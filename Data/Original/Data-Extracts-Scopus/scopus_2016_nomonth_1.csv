Moreover, such spatially continuous data, based on weather observations, are commonly used in, e.g., downscaling and bias correcting of climate model simulations. Here we conducted a comprehensive spatial interpolation scheme where seven climate variables (daily mean, maximum, and minimum surface air temperatures, daily precipitation sum, relative humidity, sea level air pressure, and snow depth) were interpolated over Finland at the spatial resolution of 10 × 10km2. More precisely, (1) we produced daily gridded time series (FMI_ClimGrid) of the variables covering the period of 1961–2010, with a special focus on evaluation and permutation-based uncertainty estimates, and (2) we investigated temporal trends in the climate variables based on the gridded data. National climate station observations were supplemented by records from the surrounding countries, and kriging interpolation was applied to account for topography and water bodies. For daily precipitation sum and snow depth, a two-stage interpolation with a binary classifier was deployed for an accurate delineation of areas with no precipitation or snow. A robust cross-validation indicated a good agreement between the observed and interpolated values especially for the temperature variables and air pressure, although the effect of seasons was evident. Permutation-based analysis suggested increased uncertainty toward northern areas, thus identifying regions with suboptimal station density. Finally, several variables had a statistically significant trend indicating a clear but locally varying signal of climate change during the last five decades. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

This waste wood currently lacks a useful purpose, and its indiscriminate burning generates CO emissions. This paper presents the results of formulated composite solid fuels at reduced gaseous emission with the use of clay (kaolinite) solution. The formulations were made using clay (kaolinite) solution (1:2 of clay: water) and sawdust. The pure sample and a total of three formulations were used. The formulations were in the ratios of 2:1 sawdust: clay solution, 1.5:1 sawdust: clay solution and 1:1 sawdust: clay solution respectively. 200μm sieve, 500ml beaker and pdt-crowcon gasman single trace gas (CO) analyzers were all used in the solution formulation and emission analysis. The results show that clay incorporated in sawdust for indoor heating has considerable advantages over pure sawdust. The environment has been enhanced through the development of less harmful and environmentally tolerable fossil fuel types. The negative impact of the use of pure biomass energy on the daily lives of populations (especially women and children) in the poorest parts of the developing world cannot be underestimated. The sawdust- based composite fuels which were produced from a mixture of the solid fuels and clay solution yield its minimum emission for a formulation of 1:1 of saw dust: clay solution (1:2 of clay: water) by mass fraction.","Beaker; Clay; Coal; Composite solid fuels; Emission measurement; Formulation; Kaolinite; Pdt-crowcon gasman single trace gas (CO) analyzer; Sieve and sawdust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976466132

Wind energy is considered one of the important renewable energy resources that provide a clean and low cost power. The growth of the wind power capacity is very fast all over the world. As outlined in Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC's), wind power is on track to supply 10-12% of global electricity demand by 2020, reducing CO2 emissions by 1.5 billion tons per year. The Supreme Energy Council in Egypt adopted a resolution on an ambitious plan aiming at increasing the contribution of renewable energy to reach 20% of total energy generated in 2020. Within this framework a total of 7,200 MW of wind power generation capacities are foreseen. The complexity of the interconnection of wind farms to the power grid stems from the fact that wind energy is rather unstable and available only during certain hours of the day. By its nature the wind power generation may drop suddenly. A rather unique feature of wind power in Egypt is that most of the high speed wind resources are concentrated at Gulf of Suez (280km from the load center) and at Eastern and Western bank of Nile River areas. This raises an additional operational constrain since large concentrated wind power is connected at certain nodes of the network and not geographically distributed over the country. Until recently, wind generators have been designed to trip offline in response to instantaneous voltage drops in order to protect the wind turbine equipment until the grid recovers. In tightly interconnected grids with significant penetration of wind generation, however, this response can lead to cascading failure of the entire system. Requirements have put forward that the generating plants contribute to the stability of the network by remaining connected during external disturbances. Which means that they require, for example, fault ride-through (FRT) capabilities for wind turbines. Although the FRT enable the overall system to restore its stability without losing large amounts of power generations after fault clearing, these control strategies may influence the related protective elements. Relay miss-coordination or miss-operation may occur due to the resulting changes of fault current profile. This “fault ride through” capability is achieved by coordinating (delaying) the relays with the network protection. Furthermore, the backup relays used to detect faults external to the line must be delayed accordingly permitting the generators to remain connected during voltage dips. This paper will focus on studying the impact of interconnection of large wind turbines on protection system with special care on modeling that emulate Egypt Case in some areas where wind penetration is high and at the same time no conventional generation in that area, and more, the farms connected with long transmission line to the Grid. Detailed aggregated modeling for wind farms having different generators technologies has been done together with studying different types of faults, with different time steps. Also successful and non-successful reclosure impact has been examined. The Crowbar action and its impact on the short circuit current has been studies. Coordination between wind farms and transmission protection schemes according to Egyptian grid code has been studied in details together with the co-influence of fault ride through capability on protective relay using proper software to achieve the objective of the thesis. Recommendations on the coordination between FRT and the under voltage protection has been presented together with illustration on the impact of Crowbar setting on different Transmission Protection Systems. © 2016 CIGRE.

To date, use of solar energy as an auxiliary source of on-board fuel has not been extensively investigated. This paper is the first study at undertaking a comprehensive analysis of using solar energy on-board by means of photovoltaic (PV) technologies to enhance automotive fuel economies, extend driving ranges, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and ensure better economic value of internal combustion engine (ICE) -based vehicles to meet CAFE standards though 2025. This paper details and compares various aspects of hybrid solar electric vehicles with conventional ICE vehicles. Different driving locations, vehicle sizes, various driving patterns and different cost scenarios are used in order to enhance the current understanding of the applicability and effectiveness of using on-board PV modules in individual automobiles and ensure an accurate representation of driving conditions in all U.S states at any time. These times and location-dependent results obtained over a year show an increase in the combined mile per gallon (MPG) at noon in the range of 2.9-9.5% for a vehicle similar to a Tesla S, and a significant increase in the range of 10.7-42.2% for lightweight and aerodynamic efficient vehicles. In addition, by adding on-board PVs to cover less than 50% of the projected horizontal surface area of a typical mid-size vehicle (e.g., Toyota Camry or Nissan Leaf), up to 50% of total daily miles traveled by an average U.S. person could be driven by solar energy. Also, the return on investment (ROI) of adding PVs on-board with ICE vehicle over its lifetime shows only negative values when the price of gasoline remains below $4.0 per gallon and the vehicle is driven in low-solar energy area (e.g., Boston, MA). The same ROI is more than 250% if the vehicle is driven in high-solar energy area (e.g., Arizona), even if the gasoline price remains low. For future price scenarios, this ROI is much higher - nearly 10 times the investment cost under some scenarios, with the assumption of an eventual decline in battery costs. With regard to environmental impacts, significant gasoline gallons savings (∼500-3400) and CO2 emission reduction (∼5.0 to 34.0 short tons) are achieved.

Because of the limitations of hand held gas detection devices, and the sheer size and complexity of these facilities, smaller leaks may go undetected and unintended releases may occur when plant personnel are not present or the area monitored. Reducing the total fugitive emissions from a large plant or a regional industry footprint could have an appreciable positive impact on the environment. Further, early detection of hydrocarbon leaks using a continuous monitoring system can reduce the risk of conditions that may lead to safety incidents that can result from unintended ignition of gas plumes. ExxonMobil Research Qatar and Providence Photonics have partnered since 2009 to develop the IntelliRed"" Remote Gas Detection system that integrates computer vision algorithms and infrared (IR) technology to autonomously scan for and identify small leaks. Efficient identification of these emission sources can lead to better control and maintenance activities. A single sensor version of the technology utilizes a custom build component based IR camera and integrated cooler assembly, and a computer vision algorithm that analyses the video output from the IR imagers to determine the presence of hydrocarbon plumes. Most hydrocarbon plumes have strong absorption peaks in the narrow mid-wave IR region. The algorithm takes advantage of the difference in contrast between a hydrocarbon plume and the background in each pixel of an IR image and the temporal changes due to plume behavior for the analysis. The algorithm compares sequentially collected IR images and uses a multi-stage confirmation process to confirm the detection and has built-in filters that eliminate interferences like steam, and moving objects. Field tests indicate a 4 lb/hr propane leak could be autonomously detected from a distance of up to 800 feet. Also, rigorous field tests comparing the technology to point and path detectors showed successful detection of leaks, 300 feet away, that barely elicited a response from a point and path detector array only 5 feet away. A dual sensor version of the technology utilizes two cooled mid-wavelength IR (MWIR) sensors with a common optical path resulting in a differential infrared (DIR) camera. The infrared energy from the scene is split between two sensors and the spectral band pass filtering for the two sensors is chosen so that one sensor can see the hydrocarbon plume while the second sensor cannot. The two sensors are synchronized spatially and temporally to ensure that successive frames are aligned correctly. Image subtraction techniques are used to produce a differential image that eliminates the background, thus filtering out interferences such as dust and steam and allowing for leak detection while the system is in motion without the need for image stabilization. The IntelliRed™ technology was commercialized in 2014 and has since been deployed at 6 process facilities worldwide. Current research focus is to add quantification capability for use in upstream and downstream LDAR applications through an ongoing research partnership with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering. © 2016 IChemE.",,"Algorithms; Cameras; Chemical detection; Computer vision; Gas detectors; Gas emissions; Hazards; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Infrared imaging; Infrared radiation; Leakage (fluid); Monitoring; Autonomous detection; Computer vision algorithms; Continuous monitoring systems; Hydrocarbon release; Image stabilization; Impact on the environment; Maintenance activity; Strong absorptions; Image processing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979642788

The direct discharge of slaughterhouse wastewater causes serious environmental pollution due to its high chemical oxygen demand (COD), Total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The conventional ways for slaughterhouse wastewater treatment have both economic and environmental disadvantages. In this study, ultrasonic assisted- membrane anaerobic system (UMAS) was used as an alternative, cost effective method for treating slaughterhouse wastewater. Six steady states were conducted as a part of a kinetic study that considered concentration ranges of 7,800 to 13,620 mg/l for mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and 5,359 to 11,424 mg/l for mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS). Kinetic equations from Monod, Contois and Chen &amp; Hashimoto were employed to describe the kinetics of slaughterhouse treatment at organic loading rates ranging from 3 to 11 kg COD/m3/d. The removal efficiency of COD during the experiment was from 94.8 to 96.5% with hydraulic retention time, HRT from 308.6 to 8.7 days. The growth yield coefficient, Y was found to be 0.52gVSS/g COD the specific microorganism decay rate was 0.21 d-1 and the methane gas yield production rate was between 0.24 l/g COD/d and 0.56 l/g COD/d. Steady state influent COD concentrations increased from 16,560 mg/l in the first steady state to 40,350 mg/l in the sixth steady state. The minimum solids retention time, θmin c which was obtained from the three kinetic models ranged from 6 to 14.4 days. The k values were in the range of 0.35 - 0.519 g COD / g VSS. d and μmax values were between 0.26 and 0.379 d-1. The solids retention time (SRT) decreased from 600 days to 14.3 days.

Albeit the economic benefits in terms of waste material sourcing and job creation, these scrap-iron recycling factories have attracted significant public criticism due to the characteristic uncontrolled pollution (toxic gases) plume released from their operations into the atmospheric environment of host communities and thus aggravating existing and unresolved rural and urban air pollution problems in Nigeria. This study therefore provides model-based estimates of atmospheric dispersion for gaseous pollutants (SO2 and NOx) released from a scrap-iron recycling factory located in Ile-Ife, southwest Nigeria as a case study for investigating emission signature from such sources.

Therefore, vehicle manufacturers are shifting their research to develop vehicle engines that use alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG). However, the purpose of the present study is to measure the performance and emission characteristics of a vehicle over a wide range of its operation conditions. All the tests have been done on a passenger vehicle chassis dynamometer under transient state conditions for both gasoline and CNG fuels, where a detailed comparison has been made between their results. A bi-fuel vehicle that has been retrofitted for both fuels together with a locally produced three-way catalytic converter (TWC) that was fitted on the exhaust manifold to reduce its emissions. A multi-point injection (MPI) system is used. The results indicate that the reason behind the increase of total hydrocarbon (THC) in CNG operated vehicle over that produced in gasoline operated vehicle is due to the difficulty in oxidizing the unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust gases, where the oxidization of hydrocarbons is one of the functions of the TWC. The exhaust hydrocarbons of a gas operated vehicle have a significantly different composition to those of a gasoline operated vehicle. Furthermore, a small deviation in the air index (λ) can be observed in all the testing times. This indicates that the use of catalyser with gasoline or CNG produces nearly sameλ.","Air index; Alternative fuel; Catalytic converter; Chassis dynamometer; Performance; Spark ignition engine","Automobile manufacture; Catalytic converters; Chassis; Compressed natural gas; Crude oil; Dynamometers; Engines; Exhaust gases; Fuels; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Internal combustion engines; Natural gas vehicles; Petroleum deposits; Vehicle performance; Vehicles; Air indexes; Chassis dynamometers; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Performance; Performance and emissions; Three way catalytic converter; Unburned hydrocarbons; Vehicle manufacturers; Alternative fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011629214

In the recent years, with the intensity and frequency of disaster occurrences in Malaysia, the impact of disaster could destruct construction organisational business, assets and properties. For instance, flood occurrence in 2011, has affected the double track construction project in Malaysia resulting time overrun for a period of 18 months and financial loss of ringgit Malaysia 150 million to private construction organisations. Based on the 11th Malaysian Plan (Strategy Paper 11: Climate Resilient Development), construction organisations are recommended to identify the disaster impacts to prepare for disaster occurrences. Hence, the objective are: to investigate vulnerable factors of disaster (pre-event) and to distinguish the key areas of disaster impacts (post-event) for private construction organisations in Malaysia. The initial research starts with literature review from various scholars on key areas of disaster impact and disaster impact model. The next stage is conducting preliminary data survey among seven private construction organisations involved in disasters. The findings revealed that in Malaysia, social and environmental vulnerabilities are prominent elements in the pre-event phase of disaster impact. Subsequently, the Malaysian private construction organisations selected four (4) key areas of disaster impact to be the utmost critical at the post-event phase. These are people: reputation; information and communication; and finance. The outcomes of the research would provide valuable insight to the private construction organisations in Malaysia in reducing impacts to any kind of disaster and to sustain the business efficacy in the long run. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

Initially, the climatic data such as relative humidity, temperature and horizontal solar radiation over 30 cities in Sudan were collected from NASA web page, then the behavior of all climatic data was analyzed. Annual daily solar radiation on a tilted surface was also calculated over the 30 locations around the country. It was found that the maximum value of tilted average solar radiation is 6.61 KWh/day at Dungola from fixed mode and 8.93 kWh/m2/day from tracking mode. Consequently, the location was selected as an optimum spot for building the solar PV power plant. Additionally, the available solar PV panels on the market were judged according to the maximum module efficiency and high ratio value of module capacity to frame area. The project lifetime is considered as 25 years. RETScreen v.4 software was used to simulate the feasibility analysis of the project based on electric power generated from fixed and tracking modes of operation, financial analysis and greenhouse gas emissions. The study showed that, technically, the proposed plant can generate up to 16.209 GWh of electric energy annually from the fixed system and 21.828 GWh from the tracking system. Environmentally, the annual net GHG reduction is 16,000 and 21,600 tons of CO2 from fixed and tracking systems respectively. From a financial standpoint, the cost-effective indicators were calculated and it was found that the IRR and payback period for the fixed system plant were 0.6% and 23.6 years, respectively. While for tracking system plant, figures were 2.66% and 19.4 years, respectively.

Findings: This study found that there is a low response to extreme events. Hopefully, the growing national awareness and activity in relation to climate change and disaster will improve response and be downscaled into these communities in the future. Although, some learning has occurred at the national government level and by agricultural producers who are adapting practices, to date no government institution has facilitated social learning taking into account conflict, power and tactics of domination. Originality/value: This paper improves the understanding of the vulnerability of rural agricultural communities to shifts in climate variability.

Numerous risk assessments and modelling studies providing evidence that the transmission range of malaria will expand with rising temperatures resulting in adverse impacts on vulnerable communities. This risk is significant in East Africa whereby current research shows an expansion of malaria into the highland areas due to changes in temperature and rainfall. While there exist multiple lines of evidence for the influence of climate change on malaria and the risk posed to vulnerable communities, there is insufficient understanding of the complexity of factors influencing the spread of the disease at the community level. This paper considers assessment of risk of malaria infection due to climate change, from systems perspective. Drawing upon published literature, we apply systems approach to propose a detailed conceptual model that illustrates causal relationships between the multiple drivers of malaria transmission in line with the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommendations for risk and vulnerability assessments. We suggest that this framework can be applied at a community level using both quantitative and qualitative methods with stakeholder engagement and in conjunction with Bayesian Belief Network to models to: explore how policy and management interventions can reduce the risk of malaria infection and; provide targeted adaptation strategies that incorporates both the scientific and the community perspectives. © 2016 Environmental Modelling and Software for Supporting a Sustainable Future, Proceedings - 8th International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software, iEMSs 2016.

Solar energy, which is adequately available in most part of Africa and regarded as a clean and renewable source of energy, makes it possible to generate electricity by using photovoltaics technology. However, before time and financial resources are invested into rooftop solar photovoltaic systems in urban areas, it is important to evaluate the potential of the building rooftop, intended to be used in harvesting the solar energy. This paper presents methodologies making use of LiDAR data and other ancillary data, such as high-resolution aerial imagery, to automatically extract building rooftops in City of Cape Town and evaluate their potentials for solar photovoltaics systems. Two main processes were involved: (1) automatic extraction of building roofs using the integration of LiDAR data and aerial imagery in order to derive its' outline and areal coverage; and (2) estimating the global solar radiation incidence on each roof surface using an elevation model derived from the LiDAR data, in order to evaluate its solar photovoltaic potential. This resulted in a geodatabase, which can be queried to retrieve salient information about the viability of a particular building roof for solar photovoltaic installation.","Aerial imagery; LiDAR data; Roof extraction; Solar photovoltaics","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Electric load shedding; Electric power transmission networks; Extraction; Global warming; Incident solar radiation; Optical radar; Photovoltaic cells; Remote sensing; Roofs; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Aerial imagery; Carbon dioxide emissions; Electricity consumers; Global solar radiation; High resolution aerial imagery; LIDAR data; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar photovoltaics; Aerial photography",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979530404

While the Agreement offers a moral foundation for future action and a novel collaborative framework for global environmental governance, a significant gap remains between existing country commitments and the aspirational 2-degree pathway. Companies, cities, regions, and other non-state actors are stepping forward to reduce their own emissions and bridge the global gap. The Science Based Targets initiative is a collaboration between the World Resources Institute (WRI), CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the United Nations Global Compact to help companies develop emission reduction targets consistent with a global 2-degree pathway. At the company level, the primary levers for achieving these reductions are efficiency improvements and decarbonization via fuel switching. As of June 2016, more than 160 companies have demonstrated the business case for mitigation investment by publicly committing to develop science-based targets that align their companies with a global 2-degree pathway. Based on sector analyses and company targets, this paper describes cumulative emissions budgets, pathways, and mitigation practices for transitioning energy-intensive industry to a 2-degree pathway. The paper also discusses the role of sciencebased targets and other voluntary initiatives, sector programs, and policies in moving industry toward a 2-degree pathway. Whether emissions are reduced to a level that holds warming to 1.5 degrees or soars beyond 6 degrees, the industrial sector will play a central role in bringing about and responding to climate impacts. © 2018 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Despite the positive effects of congestion pricing, its implementation has faced problems. This paper investigates the issue of environmental equity in cordon pricing and a park-and-ride scheme. Although pollution decreases inside the cordon by implementation of cordon pricing, air pollutants emission may increase in some links and in the whole network. Therefore, an increase in air emissions in the network means more emission outside the cordon. In fact, due to the implementation of this policy, air pollutants emission may transfer from inside to outside the cordon, creating a type of environmental inequity. To reduce this inequity, a bi-level optimization model with an equity constraint is developed. The proposed solution algorithm based on the second version of the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) is applied to the city network in Tehran. The results revealed that it seems reasonable to consider environmental equity as an objective function in cordon pricing. In addition, we can create a sustainable situation for the transportation system by improving environmental inequity with a relatively low reduction in social welfare. Moreover, there are environmental inequity impacts in real networks, which should be considered in the cordon pricing scheme. © 2016 by the authors.","Cordon pricing; Environmental equity; Multi-modal network; Multi-objective bi-level optimization; Park-and-ride; SPEA2","algorithm; atmospheric pollution; environmental quality; equity; optimization; pricing policy; traffic congestion; transportation system; Iran; Tehran [Iran]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960327858

To gain insight into natural variation in trehalose metabolism, 14-day-old seedlings from eight Arabidopsis thaliana accessions were raised on MS medium supplemented with or without 100 mM trehalose and then compared for some physiological and biochemical parameters related to carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolism. Growth arrest occurred in Columbia (Col-0) and all other accessions, but seedlings from the Cape Verde islands (Cvi) accession were relatively resistant to trehalose. Trehalose feeding induced massive anthocyanin, soluble sugar and starch accumulation in Col-0 rather than Cvi cotyledons and the accumulated starch was localized in cotyledons. Trehalose feeding furthermore led to increase activity and transcript levels of trehalase in Col-0 plants while these remained unaltered in Cvi ones, indicating trehalose insensitivity of Cvi plants is not due to greater trehalase activity. Trehalose in addition, suppressed the expression of sucrose transporter (SUC), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and invertase (INV) genes in Col-0 seedlings whereas it increased the expression of SPS and INV genes in Cvi seedlings. The trehalose-induced growth arrest of Col-0 seedlings was further accompanied with decreased ascorbate/dehydroascorbate ratio, declined chlorophyll, increased hydrogen peroxide content and enhanced catalase and peroxidase activities. The activity of super oxide dismutase (SOD) and its transcript level were also greater in Cvi seedlings compared to Col-0 ones when supplied with trehalose. It was concluded that trehalose insensitivity of Cvi plants is due to their efficient antioxidant metabolism which by maintaining a greater levels of reduced ascorbate and enhanced SOD activity counteracts the trehalose-induced reactive oxygen species generation. This capacity might be attributed to unaltered and/or optimized carbon metabolism of source-sink tissues in Cvi plants.","Accession; Arabidopsis thaliana; Oxidative metabolism; Sucrose phosphate synthase; Superoxide dismutase; Trehalose insensitivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958179941

In West Africa, as elsewhere in other parts of the world, preserving terrestrial ecosystems has proven essential to any emissions mitigation policy for greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide. A meaningful assessment of the contribution of a given region to the global carbon cycle implies the need to think in terms of balance, taking into account the totality of the carbon export and import within the ecosystems. Literature. This review, based on the results of a small number of published and unpublished studies focusing on West African ecosystems, has as its main objective the assessment of the importance of carbon exchange. Carbon fluxes appear to be spatially highly variable in the West African region, mainly due to the variability of the types of vegetation, approaches to ecosystem management, and edaphic and climatic conditions. The mean annual precipitation appears to be the main factor controlling plant respiration and photosynthesis in this region. Annual cumulated NEE has been positively correlated with the rate of photosynthesis, and has been shown to account for 71% of its spatial variability at the annual scale. This paper also confirms the presence of carbon sink behavior for considered ecosystems in the West Africa with an annual average carbon sequestration of -2.0 ± 1.5 t C.ha-1 and highlights the need to improve understanding of factors or mechanisms controlling the carbon exchange between the ecosystems and the atmosphere. Conclusions. Based on these results, which were collected on a very limited number of sites, it appears necessary to continue with the measurement of carbon fluxes in the long term at the ecosystem scale in order to better appreciate the temporal and spatial variabilities, especially on a seasonal and inter-annual basis. This paper highlights the need to extend eddy covariance measurements to other vegetation types in this region in order to facilitate studies comparing the different ecosystems. This could be used as a basis for the recommendation of more sustainable management strategies favoring carbon sequestration while limiting emission levels. © 2016, FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

Rehabilitation of extremely degraded areas through re-vegetation by fast growing species is expected to speedily recover their dynamic of organic-carbon stocks. The purposes of the study were to compare carbon stock in the aboveground biomass, understorey, litters, and soil organic under land use changes areas of open coal mining areas. The study was conducted in the coal mine concession area of PT. Berau Coal, at Site Binungan in Berau, East Kalimantan, Indonesia from September 2013 to October 2014. Data were collected from 10 plots representing ecosystem dynamics of coal mining land, consisting of: secondary forest, degraded forest; non-active mining pits; backfilling post-mining; re-vegetation forest by 2 years-old Johar (Senna siamea) stand; 1, 3 and 7 years-old Sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria); mixed forest 7 years-old Sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria) and 3 years-old meranti (Shorea sp.), and mixed forest of 9 years-old mangium (Acacia mangium) and 2.6 years-old Shorea sp. Allometric method was used to calculate the aboveground biomass and their carbon stocks. Destructive method was used to obtain the biomass of understorey, litters, and soil organic carbon. The re-vegetation programs with fast growing species after 9 year rehabilitation at post-open-mining land in tropical areas were able to restore aboveground biomass at two-thirds of previous secondary forest ecosystem. Understorey biomass in the 1-9 years-old of fast growing species were ranges at 0.19-0.95 Mg C.ha-1. Carbon stocks in the litter of 7-years-old sengon re-vegetation area were higher than that of natural forest, because of their supply from litterfall and understorey. Soil organic carbon in re-vegetation areas of 9-years-old Acacia mangium stand was 23.2 Mg.ha-1, almost equal to the value at the former secondary forest (28.5 Mg.ha-1), whereas its value during land clearing just only 4.3 Mg.ha-1. Environmental restoration in open coal mining areas through re-vegetation by fast growing plantation will restore their biomass and carbon stocks, nearly similar to their former secondary forest conditions. © 2016 The Authors.","carbon stocks; ecosystem changes; land rehabilitation; open mining; tropical region","Biomass; Coal; Coal mines; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Land use; Organic carbon; Restoration; Soils; Tropical engineering; Tropics; Vegetation; Vehicles; Carbon stocks; Ecosystem changes; Land rehabilitation; Open mining; Tropical regions; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993240552

It is seldom thought to be applicable to low-cost housing for the low-income populace. As such Green affordable housing for the low income communities in the developing countries till to-date remains a far-fetched dream. The reason is very simple as most high performance green building materials and techniques are too expensive and beyond the reach of the low income communities in the developing countries. In the developing country settings where a vast majority of them lack even the basic services, the green building approach to tackling the climate change is simply an uphill task and unaffordable also. There is therefore an urgent need for a meaningful research into the area of low-cost green building innovative materials and techniques so as to make it available and affordable to the vast majority of the low income populace throughout the world. This research paper focuses on the subject of application of low-cost innovative green building materials and technique for improving lives of the inhabitants in low income housing. This research paper presents alternative & innovative yet low-cost building materials & techniques that have been identified and whose applications in low income housing can help provide a reasonable level of comfort inside during all seasons. Such materials and techniques are easy to apply and are affordable also.

With the increase in wide-body aircraft in the 1990s, rutting of the airside pavements at BOS became a problem. From 1995 to 2003, attempts were made to address the rutting problem by ""stiffening"" the asphalt mixes. This led to moisture-sensitive mixes, and in the early 2000s, stripping of the asphalt became an issue. Several WMA projects were completed at BOS between 2006 and 2015. Initially, non-WMA control sections were used in critical locations to provide a baseline for evaluating the rutting performance of WMA sections. The first WMA project, in 2006, was the placement of a WMA binder course on the Terminal C alleyway. In 2007, a 150-mm-Thick (6-inch-Thick (alternating 2-75 mm (2-3 inch) and 1-150 mm (1-6 inch lift)) WMA test strip was included as part of a mill and overlay research project on Taxiway A. In 2008, 24,000 tonnes (26,000 tons) of WMA was used as a part of the rehabilitation of Runway 22L. This project consisted of a 200-mm (8-inch) inlay on the outboard sections of the runway. In 2009, a larger project-50,000 tonnes (55,000 tons)-was constructed for rehabilitation of Runway 9-27, which consisted of a WMA overlay 75 to 175 mm (3 to 7 inches) thick. The ease of WMA compaction was demonstrated along with reduced emissions and energy savings. Also in 2009, WMA was used in the extension of Taxiway Delta at Logan, 36,000 tonnes (40,000 tons). Additionally, new Taxiway G had 250 mm (10 inches) of WMA placed on newly constructed portions of the taxiways, and existing Taxiway C received a 75-mm (3-inch) inlay of WMA. All of the projects at BOS used Sasobit technology and also incorporated from 15 to 20 percent reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). The WMA was placed and compacted in maximum 100-mm (4-inch) lifts, whereas 75-mm (3-inch) lifts are typical. A PG 64-28 virgin binder with 4 percent latex modifier and 1.5 percent Sasobit by weight of binder was used for all projects. An anti-stripping additive consisting of 1 percent lime was added to the mixture to alleviate prior issues with moisture sensitivity. This paper describes the process used to evaluate the potential of WMA for airside pavements, along with the lessons learned from asphalt production and placement. The results of condition monitoring from a variety of production sections are presented along with recommendations for the successful use of WMA. © ASCE.",,"Airports; Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Binders; Bins; Condition monitoring; Energy conservation; Fighter aircraft; Moisture; Anti-stripping additives; Asphalt production; International airport; Moisture sensitivity; Reclaimed asphalt pavements; Rutting performance; Warm mix asphalt (WMA); Wide body aircrafts; Asphalt concrete",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988434137

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, performances of some AD plants presently operating successfully in India have been studied in the field (Section 3.1). Primary data collected from this study has been used to evaluate the biogas generation potential of OFMSW in Indian condition (Section 4). To ensure the validity, this gas generation potential has been compared with the gas yield data observed by the other researchers and with the gas yields of AD plants of some technology providers at some parts of the world (Section 4.1). From the future population projection (year 2030) and the future per capita waste generation rate obtained from the literature survey, estimation has been made for future quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) (year 2030) (Section 2.3). Based on these data, the green energy generation potential from the bio-degradable portion of MSW through AD route, in India, has been evaluated (Section 4.2), and its economic and environmental benefits have been analyzed (Section 5). Findings: This secondary research work reveals that from the bio-degradable portion of MSW, India can generate about 583 MW of green energy daily and produce about 5.1 mil MT of bio fertilizer per annum presently, and these may go up to 2,273 MW and 19.5 mil MT, respectively, in the year 2030. Generation of green energy from OFMSW, in India, may save coal consumption of about 3.04 mil MT and reduce 35.42 mil MT of CO2 emissions per annum presently. Moreover, utilization of the bio-degradable portion of the MSW stream may save about 550 acres (2.23 sq. km) of landfill area per year presently and in total may save about 8,182 hectare (82.5 sq. km) of landfill area during the period of 15 years time. Research limitations/implications: The population growth and future per capita waste generation rate are based on census report of Govt of India and survey report of World Bank, respectively. Separate collection of bio-degradable portion of MSW has not yet been developed properly in India. Practical implications: This study reveals that in India, the high-moisture-content, low-calorific-value bio-degradable waste in India can be used for the generation of substantial amount of green energy in India, which in addition to financial gains would reduce the waste quantity at landfill site, conserve natural resources, save land, reduce green house gas emission, generate employment and help to protect environment. Considering these benefits and advantages, evaluated in this study, policy makers and city managers may review their approaches toward solid waste management system of their cities to meet the challenges of huge increase of MSW in the years to come in India. More research works may be initiated to improve the AD system of organic waste, and more capital may be employed in waste management business in India. Originality/value: Numbers of research works have been carried out by other researchers for estimation of energy generation potential through AD of OFMSW for different countries; but no such work could be found to identify such potential and its benefits in India. This research work demonstrates how MSW can be used as a wealth for green energy production in India. The originality of this paper is the analysis of green energy generation potential from the low calorific value MSW in India. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Energy transformation; Resource management; Scenario analysis; Solid wastes; Surveys; Waste-based","Anaerobic digestion; Calorific value; Carbon dioxide; Conservation; Fertilizers; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Population statistics; Solid wastes; Surveying; Surveys; Waste management; Design/methodology/approach; Economic and environmental benefits; Energy transformation; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Resource management; Scenario analysis; Solid waste management systems; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015291363

The e2democracy (e2d) project studied seven participation exercises with largely identical objectives and organization (a combination of long-term individual CO2e footprint monitoring by the panelists, issue-specific information and events, and other opportunities for exchange over up to 2 years) in Austria, Germany, and Spain. In all panels, pro-climate awareness, attitude and behavior changes associated with the participation processes were observed, although to different degrees. In all but one region, the results showed a relatively strong positive link between attitude and behavior change. Attitudinal changes were greater than behavioral changes, which can partly be explained by the difficulties of changing social practices (e.g., nutritional habits) and local context conditions (e.g., transport options). An investigation of the causal mechanisms and mediating factors revealed moderate “gentle nudge” type effects from CO2e footprint monitoring among panelists in all three countries. While a direct effect of community feeling on behavior change was not confirmed, a number of community-related factors, such as social learning and the removal of personal barriers through community support were positively related to behavior change. One conclusion is that attempts to change individual behavior towards pro-climate lifestyles through individual information feedback are more effective when they are embedded in a participatory community context. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Attitude change; Behavior change; Behavioral change; Climate protection; Panel survey",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060124794

A panel of Nigerian state-level crop yields was paired with a fine-scale weather data set that included distribution of temperature and precipitation between the minimum and maximum across all days of the growing season for selected crops. Weather data were examined from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2012. The analysis was started with the traditional approach of estimating climate change impact by a quadratic regression model of weather and Growing Degree Days (GDD) on crop yields using panel data estimation. Later, Harmful Degree Days (HDD) and Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) were step-wisely included. Interactions of rainfall, GDD and VPD were also explored. In the production approach, crop yield was specified as a function of weather inputs (temperature and precipitation). The results showed that the time when the lowest and highest yields were obtained differed by crops. The highest (43.50 kg/ha) and lowest (1.085kg/ha) yields for cassava were observed in 1999 and 2001, respectively, while both highest and lowest yields for sorghum were recorded in 2012. Daily maximum temperature between 30 and 35 °C occurred more than a 1000 times over all the days covered in this study (January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2012). The regression results showed that high damage to cassava, cotton and maize was evident by the strong and negative coefficient of Harmful Degree Days (HDD). For sorghum and rice, an exposure to heat range showed a negative influence on the yield. In order to address the negative weather effects and other problems associated with the National Agricultural Insurance Corporation (NAIC) such as little access by farmers, high information asymmetric and transaction costs, crop insurance based on indices from Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) could be adopted to compensate part of the damage caused to the farm products.","Agricultural insurance; Econometrics; Extreme weather; Nigeria; Staple crop; Yield risk",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019895724

The ERS demonstrated has twice the energy efficiency of conventional diesel HDVs and enables the use of renewable energy. The technological development was made possible by combining expertise from rail electrification, electric drives and a newly developed active current collector for dynamically connecting to the OCL and receiving a continuous supply of electricity to power the vehicle's engine and to store energy on-board. The research project demonstrated that a hybrid truck can run in pure electric mode without any change in the operations for the driver and without concessions on truck performance. The ERS infrastructure was successfully integrated into a highway environment. The result was the first fully operable prototype on a test track with dedicated infrastructure. Since mid-2011 it has been undergoing testing and demonstration. During trials, the OCL-hybrid prototypes demonstrated full performance and suitability for everyday use - regardless of the environmental and load conditions. In addition to providing highly promising results in terms of technology, the tests also demonstrated benefits to the environment and economy. The ERS can be integrated with existing infrastructure, thus making it much easier and cheaper to implement and maintain. Lower energy consumption yields lower operating costs and the resulting savings can finance the infrastructure investment, especially on heavily trafficked routes, such as port-to-rail connections near metropolitan areas. These aspects will be further demonstrated on public roads, with operations commencing in the first half of 2016. This paper presents the latest available results and points the way to a heavy-duty road freight system with full electric power and full flexibility.","Dynamic charging; Heavy-duty; HEV (hybrid electric vehicle); Infrastructure; Truck","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Electric current collection; Electric drives; Electric lines; Electric power systems; Electric railroads; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Investments; Operating costs; Roads and streets; Transportation; Trucks; Vehicles; Heavy duty; HEV(hybrid electric vehicle); Infrastructure; Infrastructure investment; Lower operating costs; Overhead contact lines; Technological development; Use of renewable energies; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013891475

Herein, we examine the implications of the theoretical choices used in DFT models that impact the stability of the reaction intermediates and the limiting potential (UL) of the activity/selectivity determining steps in CO2 ER across transition metals. Three theoretical choices are considered: (i) the type of exchange-correlation (XC) functional, (ii) the surface facet of the metal electrocatalyst, and (iii) the effect of solvation. The impact of the theoretical choices is also studied in the context of deriving scaling relationships for electrocatalyst screening. The analyses reveal that the choice of XC functional (PBE versus RPBE) can alter binding energies of CO2 ER intermediates by 0.30 eV, but have little impact on surface reaction energetics. Surface termination has greater impact, as OH∗-terminated adsorbates bind weaker on average by 0.26 eV on stepped facets. Including explicit local solvation stabilizes the OH∗-terminated adsorbates, preferentially decreasing the UL for CO∗ → COH∗ reduction.

How prepared are they for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies? Are there any socio-cultural barriers to combating climate change? The study therefore focused attention on their beliefs, attitude and perception about climate change. It also discussed the barriers their beliefs and attitude posed to the establishment and implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies in the rural areas.

Data collected were analysed using Atlas.ti and SPSS. Most of the women in the rural areas are aware of the impacts of climate change in their environment, especially, on their livelihoods. However, the awareness level has not impacted on them positively to adopt any mitigation and adaptation strategies. This is due to their belief system that climate change is not a consequence of anthropogenic activities.

The 10/22/2015 INDC of the UAE sets forth several measures to diversify its petroleum-based economy that will have mitigation co-benefits. The case of UAE suggests that it may be more important to decouple greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from economic growth and compare GHG emissions per GDP. This analysis will enable policymakers to evaluate whether a country is successfully transitioning to a high technology, low-carbon economy. Also, a larger GDP may yield secondary climate benefits resulting from increased investment of in research and development of sustainable energy and foreign aid to developing countries.

The permeability of these samples is highly anisotropic. He permeability of the Eagle Ford sample normal to bedding was ∼10 nanodarcies. He permeability parallel to bedding was ∼2 microdarcies. This large permeability anisotropy appears to reflect vertical flow through interconnected nanoscale pores along tortuous pathways whereas horizontal flow can also flow along microcracks and bedding planes. We found that the adsorption of Co2 molecules reduced the permeability normal to bedding by about an order of magnitude. However, the permeability reduction parallel to bedding decreased by only ∼10%. In both cases, the permeability reduction was reversible. That is, when the Co2 was desorbed, the He permeability returned to its initial value. Both pulse-decay and steady-state flow experiments were conducted at a temperature of 38.5°C ( 0.1°C), confining pressures up to 6,000 psi (41.4 MPa), and pore fluid pressures ranging from 377 to 2,000 psi (2.6 to 13.8 MPa). As the measurements with both types of gases were performed at the same mean free path to achieve the same impact of slippage flow on permeability, the observed difference in permeability anisotropy is due to the adsorption of Co2. A thorough understanding of these nanoscale transport processes in various directions is critical for defining the interactions between shale rock and Co2. Hence, the design and implementation of various Co2 applications in shale formations, such as hydraulic fracturing with Co2 and Co2 injection for enhanced oil/gas recovery, can be further optimized and their economic impact can be improved.

In the past few decades, numerous residential projects constructed in the region have led to higher energy demand for the residential sector. In addition, the growing rate of urbanization and changes in lifestyles caused a significant increase in domestic energy consumption and in Oman, during the period from 2012 to 2018, peak electricity demand is expected to grow at 8% per year compared to the global average rate of 2.5%. This rapid increase in energy consumption has highlighted the need for energy solutions to overcome its excessive consumption. Since the residential sector consumes 48% of total electricity, the main source of energy in Oman, reducing domestic energy use has the potential to reduce the country’s total energy consumption. This research aims to evaluate experimentally the key Low Carbon Building (LCB) strategies and criteria best suited to the economic, climatic and social constraints for the hot humid climate of Oman that can be implemented in their future residential sector. For the purpose of this research, the energy performance of reference exemplar state of the art low carbon buildings available in the country, will be compared to selected examples of conventional buildings located within 15 km from the reference buildings. Six key performance parameters of energy consumption in the LCB; lighting, domestic electronic appliances, air conditioning (HVAC), hot water, refrigerators and wash machine, were monitored and recorded, whereas the energy consumption for the same parameters in the conventional buildings were calculated by energy audit. Building energy consumption patterns and performance were monitored and calculated. Based on the data collected, the domestic building energy consumption and energy performance index (EPI) for residential buildings were calculated. Then the modeled energy saving and CO2 emission reductions that may be achieved by implementing LCB strategies on conventional building were evaluated using IES virtual environment software. © 2016 Amer.

To state the problem in its simplest terms, writes Joseph Aldy, future, unborn generations would enjoy the benefits of policies to reduce carbon emissions whereas the current generation would have to bear the costs. In particular, incumbent firms—politically influential fossil-fuel companies and fossil fuel–intensive industries, which are now reaping substantial returns from a status quo that fails to address climate change—might face significant losses from policies that discourage carbon emissions. On the other hand, insurgent firms—companies that are investing in low- and zerocarbon technologies—stand to gain. Aldy analyzes durable, successful public policies in US history whose costs and benefits accrued to different groups—the 1935 Social Security Act, the 1956 Interstate Highway Act, and the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments. Those policies differ from climate change policy in important ways, but they nonetheless offer lessons. For example, designing climate policy to deliver broad, near-term benefits could help overcome some of the political opposition. To do so might require linking climate change with other issues, or linking various interest groups. We might also win support from incumbent firms by finding ways to compensate them for their losses under climate change policy, or use policy to help turn insurgent firms into incumbents with political influence of their own. Finally, we might account for and exploit the veto points and opportunities embedded in our existing political institutions. © 2016, Center for the Future of Children.

Even at low concentrations, H2S is a dangerous and abhorrent gas that causes a wide range of health effects. A few key industrial sources of H2S include petroleum refining, pulp and paper manufacturing, and waste disposal. Major municipal sources include wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and solid waste collection as well as storage, transfer and disposal facilities. Hydrogen sulfide is often found in high concentrations in WWTPs. In order to stay within the limit noted above, H2S sources and source strengths should be identified and determined to reduce emissions in a cost-effective manner. A good understanding of odor levels through ambient H2S monitoring is the first step in the process of odor management. This paper focuses on the measurement of H2S levels using continuous and portable analyzers manufactured by Detcon Inc that are capable of measuring H2S in ppb levels. Efforts were made to monitor H2S at various locations at the two WWTPs in Louisiana to understand the sources within the treatment plants, document the hot spots, analyze the results, compare and contrast the variations and similarities. The monitoring was conducted in the months of June and July in 2015. Each day that the monitoring was conducted, the test period lasted for two-three hours from 6:30a.m. - 9:30a.m. Most of the results obtained were below the detection limit of the equipment (i.e. 0.01 ppm) and the maximum observed reading at Harvey WWTP was 3.17 ppm and that of Marrero WWTP was 4.79 ppm. The lessons learned from this research are documented in order to assist researchers and owners of the WWTPs in awareness of the methodology used to measure H2S levels. © 2016, Air and Waste Management Association.

These projections indicate that plug-in electric vehicles can significantly reduce transportation sector emissions even when accounting for the emissions associated with vehicle electrification. © 2016 WEVA.","Electricity; Emissions; Environment; United States of America","Electricity; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Plug-in electric vehicles; Power plants; Environment; Grid emissions; Stored electrical energies; Technical complexity; Transportation sector; United States of America; Vehicle battery; Vehicle electrifications; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013459745

This has driven ICAO to establish goals and timeframe (carbon neutral by 2020 and 50% reduction on 2005 baseline) to states and industry in order reduce aviation pollution. A solid “Four Pillar” initiative was set by the industry with the objective to address such target, considering investments on: operational procedures, infrastructure, technology and market based measures. However, according to recent studies, operational procedures and improvements on infrastructure may not be sufficient to accomplish the ICAO goals with current technological state of art. New technological developments, mainly related to new airframe and engines design and concepts, is indeed considered the most effective and promising measure with potential to lead fuel efficiency improvements up to 25% when compared with 2005 levels. According to this perspective, fuel efficiency is becoming more and more relevant on aircraft design techniques. Electrical vehicles may be a considerably, if no entirely, part of the ground transportation fleet in coming decades. A study was undertaken here to estimate the percentage of aviation in CO2 emissions and noise levels considering a steadily increasing fleet of electrical vehicles over time. The evident conclusion is that even introducing biofuels on aviation operations, the increasing demand for electrical road vehicles would lead aviation to a scaling increase its share on transportation emissions throughout the year 2050, despite of the overall emissions reduction. In other words, there is significant evidence that aviation will be more and more in focus (and also social-political pressure) throughout the years regarding the GHG emissions. This fact obviously reinforces the necessity of improvements o aircraft/engine design, alternative motorization, and other sources of energy to power aircraft systems and improvements in operational efficiencies. © 2016 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The study aims to develop a generic approach to isolate the relative effect of upstream man-made interventions from the mutual impacts of basin-wide dry climate environments and upstream human-induced pressures. The proposed method supports water managers in unbiased, timely and spatially relevant decision-making processes. The streamflow drought index and the monthly-based truncation level were utilized to characterize hydrological droughts, while the standardized precipitation index was used for meteorological drought interpretations. Findings revealed that the upstream river regulation schemes noticeably led to a decline in water availability of the downstream country.

Influence of climatic parameters on energy production and performance ratio is assessed based on the, hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly energy produced from PV crystalline silicon based and thin film technologies. The assessed technologies are the monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film of cell types of cadmium telluride (CdTe) and CdS/CdTe semiconductor. The energy assessment is based on the manufacture provided PV modules characteristics and average of 30 years hourly climatic values of the ambient air-dry temperatures, horizontal solar radiation, and average wind speed for the state of Kuwait. The main obtained results show that for the designed peak power of one MWp plant the Thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) technology has the yearly average good energy performance parameters with less leveled energy produced cost and minimum environmental harmful emission.

We applied heterogeneous panel autoregressive distributed lag techniques of mean group (MG) and pooled MG suggested by Pesaran et al. (1999), during 1984-2001. The main empirical result reveals that; the relationship between income inequality and carbon dioxide emissions is negative and statistically significant. This means that; widening income inequality could lead to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the sampled countries. Moreover, the variables of trade openness, per-capita gross domestic product (GDP), and urbanization are positive and statistically significant; this means that increase in any of these variables could lead to overall increase in the level of carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, in providing policies that will be used to improve environmental quality in Africa, income inequality should not be considered because it is reducing the level of environmental degradation through reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.

In this paper, we will discuss how for the first time in Kuwait a state-of-the-art wireline open hole tractor has been successfully used to convey an advanced wireline pressure measurement in a horizontal well. Two wells will be discussed in this paper, the first was a short radius horizontal side track in the tight carbonate formation while the second is highly deviated well across sand/shale layers. Traditionally in horizontal wells, the pressure measurement is either run on drill pipe or LWD. Moreover, the formation tightness posed another challenge, as stabilized formation pressures can be difficult to achieve. To address the challenge of formation tightness and save rig time, a fast wireline pretest measurement tool allowing dynamic control of the pretest system would be conveyed on wireline using Open Hole tractor. A job simulation was conducted, based on the friction force and tool weight, to ensure the ability of conveying the tractor to the required depth in addition to the ultimate tractor drives number with tandem1 configuration. After gaining confidence and experience from the first well tractoring across tight consolidated carbonate, it was decided to go for open hole tractoring across less consolidated sand/shale layers in a highly deviated well (maximum deviation of 85deg). Both jobs were successfully executed as per plan. The tool was conveyed smoothly across the tight carbonate reservoir to the target depth of 10,030 ft MD at an average tractoring speed of 1800 ft/hr. The job was concluded with a cumulative tractoring footage of 3200 ft and an operating time of 12.5 hours, which resulted in more than 30 hours of rig time savings compared to other alternatives. The requested pressure program was achieved. Due to the pressure tool's low rate pretest capability, in addition to the flexible volume and pretest time options; stabilized formation pressure data could be acquired2,3. The precise depth control resulting from this conveyance method enabled accurate pressure profiling. Similarly, the second job was conveyed smoothly to the target depth. The combination of the advanced pressure measurement with a state-of-the-art open hole tractor1 conveyance method has proved to be an efficient and effective alternative to LWD and drill pipe in a challenging horizontal and highly deviated environments (the first job of its kind in the region). It resulted in acquiring accurate pressure data with significant rig time saving, and proved to be a cost effective solution contributing to an overall reduction in the well cost per barrel.

Gasco requirement is to recover the flare gases of the three hydrocarbon flares instead of being continuously burnt. This should be through the installation of Flare Gas Recovery Systems (FGRS). This recovered gas should be either used as a fuel gas or injected back into the processing facilities. World Bank has introduced the initiative Zero Routine Flaring by 2030. In line with the above initiative, within Gasco there are KPIs which aim at reducing flaring and to recover the flared gases. This is achieved through the successful implementation of Flare Gas Recovery Systems (FGRS) at GASCO Plants A, B and C. Targeting Process Safety (PS), enhancement in HSE and performance monitoring, starting 2008, Gasco embarked on an ambitious Project requiring state of the art Flare gas recovery systems. This Paper details the stages involved and detailed plan, i.e. Study, FEED and EPC. Optimization methodology necessary when designing or operating a reliable Flare Gas recovery Systems on existing Gas Plants to recover hydrocarbon gases over wide range of gas compositions without affecting the existing facilities. A study was conducted on Hydrocarbon Flares of Gasco Plants A, B and C in order to predict the various continuous flow rates through the three Hydrocarbon Flare headers. It was predicted that for each of above plants the recovered gas could be in the order of ~1 to 2 MMscfd. In FEED, considering the future additional flare gases, the design capacity of the individual flare gas recovery systems fixed at 5 MMscfd per train for each of above plants. EPC Package was developed to execute project on turnkey basis. Proper FEED, EPC Detailed Design Review, HAZOP and SIL sessions produced an inherently safe Design. In 2013 the project was successfully commissioned. The FGR system was found capable of operating at flowrates up to the design flowrate across the full range of molecular weights.

Carbon storage is well recognized as an important technology for CO2 emissions reduction on industrial scales. Observations and modeling have shown that residual trapping of CO2 through capillary forces within the pore space of saline aquifers, characterized as water-wet, is one of the most significant mechanisms for storage security and is also a factor determining the ultimate extent of CO2 migration within the reservoir. In contrast, most of the major CO2 storage projects in operation and under construction are in depleting oil reservoirs utilizing CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Carbon utilization and storage has a significant energy and economic benefits and is considered as an important component in achieving the widespread commercial deployment of carbon storage technology. However, there are no observations characterizing the extent of capillary trapping of CO2 in mixed-wet carbonate systems, a characteristic of most conventional oil reservoirs in the world. In this work, residual trapping of supercritical CO2 is measured in water-wet and mixed-wet carbonate systems on the same rock sample before and after wetting alteration with crude oil. In particular, CO2 trapping was characterized before and after wetting alteration so that the impact of the wetting state of the rock is observed directly. A reservoir condition core-flooding laboratory was used to make the measurements. The setup included high precision pumps, temperature control, stir reactor, the ability to recirculate fluids for weeks at a time and an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. The wetted parts of the flow-loop were made of anti-corrosive material that can handle co-circulation of CO2 and brine at reservoir conditions.

Carbon storage is well recognized as an important technology for CO2 emissions reduction on industrial scales. Observations and modeling have shown that residual trapping of CO2 through capillary forces within the pore space of saline aquifers, characterized as water-wet, is one of the most significant mechanisms for storage security and is also a factor determining the ultimate extent of CO2 migration within the reservoir. In contrast, most of the major CO2 storage projects in operation and under construction are in depleting oil reservoirs utilizing CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Carbon utilization and storage has a significant energy and economic benefits and is considered as an important component in achieving the widespread commercial deployment of carbon storage technology. However, there are no observations characterizing the extent of capillary trapping of CO2 in mixed-wet carbonate systems, a characteristic of most conventional oil reservoirs in the world. In this work, residual trapping of supercritical CO2 is measured in water-wet and mixed-wet carbonate systems on the same rock sample before and after wetting alteration with crude oil. In particular, CO2 trapping was characterized before and after wetting alteration so that the impact of the wetting state of the rock is observed directly. A reservoir condition core-flooding laboratory was used to make the measurements. The setup included high precision pumps, temperature control, stir reactor, the ability to recirculate fluids for weeks at a time and an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. The wetted parts of the flow-loop were made of anti-corrosive material that can handle co-circulation of CO2 and brine at reservoir conditions. The measurements were made while maintaining chemical equilibrium between the fluids (CO2 and brine) and rock phases to prevent reaction with the core sample and replicate conditions far away from the injection site. A novel core-flooding approach was used, making use of the capillary end effect to create a large range in initial CO2 saturation in a single core-flood.

The development of effective strategies for natural resource monetization is important for profitable resource utilization. Environmental concerns associated with natural gas monetization include carbon dioxide emissions linked to climate change, which has caused the global community to set significant carbon dioxide emission reduction targets. This presents the oil and gas sector with the challenge to contribute to emission reduction targets, whilst maintaining profitability of operations. This work integrates the recently proposed carbon integration approach for the identification of efficient carbon dioxide reduction options in industrial parks with a natural gas allocation model that takes into account alternative monetization paths. The resulting optimization-based approach can synthesize integrated natural gas and carbon dioxide networks for industrial cities that can meet carbon dioxide emissions constraints while maximizing the profitability of natural gas monetization. The application of the method is illustrated through an example of an industrial park considering typical processes associated with natural gas monetization and carbon integration. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Gas industry; Gases; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Natural gas; Pollution control; Profitability; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon dioxide reduction; Chemical conversions; Emission reduction targets; Environmental concerns; Industrial cluster; Integration approach; Resource utilizations; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009792207

The GCC Interconnector delivers a range of potential benefits to the electric utilities of the GCC Member States. This study estimates the following categories of such benefits: Savings in the amount of installed generation capacity each Member State requires in order to maintain a given level of security of supply; and Reductions in fuel costs, generation plants’ variable operating and maintenance (VO&amp;M) costs, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to more efficient plant despatch because of: − Savings from sharing spinning reserve amongst Member States; and − Trade in energy between Member States. Estimating the benefits of the Interconnector requires that we perform simulation modelling to estimate the costs of the GCC power system: In a scenario that assumes the Interconnector is present; and A hypothetical counterfactual scenario in which the Interconnector does not exist This study estimates both potential future benefits of the Interconnector, and the benefits that it has delivered since its commissioning in 2009. Future Benefits We assume that, in the scenario with the Interconnector, that Member States will make full use of the Interconnector in the future, realising all opportunities for optimising despatch of plant across the region to trade energy and share spinning reserve to achieve an N-1 standard across the GCC power system as a whole. We also assume that Member States build no more generation capacity than is needed to achieve the security standard of 5 hours per year expected loss of load (LOLE). In the hypothetical counterfactual, we assume that each Member State operates as an isolated system, and to make up for the absence of the Interconnector, builds more generation capacity to meet the same security standard of 5 hours per year LOLE and schedules plant to provide sufficient spinning reserves to achieve the same N-1 standard as in the interconnected case, but within its own power system. Our modelling estimates that the GCC Member States can potentially accrue the following benefits over the period 2014 – 2038: A total saving from reductions in installed generation capacity of 5.23 GW, which equates to total monetary savings of $5.66 billion (or $0.43 billion per annum); Savings in fuel and VO&amp;M costs of over $27 billion (or $2.07 billion per annum); and A reduction in CO2 emissions of 225 million tonnes. Historical Benefits The main benefit that Member States have enjoyed since the introduction of the Interconnector in 2009 is the ability to import power at times of system stress, thereby helping to avoid system outages. To assess the extent to which Member States have benefited from the avoidance of outages, we examined historical data provided by the GCCIA on unscheduled imports of power by Member States during “frequency incidents”2 over the period 2009-2013. Based on analysis of the above data, we found that the Interconnector allowed Member States to avoid 7,359 MWh of load-shedding due to unscheduled outages, over the period 2009-13. Applying an assumption regarding the Value of Lost Load (VOLL) of between $3,053 and $4,001 per megawatt hour (MWh), which varies depending on the year, we estimated the value of avoided outages amounts to $28.6 million, or $6 million per annum. Since 2009, we understand that the Interconnector has not been used extensively for the trading of energy or the sharing of reserves, and that the GCC Member States have not accounted for the Interconnector in the planning of their local power systems. Hence, we have not sought to estimate these historical benefits directly in this paper. For instance, we have examined historical data on spinning reserves and found that Member States have held more spinning reserves than required to meet the GCCIA’s N-1 standard across the whole GCC power system. To help assess the extent to which Member States have missed out on the potential benefits of reserve sharing, and thus the quantum of potential future savings, we estimated the level of spinning reserves that Member States would have been required to hold over this period to comply with GCCIA’s standards, both in the interconnected case and the isolated case. We found that Member States would have saved US$ 144 million per annum if they had adopted the N-1 standard in their respective isolated systems. Member States would have saved a further $25 million per annum if they had only held the reserves necessary to meet the N-1 standard across GCC power system as a whole, taking into account the ability to share spinning reserve through use of the Interconnector. Hence, the value of $25 million per annum represents our estimate of the incremental value of the Interconnector through the potential to share reserves, taking the N-1 standard as given. This estimate could, however, be an over estimate: Even if plant were scheduled and despatched in a way that exploited all gains from trade and reserve sharing opportunities, there may be technical reasons why Member States require more spinning reserves than would be necessary to meet the N-1 standard in the GCC power system, such as local grid constraints; or In some situations, a surplus of spinning reserves may effectively be provided “for free” by cogeneration plant being required to part-load in order to meet heat demand for water desalination. If this happens to a greater extent than we have assumed in our modelling, we may have underestimated the supply of spinning reserve. Non-Quantified Benefits In addition to above quantified benefits, the Interconnector provides other benefits that we have not estimated in this study. These include economies of scale derived from building large shared generation units, better integration of renewables and nuclear generation and reductions in frequency management costs, savings in transmission costs within countries, and increased scope for the exchange of energy with neighbouring countries outside the GCC. © 2016 CIGRE.

The key to designing a passive building is by taking advantage of the local climate (micro-climate) and therefore, climate characteristics and classification can help with identifying approaches as early as site planning and analysis. Therefore, climate and comfort are the two fundamental measures in passive design that require attention. Passive design is a major part of environmental design, and approaches utilising several techniques and strategies that can be employed to the buildings in all types of climates around the world such as orientation, ventilation, shading devices, thermal mass, insulation, daylighting and so on. These techniques and strategies can also be supported by various other parameters such as using technologies (passive and/or active) and customisable controls as well as enhanced by patterns of biophilic design for improving health and well-being in the built environment. There are also passive solar technologies including direct and indirect solar gains for space heating, solar water heating systems, solar cookers, use of thermal mass and phase-change materials for slowing indoor air temperature swings, solar chimney for enhancing natural ventilation, and earth sheltering that can be considered as part of the actual design. Today, passive design strategies can be easily evaluated with the use of either simple or more sophisticated Building Performance Simulation (BPS) tools such as Ecotect, IES VE, etc. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Building envelope; Natural ventilation; Thermal comfort; Thermal mass; Wind flow",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060576408

However, the application of doped titanium dioxide supports in PEM fuel cells has been hampered by their lower electronic conductivity and often smaller surface area when compared to carbon black. Reported here is a new strategy to increase the conductivity and external surface area of mesoporous Nb-doped titanium dioxide (NbxTi(1-x)O2, x = 0.1 or 0.25) nanofibers by embedding 10-11 wt% of carbon (graphitic) via reductive calcination of the polymer coated nanofibers. A comparison between carbon-embedded and carbon-free Nb-doped titanium dioxide nanofibers reveals significantly higher electronic conductivity (0.12 vs. 5 × 10-6 S cm-1) and external surface area (86 vs. 17 m2 g-1). Finally, carbon-embedded and carbon-free nanofibers were tested as Pt catalyst support for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under acidic conditions and compared with that for a commercial carbon black support (Vulcan XC-72R). While the ORR mass activity under acidic conditions is similar for all tested supports, Pt catalysts supported by carbon-embedded nanofibers showed enhanced ORR specific activity and significantly higher durability. The lower electrochemical durability of Pt catalysts supported by carbon-free nanofibers is due to the electro-oxidation of metal oxides in lower oxidation states (e.g. NbO2 to Nb2O5 and/or Ti4O7 to TiO2) at the surface, which is in agreement with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon black; Catalysts; Durability; Electric conductivity; Electrolytic reduction; Electrooxidation; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Nanofibers; Niobium; Niobium oxide; Oxides; Platinum; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reduction; Thermogravimetric analysis; Titanium; Titanium dioxide; Titanium oxides; Transition metals; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Acidic conditions; Electronic conductivity; Embedded nanofibers; External surfaces; Nanostructured titanium; Oxidation state; Oxygen reduction reaction; Specific activity; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968835225

The MARNI 12.2 is constructed using C# language programming on the Microsoft Windows platform. The tool is applied for the vehicle emission calculation on an arterial road in Makassar City and we compare the results using IVEM software, a calculation tool based on International Vehicle Emission (IVE) Model that developed for developing countries condition. The results provide a significant confidence in the vehicle emission calculation for the heterogeneous traffic situations. However, the MARNI 12.2 still covers passenger car types only, we expect to complete the tool involving motorcycle and heavy vehicle types in the future research activities. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","Heterogeneous traffic; Indonesia; MARNI 12.2; Motorcycle; Vehicular emission quantity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969980741

In particular, achieving high activity without sacrificing stability is essential for designing commercially viable catalysts. A major challenge in designing state-of-the-art Ru-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a key step in water splitting, is the poor stability and surface tailorability of these catalysts. In this study, we designed rapidly synthesizable size-controlled, morphology-selective, and surface-tailored platinum-ruthenium core-shell (Pt@Ru) and alloy (PtRu) nanocatalysts in a scalable continuous-flow reactor. These core-shell nanoparticles with atomically precise shells were produced in a single synthetic step with carbon monoxide as the reducing agent. By varying the metal precursor concentration, a dendritic or layer-by-layer ruthenium shell can be grown. The synthesized Pt@Ru and PtRu nanoparticles exhibit noticeably higher electrocatalytic activity in the OER compared to that of pure Pt and Ru nanoparticles. Promisingly, Pt@Ru nanocrystals with a ∼2-3 atomic layer Ru cuboctahedral shell surpass conventional Ru nanoparticles in terms of both durability and activity. © 2016 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975156661

Out of the different mechanisms of formation damage, the pore plugging with the migration of particles within the injectant fluids by bridging at the pore throat junctions and/or by pore filling can lead to the buildup of an internal filter cake away from the wellbore that limits the well's injectivity and can affect the vertical and lateral sweep. This type of formation damage is very difficult to treat with any kind of stimulation and the impact will be manifested especially in tight formations with interbedded stylolites layers with a total range of permeabilities from 2 to less than 1 milli-Darcy and a median pore throat size ranging from 2.5 to 0.3 micron meters. The study comprises several parts starting with a geological analysis that was conducted to identify areas and layers most prone to formation pore plugging by analyzing thin-sections and MICP data. Second, in the lack of core flood tests, a reservoir and well study analyzed existing water injectors situated in similar or slightly higher quality rock areas through the analysis of injectivity index behavior to estimate the impact of damage and the expected injector's half-life. As a result, through the application of an analytical mathematical model for defining deep bed filtration parameter, a correlation was established based on average injected particle size and reservoir rock quality to aid in selecting the proper water injection filter size. In order to confirm that, a dedicated injectivity test in a horizontal well utilizing membrane filters was carried out to assess eventual formation damage and the filters efficiency by conducting a series of multiple pressure fall-off tests coupled with injection profile logging to monitor any induced damage within the wellbore region. Finally, the operational aspects and the integration within field development plans were addressed, especially with the recommended well placement and completion. This culminated in a field development strategy for formation damage mitigation in tight carbonate reservoirs during production and injection phase that can be used in other similar fields.

The target is to maximize the total steady-state hydrocarbon (HC) liquids recovery of the surface producing facilities utilizing available resources and without any the need for plant modification. Maximizing liquids removal from associated gas has several benefits to gas-oil separation plants (GOSPs) such as increasing crude oil throughput, exporting leaner gas through pipelines in addition to other advantages that will be highlighted through two implemented case studies: 1. Abu Ali Plant (Arab Extra Light crude oil producing facility). 2. Manifa Central Processing facility (Arab Heavy crude oil producing facility). The concept is basically to raise the after-cooler's operating temperature (minimize cooling) of the lower pressure compression stages, to enable shifting rich/heavier gas to the optimum side where it is more favorable for the HC heavy ends to coalesce and condense. At that point, the after-cooling is maximized to collect the liquids from the discharge knockout (KO) drum of the highest pressure compression stage. This setup, when compared to conventional setup, which is maximizing the cooling across all stages, yields higher overall HC liquid recovery from the associated gas. In case study #1, where condensate removed from the gas compression plant is normally spiked in the crude production, this approach was evaluated and field tested, resulting in gain of 2,000 barrels per day in export crude for the same GOSP feed rate. In addition, 50% drop in export gas water load and 25% drop in the HC's dew point was achieved, which helps mitigating pipeline corrosion and slugging issues in export gas transport, given the unavailability of a gas conditioning system in the facility. In case study #2, where condensate removed from the gas compression plant is segregated and shipped to downstream facilities, this approach was evaluated, field tested and resulted in a gain of approximately 5,000 barrels per day in export condensates for the same GOSP feed rate. This gain resolved a chronic low velocity issue in the export condensate pipeline and helped mitigate water, solids settling and associated corrosion problems in the pipeline as well as downstream facilities upsets. © 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Associated gas; Cooling; Corrosion; Crude oil; Drops; Gas plants; Gases; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Liquids; Petroleum engineering; Pipeline corrosion; Pipelines; Recovery; Stages; Central processing facilities; Compression system; Corrosion problems; Gas compression systems; Gas oil separation plants; Hydrocarbon liquids; Operating temperature; Optimum operating conditions; Gas condensates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044266893

A supercritical Co2 centrifugal compressor increases the pressure of the fluid which state is initially very close to the critical point. When the supercritical fluid is compressed near the critical point, wide variations of fluid properties occur. The density of carbon dioxide at its critical point is close to the liquid density which leads to reduction in compressor work. The investigated compressor is a centrifugal compressor tested in the Sandia supercritical CO2 compression loop. In order to get results with the high accuracy and take into account the non-linear variation of the properties near the critical point, the CFD flow solver is coupled with a lookup table of properties of fluid.

Thermal treatments, for example, using lasers as a process tool, can locally improve some characteristics of these materials like plastic deformation capability. The high energetic efficiency of a laser process, and its capability to be automated, are some of the advantages of using such a process. This study aims to investigate the effects of local heat treatment (involving changes in the solid state), by laser radiation, in the mechanical properties and microstructures of two types of advanced high-strength steels, the dual-phase DP 600, and the transformationinduced plasticity TRIP 750. A method to evaluate the interaction between laser radiation and the materials is proposed. Previous studies in this area focused, basically, in welding or cutting technology, and for the modern TRIP steel studied here, there is a scarcity of published material regarding laser-material interaction. Hardness and tensile tests revealed, for the range of process parameters studied, an improvement (up to 30 % with relation to the base material) in yield strength and ultimate strength (up to 15 %). Revealed also is a dramatic reduction in the elongation (up to 80 %) for both materials.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The paper identifies landfills as specific examples of urban landscapes which can be transformed to landscaped landfills. Such a plan can be formulated only by knowing the quantity and quality of the waste generated the available resources and the environmental conditions of a particular region. This paper looks into an innovative approach where source separated biodegradable waste that is taken to a landfill could be a source for landscape development. Findings: As a result the paper describes a conceptual model for landscaped landfills where it considers two options; one is rehabilitating existing dump sites (due for a clean-up) and another for setting up new sites for disposal. For both these solutions the organic/biodegradable nature of the waste can provide nutrient for plant growth which is an essential element of landscape. However, for a continuous maintenance and management of such sites the model tries to integrate certain existing waste management techniques without overlooking the environmental risks associated. Further, the paper explains the cyclic process of landscaped landfills in three different phases which includes the dumping phase, degradation phase and the planting phase. The paper briefly outlinesthat the extent and intensity these phases are site specific and depends on the quantity and quality of the waste, plant growth period and climate. Application/Improvement: The model describes a strategy and methodology to convert landfills/open dumps or any vacant land into a fitting component of typical urban landscapes through enhancing its environmental significance and visual quality for sustainability.","Environment; Landfills; Landscape; Solid waste; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983542607

This paper also aims to formulate an original and optimal mathematical correlation between readily obtainable climate parameters (mean monthly air temperature, monthly amplitude of air temperatures, monthly insolation, average monthly relative air humidity and the number of rainy days), which results in values of the TCCI. Simultaneously, this index will provide the values correspondent to the values of air temperatures (°C), which represents a comparative baseline understandable equally for tourists, tourism planners and managers. The example of Serbia as a mainland country in the south-east of Europe was used to apply the proposed methodology. The spatial-temporal variability of TCCI is formulated on basis of data for the period 1961-2000 while for testing model was used selected period 2001-2010 on the sample of 26 meteorological stations distributed all around Serbia. For this purpose a standard statistical techniques were applied and ArcGIS software was used for analyze of the variability of the TCCI in relation to the altitude, which is of particular importance for the development of tourism in the mountains. Checking variability of the index was carried out in relation to statistical data about number of tourists on the three most visited tourist destinations which are of importance for the development of urban, mountain and spa tourism, the leading forms of tourism activities on the territory of Serbia. The obtained results correspond with the fact of the pronounced seasonality of tourism market and thus may represent a good basis for future tourism planning and management. © 2016 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

So-called snow lines, indicating regions where abundant volatiles freeze out onto the surface of dust grains, play an important role for planet growth and bulk composition in protoplanetary disks. They can already be observed in the envelopes of the much younger, low-mass Class 0 protostars, which are still in their early phase of heavy accretion. Aims. We aim to use the information on the sublimation regions of different kinds of ices to understand the chemistry of the envelope, its temperature and density structure, and the history of the accretion process. This information is crucial to get the full picture of the early protostellar collapse and the subsequent evolution of young protostars. Methods. As part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program, we have obtained observations of C18O, N2H+, and CH3OH towards nearby Class 0 protostars with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer at sub-arcsecond resolution. For four of these sources, we have modeled the emission using a chemical code coupled with a radiative transfer module. Results. We observe an anti-correlation of C18O and N2H+ in NGC 1333-IRAS4A, NGC 1333-IRAS4B, L1157, and L1448C, with N2H+ forming a ring (perturbed by the outflow) around the centrally peaked C18O emission. This emission morphology, which is due to N2H+ being chemically destroyed by CO, reveals the CO and N2 ice sublimation regions in these protostellar envelopes with unprecedented resolution. We also observe compact methanol emission towards three of the sources. Based on our chemical model and assuming temperature and density profiles from the literature, we find that for all four sources the CO snow line appears further inwards than expected from the binding energy of pure CO ices (~855 K). The emission regions of models and observations match for a higher value of the CO binding energy of 1200 K, corresponding to a dust temperature of ~24 K at the CO snow line. The binding energy for N2 ices is modeled at 1000 K, also higher than for pure N2 ices. Furthermore, we find very low CO abundances inside the snow lines in our sources, about an order of magnitude lower than the total CO abundance observed in the gas on large scales in molecular clouds before depletion sets in. Conclusions. The high CO binding energy may hint at CO being frozen out in a polar ice environment like amorphous water ice or in non-polar CO2-rich ice. The low CO abundances are comparable to values found in protoplanetary disks, which may indicate an evolutionary scenario where these low values are already established in the protostellar phase. © ESO, 2016.","Circumstellar matter; ISM: general; Radio lines: ISM; Stars: formation; Stars: protostars","Bins; Carbon dioxide; Dust; Ice; Methanol; Snow; Stars; Sublimation; Circumstellar matters; ISM: general; Radio lines: ISM; Stars: formation; Stars: protostars; Binding energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973607454

Overharvesting drastically reduced the population of polar bears in the Barents Sea region from about 1870 to 1970. After harvesting was stopped-in 1956 in Russia and 1973 in Norway-the population grew to an estimated 2650 individuals (95% confidence interval 1900-3600) in 2004, and maternity denning in the Svalbard Archipelago became more widely distributed. During recent decades, the population has faced challenges from a variety of new anthropogenic impacts: a range of pollutants, an increasing level of human presence and activity as well as changes in ice conditions. Contaminants bioaccumulate up through the marine food web, culminating in this top predator that consumes ringed, bearded and harp seals. Females with small cubs use land-fast sea ice for hunting and are therefore vulnerable to disturbance by snowmobile drivers. Sea-ice diminution, associated with climate change, reduces polar bears' access to denning areas and could negatively affect the survival of cubs. There are clear linkages between population biology and current anthropogenic threats, and we suggest that future research and management should focus on and take into consideration the combined effects of several stressors on polar bears. © 2016 M.

The uncertainty and the lack of confidence associated with these conditions require the application of wide safety margins during the design of the turbine cooling systems, with a detrimental effect on engine efficiency. The adoption of lean-burn technology in modern aero-engines to reduce NOx emissions exacerbates the situation, as the absence of dilution holes keeps the strong swirl component generated by the burners up to the combustor outlet and prevents to control the pattern factor. Complexity and costs associated with the experimental investigation of combustor-Turbine interaction, makes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) paramount to understand the physical phenomena involved. Moreover, due to the well-known limitations of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach and the increase in computational resources, hybrid RANS-LES models, such as Scale Adaptive Simulation (SAS), are proving to be a viable approach to capture the main structures of the flow field. This paper reports the main findings of the numerical investigation on a test rig representative of a lean-burn, effusion cooled, annular combustor, developed in the context of the EU Project FACTOR (Full Aerothermal Combustor-Turbine interactiOns Research) with the aim of studying combustor-Turbine interaction. Results obtained with RANS and unsteady SAS were critically compared to experimental data and analysed in order to better understand the flow physics within such a device, as well as to assess the improvements related to the use of hybrid models. The main discrepancies between RANS and SAS are highlighted in predicting the recirculating region, which has slight influence on the velocity field at the combustor outlet, but affects dramatically mixing and the resulting temperature distribution. Accuracy of the results achieved suggest a possible exploitation of SAS model with a view to the future inclusion of the nozzle guide vanes within the test rig.

Conflicting explanations have been proposed for the cause of the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) in the early part of the last millennium to the Little Ice Age (LIA) near its end. The possible causes include volcanic emissions, total solar irradiance (TSI) variations, greenhouse gas concentration fluctuations, and orbital forcing variations. In the present paper, it is demonstrated that all of these climate forcings contribute significantly to simulated surface air temperature (SAT) and sea ice concentration changes over this period. On the other hand, simulated ocean heat content appears to respond significantly only to volcanic and TSI variations. In model simulations at T85 spectral resolution, TSI reductions and volcanic emissions together generate significant increases in sea ice extent in the Barents Sea, which is found to be responsible for most of the temperature reductions over northwestern Europe. TSI appears less important to Arctic sea ice and SAT changes in simulations at T42 spectral resolution, which are weaker than at T85 resolution. Such resolution dependence is attributed to differences in background conditions in the responses to these external climate forcings. Nonlinearities in the forcing responses and sensitivities to background conditions challenge the assumption that sensitivity tests for given forcings can be run independently. Additionally, it is demonstrated that an ensemble of model simulations is required to isolate forcing responses even over a period as long as the last millennium. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Gas emissions; Glacial geology; Greenhouse gases; Sea ice; Spectral resolution; Volcanoes; Background conditions; Medieval climate anomalies; Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA); Ocean heat content; Sea ice concentration; Surface air temperatures; Temperature reduction; Total solar irradiance; Ice; air temperature; climate forcing; Little Ice Age; Medieval Warm Period; paleoclimate; sea ice; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983509290

Most of the Climate Initiatives Program funding was allocated to local governments or used by MTC for innovative pilot projects to test the ability to reduce GHG emissions. The results of a comprehensive evaluation of the program are reported. The evaluation covers 16 projects that received a total of $33 million in funding in five project categories: transportation demand management (TDM), safe routes to school, bicycle projects, electric vehicle projects, and other project types. This evaluation differs from many previous studies in that it is based on observed transportation activity before and after each project, with data collected through user surveys and other methods. The evaluation found that projects varied widely in their ability to reduce GHG emissions and in their cost-effectiveness.

Tuggerah Lakes had significantly higher nutrient, chlorophyll a, and suspended sediment concentrations in the water column and significantly higher fine sediment fraction and sediment organic matter content. Seagrass above-ground biomass (AGB) was significantly greater in the mesotrophic Tuggerah Lakes, while below-ground biomass (BGB) was significantly greater in the oligotrophic Lake Macquarie, most likely reflecting the different nutrient status of the lakes. Light gradients were the primary control over total biomass, BGB, and shoot density across the study area. Although no general trends between light and AGB were found in this study, lake-and site-specific relationships between light, AGB:BGB ratios, and leaf area index were seen to vary along gradients in nutrient status and sediment quality. These trends are thought to be driven by morphological acclimation that allows seagrass to maintain favourable plant carbon and net community metabolism balances while minimising sulphide exposure. Seagrass depth limits were best predicted by a multilinear model including Secchi depth, fine sediment fraction, and organic matter content, suggesting that negative feedbacks associated with sulphide exposure in the rhizosphere increased the minimum light requirements of this species. Our results support an emerging view that sediment quality and nutrient status are important controls over minimum light requirements in seagrasses. Morphological plasticity can moderate but not completely compensate for the negative impacts of sediment properties on minimum light requirements. © The authors 2016.","Depth gradient; Morphological plasticity; Nutrients; Seagrass; Sediment quality","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; coastal zone; light effect; mesotrophic environment; morphometry; nutrient dynamics; organic matter; phenotypic plasticity; rhizosphere; seagrass; sediment property; suspended sediment; temperate environment; water column; water depth; acclimation; biomass; coastal lagoon; environmental quality; lacustrine deposit; metabolism; morphology; vertical distribution; Australia; Lake Macquarie; New South Wales; Tuggerah Lakes Estuary; Zostera muelleri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989159362

Various drivers have enabled this transition, including sustainability concerns, scarcity in resources, economic considerations, and rapid growth in enabling technologies of sensor networks, and computational and communication systems. Two notable examples of such infrastructures are smart grids and smart cities. The idea behind a Smart grid is the creation of a dynamic, cyber-physical infrastructure that meets the challenges of intermittency and distributed availability of renewables, and realizes reduced operational costs and emissions, via a flexible, intelligent, and networked grid that plans, controls, and balances supply and demand over an entire region. The concept of a Smart City is gaining popular attention driven by goals of sustainability and efficiency, the needs of enhancing quality of life and affordability, growing urbanization of the world's population, and the explosion of technological advances in communication and computation. While systems and control problems abound in any complex dynamic system, two characteristics that are specific to critical infrastructures are the need to deliver reliable service and the ability to accomplish this goal amidst constrained resources. These in turn lead to new research topics in systems and control including empowered consumers, transactive control, and resilience. The focus of this paper is on these emerging topics. Their role in smart infrastructures, the opportunities they provide, and the research challenges that they bring in are all discussed. Specific illustrations of recent successes are presented that are based on coordinated adjustment of generation and consumption using concepts of multi-agents and multi-timescales in smart grids and socio-technical models of empowered drivers in smart cities. © 2016 International Federation of Automatic Control","Control; Empowered consumers; Multi-agents; Multi-timescales; Resilience; Smart cities; Smart grids; Stability; Transactive control","Complex networks; Control; Convergence of numerical methods; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Multi agent systems; Public works; Sensor networks; Smart power grids; Sustainable development; Empowered consumers; Multi agent; Resilience; Smart cities; Smart grid; Time-scales; Transactive controls; Critical infrastructures",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995677066

LocaGIStics was further developed within the S2Biom project. It enables to further design and evaluate regional biomass delivery chains that are either suggested by higher level optimization models like e.g. Be Where or that are the result of initial planning by e.g. an energy company or a biobased producer. These general plans are translated in several biomass delivery designs using the variation in logistical concepts covering transport, pre-treatment and conversion options. The performance of every chain design can then be analysed by comparing the different biomass delivery chains on the following environmental and economic indicators: GHG emissions and mitigation (including land use change emissions), soil C, soil erosion impacts potential and an economic minimum acceptable return analysis. LocaGIStics can take account of high resolution cost-supply information available at 250 m resolution grid.

Recently, it has been shown that the large coherent structures of a turbulent single-stream jet, which are parts of the noise generation mechanisms, can be interpreted as instability of the mean turbulent flow, especially in the region of the potential core. Reducing noise will be probably only achieved with some new control strategy on the underlying physics of the acoustic wave generation. The present work deals with the last investigations associated to the sensitivity analysis of the single and dual-stream jet instability to any local forcing. Sensitivity is a first step of any aeroacoustic or flow control approach and it is performed by the Parabolized Stability Equations and their adjoint counter part. Validation is first made on a simple semi-analytical supersonic jet. Then sensitivity functions to a source of momentum, mass or energy forcing are given in a supersonic single (M = 1.15) and dual- stream jets (Mp = 0.89 and Ms = 1.20). The base-flow is obtained from accurate Large Eddy Simulations and included some shock cells. Highest sensitivities are found inside the shear layer close to the external boundary of the potential core and close to the jet inlet, similar to the previous results found in incompressible single stream jet. The growth rate and wave number of the Kelvin-Helmhotz instability and the acoustic (pressure) perturbation are strongly influenced by the shock cell positions. © American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The generation of noise has been demonstrated to originate from convective instabilities that amplify in the jet stream. Several authors have investigated them through the Parabolized Stability Equations approach (PSE). The present work aims to develop the adjoint of the PSE to extract from a mathematically well posed problem the sensitivity coefficients which can be understood as gradient. The final objective is to propose some path of possible actuations in order to decrease noise emission in some jet flows. The shape and the location of the maximum of sensitivity are strongly related to the radial and streamwise variation of the base flow. In particular the maximum of sensitivity is located along the border of the potential cone and it seems to be well correlated with the location of the sound generation mechanism. In addition the sensitivity to axial momentum forcing is higher than to a radial momentum forcing. Finally the sensitivity increases when the perturbation is near to the exit of the nozzle. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N. meningitidis can utilize a restricted range of carbon sources, including lactate, glucose, and pyruvate, whose concentrations vary in host niches. Microarray analysis of N. meningitidis grown in a chemically defined medium in the presence or absence of glucose allowed us to identify genes regulated by carbon source availability. Most such genes are implicated in energy metabolism and transport, and some are implicated in virulence. In particular, genes involved in glucose catabolism were upregulated, whereas genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were downregulated. Several genes encoding surface-exposed proteins, including the MafA adhesins and Neisseria surface protein A, were upregulated in the presence of glucose. Our microarray analysis led to the identification of a glucose-responsive hexR-like transcriptional regulator that controls genes of the central carbon metabolism of N. meningitidis in response to glucose. We characterized the HexR regulon and showed that the hexR gene is accountable for some of the glucose-responsive regulation; in vitro assays with the purified protein showed that HexR binds to the promoters of the central metabolic operons of the bacterium. Based on DNA sequence alignment of the target sites, we propose a 17-bp pseudopalindromic consensus HexR binding motif. Furthermore, N. meningitidis strains lacking hexR expression were deficient in establishing successful bacteremia in an infant rat model of infection, indicating the importance of this regulator for the survival of this pathogen in vivo. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.",,"adhesin; bacterial protein; carbon; glucose; HexR protein; membrane protein; transcription factor MafA; tricarboxylic acid; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; carbon; glucose; Article; bacterial gene; carbon metabolism; citric acid cycle; controlled study; down regulation; genetic code; glycolysis; in vitro study; Neisseria meningitidis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein structure; surface property; upregulation; animal; energy metabolism; epidemic meningitis; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; Neisseria meningitidis; nucleotide sequence; operon; promoter region; rat; regulon; Wistar rat; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Carbon; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Glucose; Humans; Meningitis, Meningococcal; Molecular Sequence Data; Neisseria meningitidis; Operon; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Regulon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958073375

A performance target was set at a rated power of 300 kW (BMEP=1.7 MPa) and peak torque of 1842 Nm (BMEP=2.2 MPa). Emission targets were set at a level of near future regulation standards in Japan. The engine was equipped with a high pressure fuel injection system of the 200 MPa level with a common rail system and a new variable geometry turbocharger (VGT). The maximum pressure ratio of the VGT compressor was 5.0, which was twice as much as the conventional turbocharger (approx. 3.0). Under these conditions, wide range and high EGR rates were achieved by high and low pressure loop EGR systems. The test engine with aftertreatment systems such as an oxidation catalyst, a lean NOx catalyst and a DPF was evaluated and was examined as an experiment under the Japanese JE05 transient test cycle to meet the targets for the performance and emissions. The high and low pressure loop EGR systems with a VGT had a high performance and could increase an EGR rate in order to reduce BSNOx while maintaining the satisfied BSFC and PM performance simultaneously not only in the steady state condition but also in the transient condition.

Its purpose is to explore whether some early signals for peak travel in long-distance transport can be identified and if so, which could be the options for a consistent policy action. For the sake of simplicity, only car and air modes are considered. The analysis is based on previous research conducted for the preparation of the recent report of the European Environment Agency (EEA), ""Focusing on environmental pressures from long-distance transport - TERM 2014"" (EEA, 2014). Passenger travel demand data at the national level show striking differences among European countries. Beyond the traditional divide between ""new"" and ""old"" EU member states, it seems that differences respond to a much richer variety of traits, including the size of the country, per capita GDP trends and the characteristics of the population. It is within this complex geographical background that the influence of three traditional key drivers should be explored: population, disposable income and lifestyles. Although there are good arguments to conclude that peaking in long-distance transport demand could be reached in an increasing number of European countries, there are also significant forces to further expand demand. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting that peaking, if materialised, would be happening at levels too high to be compatible with GHG emission reduction targets. The paper concludes that there are positive signs in the recent trends of these drivers indicating that they would not result in additional mobility demand. However, these trends could be neutralised by other factors, such as the strategies of European transport policy makers and operators to foster latent demand and expand their markets, this is illustrated by current strategies of air travel operators and some regional governments to further develop low-cost, regional airport-based services. © 2016 The Authors.

In Bolivia climate change is operating in a framework of poverty and inequality. This chapter focuses on the Bolivian Chaco ecosystems water availability and indigenous health. An ecohealth research was launched to evaluate rural communities and their vulnerability and impacts to current and future climate conditions. The participatory-based approach incorporates community and indigenous organizations, local and national health, and meteorological services. Main observed impacts at Chaco are water stress and warming affecting watersheds, ecosystems and health. Water-borne diseases (WBD) and diarrheal diseases (DD) affected most children evaluated. An average decrease in rainfall of 5–12 %, up to 25 % in winter, especially at the middle and low watershed, is observed. Future increases in temperature (+1–2 °C for 2030–2050), modified rainy patterns and reduced water availability are expected. The both observed and expected warming and less rainfall are correlated with diarrheal vulnerability (VCCDD) and the number of DD cases at rural and indigenous communities. Thus, increasing trends of WBD and DD are likely for 2030–2050. This experience was useful to design Chaco region climate change policies and indigenous health adaptation strategies focused on WBD/DD. These included: raising awareness about water and health climate vulnerability and impacts, increasing investments for water sources protection, establishing systems to compensate and protect watersheds and water springs, capacity building, WBD/DD prevention actions, and clean technologies for economic activities. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate inequality; Climate scenarios; Ecohealth; Indigenous health; Water availability and quality; Waterborne and diarrheal diseases",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020162374

The Bosomtwe District is predominantly agrarian with potentials for climate change mitigation through REDD+ mechanism among smallholder farmers. The limited knowledge and practices of this strategy among farmers are limiting potentials of mitigating climate change. This paper assesses the REDD+ potentials among smallholder farmers in the district. Using a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative design, 152 farmer-respondents were purposively sampled and interviewed, using snowballing method from 12 communities. Quantitative data gathered were subjected to the tools of contingency and frequencies analysis, embedded in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v.16. The qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results indicate that respondents have knowledge of REDD+ but not the intended benefit sharing regimes that can accrue to the smallholder farmers. Farmers' willingness to practice REDD+ will be based on the motivation and incentive potentials of the strategies.

While policy-makers adopt energy policies that address climate change and energy security, these policies often include broad strategy statements and may not include specific implementation plans. Accordingly, effectiveness of these energy policies is also evaluated at the strategic level, which may not appropriately evaluate the policies beyond how the policy met its strategic goal(s). This paper assesses the feasibility of mapping energy policies to their strategic, tactical, and operational (STO) levels through two case studies. The first case study assesses the European Union (EU) 2020 energy and climate policy known as EU 20-20-20 as well as the United States' Executive Orders 13514 and 13423 that mandate energy and greenhouse gas reductions for federal buildings. Results of this paper illuminate potential advantages and limitations of using STO as an energy policy assessment tool and the mapping effort described in this paper suggests that strategic, tactical and operational levels should be addressed explicitly in future energy policies. © 2016 The Authors.","Climate Change; Energy Policy; EO 13514; EU 20-20 20; Operational; Strategic; Tactical","Energy policy; Energy security; Greenhouse gases; Mapping; Sustainable development; Energy and climate policies; EO 13514; Greenhouse gas reductions; Operational; Operational level; Policy assessment; Strategic; Tactical; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999861946

Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies a case study approach, drawing from the documented experiences of organised urban poor groups in Asian countries already actively participating in collective settlement upgrading, building networks and financial resources for further action. Findings: The findings show that while certain actions might not be taken with climate change adaptation specifically in mind, these development activities also contribute to broader resilience to climate change, by reducing exposure to risk and addressing other drivers of vulnerability. The findings also show that partnerships between low income communities and other urban stakeholders, including local government, and innovative financial mechanisms managed by communities, can lead to scaled-up action to address development and adaptation deficits. This can lead the way for transformation in socio-political systems. Practical implications: The approaches applied by organised urban poor groups in Asia show that community-level actions can make a positive contribution to building their resilience to climate change, and with local government support and partnership, it could lead to scaled-up actions, through a bottom-up approach to multi-level governance. Originality/value: This paper considers how community-driven actions can build resilience to climate change, and it argues that adaptation and development should be considered together. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Asia; Climate change; Community; Urban","bottom-up approach; climate change; living standard; local government; low income population; resource use; risk assessment; socioeconomic status; stakeholder; urban area; urban climate; urban population; vulnerability; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999749796

For a given locality, the possibility to know in advance the climatic data with a high reliability index, makes possible the predictive evaluation of thermal loads in buildings. The predicted thermal loads evaluation allows a better management of the heat generation systems, with corresponding operation economies. Climate data, geometric and thermo-physical characteristics of a building envelope are usually employed in dynamic simulation codes in order to determine the thermal loads. These codes are characterized by a high complexity index, with interfaces difficult to understand and usually require high computational time. In this paper, a dynamic model with lumped parameters and easy to understand, developed also for non-expert users, is presented. Regarding a residential building of usable area of 100 m2, in function of climate data of South Italy, the thermal load profiles and indoor air temperature were determined with the mentioned model implemented in JAVA environment. The results were compared with the TRNSYS code that uses the transfer function method approach. Good agreement between the obtained results was observed, especially for buildings with high thermal inertia. © 2016 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).","5R1C dynamic simplified model; Building energy efficiency; Predictive thermal loads: smart grids; TRNSYS","Buildings; Climate models; Codes (symbols); Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Function evaluation; Smart power grids; Thermal load; Building energy efficiency; Dynamic simulation codes; Indoor air temperature; Physical characteristics; Residential building; Smart grid; Transfer function method; TRNSYS; Building codes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994631089

Due to the features of energy deposition of charged particles a small amount of dose is released to the healthy tissue in the beam entrance region, while the maximum of the dose is released to the tumor at the end of the beam range, in the Bragg peak region. However nuclear interactions between beam and patient tissues induce fragmentation both of projectile and target and must be carefully taken into account. In 12C treatments the main concern are long range fragments due to projectile fragmentation that release dose in the healthy tissue after the tumor, while in proton treatment the target fragmentation produces low energy, short range fragments along all the beam range. The FOOT experiment (FragmentatiOn Of Target) is designed to study these processes. Target nuclei (16O,12C) fragmentation induced by 150-250 AMeV proton beam will be studied via inverse kinematic approach. 16O,12C therapeutic beams, with the quoted kinetic energy, collide on graphite and hydrocarbons target to provide the cross section on Hydrogen. This configuration explores also the projectile fragmentation of these 16O,12C beams. The detector includes a magnetic spectrometer based on silicon pixel detectors and drift chamber, a scintillating crystal calorimeter with TOF capabilities, able to stop the heavier fragments produced, and a ΔE detector to achieve the needed energy resolution and particle identification. An alternative setup of the experiment will exploit the emulsion chamber capabilities. A specific emulsion chambers will be coupled with the interaction region of the FOOT setup to measure the production in target fragmentation of light charged fragments as protons, deuterons, tritons and Helium nuclei. The FOOT data taking is foreseen at the CNAO experimental room and will start during early 2018 with the emulsion setup, while the complete electronic detector will take data since 2019. © Copyright owned by the author(s).",,"Charged particles; Deuterium; Emulsification; Inverse kinematics; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Nuclear reactions; Projectiles; Silicon detectors; Tissue; Tumors; Electronic detectors; Inverse kinematic approach; Magnetic spectrometers; Nuclear interaction; Particle identifications; Projectile fragmentation; Scintillating crystals; Silicon pixel detector; Proton beam therapy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034583437

This region is influenced by multiple physical and socio-economic drivers and feedbacks, impacting both the natural and human environment. Air pollution is one such driver that impacts Arctic climate change, ecosystems and health but significant uncertainties still surround quantification of these effects. Arctic air pollution includes harmful trace gases (e.g. tropospheric ozone) and particles (e.g. black carbon, sulphate) and toxic substances (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) that can be transported to the Arctic from emission sources located far outside the region, or emitted within the Arctic from activities including shipping, power production, and other industrial activities. This paper qualitatively summarizes the complex science issues motivating the creation of a new international initiative, PACES (air Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment and Societies). Approaches for coordinated, international and interdisciplinary research on this topic are described with the goal to improve predictive capability via new understanding about sources, processes, feedbacks and impacts of Arctic air pollution. Overarching research actions are outlined, in which we describe our recommendations for 1) the development of trans-disciplinary approaches combining social and economic research with investigation of the chemical and physical aspects of Arctic air pollution; 2) increasing the quality and quantity of observations in the Arctic using long-term monitoring and intensive field studies, both at the surface and throughout the troposphere; and 3) developing improved predictive capability across a range of spatial and temporal scales. © 2016 Arnold et al.",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; climate change; environmental impact; global change; human activity; PAH; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; trace gas; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986278063

Electricity consumption will influence emissions from power plants, and these along with direct residential fuel combustion will also contribute to emissions of multiple key pollutants, with corresponding air quality and health impacts. We have developed models to quantify the energy savings associated with increased residential insulation and to estimate in monetary terms the environmental and public health benefits. We are considering both retrofits to existing housing and new construction, focusing on the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), which specifies R-values and U-factors by climate zone and a number of other structural components and design specifications. We are applying EnergyPlus to a series of template files to estimate energy savings by fuel type and state, for both retrofits and new construction. To determine the emissions reductions related to reduced electricity generation, we used EPA’s AVERT tool. AVERT uses the basic attributes of electricity dispatch modeling to determine the power plants most likely influenced by energy efficiency programs, and provides the direct nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions on a plant-by-plant basis. For residential combustion, we used EPA’s AP-42 database and other resources to quantify direct emissions by fuel type (including natural gas, fuel oil, and wood). To model the health benefits of the criteria pollutant emissions, we linked the emissions reductions due to increased energy efficiency with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. We developed a series of simulations using CMAQ v4.7.1 instrumented with the Decoupled Direct Method (DDM), an advanced sensitivity analysis technique that allows us to estimate the influence of individual pollutants from individual sources or regions. We considered direct residential combustion by state, leveraging Census and housing start data to determine spatial patterns of emissions within states, and modeled individual power plants in geographic groupings using a design of experiments that allow us to estimate the impacts for all major power plants on the grid. We focused on fine particulate matter and ozone concentrations, as the key drivers of monetized health impacts. As CMAQ provides concentration estimates by grid cell, we are able to determine total public health benefits in terms of avoided mortality and morbidity as well as the distribution of those benefits for directly modeled facilities and locations. We estimate 19,000 premature deaths per year associated with EGU emissions, with more than half of the EGU-related health impacts attributable to emissions from seven states with significant coal combustion. We also estimate 10,000 premature deaths per year associated with residential combustion emissions, driven by primary PM2.5 emissions. In general, primary PM2.5 health damage functions are an order of magnitude larger than those of secondary PM2.5 precursors. Our findings reinforce the significance of source-specific assessment of air quality and health impacts for developing public health policies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Air quality; AVERT; Benmap-CE; CMAQ; DDM; Electric generating units; Energy plus; Health impacts; Insulation; O3; PM2.5; Residential combustion",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060431992

The most commonly used catalyst for SCR in established markets is Cu-Zeolite (CuZ) due to excellent NOx conversion and thermal durability. However, most applications in emerging markets and certain applications in established markets utilize vanadia SCR. The operating temperature is typically maintained below 550°C to avoid vanadium sublimation due to active regeneration of the diesel particulate filter (DPF), or some OEMs may eliminate the DPF because they can achieve particulate matter (PM) standard with engine tuning. Further improvement of vanadia SCR durability and NOx conversion at low exhaust gas temperatures will be required in consideration of future emission standards. A high-porosity substrate (HPS) with increased vanadia catalyst loading is a viable solution to reach higher conversion efficiency targets at low exhaust temperatures (&lt;300°C). A previous study evaluated HPS of various design configurations with a high vanadia catalyst loading with a gas reactor and an on-highway 7L class engine [1]. The study demonstrated HPS with high vanadia catalyst loading improves NOx conversion and has a potential to be downsized more than 50% when compared to standard substrate with conventional catalyst loading. This study addresses hydrothermally aged SCR performance of high vanadia catalyst loading on HPS in various design configurations. The catalyzed substrates were hydrothermally aged for 100 hours at 550°C with the engine and evaluated by measuring NH3 storage and performance over steady state conditions and the World Harmonized Transient Cycle (WHTC). For the transient test, 50% volume SCR was also tested to clarify effect of downsizing. The comparison of degreened and aged SCR performance confirms that HPS with high vanadia catalyst loading maintains high NOx conversion activity after 100 hours aging at 550°C even when the volume is cut in half. Also, the best SCR design in terms of tailpipe NOx and N2O emission is discussed in anticipation of tighter NOx and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) regulation.

As a result, building designers are increasingly expected to improve the energy performance and reduce the carbon footprint of their building models in the design process. Higher energy savings opportunities are available during early stages of design; however, energy performance assessments are typically done during the later phases due to the lack of the easy-to-use and efficient tools that could help architects explore design alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a new Form-based Energy Performance Regression Model (FEPRM) that is capable of real time quantification of the building energy performance based on the form variation in a building information modeling (BIM) tool. FEPRM generates a set of models and simulations based on the project specifiations and provides a seamless energy performance feedback to the designer for decision making during the conceptual design process using a regression-based model. In this paper, we investigated the use of FEPRM on 3 different cases with different AHSRAE climate zones to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. The comparison between actual simulation and predicted energy performance is provided to study the accuracy of the FEPRM; moreover, a set of extended test cases are also described. © 2016 ASHRAE (www.ashrae.org).",,"Carbon footprint; Conceptual design; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Information theory; Regression analysis; Structural design; Building designers; Building energy performance; Building Information Model - BIM; Design alternatives; Energy performance; Energy performance assessments; Real-time quantification; Regression-based model; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093014426

Mandatory biofuels incorporation rates have been recently established in several countries, including the European Union, in order to promote the use of renewable energetic resources in spite of several criticisms toward biofuels relating to their impacts on food security, the environment and the conflicts associated with resource allocations. To study existing concerns on the growth, the profitability, the limiting factors biofuels, as well as the impacts of current policies in force, a highly parameterized operational modelling tool (AGRAF) dedicated to the European area has been developed. Based on the coupling of three economic models (AROPAj, OURSEurope and GIRAF), each one representing a key sector of the biofuel production chain (respectively agriculture, refining and biofuel manufacturers), his approach allows to assess different scenarios based on different technical, economic, environmental and political criteria. Furthermore, it helps highlighting the biofuel production potential growth (quantity, nature, location, by products and polluting emissions), related costs (investments, transportation, raw material) and exchanges between the agents. AGRAF incorporates biomass and biofuels importations from outside Europe and takes into account both first and second generation biofuels (involved in the European biofuel policy scheme for 2030). These features help identifying the levers and opportunities for reaching European Union bioenergy's targets over a medium-long term. © Environmental Modelling and Software for Supporting a Sustainable Future, Proceedings - 8th International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software, iEMSs 2016.

It brings about the possibility of recycling heat released during exothermic carbonation and it offers a higher rate of conversion through two separate stages: producing of reactive compounds, mainly Mg(OH)2, through solid reactions between Mg-silicates and ammonium sulfates and subsequent carbonation of reactive compounds. Milling is essential to enhance the solid-state reaction rate and increase the conversion percentage. The milling energy, being the major energy consumption of the entire carbonation process, needs to be minimized without sacrifice of its activation purpose. This study focuses on enhancing the kinetics of solid-state magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) thermal extraction from the solid-solid reaction of olivine ((Fe,Mg)2SiO4) and ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), with optimized milling energy input. This process constitutes the first stage of Mg(OH)2 production for indirect CO2 storage purposes. The mechanical activation of reactants via a high-energy magneto ball milling with a controlled energy input is achieved. The variation of structural parameters such as the particle size, specific surface area (SSA), pore volume, and crystallite size and strain are characterized as a function of milling energy input and the correlation between structural factors and activation energy of extraction is investigated. In addition, the variation in the apparent activation energy of solid-state extraction is examined as a function of milling energy. The optimal amount of milling energy input for increasing the reaction kinetics of MgSO4 extraction is estimated to be about 27.6 kJ g-1 which causes around 34% reduction in the activation energy of MgSO4 solid-state extraction. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Ball milling; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Chemical activation; Crystallite size; Energy utilization; Extraction; Magnesium; Milling (machining); Particle size; Reaction kinetics; Silicate minerals; Silicates; Solid state reactions; Sulfur compounds; Apparent activation energy; Carbonation process; Crystallite size and strains; Mechanical activation; Solid state extraction; Solid-solid reaction; Specific surface area (SSA); Structural parameter; Activation energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979949609

The new Standard remapped counties to climate zones based on the new weather data. More than 400 counties out of a total of over 3,000 in the U.S. were reassigned to different climate zones and most of the counties were reassigned to warmer climate zones. Many code requirements, such as for wall insulation, are less stringent in warmer climate zones. Thus, when a county is reassigned to a warmer climate zone, new buildings built in that county are likely to be less energy efficient than before. The new county-to-climate zone mapping in ASHRAE Standard 169-2013 has been adopted by Standard 90.1 and may be adopted by other codes and standards as well. In this paper, we present the impact of changing the county-climate zone mapping on energy codes and building energy efficiency in the country.

They are aimed at improving the fuel efficiency of the conventional gasoline and diesel power trains with conventional 12 V electrical system, and thus reduce the CO2 emissions as well. Various technologies like Engine Stop-Start, Intelligent Alternator Control, and Electrical Energy Management Systems are included in the bracket of micro hybrid systems. These system functions demand a totally different approach for managing the SLI battery, which is a total departure from the conventional approach. Particularly, the Alternator Shutdown function of Intelligent Alternator Control maintains a calibrated average level of State of Charge, which is typically around 80%, to ensure that the battery can accept more current, during the energy recuperation, which indirectly improves fuel economy. However, continuous operation under partially discharged condition, results in the sulfation in the battery which is the main reason for the ageing of the battery. Symptoms of ageing include permanent loss of capacity, increase in internal resistance, etc. This paper discusses a novel approach of ensuring the life of the battery in the altered operating conditions of a Micro Hybrid System. A Charge Refresh Cycle is implemented in the Battery Management System, which periodically performs a refresh charge on the battery to ensure that the battery is not affected due to partially discharged conditions, without having to disconnect the battery from the vehicle, and without the need of a visit to a service station. This is achieved by implementing a timer and an engine start counter, based on which the control signals for the refresh charge are triggered. The system not only ensures the performance of the battery, but also ensures the return of designed life of the battery.

(2012). They have investigated a long-term relationship between climatic change and economic growth in case of Pakistan. Agricultural sector plays an important role in economic field, whereas industrial sector is the main source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. Therefore, this study aims to replace economic growth variable with industrial growth in case of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: Investigation is made on the basis of the environmental Kuznets curve by using the time series data during the period 1971-2009. The per capital carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is used as an environmental indicator and per capita industrial income as the economic indicator. Different econometric tools including augmented Dickey–Fuller, autoregressive distributed lag and Granger-causality test are used to verify this relationship. Findings: The empirical findings will help the policy-makers of Pakistan in developing new standards and monitoring networks for reducing CO2 emission. It is essential to extend the current research work at provincial and different sectors levels in order to have clear understanding about the impact of current emission rate. Originality/value: This study replaces economic growth variable with industrial growth in case of Pakistan because the industrial sector is the main source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. This study is to investigate a long-term relationship between climatic change and industrial growth in case of Pakistan. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","ARDL; CO2 emissions; Environmental Kuznets curve; Industrial growth; Pakistan","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economics; Industrial emissions; ARDL; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental indicators; Environmental Kuznets curves; Granger causality test; Industrial growth; Long-term relationships; Pakistan; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015276423

This work describes the project LOCARBO, already in the early stage of implementation, financed by the INTERREG EUROPE Program. The project is mainly oriented at improving regional programming and main policy instruments in order to innovate low carbon strategies looking at the best European practices properly transferred in each implementation context. A peculiarity of the approach promoted by the project is the involvement of citizens in order to spread sustainable behaviours based on a formal ‘green’ agreement among users, local administrations and business/services operators. The challenge to involve and motivate stakeholders (especially energy consumers) is perceived broadly as a major problem for public authorities. Motivation and awareness of consumers are of high significance to influence their behaviour and support more conscious energy decisions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Covenant of majors; Energy efficiency; EU 2020; New cohesion policy; Regional planning","Energy efficiency; Regional planning; Covenant of majors; Energy consumer; Low carbon; Low carbon economy; Low-carbon strategies; Policy instruments; Public authorities; Sustainable behaviours; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978828701

To begin with, the dialogue between researchers and decision-makers is essential to ensure profound understanding and legitimate interpretations of the results. Furthermore, the step to drawing practical conclusions and process them into actions can only succeed if research findings are diffused to decision-making levels with influence on the matter and mechanisms to knowledge transfer in the presence of a stable, favourable policy environment exist. Research investments into the topic of electromobility in Europe are substantial, and subtopics aiming to inform national policy-makers address a complex set of aspects from environmental and societal to technological and economic. This paper has a two-fold objective, the first of which is to present the results of scenarios to explore electromobility deployment in Finland, Germany and the European Union. The second is to discuss the challenges and solutions to bridge the gap from research findings towards decision-making and policy-planning, using our electromobility scenario work as an example. The electromobility scenarios were built using the VECTOR21 model (Mock, 2010), and the rationale was to simulate vehicle sales and markets under different policy settings and calculate the most economical solution to fulfil regulation on CO2 emissions as set by the European Commission (2009). The model allows calculating the market diffusion of alternative powertrain technologies to the European market until 2030, taking into account different taxation schemes, incentives and other country-specific characteristics. We also present the cost-benefit-analysis of the modelling results to assess the different scenarios and to show variation between regions regarding profitability of alternative technological or political support and interventions. To proceed from research findings towards decision-making and policy-planning, we made observations relating to transfer of research knowledge and interpretation of our electromobility scenario results in national policy contexts. An evaluation of how the function of research to inform policy in this case succeeded is provided. In addition, the influence of expert opinions on the political decision-making process will be discussed through experiences from an expert questionnaire conducted to survey the importance of costs, time requirement, acceptance and other criteria of promotion measures of electromobility. © 2016 The Authors.","Electric vehicles; Electromobility; Emissions; Scenarios; Transport policy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991471822

This study focuses on the elimination of mercury from the combustion flue gases via the oxidation of elemental mercury (non-soluble) into its oxidized form (soluble) by the addition of halogens (chlorine, bromine and iodine). A detailed reaction mechanism is developed and comparisons of mercury loss versus halogen, NO, SO2 and H2O presence in a typical combustion effluent stream are presented. The influence of different air-fuel equivalence ratios is also illustrated. The removal of mercury is evaluated with an elementary reaction mechanism (957 reactions, 203 species) developed from fundamental principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Thermochemistry and rate constants are from literature, or calculated at the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ-PP (mercury species), and CBS-QB3 (non-mercury species) levels of theory. Rate constants are calculated by application of the Canonical Transition State Theory (CTST). Pressure dependence of chemically activated reactions is included by the QRRK analysis for k(E) and Master Equation for fall-off. Thermochemistry on Hg halides, oxides, and X-Hg-NOx and X-Hg-SOx (X=Cl,Br) has been determined and kinetics incorporated in the mechanism. Bromine and iodine are more effective than chlorine at oxidizing mercury due to competition for chlorine by hydrogen. Other results show that NO and SO2 are observed to inhibit mercury conversion, that moderate changes in H2O have a slight impact on mercury oxidation, and that the air-fuel ratio significantly influences the conversion of mercury by the halogens. © 2016, Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

Despite organic carbon limitation, metal-reducing microbial communities are present in potentially ancient anoxic brines continuously emanating from exploratory boreholes on Level 27. Using graphite electrodes deposited in situ as bait, we electrochemically enriched and isolated a novel halophilic iron-reducing Deltaproteobacterium, 'Desulfuromonas soudanensis' strain WTL, from an acetate-fed three-electrode bioreactor poised at +0.24 V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Cyclic voltammetry revealed that 'D. soudanensis' releases electrons at redox potentials approximately 100 mV more positive than the model freshwater surface isolate Geobacter sulfurreducens, suggesting that its extracellular respiration is tuned for higher potential electron acceptors. 'D. soudanensis' contains a 3,958,620-bp circular genome, assembled to completion using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing reads, which encodes a complete TCA cycle, 38 putative multiheme c-type cytochromes, one of which contains 69 heme-binding motifs, and a LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing cassette that produces an unidentified N-acyl homoserine lactone.

Ion current sensing technology has the potential to provide real-time feedback of the combustion process while using a fairly inexpensive sensor. 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) cycle simulation is becoming more complementary in understanding the complex combustion process in diesel engines. In this paper, a CFD study is focused on investigating the characteristics of the ion current signal produced during the combustion process of a Gen-set turbocharged diesel engine. Multiple virtual ion sensing probes are defined in different locations inside the combustion chamber to understand the influence of sensor location on signal characteristics. The n-heptane reaction mechanism and NO mechanism, combined with an ionization mechanism developed at WSU with 11 species, are used in the model to predict the chemical kinetics of combustion and the mole fraction of ionized species produced during combustion. Since the charge in diesel engines is heterogeneous and due to the sensing nature of the ion sensor, this paper explores the effect of sensor sensing diameter and its protrusion depth inside the combustion chamber on the ion current signal development. The simulation is validated by comparing in-cylinder pressure traces, the rate of heat release, and the ion current signal. Further, the model results are validated under different engine loads and injection pressures. This study utilizes the ionization mechanism to give further understanding of the complex formation of ionization species and their amplitudes, particularly at local sensing locations. This can be very vital to identify the potentials of using the ion current sensing and highlight its viability in feedback closed loop combustion control.

Most of this problem is due to economic issues and lack of attention from governments. Moreover, the Guadua angustifolia Kunth (Guadua-a.) is a bamboo that grows in most of the Americas. This material has a resistance - weight ratio similar to structural steel also presenting additional benefits such as soil stabilization, flow regulation, and a high CO2 fixation rate to the ground. In addition the Guadua-a. growth cycle spans from 3 to 5 years. All of these makes the Guadua-a. in highly renewable material. This paper presents an alternative for the construction of Guadua-a. structural modules for pedestrian bridges, as a solution to the lack of infrastructure in village roads and even in suburban areas. In the proposed model, the bridge would be built by the community in a short time, taking advantage of existing Guadua-a. in the area, and establishing an industrialized cultivation of it, to enable them to have enough material for maintenance and replacement of sections as necessary. A numerical structural analysis was performed to determine the maximum possible span under load specifications from Colombian bridge building code. The results shows that a bridge up to 21m of span can be constructed using the module. The span can be increased drastically when the module is combined with wire-cable or an arc shaped configuration, however, the module was assessed to be used in straight truss bridges because this setting carries the largest loads on the elements. Real scale load tests were conducted on a full scale physical model of the module, the structural elements and the connection between the modules. © (2016) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Guadua angustifolia kunth; Modules; Pedestrian bridge","Bamboo; Building codes; Building materials; Load testing; Soil mechanics; Stabilization; Trusses; Full-scale physical modeling; Guadua angustifolia kunth; Modules; Renewable materials; Road infrastructures; Structural elements; Structural module; Structural steels; Footbridges",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954096710

In this study, a locally isolated microalga, Scenedesmus obliquus (Turpin) Kützing GA 45 presented a biomass yield of 3.74 g L-1 with a concurrent lipid yield of 850 mg L-1 for a 16-day incubation period under 15% CO2 sparging at 0.6 vvm air flow in a photobioreactor system. These values were raised up to 7.01 and 1.69 g L-1, respectively, for biomass and lipid yield for 10 days incubation with 1% glucose under the above conditions. The maximum CO2 bio-fixation rate was found to be as high as 0.77 g L-1 d-1. Moreover, under one week's biphasic nitrogen starvation, lipid content was boosted up to 43.9% of dry cell weight (dcw) with a yield of 2.0 g L-1. This yield can be projected to an areal lipid productivity of 180 tons per ha per year, and a CO2 biofixation rate of 1170 tons per ha per year with 200 algal ponds (size: 15 × 3 × 0.5 m), assuming 18 cultivation cycles per year.

We determined the influence of vegetation composition on the soil organic carbon in three different plant communities. Three dominant plant communities were selected in grassland habitats in north-western Iran. To compare the soil organic matter (SOM) parameters, soil samples from each community were collected from depths of 0-15cm and 15-30cm. The results showed that the spatial variation of SOM was probably affected by the plant community composition. The highest values of total C occurred in Astragalus microcephalus and Pterpyrum aucheri communities. Total N, POM-C and also POM-N were generally highest in the Astragalus microcephalus community. POM-N contents in both soil depths of the Astragalus microcephalus and Pterpyrum aucheri communities were significantly higher than the Prangus uloptera community. There was a significantly smaller proportion of soil present as macro-aggregates in the upper soil layer of the Astragalus microcephalus community compared to the other communities. There was also a significantly higher proportion of soil present as micro-aggregates in the upper soil layer in the Astragalus microcephalus and Prangus uloptera communities compared to Pterpyrum aucheri. There was no significant difference between micro- and macro-aggregates in the lower soil layer between plant communities. We suggest that, in conservation projects based on higher carbon sequestration, managers should identify the plant communities which can add higher carbon contents to soil and try to extend such communities.","Carbon sequestration; Grassland; Plant composition; Soil organic carbon; Vegetation type","Aggregates; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Conservation; Forestry; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Soil conservation; Vegetation; Carbon sequestration; Grassland; Plant composition; Soil organic carbon; Vegetation type; Soils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009127127

Existing studies (Devine- Wright & Howes, 2010; Anderson, 2013) have investigated the ways in which representations of diverse forms of place change are anchored and objectified symbolically based on existing social representations of place. These studies have shown that the degree of fit between representations of place and proposed place change can be seen to inform community responses to different developments. There is however, a dearth of research investigating the symbolic fit of power line projects amongst existing representations of the English countryside, despite the fact that such projects are both highly controversial and key to ensuring delivery of low-carbon energy policy targets. This paper thus sought to explore social representations of a proposed power line development in Southwest England and their symbolic fit with representations of nearby countryside areas, given the increased deployment of lowcarbon energy infrastructure in this locale. Five focus groups were conducted with residents of a town in North Somerset, to highlight residents' co-constructed place and project-based social representations. Findings from thematic data analysis suggest that those representing the nearby countryside as replete with existing grid infrastructure objectified the power line proposal as an acceptable and 'familiar' form of place change. Conversely, those representing the countryside as 'natural' tended to objectify the proposal as industrialising this locale, objecting to it on this basis. This study reveals the utility of adopting Social Representations Theory to understand responses to proposed energy infrastructure developments given the UK low carbon transition, and suggests that grid companies could enhance acceptance by seeking to minimise the 'industrial' nature of such projects. © 2016 The Authors.","Focus group interviews; NIMBYism; Power lines; Social representations; Symbolic fit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000624314

A new mathematical programming based approach is employed to obtain the desired number of feasible, unique and space-filling samples. We then approximate the black-box function by kriging function and apply trust region based ε-exact method to converge to a local optimal solution.

This may serve as an inoculum when fresh manure is subsequently added, thereby increasing methane (CH4) emissions. Previous pilot-scale studies have shown that completely emptying storages can decrease CH4 emissions; however, no farm-scale studies have been conducted to quantify the effect of sludge removal. In this study, a commercial dairy farm removed as much manure and sludge from their concrete storage as possible in the fall (~2% by volume remained). Emissions of CH4 were measured during the following winter, spring, and summer, and compared with emissions measured the preceding 2 yr when most of the sludge had not been removed (~14% of tank volume remained). Emissions were measured using a micrometeorological technique, utilizing open-path CH4 lasers. Contrary to what was hypothesized, removing the majority of sludge in fall did not delay the onset of CH4 emissions and did not decrease emissions the following summer. In fact, annual CH4 emissions were ~16% higher. It is possible that fall removal provided sufficient time for microbial dynamics to be restored before the following summer when emissions were high. Future farm-scale research should examine the effect of spring (rather than fall) emptying for on-farm CH4 mitigation in both concrete tanks and earthen storages. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"Concrete tanks; Concretes; Manures; Methane; Dairy manures; Land applications; Liquid manure; Methane emissions; Microbial dynamics; Micrometeorological techniques; Pilot-scale study; Sludge removal; Fertilizers; methane; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; absorption lag time; air temperature; Article; dairy cattle; lagoon; manure; microbial community; nonhuman; sludge; spring; storage; summer; winter; dairying; sewage; Carbon Dioxide; Dairying; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006373164

However, the spatiotemporal relationships between this region's ice cover and North American climate are not particularly well understood. This study employs a synoptic climatological weather typing scheme known as the Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) to holistically evaluate temperature and moisture characteristics throughout the terrestrial North American Arctic (NAA) associated with the Western Arctic sea ice freezeup dates from 1979 to 2013. Monthly climatologies and linear trends of autumn/winter-dominant SSC weather types in the region, Moist Polar (MP) and Dry Polar (DP), are assessed and statistically linked to the freeze dates. Results suggest that the MP weather types are increasing, at the expense of DP types, across much of the domain. The apparent NAA transition to MP conditions is positively correlated with the timing of the Western Arctic freeze-up, and far more MP days occur during late-freeze versus early-freeze years, especially at the most northerly weather stations. Positive near-surface temperature anomalies and northerly low-level winds across the Western Arctic Ocean during late minus early freeze years potentially connect delayed ice for mation to a changing NAA climate. © Inter-Research 2016.","Freeze-up; Sea ice; Spatial Synoptic Classification; Weather typing; Western Arctic","air temperature; ice cover; sea ice; seasonal variation; surface temperature; temperature anomaly; troposphere; Arctic Ocean; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961837990

This research assessed achievements and challenges in California's four largest regions in advancing sustainability goals through transportation-land use planning integration under S.B. 375. On the basis of an assessment of plan documents from before and after passage of the law, progress was assessed for four aspects of the planning process: development of performance objectives, land use projections, techniques for analyzing plan options, and implementation strategies for encouraging land uses that supported regional plan goals. The analysis indicates that post-S.B. 375 plans demonstrate advances in promoting sustainable transport, for example, in their budget allocations and in attaining performance metrics for location and transport efficiency.

Aspens (Populus spp.) are accepted as an agriculture energy crop with rotation period up to 5 years in Latvia since 2011. The research aim was to determine the productivity and removals of CO2 in a hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. x P.tremuloides Michx.) plantation during the 5 years rotation period after managing the plantation as an agroforestry system together with perennial crops - reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), festulolium (x Festulolium pabulare) and fodder galega (Galega orientalis Lam.), as intercrop, and fertilized with biogas production residues (30 tonnes·ha-1), wastewater sludge (10 tonnesDM·ha-1) and wood ash (6 tonnesDM·ha-1). The most important impact on the plantation's productivity has selection of the clone, although relevant impact on the tree growth was observed for fertilizer application and the type of intercrop. The most significant impact on the growth of the most productive clone No 4 demonstrated fertilization with biogas production residues and waste water sludge - 0.3-4.2 fresh tonnes of additional biomass compared to control without intercrop and without fertilizer. Comparing different intercrops, the best results were obtained with galega and red canary grass - 3.3 and 3.7 fresh tonnes of biomass higher stock in comparison to control unfertilized plots. The best combination was clone No 4 fertilized with wastewater sludge or biogas fermentation residues in combination with reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) intercrop - 16.4 fresh tonnes of biomass (42 MWh of primary energy per hectare) or 16.5 tonnes·ha-1 of CO2 removed in above ground biomass (8.5 tonnesDM·ha-1).

The reservoir was modelled using GEM, an advanced general equation-of-state compositional simulator. Vertical and multi-lateral CBM development plans were proposed and the cumulative gas production and gas production rates were estimated. Finally, a standard discounted cash flow analysis was performed. It was found that the vertical and multi-lateral CBM plans would yield positive NPV's - US$ 12,148,498 (IRR - 28.35%) and US$ 11,250,167 (IRR - 27.39%) respectively - only at the west field. Financial analysis showed that none of the alternatives are feasible at the east field. It can be concluded that the vertical CBM development plan with higher IRR (28.35%) would be the best alternative for the west field considering the technical difficulties in drilling operations and much higher capital investment in the multi-lateral CBM development plan. By this way emissions of 2.57 MMtCO2e would be avoided over a 20-year period based on the fact that the coal will be mined and the resulting methane will be liberated. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","CBM; CBM economics; Coal bed methane; GEM; Ghg emissions; Methane; Reservoir modelling","Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Economics; Equations of state; Gas industry; Gems; Investments; Compositional simulators; Cumulative gas productions; Development strategies; General equation of state; GHG emission; Pre-feasibility studies; Reservoir modelling; Technical difficulties; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986238242

The simulators’ platform, sIMfLOR was recently created to implement different growth models with a common philosophy. The objective was developing one easily-updatable, user-friendly, forest management and climate change sensitive simulator capable of projecting growth for the main tree species in Portugal. Area of the study: Portugal. Material and methods: The new simulator was programmed in a modular form consisting of several modules. The growth module integrates different forest growth and yield models (empirical and process-based) for the main wood production tree species in Portugal (eucalypt, stone pine and maritime pine), the management module drives the growth projections along the planning horizon according to a range of forest management approaches and climate (at present only available for eucalypt). Main results: The main result is the StandsSIM-MD Management Driven simulator that overcomes the limitations of the existing stand level simulators. It is a step forward when compared to the models currently available in the sIMfLOR platform covering more tree species, stand structures and stand compositions. It is focused on end-users and it is based on similar concepts regarding the creation of required inputs and generated outputs. Research highlights: — Forest Management Driven simulations approach — Multiple Prescriptions-Per-Stand functionality — StandsSIM-MD can be used to support landowners decisions on stand Forest management — StandsSIM-MD simulations at regional level can be combined with optimization routines. © 2016 INIA.","Forest management; Forest Management Approaches; Forest simulator; StandsSIM-MD",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978795435

We investigated the effects of long-term experimental warming on plant growth (leaf length) and reproduction (inflorescence height, reproductive phenology and reproductive effort) using 17-19 years of measurements collected as part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) at sites near Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska. During the study period, linear regressions indicated non-significant tendencies towards warming air temperatures at our study sites. Results of our meta-analyses on the effect size of experimental warming (calculated as Hedges' d) indicated species generally responded to warming by increasing inflorescence height, increasing leaf length and flowering earlier, while reproductive effort did not respond consistently. Using weighted least-squares regressions on effect sizes, we found a significant trend towards dampened response to experimental warming over time for reproductive phenology. This tendency was consistent, though non-significant, across all traits. A separate analysis revealed significant trends towards reduced responses to experimental warming during warmer summers for all traits.We therefore propose that tendencies towards dampened plant responses to experimental warming over time are the result of regional warming. These results show that Arctic plants are capable of sustained responses to warming over long periods of time but also suggest that, as the region continues to warm, factors such as nutrient availability, competition and herbivory will become more limiting to plant growth and reproduction than temperature. © 2016 R.T.

Furthermore, these energy systems help reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to the environment and decrease their impact on climate change. However, there are certain limitations that justify the use of a diesel generator in these systems, such as: i) to backup electricity during peak hours; ii) to support the systems in periods with low levels of solar radiation and wind speeds; and iii) to reduce the cost of electricity (COE) of the system. The aim of this paper is to propose the design of a Hybrid Electric System (HES) to supply the energy demand of a rural parish placed on the Ecuadorian coast. The feasibility analysis, constitutive elements of the system, and adjust variables are computed and presented using the computational tool HOMER. This study is carried out considering the meteorological data obtained from the selected place, and two different prices for the diesel, i.e., subsidized and non-subsidized by the state, are considered. Additionally, technical and economic details of the proposed HES are presented.","Feasibility analysis; HOMER; Hybrid electric system; Renewable energies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995665371

Among such alternatives, acetylene has proved to be a better fuel for internal combustion engines due to its low cost, easy availability and excellent combustion characteristics. Compared to other fuels, acetylene emits less carbon, which plays a major role in environmental degradation. However, the desired alternative fuel must be safe and also readily usable in existing engines without any significant modifications. It is proposed in the present work that acetylene is safe and have all the key qualities an alternative fuel should have; which is ascertained by testing the fuel on a compression ignition engine with minor design modifications. A diesel engine with a subsidiary mixing box for a homogeneous mixture of air and acetylene was selected first. The experiments were conducted with consistent acetylene flow rates from 0.1 Lit/min to 5 Lit/min with an increase of O.S Lit/min in every step. The engine was tested at various loads, keeping track of combustion performance parameters to find out optimum fuel flow rates and also to have reduced emissions. The results show that the performance characteristics of the acetylene-enriched engine is nearer to the pure diesel engine with reduced emissions. It is concluded that acetylene could be the better alternative fuel without compromising brake thermal efficiency and safe operation with a moderate increment of smoke and NOx. Exhaust gas recirculation technique is implemented to safely get NOx exhaled off the engine to acceptable limits.","Acetylene; Carbon monooxide; Carbondioxide; Combustion; EGR; Hydrocarbon; NOx","Acetylene; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Internal combustion engines; Lighting; Nitrogen oxides; Brake thermal efficiency; Combustion characteristics; Combustion performance; Compression ignition engine; Emission characteristics; Environmental friendliness; Exhaust gas recirculation techniques; Performance characteristics; Alternative fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994246412

CA adoption in the Middle-East is low compared to other regions. Lack of knowledge on CA practices and systems discourages farmers from giving up ploughing. The main reason why farmers in the Middle-East have begun to apply the no-till system has been the cost reduction in fuel, labor and machinery required for land preparation. Soil and water conservation concerns do not appear to be the main drivers in the Middle-Eastern farmers' decision to adopt or not to adopt CA. The adoption and uptake of CA by Middle Eastern farmers has been slow but it is nonetheless occurring gradually. Collection of information and research parameters related to agricultural practices are needed for designing a suitable soil and water conservation program for sustainable production intensification. Governmental policy encouraging the adoption and spread of CA systems in the Middle-East region is certainly a necessary condition for uptake. The objective of this article is to review the current status of adoption and spread of CA in the Middle-East, focusing mainly on Syria and Lebanon, and the potential beneficial consequences that can be harnessed through CA systems under rainfed conditions in both countries.

In the sensing studies, classical and quantum molecular dynamics simulations are used to relax graphene with grain boundaries deposited on amorphous SiO2. Electronic structure calculations show how this graphene is locally doped by the substrate and adsorbed molecules, while electronic transport modelling reveals that the doping can lead to synchronous opening and closing of local electron transport channels, resulting in a very large observed sensitivity. In the catalysis studies, electronic structure calculations combined with ab initio molecular dynamics uncover that the metallic character and high d-electron density of molybdenum-terminated MoS2 edges and EMIM-ion delivery are responsible for the observed superior CO2 reduction performance, with a high current density and low ~54 mV overpotential. The described mechanisms open up new pathways for the design of nanometer-scale highly sensitive chemical detectors and the development of inexpensive systems of CO2 conversion to energy-rich products. These studies illustrate how hybrid modeling techniques can explain complex transport phenomena in nanostructures. © 2016.","Carbon dioxyde reduction; Grain boundaries; Molybdenum disulphide; Transport channels",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963617826

Ionic liquids and conventional available KHIs (polymers) perform poorly at high subcooling and extended shut-in conditions. Thus, it's necessary to understand the inhibition mechanism and performance of mix kinetic inhibitors for gas hydrate mitigation in oil and gas transmission lines. In this work, the synergic kinetic inhibition effect of 1-Ethyl-3-methy-limidazolium chloride (EMIM-Cl) + Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the induction time and gas uptake during carbon dioxide (CO2) gas hydrate formation is reported. The study was performed in a high pressure sapphire cell at a pressure and temperature of 36 Bar and 1 oC respectively using an isochoric constant cooling method. Result suggests that, the induction time of deionized water + carbon dioxide hydrate increased over 100% in the presence of pure EMIM-Cl and PVP, with PVP slightly higher than EMIM-Cl comparatively.

Box: 146, Zanzibar, Tanzania","The linkages between ecosystem conditions and disaster risk reduction have gained increasing international attention. Despite this growing awareness, national and local decision makers often lack the tools to visualize disaster risk under different ecosystem conditions. As a result, the importance of ecosystems continues to be under-appreciated in decision-making processes related to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. While spatial models have commonly been applied in both ecological assessments and disaster management, there have been relatively few studies that merge these two applications. This chapter demonstrates applications of the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) tool in data-deficient countries where the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is currently implementing ecosystem-based field interventions to reduce disaster risk. InVEST software (developed by the Natural Capital Project) provides spatial tools for assessing ecosystems and disaster risk even when limited data is available. The first study presented in this chapter takes into consideration the role of coastal and marine ecosystems in reducing exposure to coastal hazards in a small municipality in the south of Haiti. It provides an example of a qualitative assessment of exposure to storm surges and coastal flooding under different ecosystem management scenarios. The second study examines realistic land use change scenarios such as reforestation and urbanization and their impacts on soil erosion and sedimentation in a river basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Through detailed examination of the two case studies, this chapter aims to demonstrate how integrated models such as InVEST could function as decision-support tools for considering ecosystem-based solutions for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The limitations, challenges and areas for improvement of each model application, as well as implications for local decision-making and awareness-raising, are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Coastal exposure; Disaster risk reduction; Eco-DRR; Ecosystem management; Erosion; GIS tool; ICZM; IWRM; Natural infrastructure; Scenario; Sedimentation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014046823

Improvements in thermal power generation efficiency will significantly contribute to the goals of reducing emissions and cost of electricity, thereby increasing their competitiveness. However, targeted high efficiency levels (e.g., 65% combined cycle power plant net efficiency) cannot be achieved with today's technology. One of the main difficulties is the appropriate distribution of technology challenges among various combined cycle equipment. Optimization of the early phases of innovation in the product development for future technologies is key for their sustainability and increased likelihood of economic success. For this purpose a combined cycle power plant initial design methodology was developed with the help of the Original Equipment Manufacturers, OEMs. As the main advantage, this approach is able to combine current OEM's state of the art in product technology with an educated guess for near future technology development. The application of the developed methodology is done on the exploration of the design parameters of new technologies to achieve 65% combined cycle power plant net efficiency. The results highlight the interdependence of the topping and bottoming cycle thermodynamic performance parameters and a large number of potential designs achieving 65% efficiency was identified. The technical realization of found thermodynamic performance parameters would be evaluated later in terms of their technological challenge and economic viability. In this respect the integrative combined cycle power plant optimization methodology is the key to analyze existing limitations and explore new technologies in order to constantly increase the value for power plant customers.

While there have been considerable advances in the derivation of a global urban mask using satellite information, the complexity of urban structures, the heterogeneity of materials, and the multiplicity of spectral properties have impeded the derivation of universal urban structural types (UST). Further, the variety of UST typologies severely limits the comparability of such studies and although a common and generic description of urban structures is an essential requirement for the universal mapping of urban structures, such a standard scheme is still lacking. More recently, there have been two developments in urban mapping that have the potential for providing a standard approach: the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme (used by the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools project) and the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) methodology by JRC. In this paper the LCZ scheme and the GHSL LABEL product were compared for selected cities. The comparison between both datasets revealed a good agreement at city and coarse scale, while the contingency at pixel scale was limited due to the mismatch in grid resolution and typology. At a 1 km scale, built-up as well as open and compact classes showed very good agreement in terms of correlation coefficient and mean absolute distance, spatial pattern, and radial distribution as a function of distance from town, which indicates that a decomposition relevant for modelling applications could be derived from both. On the other hand, specific problems were found for both datasets, which are discussed along with their general advantages and disadvantages as a standard for UST classification in urban remote sensing.","Global Human Settlement Layer; Local climate zones; LULC; Urban structure; Urban systems","Classification (of information); Mapping; Human settlements; Local climate; LULC; Urban structure; Urban systems; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979521163

The chapter also provides summaries and overview of climate change studies over the Italian territory. A calibrated and validated watershed model, soil and water assessment tool (SWAT ), was forced by the climate model outputs obtained from three dynamically downscaled regional climate models (RCMs ) to evaluate the recharge characteristics of the basin. During calibration, the watershed model was highly sensitivity to groundwater flow parameters. The climate change analysis from the three RCMs indicated that by the end of twenty-first century, rainfall will decrease up to 40 % in the dry period and there will be an increase in temperature that could reach as high as 3–5 °C. Moreover, the bias-corrected RCM outputs showed different results among models. Such variation of result calls for further investigation of model uncertainty. Groundwater recharge shows a decreasing trend as a response to changes in rainfall. However, as the timing of both precipitation and recharge is critical for future groundwater development in the basin, further analysis through different climate models, downscaling approach and groundwater modeling needs to be taken into account. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Central Italy; Climate change; Groundwater recharge; Regional climate models; SWAT; Tiber basin",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060376938

Mineral-based polymer-mortar composites (PMC) are often used as inexpensive promising materials to prevent the deterioration of constructions or remedy various reinforced concrete structures and they are used as materials for energy efficiency in buildings. In repair applications, polymer addition allows improving the adhesion properties of materials used in coating. With the intention of improving the sustainability of these composites, the influence of latex polymer and supplementary cementitious materials (natural pozzolan and silica fume) additions on the characteristics of these composites was investigated in aggressive media, such as acids. Mortars made with local pozzolanic mineral admixtures, obtained by substituting cement by different proportions of polymer (0, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15%) were conserved in acidic solutions for 56 days. The microstructural analysis of these mortars was performed, using the X-ray diffraction technique, after 56 days of exposure to acid attack. The obtained results enable to bring out the beneficial effect of adding a latex polymer and other pozzolanic additives into modified materials on resistance to acid attacks. So, these composite materials can be recommended as materials for energy efficiency in buildings. Because it improves the durability of building materials, leads to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, and reduces the unit cost of PMC composite production. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Energy efficiency; Energy-efficient building materials; Latex; PMC materials; Pozzolana; Silica fume; Sustainability","Acid resistance; Additives; Deterioration; Glass ceramics; Intelligent buildings; Latexes; Minerals; Mortar; Polymers; Reinforced concrete; Silica fume; Sustainable development; Different proportions; Energy efficiency in buildings; Energy efficient building; Microstructural analysis; Pozzolana; Pozzolanic additives; Supplementary cementitious material; X-ray diffraction techniques; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958214239

These parameters are commonly estimated on the basis of manual adjustments (expert tuning), which carries the risk of overtuning the parameters for a specific climate region or time period. This issue is particularly germane in the case of regional climate models (RCMs), which are often developed and used in one or a few geographical regions only. This study addresses the role of objective parameter calibration in this context. Using a previously developed objective calibration methodology, an RCM is calibrated over two regions (Europe and North America) and is used to investigate the transferability of the results. A total of eight different model parameters are calibrated, using a metamodel to account for parameter interactions. The study demonstrates that the calibration is effective in reducing model biases in both domains. For Europe, this concerns in particular a pronounced reduction of the summer warm bias and the associated overestimation of interannual temperature variability that have persisted through previous expert tuning efforts and are common in many global and regional climate models. The key process responsible for this improvement is an increased hydraulic conductivity. Higher hydraulic conductivity increases the water availability at the land surface and leads to increased evaporative cooling, stronger low cloud formation, and associated reduced incoming shortwave radiation. The calibrated parameter values are found to be almost identical for both domains; that is, the parameter calibration is transferable between the two regions. This is a promising result and indicates that models may be more universal than previously considered. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Europe; Geographic location/entity; Mathematical and statistical techniques; Model evaluation/performance; Models and modeling; North America; Optimization; Physical meteorology and climatology; Regional models; Soil moisture","Calibration; Evaporative cooling systems; Geographical regions; Hydraulic conductivity; Optimization; Risk perception; Soil moisture; Uncertainty analysis; Europe; Geographic location; Model evaluation/performance; North America; Regional model; Statistical techniques; Climate models; calibration; climate modeling; climatology; optimization; regional climate; soil moisture; statistical analysis; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957837278

One of the challenges of using RE sources is to handle its inherent uncertainty. In this paper, a RE powered cellular network is investigated. For a one-day operation cycle, the cellular network aims to reduce energy procurement costs from the smart grid by optimizing the amounts of energy procured from their locally deployed RE sources as well as from the smart grid. In addition to that, it aims to determine the extra amount of energy to be sold to the electrical grid at each time period. Chance constrained optimization is first proposed to deal with the randomness in the RE generation. Then, to make the optimization problem tractable, two well- know convex approximation methods, namely; Chernoff and Chebyshev based-approaches, are analyzed in details. Numerical results investigate the optimized energy procurement for various daily scenarios and compare between the performances of the employed convex approximation approaches. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Constrained optimization; Electric power transmission networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Wireless networks; Carbon dioxide emissions; Chance-constrained optimizations; Convex approximation; Convex approximation methods; Energy procurement; Optimization problems; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015407171

Since the introduction of stringent legislative targets in Europe as well as in the United States of America in late 20th Century, one of the viable options identified by the industry was the application of alternative powertrain. On the motorsport arena, changes introduced by the Formula 1 governing body (FIA) for the high-performance racing engines also focuses on fuel economy. FIA regulation for 2014 restricts the fuel-flow rate to a maximum of 100kg/hr beyond 10,500 rev/min and prescribe fuel flow rate below 10,500 rev/min operating conditions for the F1 Engines. In addition, Formula1 and Le Mans racing regulations actively promote the integration of the hybrid powertrain in order to achieve optimum fuel economy. Therefore, the aim of the present work is to evaluate available technology choices and measure efficiency in terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emission level. This technology mining exercise has been carried out using a powertrain simulation tool based on a mid-size light duty vehicle. The benchmark powertrain architecture for a light-duty vehicle is based on legislative drive cycle. The technologies tested on the drive cycles are also to be tested in a racing prototype car (LMP1), around a lap at Le Mans Circuit. This report presents a systematic methodology for assessing technology choices for racing vehicle using powertrain simulation tool. It presents a merit matrix based on fuel economy, drive cycle energy analysis, to evaluate the powertrain ability to harvest the available energy on a given drive cycle.

Drivetrain electrification represents one of the main measures for reducing the fuel consumption of passenger vehicles. Mild-hybridization based on a voltage level below 60 V is a promising alternative to cost-intensive high voltage powertrains. The objective of this study is to investigate the belt-driven starter/generator architecture for its CO 2 emission reduction potential within different driving cycles. In order to evaluate the CO 2 emission reduction potential resulting from 48 V mild-hybridization, a complete vehicle simulation model was built up. Key components like internal combustion engine and electric motor were parameterized with characteristic diagrams, representing the efficiency of each operating point. Different hybrid functions were implemented in the simulation model. The superior operation strategy was designed in dependence of the battery state of charge (SOC). This study shows the influence of different driving cycles, electric motors and transmission types on the CO 2 emissions, focusing on a 48 V P0 mild-hybrid vehicle. Additionally, the impacts of different hybrid functions on the emissions are shown. It was demonstrated that load shifting can have negative effects on the cumulated fuel consumption, depending on the given loss chain. Finally, deductions for the development of 48 V mild-hybrid systems are drawn. The identical vehicle without drivetrain electrification was selected as comparison base. © 2016, FISITA.

Inorganics that have objectionable odors such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3) are often found in high concentrations in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Typically, municipalities reduce these odors by adding chemicals that react with odor-causing compounds and by placing structural fabric covers on clarifiers and trickling filters. Some important odor/H2S management techniques at WWTPs include: (1) understanding process units, (2) bench-marking H2S levels through continuous, long-term, and ambient monitoring, (3) formulating source-receptor relationships through inverse-dispersion modeling, (4) ranking source strengths, and (5) optimizing source controls to reduce emissions from high priority sources. The purpose of this paper is to understand and bench-mark the ambient concentrations of H2S at various locations by employing continuous monitors. Hydrogen Sulfide monitoring is being conducted by using low range OdaLog H2S analyzers. The Maximum percentage (95.47%) of H2S concentration readings observed during the total monitoring period at all seven locations are found below 0.25 ppm, few readings (0.56%) were found in the range of 1 - 2 ppm. © 2016, Air and Waste Management Association.

However, no adequate information seems to be available on the current situation. This means there is a critical gap in research, policy framework and implementation in the country. Objective: The purpose of this paper was to synthesize evidence from a systematic situational analysis and needs assessment to help establish a hub for research and training on three major themes and their related policy frameworks: air pollution and health, occupational health and safety and climate change and health. Methods: The methods used in this work include a systematic review of secondary data from peer-reviewed literature, thesis reports from academia, government and national statistical reports. Limited primary data based on key informant interviews held with major stakeholders were also used as sources of data. Findings: Exposures to high levels of indoor and outdoor air pollutants were found to be major sources of public health challenges. Lack of occupational safety and health due to agricultural activities and exposure to industries was found to be substantial. Worse is the growing fear that climate change will pose increasingly significant multidimensional challenges to the environment and public health. Across all three areas of focus, there was a paucity of information on local scientific evidence. There is also very limited trained skilled manpower and physical infrastructure to monitor the environment and enforce regulatory guidelines. Research, policy frameworks and regulatory mechanisms were among the cross-cutting issues that needed urgent attention. Conclusions: Critical gaps were observed in research and training across the three themes. Also, there is a limitation in implementing the link between policy and related regulations in the environment and health.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009508215

The networks of air pollution governance rest on the premise of a hegemonic play of power and politics related to the ""social relations which make environmental degradation possible"" (Kanie & Haas, 2004). This paper examines and in turn questions the various theoretical traditions which initiate an enquiry into the power structures only to give rise to policies that reify the traditions of a liberal, capitalist state in which the government has a very limited role to play. Most of the studies in India have confined themselves to identifying health damages caused by air pollution and failed to address the structural issues which lie at the heart of policy making and governance. The limitations of these theoretical approaches encouraged us to look for alternatives to study this phenomenon within a larger social matrix. In this paper, we have made an attempt to explore the governance mechanism with manages the relationship between capitalism's (in) compatibility with the achievement of sustainability. We wish to illustrate how exploring the political economy of air pollution in India will help us identify the ways in which policies are designed to strengthen the existing power relations in an economy and how the existing power structure is reinforced through mechanisms that are formulated by the state in association with the private actors. The aim of this paper is to examine how the discussions about the environmental problem of air pollution can be rearticulated to include a deliberation about the rights of the urban poor who are being trampled in the process of building on the modern dream of an urbane India. Media, we think, can play a very effective role in bringing to light the disproportionate burden of costs that some social groups are forced to bear due to the process of industrialization and development which benefit other, more powerful groups (Keller, 2011). Whereas the political economy approach discusses about the power relationships which perpetuates inequalities in a society it also offer alternatives to resolve the issues. Treating the problem of air pollution as an 'environmental justice' issue where each member of the society is made to carry the burden of environmental violation has been identified as a solution as it will guarantee the weak their rights as citizens who have equal stake in claiming protection against environmental hazards. © 2016 Journal of Content, Community & Communication.","Air pollution in India; Issues network theory; Political economy; Regime approach; The role of media and environmental justice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049829146

Robust Decision Making (RDM) approaches are considered useful for supporting adaptation decision making, yet case study applications in developing countries are rare. This review paper examines the potential to expand the geographical and sectoral foci of RDM as part of the repertoire of approaches to support adaptation. We review adaptation decision problems hitherto relatively unexplored, for which RDM approaches may have value. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, suggest potential sectors for application and comment on future directions. We identify that data requirements, lack of examples of RDM in actual decision-making, limited applicability for surprise events, and resource constraints are likely to constrain successful application of RDM approaches in developing countries. We discuss opportunities for RDM approaches to address decision problems associated with urban socio-environmental and water-energy-food nexus issues, forest resources management, disaster risk management and conservation management issues. We examine potential entry points for RDM approaches through Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Environmental Assessments, which are relatively well established in decision making processes in many developing countries. We conclude that despite some barriers, and with modification, RDM approaches show potential for wider application in developing country contexts. © 2016 The Authors","Adaptation decision making; Barriers, opportunities and entry points; Developing countries; Robust decision making approaches; Uncertainty",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992217822

Less scholarly attention has been paid to how practitioners and academics work together to improve school climate. Purpose: We seek to deepen understanding of how educators and researchers collaborate to address aspects of the campus environment that matter to students' learning. We discuss findings from the first year of a long-term research alliance-between a university research center, a high school, and one of its feeder K-8 school districts-focused on improving school climate. First, we report results from our analysis of students' responses to a schoolwide survey. Then, we examine the affordances and challenges at every stage of the investigative process, highlighting factors critical to school-university research alliances. Research Design: We analyzed students' school climate survey responses in one low-income predominantly Latino high school (n=1,606). We linked students' survey data to their administrative records and employed logistic regression modeling to determine the extent to which students' school climate perceptions were associated to their educational outcomes. We also analyzed the cohort of students who matriculated to the high school from the nearby elementary school feeder district to see whether the middle-to-high-school transition shifted their views on the school environment. Findings: Males, students in Grade 11, and those with at least one suspension reported fewer positive experiences on campus relative to their peers. Also, the middle-to-high-school transition had a positive influence on students who reported low average perceptions of care in their middle school. Reflecting on the partnership process, we found that responding promptly to the concerns of stakeholders helped establish credibility and trust. Open and frequent communication was also essential to maintain focus, sustain commitment, and ensure the longevity of the alliance. Further, allowing partners to contribute and make decisions throughout the analysis helped ensure that all perspectives were considered, thus increasing the validity of research findings. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957551791

Rooftop and small-scale photovoltaic (PV) technology is a quickly growing sector of the distributed generation market. The array size chosen for a PV installation is one of the main factors affecting its ability to meet a building's electrical needs and reduce its operational emissions. The rooftop area available for placement of PV can be a constraint on the optimization of PV array size. If the optimal array area for a specific building is larger than the area available on the rooftop, optimization using demand-matching methods is not necessary. A new parameter EUI-R has been introduced to describe the building's annual electrical demand with respect to the building rooftop area. It is a decision-making tool presented to help a system designer choose whether to employ an optimization method or not in selecting a PV system. The EUI-R depends on 2 general parameters, building electric demand and building rooftop area, that should be easily accessible for any system designer. This paper presents an extended study of EUI-R applied to 10 commercial building types in 3 different climate zones throughout the U.S. These cities are characterized by different latitudes and varying amounts of available solar radiation. The results show a linear dependency between optimal PV size obtained with a simple demand-matching algorithm, and building rooftop area, applicable to any building type. Any distributed energy technology serving a single building should be sized based on the specific conditions unique to the building, including electric demand and physical space available. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Decision making; Electric energy storage; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Geothermal energy; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Commercial building; Decision making tool; Distributed energies; Electricity generation; Linear dependency; Matching algorithm; Optimization method; Photovoltaic technology; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002328228

In the present paper, we discuss some of the climate or meteorological factors affecting air pollution in Tehran. Tehran is a unique megacity in terms of geographic setting, being mountainous and an ever-expanding urban area that suffers from acute air pollution and heat waves episodes. Recent records of air pollutants also show increased trends with some low-frequency variability caused by chaotic atmospheric motions. Moreover, the wind speed has also decreased as a result of the aerodynamic surface roughness increase and probably the decrease in the passage of cyclones over the mid-latitudes according to the recent findings. Mixed-layer height over the city, due to higher-surface heat fluxes (mainly due to the reduction in surface albedo, anthropogenic heat, and lower green spaces), is expected to increase; although it is favorable for reduction in some air pollutants such as CO, it is not eligible for ozone. Finally, an integrated framework for actions regarding impacts, emissions, urban climate change, and monitoring including adaptation and mitigation towards a climate-change resilient city is proposed. © 2016 Sharif University of Technology.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the monetary aspect of socio-economic acceptability of four sustainable green technologies development: green electricity, energy savings in residential buildings, smart meters and alternative fuel vehicles. We obtained information on willingness to pay, and/or willingness to accept, for such technologies from a sample of 35 papers taken from the literature. We homogenize this information computing an implicit price of a Kg of CO2 avoided, named PCO2. A qualitative analysis is carried out to explain the households' attitude to avoid CO2 in monetary terms. Results show that on average PCO2 is positive. There are, however, some negative attitudes only in the case of alternative fuel vehicles. In conclusion, empirical results show that households have a favorable attitude toward sustainable green technologies, but further research is desirable to design new policies to make the future of the sustainable society more plausible. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

We evaluated the community structure and carbon sequestration potential of mangroves in Maasim, Sarangani Province using distribution and diversity indices and allometric equations. A total of 1129 mangrove individuals growing in different habits were inventoried. Five species were identified, namely: Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora apiculata, Avicennia marina, and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. R. mucronata was the most dense (RD = 76.88%) and most frequent (RF = 44.53%) species in the area, but S. alba dominated (RO = 91.36%) in terms of basal area and was also the most important species (IV = 49.08%). The forest has low to moderate diversity (H' = 0.715) and evenness (E = 0.444) with only two equally abundant species (ENS = 2.044). In terms of aboveground carbon density, S. alba was significantly greater in amount (446.275 Mg C ha-1) compared to the other species. Zone-wise, seaward stored most of the carbon mass amounting to 241.527 Mg C ha-1. Overall, the total aboveground carbon stock in the mangrove forest was 15.130 Gg, which is equivalent to 55.526 Gt of CO2. In conclusion, S. alba showed high potential of sequestering atmospheric carbon among the mangrove species identified. Meanwhile, the high forest aboveground carbon density implies high carbon sequestration activity. However, this could also mean huge amounts of carbon to be released back to the atmosphere if the forest is disturbed by human activities.","Allometric equation; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Diversity index; Mangrove","abundance; allometry; basal area; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; community composition; diversity index; frequency dependence; mangrove; population density; Philippines; Sarangani; SOCCSKSARGEN; Avicennia marina; Bruguiera gymnorhiza; Rhizophora apiculata; Rhizophora mucronata; Rhizophoraceae; Sonneratia alba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042394595

However, these restrictions do not apply to cold engine operation. To determine the cold engine emission difference from when it has reached the operation temperature, an experiment was carried out on a car Volkswagen Golf 4, equipped with a sparkignition engine. Petrol with 5 % bioethanol blend that complies with the Latvian laws was used in the experiment. The aim of the study was to determine the amount of exhaust gases emitted during automobile engine warm up in urban driving conditions. It was found during the experiments, that the amount of toxic gas CO for the car Volkswagen Golf 4, driving with a cold engine, is by 41 % more than using the automobile at the operating temperature, but the amount of HC is by 200 ppm more, and if the distance is less than 3 kilometres, then it would be preferable to find an alternative way to travel, because this travelled distance is where the toxic pollution from emission gases is the highest.","Cold engine; Exhaust gases; Toxic emissions","Automobile engines; Automobiles; Engines; Gases; Laws and legislation; Regional planning; Sports; Temperature; Automobile exhaust gas; Driving conditions; Engine operations; Neutralization systems; Operating temperature; Operation temperature; Toxic emissions; Vehicle emission; Exhaust gases; carbon monoxide; engine; exhaust emission; experimental study; neutralization; petroleum; pollutant source; traffic emission; transport vehicle; warming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976560591

In the present paper, the development, implementation, verification, and exemplary application of a new thermal-hygric model for solving building-climatic challenging planning tasks is presented. The use of thermal insulation in buildings under hot climatic conditions, for energy saving in summer, has been verified in southern climates and the implementation into a user-friendly software, named CLIMT (Climate-Indoor-Moisture-Temperature) is shown. For the model calibration, a case study in Germany was chosen, in which interior and exterior temperature and relative humidity values were measured. Even though the building shows the peculiarity of an irregular user behavior, very good accordance between measured and calculated values could be achieved. In a further step, the application of the developed program CLIMT is demonstrated by means of a specific example: the hygrothermal optimization of a church building design, located in a hot humid climatic zone (Latakia, Syria). As part of this design, several challenging boundary conditions had to be considered. Besides specific building physical and building climatic requirements (high humidity and high temperatures), also structural requirements had to be taken into account. Furthermore, the new church building had to assimilate with the historically grown environment and the specific building typology traditions of the region. The optimized building design, facilitating a damage-free operation and low building energy consumption, is presented in detail and essential optimization steps are discussed. The represented model allows for a simplification of building climatic design, even in challenging southern climate conditions, through the implementation of a user-friendly software and is therefore particularly suitable for use in architectural planning offices. © 2016 Amer.

The transposition of the sustainable and atom-efficient strategy of water oxidation to in vitro controlled biocatalytic reactions is poorly studied but is of high interest for the development of photobiocatalysis, and eco-friendly catalytic tools in a wider sense. Here we demonstrate that light-driven oxidation of water catalysed by vanadium-doped TiO2 (V-TiO2), a re-usable photocatalyst, can provide the electrons that lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) need to oxidatively deconstruct biomass polysaccharides. The demonstration that electrons may be generated by water oxidation alleviates the need for an externally added electron donor, which so far has been a prerequisite for LPMO activity. Importantly, photocatalytic LPMO activation was achieved in the absence of redox mediators, which represents the first demonstration of mediator-free electron transfer from V-TiO2 particles to a redox enzyme, expanding the repertoire of known and conceivable photobiocatalytic reactions. Fundamentally, this photobiocatalytic system allows activation and tight control of LPMO activity, thus offering new tools for mechanistic studies of these industrially important and ubiquitous enzymes. The latter is illustrated by real-time studies of the redox state of an LPMO, using the controllable light-V-TiO2 technology for LPMO reduction and a novel fluorescence method for monitoring re-oxidation. We also show that the light-V-TiO2 technology may be used to study pre-activation of LPMOs. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989169815

The formation of soot and gaseous aerosol precursors inside the combustor and during gas expansion in turbine stages and nozzles must be addressed before the real impact of aircraft engines with respect to particulate matter emissions can be assessed. To design strategies to reduce particulate matter emissions, the development of a zero-/one-dimensional gas-turbine model is proposed, taking into account combustor and postcombustor flow operating over the landing/takeoff cycles with a detailed kerosene jet-A1 kinetics scheme, including a soot-dynamics model. This approach is very efficient computationally and may be clearly satisfying for parametric studies or in a predesign step. First, the model's predictive capacity for capturing the main features of gasturbine combustion as well as the expansion of combustion products in the turbine and nozzle has appeared acceptable as concentrations of International Civil Aviation Organization standard emissions and sulfur-species conversion agree reasonably well with measurements, whatever the operating conditions. In particular, the results showed that SO3 and H2SO4 concentrations still exhibited variations in the postcombustor zone until exiting the engine nozzle. Using a revised surface-growth mechanism combined with the condensation of six major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has significantly improved predictions of computed particles diameters. Such values now agree very closely with experimental data collected over the landing/takeoff cycle, whereas the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as ethylene and benzene, were better predicted for the highest power setting (i.e., takeoff and climb configurations). © Copyright 2015 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The deformed pseudorock sample is translucent and is used to represent a geomaterial mimic, with the EML emission generated in response to dynamic loading of the embedded nanoparticle sensors. In this work, we focus on the evaluation of EML nanoparticles and the use of pseudorocks, mimics of geomaterials, for deformation analysis. Typically, such experiments collect sparsely distributed data, often collated from post-experiment analysis. Within this research MoAl2O3:Eu EML nanoparticles were incorporated within an epoxy thermoset resin with mechanical properties analogous to rocks. A mixing ratio of 1:200 nanoparticle/resin (by weight) has been found to yield optimal emission while retaining sample translucence and a 1:5 mixing ratio yields maximum emission with a reduction in translucence. The inclusion of the EML nanoparticles within the epoxy resin significantly alters the mechanical properties of the sample, with the lowest nanoparticle ratio (0.5% by weight) producing a brittle sample prone to rapid failure/fragmentation. The highest nanoparticle ratio (20% by weight) exhibits higher yield strain with little or no sign of brittle fracture, more representative of sandstone (geomaterial) under triaxial load. This paper will introduce nanoparticle sensing and expand on the potential of EML for pseudorock deformation monitoring. A summary of the fabrication process and experimental procedure used to observe the stress conditions within a luminescent nanoparticle-polymer resin mixture under uniaxial load conditions are also presented. Emission spectra for MoAl2O3:Eu samples mixed at 20% by weight are presented, with emission peaks consistently observed at ∼520 nm for a uniaxial load up to 4.9 MPa.

On one hand, better infrastructure and modern hardware allow for a more e-cient usage of electric resources. On the other hand, data-centers can be powered by renewable sources (green energy) that are both environmental friendly and economically convenient. In this paper, we tackle the problem of targeting the usage of green energy to minimize the expenditure of running multi-center Web search engines, i.e., systems composed by multiple, geographically remote, computing facilities. We propose a mathematical model to minimize the operational costs of multi-center Web search engines by exploiting renewable energies whenever available at different locations. Using this model, we design an algorithm which decides what fraction of the incoming query load arriving into one processing facility must be forwarded to be processed at different sites to use green energy sources. We experiment using real tra-c from a large search engine and we compare our model against state of the art baselines for query forwarding. Our experimental results show that the proposed solution maintains an high query throughput, while reducing by up to ∼25% the energy operational costs of multi-center search engines. Additionally, our algorithm can reduce the brown energy consumption by almost 6% when energy-proportional servers are employed.","Green energy; Query forwarding; Web search engines","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Costs; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Information retrieval; Search engines; Websites; World Wide Web; Carbon dioxide emissions; Computing facilities; Electricity-consumption; Environmental-friendly; Green energy; Green energy sources; Processing facilities; Query forwarding; Green computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980359804

Recycled materials used in the reconstruction and expansion of an urban, 2.4 kilometer (1.5 mile) stretch of the highway included fly ash, recycled concrete aggregate, recycled asphalt shingles and recycled asphalt pavement. In addition to assessing the benefits of recycled material use, the RMRC used this project to better determine a methodology for gathering input data for a LCA and a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) using PaLATE program. PaLATE is a spreadsheet-based LCA/LCCA tool was used to conduct the analyses for the Beltline case study. In past case studies looking at LCA/LCCA of recycled materials use, the RMRC was unable to utilize LCA and LCCA technology without significant assumptions for the program’s inputs. The Beltline project offered a unique opportunity to develop a method for data collection that reduces assumptions for the analyses. The actual design with recycled material use was compared to a reference design using only virgin materials. Results show that the actual design reduced environmental impacts over the highway’s lifetime in all criteria, including energy use (13% reduction), water consumption (12% reduction) and CO2 emissions (13% reduction). The LCCA showed overall economic savings of approximately $250,000 (10% savings). These results suggest that incorporating recycled materials improves the sustainability of road construction. The knowledge gained from this project will set the precedent for future analyses of department of transportation projects that use recycled materials. © 2016 International Committee of the SCMT conferences.

Development of Urban Underground Space has been accelerating rapidly in many major cities. Pressures of a changing global environment, including climate and increasingly limited land availability, place Urban Underground Space on the top of the innovative urban development agenda. However a strategy for an alternative to surface urban growth has not yet been duly elaborated or even discussed. This paper will explore plausible transitions in the use of underground space, discussing (1) changes in housing and infrastructure demand, and energy consumption over the next decades; (2) the functional, spatial and technological changes in Urban Underground Space; (3) the potential for Urban Underground Space to mitigate climate change by significantly reducing energy consumption and providing alternative locations for facilities at risk from climate change effects; (4) the status of Urban Underground Space as public space and an additional valuable spatial asset.

Nevertheless, uncertainties in particular regarding the representation of contrail microphysics still remain. Properties of young contrail cirrus differ from those of natural cirrus due to the large ice crystal number concentration common in contrails. Consequently, microphysical process rates in contrail cirrus, which control its lifetime, can be very different to those in natural cirrus. We extend a contrail cirrus scheme within a climate model by implementing a microphysical two-moment scheme and study the life cycle of a contrail cirrus cluster. In an idealized experiment we study the properties and microphysical process rates of a contrail cirrus cluster in a large and long-lived ice supersaturated region. We find that at flight level contrail cirrus display their typical high ice crystal number concentration (of about 10-100 cm-3) for a few hours with far lower densities in lower levels caused by sedimentation. After about 7 h contrail cirrus have spread considerably so that even at flight level associated ice crystal number concentrations have dropped to values that prohibit fast relaxation of ice supersaturation. The reduced ice crystal number and the resulting limited water uptake in the contrail cirrus limit the lifetime of the contrail cirrus cluster to about 10 h even though surrounding conditions would be still favorable for contrail cirrus persistence. In our case studies, contrail cirrus resembles natural cirrus regarding their ice crystal number concentration and size after 5-7 h. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

As almost all these phenomena take place in narrow zone close to the gas chamber (GC) contact with initial (cold) oil, it seems evident that an adequate spatial representation of complex physics required special efforts. Typically the reservoir simulation models are built on numerical grid with cell sizes making impossible accurate description of heat and mass transport at the edge of the GC. Along with this outside this zone this typical grid can be acceptable. The adaptive grid refinement (AGR) may offer a compromise solution if the numerical model accepts the necessary degree of refinement. In our current work, we present a methodology of field-scale numerical simulations for solvent-Assisted thermal recovery of heavy oil using AGR. Comparison is performed between oil production mechanisms interaction for typical Athabasca bitumen and for different discretization size. In many cases a choice of trigger variable was critical. The numerical performance including the CPU time analysis is presented in some detail.,Hybrid steam-solvent or solvent-based thermal recovery methods for heavy oils become interesting and important, and have recently been field-Tested.

Now, more than 80 percent of their food and water are brought in, making them vulnerable to socioeconomic and climatic stressors. Our research approach takes a long-term perspective that includes documenting the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and community perception, as well as collecting environmental, archaeological, and paleoclimate data. Our research indicates that during the historical period Barbudans developed a socio-ecological strategy that enabled them to be successfully resilient to ecological disturbances and live sustainably within the context of their island. We call this socio-ecological strategy “sustainable resilience.” This strategy is not functioning now and islanders are increasingly vulnerable.

In many parts of the world, research attention has focused on the engagement of the general public. We suggest that studies also need to focus on key stakeholders in the government and non-governmental sectors who participate in adaptation planning processes, so that a better understanding may be achieved of the distinct knowledge cultures that influence their engagement with climate change. Indonesia is a key actor in climate adaptation because of the potentially dire consequences for its population's livelihoods and well-being. In this paper we consider whether 'climate knowledge cultures' exist amongst stakeholders at multiple organisational levels in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) Province, Eastern Indonesia. Surveys were conducted with 124 stakeholders from differing levels at the beginning of four multi-stakeholder climate adaptation workshops. Questions elicited perceptions of their region's challenges, observation and awareness of climate change, feelings they associated with climate change, beliefs regarding causes, risks and preparedness for climate change, and timeframes they associated with the future. Across all levels, climate change ranked highest as the first challenge participants identified, followed by food security, but well-being ranked highest when the top three challenges were combined. Most participants believed climate change was happening, but those working at higher organisational levels were more likely to attribute climate change to human factors whereas those at lower levels were more likely to think it was a natural phenomenon. Women were in greater agreement and more optimistic than men about current government policies to cope with climate change. Perceptions differed between sub-districts, reflecting NTB's climatic diversity. We note that although climate change is an issue of concern among NTB stakeholders, the potential privileging of some knowledge cultures may lead to its association with cultural and political elitism. <sp>Second, climate change needs to be viewed alongside the myriad other challenges facing NTB, some of which have greater perceived immediacy. This analysis highlights the need for planning that can accommodate and integrate the diverse knowledge cultures and adaptation objectives that exist at multiple levels. © 2015 The Authors.","Beliefs; Climate engagement; Knowledge; Organisations; Stakeholder; Values",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950267272

The controller is designed in order to maintain a balance between production and consumption of nitrite by AOB and NOB microorganisms respectively. Thus, accumulation of nitrite is prevented and AOB denitrification, the main N2O producer, is drastically slowed down. The controller is designed to adjust the oxygen supply according to a measured parameter which typically indicates the ratio of the activity of NOB over AOB. The controller is tested on a benchmark simulation model describing the production of N2O during both AOB denitrification and HB denitrification. Comparisons between simulation results of open-loop and closed-loop have revealed the potential of the controller to significantly reduce the amount of N2O emitted (approximately 35%). On the other side, this reduction of N2O was accompanied by an increase in the aeration costs. Moreover, a plant performance evaluation under dynamic disturbances shows that the effluent quality is compromised due to higher requirements of organic carbon by denitrifying heterotrophs. The controller can therefore be considered effective for the reduction of N2O production by AOB but would need to be coupled with a secondary control strategy ensuring a complete oxidation of the nitrogen oxides by heterotrophs to have a good effluent quality. © 2016","autotrophic denitrification; benchmark; fuzzy-logic; nitrogen; nitrous oxide emission; wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)","Benchmarking; Computer circuits; Denitrification; Effluents; Fuzzy logic; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Oxygen supply; Quality control; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Water treatment plants; Autotrophic denitrification; Fuzzy logic approach; Fuzzy logic controllers; Microbial communities; Nitrous oxide emissions; Production and consumption; Simulation environment; Wastewater treatment plants; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991037507

A qualitative approach based on semi-structured interviews, life stories and focus group discussions has been used for data collection. The historical and comprehensive method enabled to establish a relationship between populations&#39; perceptions and beliefs and their endogenous strategies of adaptation. The populations notice an extension of the dry season at the expenses of the rainy season, advanced deterioration of vegetation, of the drying up of the sources of water supply (rivers, backwaters and wells), and disappearance of some wild animals like elephant and hyena and of some plant species used by sculptors and traditional healers. The survey also shows that populations&#39; adaptation strategies are mainly based on local traditional beliefs and knowledge which are at the same time a barrier and an opportunity for the adaptation to climate variability.

The first example is the Vaskiluodon Voima concept where in a high efficiency 560 MWthcoal fired supercritical PC boiler 140 MWth fuel power is substituted by producer gas coming from a CFB gasifier. The fuel fed to gasifier is a mixture of various kind of biomass, like saw dust, forest residues, bark, shredded stumps, uncontaminated waste wood, etc. By this concept the operability of the existing power plant is not affected and the high steam parameters could be kept without problems of corrosion and fouling. The gasifier has been operating successful for over 23 000 hours with an availability of over 97% managing to substitute up to 40% of the fossil fuel on annual basis. The emissions clearly improved as well, CO content dropped, SOx emissions were reduced and the NOx emissions dropped by 30%, though the original PC boiler was already designed as Low-NOx boiler. The second successful CFB gasification project is the Kymijärvi II plant in Lahti, were SRF (solid recovered fuels) with a biogenic part of 50% is gasified to produce a gas that is then cleaned and combusted in a dedicated gas fired boiler at high steam parameters (540°C and 120 bar). Using this concept efficiency from waste as a fuel can be achieved, yielding out of 160 MW fuel input 50 MWel and 90 MW district heat. The gasifier has been operating successful for over 25 000 hours. In the future the Lahti concept could also be applied in the same manor to existing boilers to utilized existing infrastructure, gain advantages of high steam parameters in combination with the use of waste and low investment costs. © 2016 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Biomass; Gasification; Industrial scale applications; Municipal solid waste",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019720079

The study demonstrates that community perceptions of temperature and precipitation trends as indicators of climate variability are in agreement with meteorologically observed trends.

As a result of many years of practice, a large number of municipal waste landfills has been created where landfill gas has been generated. Landfill gas, which is essentially methane (50- 55%), and CO2 (40-45%) (both green-house gases), have a great environmental impact which can be reduced by using landfill gas in cogeneration plants to produce energy. The aim of this paper is to determine economic and environmental benefits from such energy production. For that purpose, the database of cogeneration potentials of 51 landfills in Serbia was created. Amount of landfill gas generated at each municipal landfill was calculated by applying a first order decay equation which requires the data about solid waste production and composition and about some landfill characteristics. For all landfills, which have over 100,000 m3 each, a techno-economic analysis about building a combined heat and power plant was conducted. The results have shown, that the total investment in 14 combined heat and power plants with payback period of less than 7 years amounts 11,721,288 €. The total nominal power of these plants is 7 MW of electrical power and 7.9 MW of thermal power, and an average payback period is about 61 months. In addition, using landfill biogas as energy source in proposed plants would reduce methane emission for 161,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year.","Combined heat and power; Green energy; Landfill gas; Methane emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991573858

In this context, we relate to risks that imply the growth of pollution, especially against nuisance air pollution increase (CO, SO2, NO etc.) with major implications on the growth of greenhouse effect, the melting of the ice fields, respectively the pollution of the soil with nitrates from fertilizers intensively used in agriculture. Our study is up-to-date, as pursuant to the ONU Conference from Paris (France 2015, Conference on Climate Changes), they reached an agreement and the adopted text admits the menace of climate modifications is far more important than previously acknowledged and engages the participants to reduce their pollutant emissions. The researchers' current concerns focus on studying the effects of the redistribution of financial resources obtained by practising the 'green' fiscal policy on dependent variables. Observing them, we integrate the respective variables into complex models analysed by multiple regression (both standard and robust) and the fixed effects panel on 20 European countries which also reflect the different effects on the environmental policy and the expenses it incurred. The main purpose of the analysis we aim to accomplish is the impact of the policy for environment expenditure tenable within the European framework on against nuisance air pollution attenuation. The statistical analysis aims at identifying these effects by means of regression equations (OLS), robust regression (M method), fixed and random effects, using panel data from 18 EU countries, as well as Switzerland and Turkey due to their position in relation to the community block; we will analyse the period between 1995-2013. Further to the application of multiple regression statistical methods (OLS and robust M), our results show that teimiqgdp expenses played a major role in the reduction of carbon monoxide. These are the total investments made in the mining sector; when these expenses were raised by 1% of the GDP value, there was a decrease of 11 628.3 thousand tons Cot at the level of the European countries analysed, according to the result of the OLS analysis, based on the robust M estimation.","Air quality; Environment expenditure; Environmental policy; European framework; Green tax; Pollution reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967205738

The interaction between local biotic and abiotic factors and global climate patterns will influence species responses to climate change. Salix arctica (Arctic willow) is a structuring species, ubiquitous and widespread, and as such is one of the most important shrub species in the High Arctic. In this study, we measured S. arctica reproductive effort, early establishment, survival and growth in the Zackenberg valley, north-east Greenland. We sampled four plant communities that varied with respect to snow conditions, soil moisture, nutrient content and plant composition. We found large variability in reproductive effort and success with total catkin density ranging from 0.6 to 66 catkins/m2 and seedling density from B1 to 101 seedlings/m2. There were also major differences in crown area increment (4-23 cm2/year) and stem radial growth (40-74 μm/year). The snowbed community, which experienced a recent reduction in snow cover, supported young populations with high reproductive effort, establishment and growth. Soil nutrient content and herbivore activity apparently did not strongly constrain plant reproduction and growth, but competition by Cassiope tetragona and low soil moisture may inhibit performance. Our results show that local environmental factors, such as snow accumulation, have a significant impact on tundra plant response to climate change and will affect the understanding of regional vegetation response to climate change. © 2016 N.

They showed deep, repeated transits that were attributed to a giant exosphere of neutral hydrogen. The low radiation pressure from the M-dwarf host star was shown to play a major role in the dynamics of the escaping gas and its dispersion within a large volume around the planet. Yet by itself it cannot explain the specific time-variable spectral features detected in each transit. Here we investigate the combined role of radiative braking and stellar wind interactions using numerical simulations with the EVaporating Exoplanet code (EVE) and we derive atmospheric and stellar properties through the direct comparison of simulated and observed spectra. The first epoch of observations is difficult to interpret because of the lack of out-of-transit data. In contrast, the results of our simulations match the observations obtained in 2013 and 2014 well. The sharp early ingresses observed in these epochs come from the abrasion of the planetary coma by the stellar wind. Spectra observed at later times during the transit can be produced by a dual exosphere of planetary neutrals (escaped from the upper atmosphere of the planet) and neutralized protons (created by charge-exchange with the stellar wind). We find similar properties at both epochs for the planetary escape rate (~2.5 × 108 g s-1), the stellar photoionization rate (~2 × 10-5 s-1), the stellar wind bulk velocity (~85 km s-1), and its kinetic dispersion velocity (~10 km s-1, corresponding to a kinetic temperature of 12 000 K). We also find high velocities for the escaping gas (~50-60 km s-1) that may indicate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves that dissipate in the upper atmosphere and drive the planetary outflow. In 2014 the high density of the stellar wind (~3 × 103 cm-3) led to the formation of an exospheric tail that was mainly composed of neutralized protons and produced a stable absorption signature during and after the transit. The observations of GJ 436 b allow for the first time to clearly separate the contributions of radiation pressure and stellar wind and to probe the regions of the exosphere shaped by each mechanism. The overall shape of the cloud, which is constant over time, is caused by the stability of the stellar emission and the planetary mass loss, while the local changes in the cloud structure can be interpreted as variations in the density of the stellar wind. © ESO, 2016.","Planets and satellites: atmospheres; Stars: individual: GJ 436","Charge transfer; Digital storage; Dispersion (waves); Interplanetary flight; Ionosphere; Magnetohydrodynamics; Pressure; Satellites; Upper atmosphere; Absorption signature; Kinetic dispersion; Kinetic temperatures; Magnetohydrodynamic waves; Photoionization rate; Planets and satellites: atmospheres; Radiation pressure; Stars: individual: GJ 436; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976498512

WRF is used as a regional climate model (RCM) to dynamically downscale reanalysis fields to compare values of SPI over drought timescales that have implications for agriculture and water resources planning. The regional climate generated by WRF has the largest improvement over reanalysis for SPI correlation with observations as the drought timescale increases. This suggests that dynamically downscaled fields may be more reliable than larger-scale fields for water resource applications (e.g., water storage within reservoirs). WRF improves the timing and intensity of moderate to extreme wet and dry periods, even in regions with homogenous terrain. This study also examines changes in SPI from the extreme drought of 1988 and three ""drought busting"" tropical storms. Each of those events illustrates the importance of using downscaling to resolve the spatial extent of droughts. The analysis of the ""drought busting"" tropical storms demonstrates that while the impact of these storms on ending prolonged droughts is improved by the RCM relative to the reanalysis, it remains underestimated. These results illustrate the importance and some limitations of using RCMs to project drought. © 2016 Jared H. Bowden et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963851643

Global carbon levels are increasing and cities require to show plans to tackle and reduce the amount of carbon which they are emitting. At present carbon emissions in urban areas are calculated rather than measured. In some cities where industrial activity is not carbon intensive, the major contributors are the burning of fuel for heating and the emissions from vehicles. Air quality levels have a direct impact on human health and cities are under increased pressure to demonstrate plans to control and reduce levels of air pollution. Of great importance is the way in which emissions, both carbon rich emissions and pollutants, disperse in a city environment.

A possible way forward is the deployment of ecosystem-scale translocation (EST), where above- and below-ground elements of a functioning terrestrial ecosystem (including vegetation and topsoil) are carefully collected and moved together. Small-scale attempts at such practice have been made for the purpose of ecological restoration. By moving larger subsets of functioning ecosystems from climatically unstable regions to more stable ones, EST could provide a practical means to conserve mature and complex ecosystems threatened by climate change. However, there are a number of challenges associated with EST in the context of climate change mitigation, in particular the choice of donor and receptor sites. With the aim of fostering discussion and debate about the EST concept, we 1) outline the possible promises and pitfalls of EST in mitigating the impact of climate change on terrestrial biodiversity and 2) use a GIS-based approach to illustrate how potential source and receptor sites, where EST could be trialed and evaluated globally, could be identified. © 2016 Boyer S et al.",,"biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; endangered species; environmental management; gene rearrangement; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964649314

The DFB and DBR grating regions are 2.55 mm- and 1.28 mm-long, respectively, for a total grating length of 5.1 mm. The lasers are designed to operate in a symmetric longitudinal mode by causing resonant coupling of the guided optical mode to the antisymmetric surface-plasmon modes of the 2nd-order metal/semiconductor grating. In turn, the antisymmetric longitudinal modes are strongly absorbed by the metal in the grating, causing the symmetric longitudinal mode to be favored to lase, which produces a single lobe beam over a grating duty-cycle range of 36-41 %.

The systems utilized the latest flexible injection technology and are controlled with a balanced algorithm including unit load, a full grid of continuous furnace temperatures and the plant continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS). Early this year, Fuel Tech and Doosan conducted another demonstration of ASNCR on a 105MWn unit in the UK firing a Russian coal blend. This demonstration provided encouraging results and showed the value of low-capital high-performance NOx reduction on an aging asset. Additional work is planned for the remainder of the year at this facility, including further testing and application of ASNCR on a second unit. Significantly, the commercial installation and startup of five large (645MWe) ASNCR systems is nearing completion at Drax Station in the UK. Unit 4 at Drax Station fires a blend of coals and controls the emission of NOx using a suite of technologies including low-NOx burners (LNB), over-fired air (OFA), combustion optimization software, and urea-based Advanced SNCR. Fuel Tech has more installed SNCR applications than any other technology supplier, with more than 590 units firing all types of fossil, biomass, and industrial fuels. These systems are currently installed and operating on units ranging in size from small industrial furnaces to some of the largest utility boilers in the world. Over the last 16 years, Fuel Tech has completed more than 50 installations on units larger than 400MW, where the majority of these units are larger than 600MW. Large units pose a particularly difficult challenge to SNCR emission control systems, as these modern units generally have higher furnace exit gas temperatures, incorporate low-NOx burners, over-fired air and have very low baseline NOX emissions. Each of these factors can potentially limit the effectiveness of SNCR. Fuel Tech uses the most advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and chemical kinetics modeling to design sophisticated injection strategies that anticipate varying load and fuel conditions in the furnace. The analysis is translated into engineering systems that incorporate numerous injector types to deliver the reagent as effectively as possible. The target injection zone varies based on temperature, NOx baseline, CO concentration and furnace residence time. CFD modeling is required to accurately predict these shifts in the target region. Recent systems have achieved more than 35% NOx reduction from low baseline furnaces that already utilize primary control measures such as LNB and OFA.

As the issue has drawn the public's ire, Congress, the President, and the Department of Defense have responded by calling for and implementing aggressive measures to curb military sexual assaults and punish offenders. These are laudable goals. But, in their eagerness to solve this complex problem, the Executive and Legislative Branches have created another problem: in the military justice system, an accused's due process rights have been compromised to ensure increased and expedited convictions.

Part II explains the framework for analyzing cases and the climate in which they are prosecuted. Part III explores overarching features of the military justice system that are particularly problematic in the context of sexual assault prosecutions before turning to the distinct inequities facing an accused in the current pretrial, trial, and sentencing phases of a court-martial.

It captures and makes conveniently available a very high proportion of solar radiation, over 90%, dwarfing the efficiency of photo voltaic panels (PV). The original technology is extremely sustainable requiring almost no maintenance, offering long term production with a life expectancy of several decades. Over the years, John has obtained several patents for his inventions, the last one awarded in December 2014. These patents reflect the continuous development of new technologies, new solutions built around the SW. Today SW offers solutions combining PV and thermal energy capture, or systems that may work to provide heating in the cold season and cooling in the warm season. All of the technologies are very cost effective. The case concerns possible agribusiness applications of one or more of the technology solutions developed by Conserval Engineering: the case users have been retained by John - thanks to their knowledge of agribusiness in their own country - to suggest possible applications of these technologies to local agribusiness industry. Mr Hollick has agreed to share a recent proposal (2010) to apply one of these technologies to solve the energy requirements of Food in Italy, while providing a significant carbon footprint reduction. He thinks that the analysis of this proposal and the material presented in the appendices will provide an opportunity to reflect on the potential of his technology and on the complex nature of the decision making process, and on some distortions resulting from public subsidies to some but not all sustainable technologies. That notwithstanding, the reflection on the first part of the case should reflect on the multiple gains that can be achieved with the adoption of these technologies in the specific local context. So, the case users armed with their reflections, their knowledge of agribusiness in their own country, and the short and essential description of the different technologies offered by Conserval Engineering, are asked to provide an illustration of what they consider the most promising applications to their own country's agribusiness industry. Yes, the case does not provide actual costs of the different technologies, other than for the proposal to Food in Italy. At the same time the case users can certainly provide a qualitative perspective, based on the fact that these are the most advanced and cost effective technologies in the solar thermal industry.

This was also a key step toward realizing the Company's plan, at Group level, to reduce the flaring of associated gas and greenhouse-gas emissions, on operated sites. Ofon is an offshore field that came on stream in 1997, and is located some 180 kilometers from Port Harcourt (about 65 kilometers from shoreline), South of Nigeria, in 40 meters of water depth. It is operated by Total E&amp;P Nigeria Limited in a Joint Venture agreement with NNPC having 60%ownership and Total 40%. In its first phase, all associated gas was flared with minor fuel gas usage. Main objectives of OFON 2 projects are: y Stop routine flaring by the end of 2014, y Increase oil reserves and production from 25 to 65 kbopd, y Monetize gas through the Nigeria LNG plant and Domgas via Amenam facility, y Inject water to repressurize the reservoirs to ensure good sweep efficiency and increase oil recovery. The Company's flare down objective in Ofon field was achieved on 15th December 2014, accounting for an immediate 10%cut in the overall volume of gas flared by the Group's Exploration &amp; Production activities. The start-up of Ofon Phase 2 had made it possible to avoid the flaring of one million standard cubic meters of gas per day under normal operating conditions. This reduction in gas flaring is estimated to have led to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 80ktCO2 equivalent to less than 8ktCO2 equivalent in the Ofon field. The project has also complied with Nigerian law of zero-flaring in oil and gas facilities. The Company is by this singular effort actively implementing the World Bank's initiative to eliminate all routine flaring of associated gas by 2030. As part of the Ofon phase 2 project, the new 70 kilometers pipeline had made it possible to pipe the gas to the OML 99 Amenam offshore gas hub, from where it is exported to the Nigeria LNG Plant at Bonny. A further 24 new wells scheduled to be drilled on Ofon field will make possible to market 3 million cubic meters of gas per day. Other significant achievements by this project include improved waste heat recovery and produced water management as well as the high level of local content in engineering and fabrication of the facilities including the Living Quarters built almost exclusively by local contractors for the first time ever in Nigeria. All activities have been conducted with the highest demand on safety and respect for the environment. Project achieved outstanding performances with more than 4.1 millions man-hours offshore without LTI including 1.5 million man-hours in SIMOPS.

The hydroelectric infrastructures in the Durance and Verdon valleys contribute to the supply of water and renewable energy across the region and foster territorial development. Water resources are under a high level of pressure due to significant abstractions for various water uses (irrigation, hydropower, drinking water, industrial use, and recreational activities) and the need to maintain ecological services. The hydropower reservoir is managed to reconcile the needs resulting from all forms of water use and the safety of individuals and property. Electricité de France actively invests in coordinated efforts with all water stakeholders to determine shared action programs for the benefit of all water users, the river, and its ecosystems. The effects of climate stress and the evolution of demographic and socioeconomic territories on water resources and water demand requires the development of adaptation strategies. Among the strategies for climate change adaptation used in the Durance-Verdon river basin are the R2D2 2050 project, the value creation methodology, and water-saving agreements.

A rate-based absorber model is presented to investigate the reactive capture of CO2 using aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) as a solvent, integrating a predictive molecular-based equation of state: SAFT-VR SW (Statistical Associating Fluid Theory-Variable Range, Square Well). A distinctive physical approach is adopted to model the chemical equilibria inherent in the process. This eliminates the need to consider reaction products explicitly and greatly reduces the amount of experimental data required to model the absorber compared to the more commonly employed chemical approaches. The predictive capabilities of the absorber model are analyzed for profiles from 10 pilot plant runs by considering two scenarios: (i) no pilot-plant data are used in the model development; (ii) only a limited set of pilot-plant data are used. Within the first scenario, the mass fraction of CO2 in the clean gas is underestimated in all but one of the cases, indicating that a best-case performance of the solvent can be obtained with this predictive approach. Within the second scenario a single parameter is estimated based on data from a single pilot plant run to correct for the dramatic changes in the diffusivity of CO2 in the reactive solvent. This parameter is found to be transferable for a broad range of operating conditions. A sensitivity analysis is then conducted, and the liquid viscosity and diffusivity are found to be key properties for the prediction of the composition profiles. The temperature and composition profiles are sensitive to thermodynamic properties that correspond to major sources of heat generation or dissipation. The proposed modelling framework can be used as an early assessment of solvents to aid in narrowing the search space, and can help in determining target solvents for experiments and more detailed modelling. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994200699

From a simple analytical model, we derive an equation linking net imports of cement and steel to local and foreign demand along with carbon price. We then econometrically estimate this relation both with ARIMA regression and Prais-Winsten estimation, finding that local and foreign demand are robust drivers of trade flows. We find no significant effect of the carbon price on net imports of steel and cement.

For feedback control, information of the current position and velocity of the armature are necessary. In mass production applications, however, position sensors are unavailable due to cost and fabrication reasons. Thus, position estimation by measuring merely electrical quantities is a key enabler for advanced control, and, hence, for efficient and robust operation of digital valves in advanced hydraulic applications. The work presented here addresses the problem of state estimation, i.e., position and velocity of the armature, by sole use of electrical measurements. The considered devices typically exhibit nonlinear and very fast dynamics, which makes observer design a challenging task. In view of the presence of parameter uncertainty and possible modeling inaccuracy, the robustness properties of sliding mode observation techniques are deployed here. The focus is on error convergence in the presence of several sources for modeling uncertainty and inaccuracy. Furthermore, the cyclic operation of switching solenoids is exploited to iteratively correct a critical parameter by taking into account the norm of the observation error of past switching cycles of the process. A thorough discussion on real-world experimental results highlights the usefulness of the proposed state observation approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001950403

Relative to its gross value (A5 billion), the northern beef industry is responsible for a sizable proportion of national reportable GHG emissions (8-10%) through enteric methane, savanna burning, vegetation clearing and land degradation. The industry occupies large areas of land and has the potential to impact the carbon cycle by sequestering carbon or reducing carbon loss. Furthermore, much of the industry is currently not achieving its productivity potential, which suggests that there are opportunities to improve the emissions intensity of beef production. Improving the industry's GHG emissions performance is important for its environmental reputation and may benefit individual businesses through improved production efficiency and revenue from the carbon economy. The Climate Clever Beef initiative collaborated with beef businesses in six regions across northern Australia to better understand the links between GHG emissions and carbon stocks, land condition, herd productivity and profitability. The current performance of businesses was measured and alternate management options were identified and evaluated. Opportunities to participate in the carbon economy through the Australian Government's Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) were also assessed. The initiative achieved significant producer engagement and collaboration resulting in practice change by 78 people from 35 businesses, managing more than 1272000ha and 132000 cattle. Carbon farming opportunities were identified that could improve both business performance and emissions intensity. However, these opportunities were not without significant risks, trade-offs and limitations particularly in relation to business scale, and uncertainty in carbon price and the response of soil and vegetation carbon sequestration to management.

The measurement techniques to eliminate ohmic drop are based on the reduction of the distance between reference electrode and structure (local or fixed reference electrode, Luggin capillary and potential probes) or on the interruption of the circulating current (ON-OFF technique in impressed current CP systems). Laboratory tests were carried out on cathodically protected carbon steel specimens in order to evaluate the effectiveness of ON-OFF potential technique for the assessment of CP condition. The limitations of the OFF-potential measurement are discussed: the technique is not reliable in overprotection condition, with the risk to underestimate the problems involved in overprotected buried pipes (cathodic disbonding, hydrogen embrittlement of susceptible steels, AC-induced corrosion).

An alternative approach to IR cameras to locate and quantify these leaks is a continuous concentration sensor network. The OpenFOAM toolkit was used to create numerical solvers for gas transport model and source definition. OpenFoam is capable of reading in both steady-state and transient wind fields, and diffusivity. The volumetric emission rate was also defined for each cell and taken as the emission characterization parameters. Different source types and locations can be considered as cell combinations, thus, both the scalar transport modeling time and the number of emission parameters increase as the mesh is refined. Total runtime to reach convergence for emissions characterization is affected by mesh discretization, even when scalar transport run time increase is considered.

The integration of user-centered design, social innovation, portable devices, and sensors may have a role in influencing people's choices and consumption patterns. The paper presents two ongoing works that investigate, design and develop tools for valuing people's positive behaviors and rewarding choices in the domain of mobility and energy. The objective of such tools is both to raise people's awareness and to engage it into a collaborative environment, in order to meet a common set of targets. The strategy adopted in both the cases is based on linking ""bottom-up"" with ""top-down"" approach, i.e. by making people to behave and to make choices coordinately with decision maker's (i.e. the Public Administration or the Administrator of the system) objectives. The first regards Opti-LOG, a project co-funded by Regione Lombardia under the Smart Cities and Communities program, which concerns last-mile delivery with low emission and zero emission vehicles. The second case regards Sharing Cities, a H2020 project that includes a pilot project in the Municipality of Milano, where the focus is on citizen engagement and behaviors in the domains of personal mobility and energy.

Also, for barges LNG could be an interesting alternative, since the emission regulations for barges are even stricter than for seagoing vessels. Hence there is also a need for LNG facilities capable of distributing relatively small quantities of LNG. For that reason Gate terminal together with the Port of Rotterdam Authority decided to construct a small scale LNG loading facility, adjacent to the existing gate LNG import terminal. LNG carriers are treated as ""regular ships"" carrying dangerous cargo in the Port of Rotterdam and the paper briefly describes the Rotterdam standards regarding LNG transport. For this project a new port basin is created (the Yukonhaven) with a new quay wall. The quay wall can be used by one seagoing LNG tanker up to 180 m and smaller vessels as short as a barge of 50 m of length. According to the SIGTTO (the Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators) guidelines a dedicated LNG basin is developed instead of a jetty parallel to the channel with ongoing ship traffic. The basin lay-out has been studied using a full mission bridge simulator with the involvement of local pilots and tug masters. In addition, state-of-the-art mooring simulations were performed which included the effect of passing vessels in the channel. The new quay wall is the first of a new standard design for Rotterdam quay walls, but with some specific LNG adaptations. The combination of seagoing vessels and inland vessels on the same berth causes challenges, especially the demand by SIGTTO for energy absorbing fenders and the European ADN safety demands for escape routes for the inland barges (see references). ADN requires small stepping distances from barges to shore. For this project the PIANC (Permanent International Association of Navigation Congresses) ""Guideline for the Design of Fenders Systems: 2002"" is not longer followed on mooring angles and velocities, but results from a large international PIANC organized (MarCom Working Group 145) monitoring campaign are used to design smaller fenders meeting all requirements. In addition, finite element (FEM) calculations were performed to verify the hull strength of the moored vessels and to be able to neglect the allowable hull pressure stated in the PIANC 2002. © 2016 ASCE.",,"Air pollution control; Barges; Carbon; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Facilities; Fenders (boat); Fossil fuels; Hulls (ship); Jack-up rigs; Liquefied natural gas; Mooring; Natural gas transportation; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Quay walls; Sailing vessels; Ships; Waterway transportation; Carbon foot prints; Dangerous cargos; Emission regulation; International Association; Loading facilities; Port of Rotterdam; Sea-going vessels; Terminal operators; Tankers (ships)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984650442

Recent comfort theories have acknowledged the interaction between people and their surrounding environment. BS15251 and TM52 have suggested a methodology that addresses comfort and overheating in naturally ventilated buildings. However, criteria need to be easily applied, overheating should be easily quantifiable. This paper looks at the criteria from CIBSE TM 52 and discusses their applicability to a typical archetype located in a set of cities in Europe. This follows work assessing the energy performance and thermal comfort of dwellings for morphed climates for the year 2020, 2050 and 2080. However, there are a set of variables that can significantly modify the results of an overheating assessment. In particular, the occupancy profile can significantly influence criterion 1 of TM 52 because it is couched in terms of occupied hours. Likewise, criterion 2 due to its weighted calculations on a daily basis is deemed to be difficult to apply. There is a danger that simplifications are made and criterion 1 prevails as the sole criterion to apply. A clear set of profiles may minimize this deficiency. An attempt to suggest a weekly profile for criterion 2 is also discussed. © 2016 NCEUB.

As such, it is important for a landfill lifetime model to properly reflect the manner in which biogas is managed. The goal of this research is to compare landfill biogas management in a conventional landfill with a bioreactor landfill during a 100-year time horizon. This comparison concentrates on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions balances and electricity generation potential from recovered biogas using reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE), which leads to avoiding GHG emissions due to fossil fuel displacement. The results estimated that the total amount of GHG emissions released to atmosphere, including fugitive methane emissions and the avoided effect of electrical energy production, was 668 and 803 kg carbon dioxide (CO2 ) equivalents (CO2E) per metric ton (t) of landfilled MSW for the conventional and the bioreactor landfill, respectively. This study underscores the importance of installing an aggressive gas collection system early for bioreactor landfills, and for investigating methods of improving gas collection efficiency during active landfilling. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The city and its stakeholders implemented initial stages of HDR's sustainable return on investment (SROI) approach to identify and communicate the value of additional benefits that could be realized from several dozen strategies and project types. The initial stage of this analysis involved identifying benefit categories in terms of the triple bottom line: financial, environmental, and social outcomes. Then, each benefit category, respectively, was further defined by key drivers of value. Next, the degree to which each strategy and project type could actually generate each type of benefit was assessed. This process ultimately led to an initial ranking of project options in terms of potential relative value. Some of the categories of benefits associated with green storm water infrastructure investments and other actions included habitat improvements, increased local water supply, greenhouse gas emission reductions, improved public health, and improved recreational opportunities. The connection between a stormwater management strategy and benefit category was characterized, depending largely on available information, in one of four ways. Monetizable: stormwater management strategies that are likely to generate the highest value would have monetizable benefits. The value of specific strategies would be derived from available peer reviewed studies. Measurable: strategies that generate measurable, but not monetizable, benefits are likely to generate comparatively lesser degree of value than monetizable ones. In this case, engineering design and studies may be able to quantify tangible impacts, but economic literature has not been sufficiently developed to assess value for that scale or type of project outcome. Potential: this scale of benefits characterizes project outcomes that are less clear and more speculative. These benefits have no peer reviewed studies showing that they were observed from implementation of the strategy in a quantifiable manner, but judgment and accepted theory suggested the benefits would be likely to occur. Not-applicable: benefits that no peer reviewed studies showed occurring from implementation of the strategy, and judgment and accepted theory suggested would be unlikely to occur. At this initial stage of analysis, the value of each stormwater management strategy was characterized in terms of the number of benefits that could be generated by the strategy and the degree to which they could generate monetizable value. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Emission control; Engineering geology; Greenhouse gases; Project management; Sewage; Storm sewers; Storms; Water pollution; Water quality; Water supply; Ancillary benefits; Comprehensive benefit; Economic valuation; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; San Diego , California; Storm-water managements; Triple Bottom Line; Water quality improvements; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050464344

Most current LIBS studies employ the fundamental Nd:YAG laser output at 1.064 μm, which has extremely low eye-damage threshold. In this work, comparative LWIR-LIBS emissions studies using traditional 1.064 μm pumping and eye-safe laser wavelength at 1.574 μm were performed on several energetic materials for applications in chemical, biological, and explosive (CBE) sensing.

However, the long-held idea that freshwater forcing, caused by massive iceberg discharges, was the driving force behind these changes has been questioned in recent years. This throws into doubt the abundant literature on modelling abrupt climate change through ""hosing"" experiments, whereby the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is interrupted by an injection of freshwater to the North Atlantic: if some, or all, abrupt climate change was not driven by freshwater input, could its character have been very different than the typical hosed experiments? Here, we describe spontaneous, unhosed oscillations in AMOC strength that occur in a global coupled ocean-atmosphere model when integrated under a particular background climate state. We compare these unhosed oscillations to hosed oscillations under a range of background climate states in order to examine how the global imprint of AMOC variations depends on whether or not they result from external freshwater input. Our comparison includes surface air temperature, precipitation, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the intermediate-depth ocean, and marine export production. The results show that the background climate state has a significant impact on the character of the freshwater-forced AMOC interruptions in this model, with particularly marked variations in tropical precipitation and in the North Pacific circulation. Despite these differences, the first-order patterns of response to AMOC interruptions are quite consistent among all simulations, implying that the ocean-sea ice-atmosphere dynamics associated with an AMOC weakening dominate the global response, regardless of whether or not freshwater input is the cause. Nonetheless, freshwater addition leads to a more complete shutdown of the AMOC than occurs in the unhosed oscillations, with amplified global impacts, evocative of Heinrich stadials. In addition, freshwater inputs can directly impact the strength of other polar haloclines, particularly that of the Southern Ocean, to which freshwater can be transported relatively quickly after injection in the North Atlantic. © Author(s) 2016.

Innovative urban vehicle concepts can contribute to an efficient utilization of infrastructure and energy. In contrary, mobility and transport demand of users may restrict the usability of these vehicle size classes due to limited space and driving range. These characteristics can be experienced as disadvantages in comparison with standard passenger cars. In this context, the present study discusses pros and cons of selected innovative vehicle types as a part of new and smart urban mobility concepts. In a first step, the present publication points to the potential of new small and lightweight vehicle concepts for urban traffic, based on the determination of representative real-user mobility scenarios and transportation demands. For that purpose, multimodal mobility scenarios have been created, integrating city cars and public transport to achieve comprehensive mobility solutions. In a second step, the energy demand, CO 2 equivalent emission and parking space reduction potential is simulated for different scenarios. A comparison of a conventional vehicle fleet and selected innovative multimodal mobility scenarios highlights the potential of new vehicle and mobility concepts for urban individual transport. Focus is put on the reduction of space requirements, energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, the application of small city car concepts driven by alternative propulsion systems is discussed. Considering requirements of future traffic scenarios in congested areas and prospective customer demands, the present study includes an evaluation of several system approaches and vehicle technologies for urban mobility. It highlights potentials regarding energy, GHG emissions and space reduction under consideration of real user’s mobility scenarios. In this way, the study treats a comparison of various mobility solutions over the entire life cycle under the boundary conditions of different kinds of urban usage profiles and it points to the CO 2 reduction potentials and limits of diverse mobility technologies. © 2016, FISITA.

Three OekoTube ESPs were thereby tested during the heating seasons 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 at different sites with rather old respectively high-PM-emission wood burning devices. Before installing the ESPs at the field testing sites they were checked in the lab regarding functionality and precipitation efficiency. The evaluation of the plant monitoring data collected during the field tests revealed high seasonal ESP availabilities between 80.2% and 97.7%. Dedicated test runs with emission measurements at the different testing sites showed high precipitation efficiencies which were well comparable with those gained during preceding lab-tests. Based on these results it can be concluded, that ESP models like the Oeko Tube are suitable as retrofit units in old appliances and have due to their high availability and particle precipitation efficiency the potential to contribute to a significant reduction of particulate matter emissions from old residential wood burning systems. © 2016 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Gas cleaning; Particle emission; Small scale application",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019673183

Hence, climate adaptation in cities is necessary to improve their resilience against climate change impacts and to secure their sustainability, quality of life and economic strength. Urban planners, practitioners and decision-makers require knowledge about the effectiveness of city-scale climate adaptation measures to prioritise their options for action and to push forward the political process for the implementation of climate adaptation strategies in cities. The Deutscher Wetterdienst's new Information Portal for Climate Adaptation in Cities, INKAS, enables its users to assess and compare the quantitative effect of different adaptation measures for varying degrees of implementation. The impact of different climate adaptation measures designed to reduce summertime air temperatures in cities is systematically investigated by means of the urban climate modelling of idealised cities. INKAS is based on about 2000 urban climate simulations of various combinations of nine urban settlement types typical for Germany and of four urban surrounding countrysides. The simplified assumptions of idealised cities with typical urban settlement types simulated with the 3-dimensional urban climate model MUKLIMO-3 increases the transferability of complex urban interrelations to local decision-makers and urban planners.

This could be seen as a strategy to fight against the challenges of future food security. In 2014, Indonesia established climate change adaptation policies. This legislation aims to pave the way for making actions on climate change adaptation mainstream in national and local development planning. Public and private finance have supported the implementation of the climate actions. However, most funding is still used for mitigation. Adaptation finance needs support, especially in agriculture. This research paper studies opportunities for microfinance to play a role together with existing resources in supporting climate change adaptation in Indonesia. The data was acquired and analysed through a literature review, analysis of case studies and interviews with stakeholders in the climate change-related financial sector. The central findings regarding the opportunity for microfinance to contribute to the existing schemes in Indonesian climate change adaptation finance for agriculture are worthy of the result. This study found that adaptation finance is mostly used for indirect activities. Meanwhile, local communities, and farmers in particular, need directly targeted measures to adapt to climate change. An alternative approach is providing microfinance, insurance and capacity development for farmers to produce high quality agricultural products. This would contribute to optimizing the agri-food value chain, which supports socio-economic development of stakeholders, especially farmers. Hence, microfinance appears to be one potential solution to support direct climate change adaptation actions for the agricultural sector. However, this may not be strong enough to finance the entire needs for agricultural climate actions. Adaptation is contextual, so it has to be grounded in the needs of local communities. Microfinance needs public sectors support as well as other resources from the private sector. In the case of rapid response to disasters, which often destroy the agricultural sector, microfinance should be advantageous in supporting adaptation. However, in reality, it does not work, as it is prevented by regulations. So, this can be an area the public sector can support as a risk-taker as well as by providing initial funds and resources for scaling up efforts.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Farmers; Indonesia; Microfinance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011086321

Smart grids address intelligent use and integration of conventional and renewable generation in combination with controllable loads and storages. Two special aspects have also to be considered for smart grids in future: rural conditions and electric vehicles. Both, the increasing share of renewable energy sources and a rising demand for charging power by electrical vehicles lead to new challenges of network stability (congestion, voltage deviation), especially in rural distribution grids. This paper describes two lighthouse projects in Europe (""Well2Wheel"" and ""Smart Rural Grid"") dealing with these topics. The link between these projects is the implementation of the same virtual power plant technology and the approach of cellular grid cells. Starting with an approach for the average energy balance in 15 minutes intervals in several grid cells in the first project, the second project even allows the islanded operation of such cells as a microgrid. The integration of renewable energy sources into distribution grids primary takes place in rural areas. The lighthouse project ""Smart Rural Grid"", which is founded by the European Union, demonstrates possibilities to use the existing distribution system operator infrastructure more effectively by applying an optimised and scheduled operation of the assets and using intelligent distribution power routers, called IDPR. IDPR are active power electronic devices operating at low voltage in distribution grids aiming to reduce losses due to unbalanced loads and enabling active voltage and reactive power control. This allows a higher penetration of renewable energy sources in existing grids without investing in new lines and transformers. Integrated in a virtual power plant and combined with batteries, the IDPR also allows a temporary islanded mode of grid cells. Both projects show the potential of avoiding or postponing investments in new primary infrastructure like cables, transformers and lines by using a forward-looking operation which controls generators, loads and batteries (mobile and stationary) by using new grid assets like power routers. While primary driven by physical restrictions as voltage-band violations and energy balance, these cells also define and allow local smart markets. In consequence the distribution system operators could avoid direct control access by giving an incentive to the asset owners by local price signals according to the grid situation and forecasted congestions. © 2016 CIGRE.

The goal was not to predict future climate conditions and plan for specific trends, but to understand which water resources and facilities are most vulnerable to potential shifts in climate and to differentiate between adaptive measures that should be initiated regardless of the trends and those that should wait for a specific trend to trigger action. This analysis evaluated potential climate-driven effects on various water resource sectors at the local scale within the District, including water supply, water quality, stormwater and flooding, and water demand, as well as related infrastructure-wastewater treatment plants, conveyance systems, dams, and levees. The study produced a list of recommended preemptive measures, from drought management plans to green infrastructure, to help protect the most vulnerable resources regardless of future climate trends and a plan to develop triggers for specific responses to changing climate.

EMS has to ensure the system stability, economic operation, and reduction of pollutant emissions. In this paper, an algorithm based on hierarchical centralized EMS has been proposed for day-ahead scheduling of multi-microgrids (MMGs) operation in the grid-connected mode. The proposed hierarchical EMS has two levels of EMSs, which are microgrid EMS (MG-EMS) and community EMS (C-EMS).

Technological advancements have made solar power efficient and economically competitive with the traditional thermoelectric power plants. Utility-scale solar plants may generate electricity by using the photovoltaic (PV) or concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. However, solar systems need water to wash the panels/mirrors to maintain their efficiency. Water use in CSP plants for wet or hybrid cooling processes is comparable to that in thermoelectric plants. Hence development of solar power may be curtailed in the semi-arid southwestern regions because of limited water resources and changing climate. This study used a system dynamics model to analyze water issues of the state of Nevada for development of solar power under the renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Water availability and use for different scenarios of PV and CSP were quantified to meet the RPS goals during the period 2010-2030. Land requirements and subsequent reduction in CO2 emissions due to solar power development were also evaluated. Results showed that transitioning to solar technology from coal led to substantial reductions in CO2 emissions during the period 2010-2030. CSP tower have the largest land requirements, whereas linear Fresnel have the smallest land requirements. Generating electricity using PV plants as well as using dry cooling methods for CSP plants was found to be better options for water stressed areas. This model can also be applied to other regions using appropriate datasets. © ASCE.",,"Availability; Carbon dioxide; Electric power generation; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydraulic fracturing; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Thermoelectric power plants; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; Concentrated solar power; Generate electricity; Renewable portfolio standard; Subsequent reduction; Substantial reduction; System dynamics model; Technological advancement; Water availability; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976466802

In the case of the municipality of São Gabriel do Oeste (SGO), located in the Upper Paraguay River Basin, the processing of historical Landsat imagery indicates from 1984 to 2013 a relative land cover increase in soybean/corn cropland from 25% to 30% and pasture from 17% to 41%, whereas a decrease in native forest from 57% to 28%. These land-use changes produced several outstanding economic indexes as the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), 48% higher than that of Brazil. The total GDP increased by 259% from 1999 to 2011. Besides, SGO Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.729 in 2010 was about 2% higher than the Brazil’s HDI average. On the other hand, the agricultural development reflected in alterations of major ecohydrological regulations (carbon and water) at the watershed, notwithstanding the economic concentration. Croplands mostly develop in areas of low vulnerability (55%), while almost all of the pasture areas are preferably in vulnerable areas (42%). Due to climate changes, the promotion of state social inclusive and low-carbon agriculture is necessary to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to recover important ecohydrological processes at the drainage basin level. In this chapter, we explore a new sustainable design of agroecosystems (integrated crop-livestock and forestry) in the Upper Taquari River Basin, which can maximize and optimize both the sharing of rural productivity and carbon/water regulations at the watershed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Agriculture; Deforestation; Integrated agroecosystems; Land use; Livestock; Sustainability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006850625

This complex interplay is illustrated by a case study that assesses the energy security and sustainability implications of different global energy scenarios using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. No single scenario meets all sustainability and security of supply criteria, but the results indicate a trade-off between strong CO2 policies and economic performance, whereas environmental and social objectives do not seem to be in contradiction to a secure supply.

Presenting the empirical evidence of stakeholder engagement activities that increase risk awareness and encourage collective action, the study addresses a key priority for the Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (Hyogo Framework for Action 2) to identify methods for increasing local-level implementation of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative, case study approach is used to explore the case in depth. A review of literature from the multidisciplinary areas of communication, social and political theory frames data collection and analysis. Data collection includes observation, document analysis and interviews with policymakers, practitioners and local stakeholders to document achievements and lessons learnt from all perspectives. Findings: Preliminary results indicate that strong political leadership and inter-departmental coordination have contributed to engaging local-level participation in disaster risk reduction in the Municipality of Amadora, Portugal. Findings indicate that the implementation of a wide spectrum of public engagement initiatives has increased awareness of hazard risks amongst specific demographic groups and improved community and government capacity to identify and implement risk reduction strategies. Research limitations/implications: As this study is a work-in-progress and data analysis is in the early stages, interview transcripts included in this paper are limited to members of the team and their Director, Amadora Town Councillor for Civil Protection Services. Practical implications: It is commonly acknowledged that to date, achievements of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2010-2015 largely remain at the national level and have not reached local levels in a substantial manner. Addressing the need for more industry-led research to explore examples of successful stakeholder participation, the paper’s findings can be used by emergency management practitioners who recognise the need to merge climate change adaptation, risk reduction and local-level engagement to encourage public participation, inclusiveness and proactive planning. Originality/value: Co-authored by an Australian academic and a member of Amadora’s Campaign Team, the paper is a combination of empirical data from one city’s practical experience to develop and implement communication strategies in developing and implementing strategies to build community disaster resilience, analysed within a framework of communication, social and political theory. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication; Disaster risk reduction; Risk management; Stakeholders; Sustainable development; United Nations","adaptive management; capacity building; climate change; collective action; data acquisition; disaster management; governance approach; leadership; local government; risk assessment; stakeholder; sustainable development; United Nations; Amadora; Lisboa [Portugal]; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978120421

However, understanding of the microbiology of this process is limited because most culture-independent methods cannot link metabolic processes to the organisms present, and this link to causative agents is necessary to predict the results of perturbations on the system. We collected soil samples at two sub-root depths (10-20 cm and 30-40 cm) before and after a rainfall-driven nutrient perturbation event in a Northern California grassland that experiences a Mediterranean climate. From ten samples, we reconstructed 198 metagenome-assembled genomes that represent all major phylotypes. We also quantified 6,835 proteins and 175 metabolites and showed that after the rain event the concentrations of many sugars and amino acids approach zero at the base of the soil profile. Unexpectedly, the genomes of novel members of the Gemmatimonadetes and Candidate Phylum Rokubacteria phyla encode pathways for methylotrophy. We infer that these abundant organisms contribute substantially to carbon turnover in the soil, given that methylotrophy proteins were among the most abundant proteins in the proteome. Previously undescribed Bathyarchaeota and Thermoplasmatales archaea are abundant in deeper soil horizons and are inferred to contribute appreciably to aromatic amino acid degradation. Many of the other bacteria appear to breakdown other components of plant biomass, as evidenced by the prevalence of various sugar and amino acid transporters and corresponding hydrolyzing machinery in the proteome. Overall, our work provides organism-resolved insight into the spatial distribution of bacteria and archaea whose activities combine to degrade plant-derived organics, limiting the transport of methanol, amino acids and sugars into underlying weathered rock. The new insights into the soil carbon cycle during an intense period of carbon turnover, including biogeochemical roles to previously little known soil microbes, were made possible via the combination of metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

Due to the high potential capacity globally, geological storage of CO2 is considered as an applicable technology to a wide spectrum of geological sites. In this complex process, many economic, technical, political, and environmental factors are involved, causing conflicts among multiple objectives. Management of CO2 capture and storage is thus essential for analyzing tradeoffs among these objective, and reducing the associated risks to local communities. Although great efforts have been made, effective design and management of various CO2 storage systems, as well as analysis of associated risks are still challenging to practitioners. In recent years, simulation and optimization methods have been used for addressing important management problems of CO2 capture and storage. The combined simulation-optimization approaches can account for the complex behaviours of the storage process and can help identify the best management strategies under consideration of the management objectives and constraints, as well as the associated risks. During the past decades, a large number of studies were conducted to simulate CO2 flow and transport in the geological substrate, and seek cost-effective storage schemes. This paper presented a comprehensive review on recent developments, advancements, challenges, and barriers associated with simulation and optimization modeling approaches in supporting CO2 capture and geological storage. A number of methodologies and applications were examined. Perspectives of effective management schemes were investigated, demonstrating many demanding areas for enhanced research efforts, which included issues of data availability and reliability, concerns in uncertainty, necessity of post-modeling analysis, and usefulness of development of process control techniques. © 2016 L & H Scientific Publishing, LLC.","CO2 capture and storage; Optimization; Review; Simulation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046660813

Material/Methods: New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized, intubated, and vascular access was canalized. The animals were monitored with pulse oximetry, electrocardiography electrodes, temperature, invasive blood pressure, and regional hepatic and splanchnic oximetry using spectroscopy. Septic shock was induced with Escherichia coli toxin in the animals in the Case group. Invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring values were recorded every 15 min, and blood samples were extracted every 60 min. At 2 h, the animals were euthanized. Results: Systemic hypoperfusion data were recorded in the Case group: invasive arterial hypotension at 30 min of toxin inoculation, reduction in serum bicarbonate levels, reduction in base excess, and increase in lactic acid levels. When analyzing the noninvasive regional oximetry values, we found a reduction in splanchnic (at 30 min) and hepatic (at 60 min) levels. Conclusions: Regional hepatic and splanchnic oxygenation is significantly related to the amount of invasive arterial pressure and biochemical variables of systemic hypoperfusion in a septic shock model. Changes in these values occurred earlier and were more marked in the measurement of regional splanchnic oxygenation. © Med Sci Tech, 2016.","Near-infrared; Sepsis; Spectroscopy; Splanchnic circulation","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bacterial toxin; bicarbonate; calcium ion; creatinine; hemoglobin; lactic acid; potassium ion; sodium ion; animal cell; animal model; Article; blood cell count; blood pressure monitoring; body temperature; controlled study; electrocardiography; Escherichia coli; female; hematocrit; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; oxygen saturation; oxygenation; partial thromboplastin time; pH; pulse oximetry; rabbit; septic shock; splanchnic hypoperfusion; thromboplastin time; tissue perfusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015924987

Moreover, the European Commission, as part of its Clean Power for Transport package, has adopted in 2014 a Directive 'on the deployment of alternative fuels, recharging and refuelling infrastructure'. Nevertheless, there are several constraints that need to be addressed yet, more particularly in LNG importing countries in order to meet the future demand of the expected LNG-powered fleet. They include facilities for storage and transhipment of LNG for fuelling berths, barges and ships. This paper provides an overview of the use of LNG for the maritime industry and examines its potential for future growth on the basis of the LNG-powered fleet (current and in order) and planned expansion of LNG bunkering facilities, mainly in European ports. Most data here presented come from a variety of sources including international databases such as IHS Maritime, ports websites, and reports from LNG-related organisations. In addition, the results from past and current EU-funded projects in this field were reviewed and consultations were conducted among representatives from participating ports. Overall, it was found that the LNG powered fleet is expanding slowly and the trend is towards building LNG-propelled vessels for smaller ship sizes and short distances. Although Norway is the newbuilding front runner, other countries, mainly in Europe (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Malta), have ordered an important amount of new buildings. Similarly, European ports are expanding considerably their LNG bunkering capacities. Remarkable are the activities conducted by the ports of Spain and Italy with planned expansion for LNG handling and storage facilities beyond 2020. Finally, with regards to regulations, while international standards have been adopted for the construction and operation of LNG powered ships and crew's training, no harmonisation exists yet for LNG facilities in ports. The latter have allowed major ports to undertake independent initiatives to overcome the situation. © 2016 The Authors.

These technologies have been implemented successfully at hundreds of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the U. S. as very reliable and energy efficient tertiary filtration technologies to serve as a final treatment step before treated effluent is discharged to receiving water bodies or used as recycled water. These two wastewater filtration technologies were also demonstrated for primary effluent filtration (PEF) (i.e., applied after the primary clarifier) as an early step in the treatment process to save energy at WWTPs. As a result of the two-year continuous operation of the demonstration system at the Linda County Water District (LCWD) WWTP (Olivehurst, California), both filtration systems have proven to be fully reliable and energy efficient treatment technologies for PEF to achieve energy savings at WWTPs. The operational robustness and reliability of these two filters when subjected to elevated and unfavorable primary effluent solids conditions, coupled with their observed high treatment and energy efficiencies, prompted using CDF for primary filtration (PF) to achieve significant energy savings and increase in plant capacity (by promoting carbon diversion). The key difference between PF and PEF is the location of the filtration step at the beginning of the wastewater treatment process rather than downstream of the primary clarifier. A summary of the previous PEF demonstration project and more recent PF pilot and demonstration projects are presented.

With trafficking and adverse environmental conditions, roads may become unserviceable quite quickly. So there is a need to re-condition granular roads through in-situ recycling to achieve the sustainability goals of re-use of materials and reduction of greenhouse gases by minimizing transport of materials. Bitumen, in the form of either cold emulsion or foamed bitumen, has been used for this purpose quite successfully, but there exist situations where it is too expensive for the road authority, given the nature of the road, or bitumen may not be suitable if plastic fines exist in the pavement material. Environmental conditions such as poor drainage of primarily flat land may also have local government looking for alternative treatments. Hydrophobic dry powder polymers (DPP) mixed with lime can serve to provide an improved road base quickly at relatively low cost. Unfortunately the literature on polymer additives in aggregates is quite limited and so research has commenced with the aid of local government agencies in Adelaide, South Australia. In this paper a field trial and laboratory investigation are presented on the comparative engineering properties of treated and untreated aggregates from a road trial. Testing has included hydraulic conductivity, large column capillary rise tests and repeated loading triaxial testing.

While at the hillslope scale sources of non-stationarity are inherent to the nature of the process, at the regional scale one of the potentially causes of non-stationarity of landslide frequency is climate change. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo based approach, to compute landslide triggering probability, and its potential variation due to climate change. The approach combines stochastic rainfall generation and hydrological and slope stability models. The stochastic model is calibrated on the basis current observations; then, factor of changes in rainfall characteristics are computed based on regional climate model (RCM) projections, and the stochastic rainfall generator is adjusted accordingly. The modified rainfall input is finally used to estimate the potential modification of landslide-triggering probabilities related to changes in precipitation patterns. Application examples conducted to a real case-study area in Italy, demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, which enables to make preliminary projections of the effect of rainfall changes on the frequency of landslide triggering.",,"Climate change; Climate models; Environmental management; Irrigation; Landslides; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Slope protection; Slope stability; Soil conservation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Water conservation; Water management; Water resources exploration; Watersheds; Application examples; Nonstationary process; Potential variations; Precipitation patterns; Rainfall characteristics; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Stochastic rainfall generations; Stochastic rainfalls; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976514449

Laser based spectroscopic techniques are good candidates to this scope due to their capability to operate in field, in remote and rapid way. In this work, the prototype of a multispectral imaging LIF (Laser Induced Fluorescence) system able to detect evidence of different materials on large very crowded and confusing areas at distances up to some tens of meters will be presented. Data collected as both 2D fluorescence images and LIF spectra are suitable to the identification and the localization of the materials of interest. A reduced scan time, preserving at the same time the accuracy of the results, has been taken into account as a main requirement in the system design. An excimer laser with high energy and repetition rate coupled to a gated high sensitivity ICCD assures very good performances for this purpose. Effort has been devoted to speed up the data processing. The system has been tested in outdoor and indoor real scenarios and some results will be reported. Evidence of the plastics polypropylene (PP) and polyethilene (PE) and polyester have been identified and their localization on the examined scenes has been highlighted through the data processing. By suitable emission bands, the instrument can be used for the rapid detection of other material classes (i.e.Textiles, woods, varnishes).

Can this societal promise of private car ownership and automotive mobility in the face of climate change and permanent congestion imply the continued guarantee of social participation? The digital options for transportation allow for a general safeguarding of mobility without the direct need for private vehicles, but the current market structures do not allow for that. It is obvious, that new business models triggered by digitalisation are struggling to find support in the current legal frameworks, although they increase the capacity and efficiency of transport and energy systems, reinforcing decarbonisation initiatives and eventually also address the citizens needs and interest in a more effective way. The dynamics of digitalisation are speeding up, eroding current patterns of mobility behaviour; the current legal framework, however, preserves the status quo and even contradicts the promise of social participation. Considerable restrictions on the private car need and will be implemented as urban and environmental pressures can no longer be mitigated. Electrification of the entire transportation sector is thus not only necessitated due to climate change mitigation, but is in line with the increased interlinking of different modes of transport into integrated mobility services. This shift will involve a fundamental transformation of the transport sector. It is driven not only by economic and technological factors, but importantly also by important societal developments and considerations. The use of digital technologies in order to economise the mobility sector, making it more efficient and intermodal, cannot be stopped. The automobile with its combustion engine was only the first generation appliance. Its broad success, however, has forced us to consider alternatives and reinterpret the product with the help of digital technologies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","digitalisation; electrification; Erosion of private car; integrated mobility services; policy framework",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994019699

We present a novel framework for participatory development of spatially explicit scenarios at national scale that model socioeconomic and environmental dynamics by reconciling local stakeholder perspectives and national spatial data. We illustrate results generated by this approach and evaluate its potential to contribute to a greater understanding of the relationship between development pathways and sustainability. Using the lens of land use and land cover changes, and engaging 240 stakeholders representing subnational (seven forest management zones) and the national level, we applied the framework to assess alternative development strategies in the Tanzania mainland to the year 2025, under either a business as usual or a green development scenario. In the business as usual scenario, no productivity gain is expected, cultivated land expands by ~ 2% per year (up to 88,808 km2), with large impacts on woodlands and wetlands. Despite legal protection, encroachment of natural forest occurs along reserve borders. Additional wood demand leads to degradation, i.e., loss of tree cover and biomass, up to 80,426 km2 of wooded land. The alternative green economy scenario envisages decreasing degradation and deforestation with increasing productivity (+10%) and implementation of payment for ecosystem service schemes. In this scenario, cropland expands by 44,132 km2 and the additional degradation is limited to 35,778 km2. This scenario development framework captures perspectives and knowledge across a diverse range of stakeholders and regions. Although further effort is required to extend its applicability, improve users’ equity, and reduce costs the resulting spatial outputs can be used to inform national level planning and policy implementation associated with sustainable development, especially the REDD+ climate mitigation strategy. © 2016 by the author(s).","Coupled human-natural system; Deforestation; Ecosystem services; Land use and land cover change; REDD+; Sustainable development","deforestation; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; forest management; future prospect; land cover; land use change; participatory approach; policy implementation; sustainable development; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989166092

The SEM region has great potential for energy efficiency improvements and deployment of renewables which are sufficient both to cover local needs and to release hydrocarbon resources for exportation as well as to help the EU achieve the Energy Roadmap emission reduction targets at lower costs. Two kinds of obstacles currently hamper taking advantage of the untapped potential: (1) lack of power interconnection infrastructure and regulatory policy framework and (2) persistence of fossil fuel subsidies in a large part of the SEM region.This analysis is based on a large-scale energy system modeling of both the SEM and the EU regions and assesses two alternative cooperation strategies. The first strategy is essentially based on centralized actions involving large-scale exploitation of renewables in large-scale installations with a mainly exportation orientation. This strategy offers the best, cost-effective prospects for electricity exports to the EU under mechanisms of remuneration based on power purchase agreements (PPAs) and geographic expansion of the EU-ETS. The second, alternative strategy gives priority to decentralized investment aiming at exploiting dispersed renewable sources - the renewables recombined with proactive removal of current energy-pricing distortions and policies providing incentives for energy savings by energy consumers.

A key stressor for sugar maple (SM) is acid rain, which depletes base cations from poorly-buffered forest soils and has been associated with much lower SM vigor, growth, and recruitment. However, the potential interactions between forest management and soil acidification – and their implications for the sustainability of SM and its economic and cultural benefits – have not been investigated. In this study, we simulated the development of 50 extant SM stands in the western Adirondack region of NY (USA) for 100 years under different soil chemical conditions and silvicultural prescriptions. We found that interactions between management prescription and soil base saturation will strongly shape the ability to maintain SM in managed forests. Below 12% base saturation, SM did not regenerate sufficiently after harvest and was replaced mainly by red maple (Acer rubrum) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Loss of SM on acid-impaired sites was predicted regardless of whether the shelterwood or diameter-limit prescriptions were used. On soils with sufficient base saturation, models predicted that SM will regenerate after harvest and be sustained for future rotations. We then estimated how these different post-harvest outcomes, mediated by acid impairment of forest soils, would affect the potential monetary value of ecosystem services provided by SM forests. Model simulations indicated that a management strategy focused on syrup production – although not feasible across the vast areas where acid impairment has occurred – may generate the greatest economic return. Although pollution from acid rain is declining, its long-term legacy in forest soils will shape future options for sustainable forestry and ecosystem stewardship in the northern hardwood forests of North America. © 2016 The Authors","Acid rain; Climate regulation; Cultural services; Ecosystem services; Northern hardwood forests; Wood products","Acid rain; Acidification; Ecology; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Harvesting; Rain; Reforestation; Soils; Wood products; Climate regulation; Cultural services; Ecological and economic; Ecosystem services; Management strategies; Northern hardwood forest; Silvicultural practices; Silvicultural prescriptions; Forestry; acid rain; acidification; climate effect; ecological impact; economic impact; ecosystem service; forest management; forest product; forest soil; silviculture; sustainable forestry; Acer; acid rain; Article; beech; biomass production; environmental economics; environmental sustainability; forest management; forest soil; harvesting; nonhuman; priority journal; red maple; seedling; soil acidification; soil acidity; stocking density; sugar maple; tree growth; United States; vegetation; ecology; economics; environmental monitoring; forestry; growth, development and aging; New York; pollution; soil pollutant; toxicity; tree; Acer Saccharum; Acidification; Ecology; Fagus Grandifolia; Forests; Silviculture; Adirondack Mountains; New York [United States]; United States; Acer rubrum; Acer saccharum; Fagus grandifolia; Acer; Acid Rain; Ecology; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Forestry; New York; Soil Pollutants; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979583977

Drawing on Social-Ecological Systems theory, we explore those characteristics of risk governance systems believed to be more favourable for building resilience at the community level in different developing country contexts. These include: diversity; polycentricism and connectivity; decentralisation and flexibility; participation and community engagement; and, learning and innovation. This review paper proposes a conceptual framework and assesses the evidence linking risk governance and access to the services needed to build resilient outcomes, drawing particularly on evidence from the Sahel and Horn of Africa. In doing so, we can start to understand where the entry points might be for strengthening resilience and the conditions needed for community-level initiatives to be brought to scale from the bottom up. © 2016 by the authors.","Informal institutions; Local risk governance; Resilience; Social-ecological systems; Sub-Saharan Africa",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028985614

This raises a critical epistemological challenge for CSD: how can we know who is vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change, and why are they vulnerable to particular impacts? In this paper, we consider both the epistemological tension arising over the construction of vulnerability that emerges at the intersection of the physical and social science communities within CSD and a second, less-discussed epistemological stress surrounding how user identities are understood within the social science community engaged in CSD-related research and implementation. We illustrate these tensions through the example of a climate services programme that delivers agrometeorological advice to farmers in Mali, demonstrating the ramifications of these epistemological issues for the design and delivery of services that further development and adaptation goals. © 2015 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).","Climate change adaptation; Climate services; Epistemology; Identity; Mali; Vulnerability","adaptive management; agricultural application; agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; decision making; information system; vulnerability; Mali",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925664520

This challenge mostly relates to the lack of reduction in emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from diesel road vehicles relative to the reductions expected through increasingly stringent vehicle emissions legislation. However, a key component of near-road concentrations of NO2 derives from directly emitted (primary) NO2 from diesel vehicles. It is well-established that the proportion of NO2 (i.e. the NO2/NOx ratio) in vehicle exhaust has increased over the past decade as a result of vehicle after-treatment technologies that oxidise carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and generate NO2 to aid the emissions control of diesel particulate. In this work we bring together an analysis of ambient NOx and NO2 measurements with comprehensive vehicle emission remote sensing data obtained in London to better understand recent trends in the NO2/NOx ratio from road vehicles. We show that there is evidence that NO2 concentrations have decreased since around 2010 despite less evidence of a reduction in total NOx. The decrease is shown to be driven by relatively large reductions in the amount of NO2 directly emitted by vehicles; from around 25 vol% in 2010 to 15 vol% in 2014 in inner London, for example. The analysis of NOx and NO2 vehicle emission remote sensing data shows that these reductions have been mostly driven by reduced NO2/NOx emission ratios from heavy duty vehicles and buses rather than light duty vehicles. However, there is also evidence from the analysis of Euro 4 and 5 diesel passenger cars that as vehicles age the NO2/NOx ratio decreases. For example the NO2/NOx ratio decreased from 29.5 ± 2.0% in Euro 5 diesel cars up to one year old to 22.7 ± 2.5% for four-year old vehicles. At some roadside locations the reductions in primary NO2 have had a large effect on reducing both the annual mean and number of hourly exceedances of the European Limit Values of NO2. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979053811

Box 208109, New Haven, CT  06520, United States","The middle Miocene climate transition (MMCT) is characterized by an abrupt 1‰ increase in benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotopes at ca. 13.8 Ma, marking expansion of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and transition of Earth's climate to a cooler, relatively stable glacial state. Also occurring during this period is a globally recognized positive carbon isotope excursion (16.9-13.5 Ma) in benthic and planktonic foraminifera with shorter carbon isotope maxima (CM) events, linking hypotheses for climate change at the time with the carbon cycle. In order to test whether export production in the eastern equatorial Pacific is related to the largest such event (CM6), coincident with Antarctic Ice Sheet expansion, a high-resolution ( &lt; 5 k.y.) record of export production at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1337 spanning the MMCT (14.02-13.43 Ma) was produced using marine pelagic barite mass accumulation rates. Export production is elevated with an extended period of more than double present-day values. These variations are not orbitally paced and provide evidence for a reorganization of nutrients supplied to the eastern equatorial Pacific in the Miocene and intensification of upwelling. If such changes are representative of the entire region, then this mechanism could sequester enough carbon to have a significant effect on atmospheric pCO2. However, continual delivery of nutrients to the surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific is required in order to sustain export production without depleting the surface ocean of limiting nutrients. This might be accomplished by a change in ocean circulation or a combination of other processes requiring further study. © 2016 Geological Society of America.",,"Carbon; Earth (planet); Glacial geology; Glaciers; Isotopes; Nutrients; Orbits; Software testing; Antarctic ice sheets; Carbon isotope excursions; Climate transition; Eastern equatorial Pacific; Equatorial Pacific; Integrated ocean drilling programs; Mass accumulation rates; Planktonic foraminifera; Climate change; carbon isotope; climate variation; extinction; Miocene; Ocean Drilling Program; oceanic circulation; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994559252

A short list of these technologies has been generated through analysis of DER projects (Zhivov et al. 2015). Characteristics of some of these ""core technologies "" depend on technologies available on an individual nation's market, minimum requirements of national standards, and life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis. In addition to these factors, requirements for building envelope-related technologies (e.g., insulation levels, windows), depend on specific climate conditions. This paper presents the results of computational modeling analysis conducted by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center team to determine the performance potential of the core technologies for two categories of buildings with relatively low internal loads in 15 U.S. climates using the net zero planner tool. This tool enabled simultaneous simulation of multiple building types and multiple technology bundles of energy efficiency measures in different climate zones. This research supported development of requirements for building envelope characteristics and typical equipment best practices for DER projects. Information presented in the paper along with results of similar studies conducted in Denmark, Estonia, Austria, Germany, China, and the UK(Riel et al. 2016; Yao et al. 2016; Zhivov 2016) for their nation-specific climate conditions have been used to develop general guidelines for technology bundles to be used in DER projects (Zhivov et al. 2016). Results of these studies show that 50% of site energy use reduction can be achieved in most climate conditions using a limited number of technologies readily available on the market. It is easier to reduce energy consumption in heating-dominated climates than in climates requiring cooling and humidity control. Additional energy efficiency technologies and measures specific to the building type and use, as well as to specific climate conditions, can further reduce energy use intensity of the building and allow achievement of even higher performance buildings (e.g., passive house standard or even net zero energy). © 2016 ASHRAE.",,"Commerce; Energy utilization; Heating; Historic preservation; Humidity control; Life cycle; Retrofitting; Solar buildings; Zero energy buildings; Energy efficiency technologies; Energy use intensities; International energy agency; Life cycle cost analysis; Minimum requirements; Multiple technology; Performance potentials; Reduce energy consumption; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974829560

This paper begins by providing a theoretical framework discussion on the dominant etic and emic academic research on monsoons and climate change impacts on agriculture. The rat ceremony performed in villages throughout East Flores is a local custom used to rid agricultural fields of pests-often rats-that come from the surrounding forests to feed on the agricultural crops when the rains become erratic. This paper argues that analyzing the rat ceremony through an emic lens allows for better future resiliency to monsoon shifts due to climate change. It is argued that the rat ceremony demonstrates a way in which community resiliency is strengthened by an adaptive approach that supports an already existing community ceremony that emphasizes two essential tenets: community solidarity and coexistence with nature.

This has created a huge access to petroleum, attracting strong interest by some states, especially energy hungry-countries and increasing competition between states, resulting in tension and threats, even military ones. Climate change has, therefore, to be perceived as a threat to international peace and security. However, recognition of the nexus between climate change, human security and conflicts in the prism of international law and politics is weak, leading to a difficulty institutions have for regulating and governing this nexus. Climate change can thus be considered as threat-multiplier, something that can exacerbate existing tensions, and the resolution of this threat will be the most difficult task to achieve where adaptation takes place in fragile and vulnerable areas, such as the Arctic, an area which is highly exposed to environmental risks and uncertainty. The region is populated by one of the most vulnerable groups, the indigenous people, such as the Inuit of the Arctic with low adaptive capacity compared to the pace of change. In the Arctic Environmental Ocean governance, access to natural resources, the potential of navigability, extension of maritime borders, and the desire of some states to extend their jurisdiction, all depict a situation of criss-crossing potential conflicts that could escalate and should, therefore, be perceived as “tinderboxes”. This article relatedly explores the existing legal framework in the case of the Arctic environmental ocean to provide effective and legitimate governance for a peaceful and “stable space” to prevent threats from both Arctic and non-Arctic states. It will be shown that Arctic Environmental Ocean activities need multi-level governance (global, regional, national and local) and that Arctic environmental security challenges cannot be addressed without a broader holistic vision. The article treat the United Nations regulatory level and how it could support many issues which have an impact on Arctic Environmental Ocean governance, and the Law on the Sea. Methodologically, the way to increase effectiveness to maintain and stabilize the Arctic environmental ocean governance entails that “stability” is achieved by integrating elements of climatology, international law, political science and agent based modelling to act in a preventative way to protect the Arctic environmental ocean and its societies and formulate effective policies. The conclusion led on how the current Arctic environmental ocean framework could be changed in order to increase effectiveness by incorporating risk analysis into a universal equation based model to redesign a new regulatory package at United Nations level and recommend changes at institutional level. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Arctic Environmental Ocean; Arctic security; Climate change; Human security; United Nations (UN) law; United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071374454

Emission from such jets extends over the whole electromagnetic spectrum and is a proxy of the nature and activity of the central engine. To constrain the physics of jets both magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) and radiative transfer (RT) calculations are needed. However, numerical simulations cannot handle full MHD+RT calculations on a useful timescale for fitting procedures. Hence, to fit and interpret observational data, semi-analytical models are required, such as the improved AGNJET code that we will discuss here.The AGNJET code [1] evaluates the emission from a multi-zone jet consisting of a nozzle followed by a quasi-isothermal conical expanding region. During the expansion a portion of the electrons can be re-accelerated, through a process that commences at a distance from the black hole (BH) determined by observational constraints. In this updated version of AGNJET ([2], [3], hereafter CC17b and CR17, respectively), the inverse Compton component is evaluated allowing for multiple inverse Compton scatterings and pair production/annihilation. Together with other upgrades like electron cooling, such new features can help break the degeneracy between synchrotron-dominated and Compton-dominated spectral energy distributions of black hole disk/jet systems. I will also discuss the coupling of AGNJET with the semi-analytic, relativistic MHD model developed by [4–6] and [7, hereafter CC17a], aimed at constraining a subset of the input parameters based on self-consistent MHD calculations for the jet nozzle.This new version of AGNJET calculates the jet velocity profile and geometry self-consistently with ideal-MHD and includes a more accurate treatment of jet morphologies and dynamics, and the relevant physical processes. © Copyright owned by the author(s)",,"Astrophysics; Cooling systems; Gamma rays; Gravitation; Magnetohydrodynamics; Relativity; Stars; Active galactic nuclei; Electromagnetic spectra; Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); Inverse Compton scattering; Observational data; Semi-analytical model; Spectral energy distribution; Young stellar objects; Fighter aircraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050645839

Besides the effects of climate change, activities such as clearing of mangroves for tourism, use of inappropriate fishing gear and excessive use of pesticides for agricultural productivity are the most powerful ecological stressors. In the Sahelian climate zone, hydrological regimes are changing due to reduced river flow and increase in atmospheric temperatures leading to the formation of inverse estuaries. The evaluation and documentation of local adaptation practices is one way to prevent “conservation bottlenecks” and encourage sustainable use of estuarine resources. This study used a questionnaire-based approach to evaluate local adaptation strategies to climate-induced ecological changes in the Tanbi Wetland National Park (TWNP) over the past three decades, targeting the communities that are engaged in the four major socio-economic sectors in the wetland i.e. Fishing, Agriculture, Oyster collection and Tourism. The agricultural zone presented the best local adaptation techniques employed as a response to ecosystem changes in the TWNP (23.53 %), followed by tourism zones (7.35 %) and fishing (5.88 %). With the disappearance of many fish species within the same timeframe, this leaves much to be desired. Bearing in mind that fisheries and tourism are the second and third largest contributors to the Gambia’s GDP, this paper provides useful recommendations for management of this important wetland. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation; Climate change; Fisheries; Mangrove estuaries; Socio-economic; TWNP",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059255895

Recent reductions in smelter emissions have resulted in much ecological recovery, but the recovery of Daphnia species has been poor. To determine if Cu and Ni toxicity could explain differences in daphniid recovery among lakes, we compared results of 14 d static with renewal bioassays in waters from Blue Chalk Lake, an uncontaminated reference lake 200 km from Sudbury, and from five Sudbury lakes ranging in distance from the smelters and varying in metal and cation concentrations. We spiked Blue Chalk Lake water with Cu and Ni to levels resembling those of the Sudbury lakes and also tested the lake waters for toxicity. Survival of Daphnia pulex, D. pulicaria and D. mendotae decreased monotonically with increasing metal concentrations in the spiked Blue Chalk Lake treatments, falling from 90% in the controls to 0% at the two highest Cu and Ni levels, reflecting levels of Middle and Hannah lakes. In contrast, survival in waters collected from the actual Sudbury lakes did not monotonically track their total metal concentrations. Rather, survival fell to 0% in Clearwater Lake water, a lake with intermediate metal contamination (8.9 and 79.9 µg L–1 of Cu and Ni, respectively) vs 70-100% in the other lakes. We performed an additional assay with Clearwater Lake waters increasing its Ca and Na concentrations, singly and in combination to levels that reflected the levels in Middle Lake. The survival of the four daphniid species increased from 0% up to 80-100% with added Ca and from 0% to 60-90% with added Na. Lipid-ovarian indices had a similar trend to survival for D. mendotae and D. pulicaria in Bioassay 1, varying with the cation concentrations in the lakes for the daphniids in Bioassay 2. The bioassays results imply that regional recovery patterns of daphniids in Sudbury lakes cannot be understood without as a minimum considering both metal and base cation concentration differences among lakes, and give an indication of differences among Daphnia species to cope with metal stress. © 2016, Page Press Publications.

Moreover, it may act as a leverage to promote a wider transition towards more sustainable mobility patterns. We investigated this phenomenon in the e-mobiliTI living lab, a socio-technical learning process held in Southern Switzerland between 2012 and 2015. We involved eleven early adopters of electric vehicles and sixteen mainstream consumers, all living in the Lugano area, which is the main urban conurbation of the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. In Spring 2013 a first three-months smartphone-based monitoring phase allowed us to identify their reference mobility patterns. In Spring 2014, during a second three-months monitoring phase, they experienced new mobility options (electric cars and bicycles, public transport season tickets and car and bike-sharing subscriptions) in their complex, real-world settings. Results gathered show high potential for substitution between conventional and electric cars, even if range autonomy and investment costs are still significant barriers. Nevertheless, the supposed wider transformation of mobility patterns did not occur and the car maintained its dominance. The e-mobiliTI living lab experiment allowed the collection of bottom-up, user-centered perceptions on the strengths and weaknesses of the mobility options being tested. This process allowed us to highlight the reasons for the lack of attractiveness of the means of transport other than the (private) car and to outline scenarios and policy recommendations for local and regional authorities. © 2016 The Authors.","Electric vehicles; living lab; opportunities and barriers; socio-technical process; transition",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991716959

A notable case of Ethanol usage is found in South America with the widespread use of E100, which has no gasoline content and can often contain up to 10% water. Engine oil contamination by fuel is of major concern and under certain conditions can have negative effects on the durability of turbocharger components which come into contact with contaminated oil, particularly sliding bearings, but also compressor stage through crankcase ventilation system fed gas. The manner in which this effect takes hold can cause a decrease in the lubrication properties and increase in corrosiveness of the engine oil.

The origin of particulates can be attributed to sources such as background organic/inorganic materials from water sources, water treatment plants, water distribution pipelines that have deteriorated, and rehabilitation activities in the water distribution systems. In this study, a practical method is proposed for tracing particulate sources. The method entails collecting information related to hydraulic, water quality, and structural conditions, employing a network flow-path model, and establishing a database of physicochemical properties for tubercles and slimes. The proposed method was implemented within two city water distribution systems that were located in Korea. These applications were conducted to demonstrate the practical applicability of the method for providing solutions to customer complaints.

The microphysical properties of clouds such as the cloud particle size distribution, shape distribution and spatial homogeneity contribute significantly to the net radiative effect of clouds and these properties must therefore be measured and understood to determine the exact contribution of clouds to the climate system. Significant discrepancies are observed between meteorological models and observations, particularly in polar regions that are most sensitive to changes in climate, suggesting a lack of understanding of these complex microphysical processes. Remote sensing techniques such as polarimetric LIDAR and radar allow microphysical cloud measurements with high temporal and spatial resolution however these instruments must be calibrated and validated by direct in situ measurements.

These voluntary, nationally determined, non-binding pledges are the most visible feature of the reorientation of the international climate regime away from its previous emphasis on top-down international coordination, and toward a bottom-up architecture that provides greater national flexibility in order to induce broader participation. At the same time, however, the agreement to keep the rise in average global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius indicates that there is a limit to the quantity of carbon that can be emitted to meet this temperature goal, raising the challenge of how to apportion this carbon budget among states. Can a fair distribution of the carbon budget be achieved amid voluntary contributions? This paper first discusses the tension between the top-down distribution that a carbon budget approach generally implies, and the bottom-up institutional elements of the new climate architecture.

The aim is to properly know its benefits in order to make travel safe, reliable and environment-friendly. Although, with time, vehicles are becoming eco-friendlier and resourceful in energy consumption and utilization, majority of vehicles today still operate on fossil fuels and the resulting emissions are a by-product. Thus, most affordable cars and even trucks in future will continue to run on fossil fuels and might simultaneously be equipped with CVT features. Fossil-fuel dependent vehicles when fully equipped with CVT would need to accelerate or decelerate appropriately around critical junctions and locations of a network to avoid collisions. CVT in vehicles will be most appreciated for safety reasons at least at the roadway merge locations of the network. However, frequent accelerations and decelerations of the vehicles at merge points such as from ramp to freeway will also lead to increase in emissions and fuel consumption. This is precisely what this paper explores and investigates. A computer-based simulation exercise is carried out using an example of a ramp to Interstate 405 freeway merge location in Long Beach, California. Based on some basic but realistic assumptions for vehicular motion made in his paper, it is found that benefit from CVT in emission reduction is marginal for the three traffic conditions of free-flow, transitional period and rush-hour congestion. These findings will help engineers to prepare vehicles with a more sophisticated CVT that can provide better emission reductions and fuel savings at several ramp-to-freeway merge locations that exist across the city of Long Beach. © 2016 The Authors.","congestion; Connected vehicle; emissions; free-flow","Beaches; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Fuels; Location; Mergers and acquisitions; Particulate emissions; Research laboratories; Sustainable development; Variable speed transmissions; Vehicles; Computer based simulation; congestion; Emission reduction; Environment friendly; Free flow; Long Beach , California; Transitional period; Vehicle technology; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999683650

The modeling framework introduced in this paper would help such policymakers to make the appropriate investment decisions for the power sector. This paper applies an analytical model and an optimization model to investigate the implications of coimplementing an emission cap and a Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policy for the U.S. Northeast. A simplified analytical model is specified and the first order optimality conditions are derived. The results from the analytical model are verified by running simulations using LP-CEM, a linear programming-based supply cost optimization model. The LP-CEM simulation results are analyzed under the recently proposed Clean Power Plan emissions cap rules and RPS scenarios for the U.S. Northeast region. The marginal abatement cost estimates, derived from a limited set of LP-CEM runs, are analyzed and compared to the theoretical results. For encouraging renewables generation, an RPS instrument is costeffective at higher policy targets, while an emissions cap instrument is cost-effective at lower policy targets. For CO2 emissions reduction, an emissions cap instrument is found be cost-effective for all policy targets. There is a trade-off between emissions levels and supply costs when the two instruments are co-implemented. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Analytical models; Biofuels; Carbon; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Computational electromagnetics; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Investments; Linear programming; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Appropriate investment; First-order optimality condition; Implementation strategies; Marginal abatement costs; Optimization modeling; Policy interaction; Renewable portfolio standard; Running simulations; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001944011

The target brine aquifer for CO2 storage is 60 m thick sandstone/conglomerate formations at a depth range between 770 and 830 mbsf (meter below seafloor), which were verified by a seismic survey and a cored borehole (980 m deep). A number of steeply dipping and NE-striking faults cross the target aquifer. To analyze potential risk of shear activation along the faults, we characterize in situ stress state at the site. Borehole image logs showed borehole breakouts along the whole logged section to -700 mbsf, which consistently indicate an average maximum horizontal principal stress (SHIUM) direction of NW-SE. A leak-off test conducted at the bottom of a casing shoe (700 mbsf) yielded the magnitude of the minimum horizontal principal stress (Shmin) lower than the vertical stress (Sv). For the given Shmin and Sv conditions, we used the logged breakout widths and laboratory determined rock compressive strength to constrain possible SHmax magnitudes that could create the observed breakouts. We utilized our estimated stress conditions to analyze slip tendency of the faults. Additional information obtained from LOT is cap rock permeability, which suggests the formation above the storage reservoir is suitable for a leakage barrier. All regional scale faults turn out to have relatively low slip tendency under the given stress condition, suggesting a relatively low risk of triggering shear activation of faults during CO2 injection.

FLEET adopts a system dynamics-type approach in modeling airline operations as a resource allocation problem, where several variations of economic conditions, aircraft technology availability, and policy implementation initiatives can be studied. Previous work with FLEET included a ‘duopoly’ model that presented the economic competition between legacy and low cost airlines. This model solved the resource allocation problem for the two competing airlines independent of each other. The motivation for the current paper is to portray a more realistic airline market competition. We use the notion of Nash equilibrium from game theory to find local equilibrium strategies for both airline carrier types, where each airline’s operation is dependent on the other’s resource allocation solution. This work describes the resulting game theory-based duopoly model and compares the simulation results with the previously developed system dynamics-type duopoly model.

In this study, a two-phase mathematical decomposition model for the collection of multiple recyclable products using compaction trailers is presented. In the first phase of the decomposition, compaction trailer routes for each product type are generated by repeatedly solving instances of the routegeneration subproblem. In the second phase, a mixed integer linear programming is formulated for route selection and solved to determine the optimal combination of scenarios generated in the first phase to minimize total collection costs. A case study was conducted in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia using this approach for the collection of clear polyethylene terephthalate and aluminium cans. Numerical results show that the proposed optimization methodology can reduce current collection costs by 53.7%.

This revolution was based on four pillars: knowledge of the subsurface, open and competitive market, full government support and favorable mining law. Outside the US, SG and LTO development cannot rely on the same pillars. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the motivations and the possible blocking factors that could encourage five countries/regions to develop (or not) their unconventional resources. Gas exporter until 2004, Argentina imports today gas from Bolivia and LNG from the Middle East in a subsidized local market. These imports could ultimately stifle Argentina's public finances. Consequently, the authorities want to quickly develop the huge potential of the Vaca Muerta, one of the best source rocks in the world. Nevertheless, the cost of imported equipment and products as well as the monetary stability of the local currency could be blocking factors. Saudi Arabia, the world's second largest oil producer, consumes nearly 1 Mbopd to satisfy the increasing electricity demand. Unlike Iran or Qatar, Saudi Arabia has not sufficiently developed its gas potential. Therefore, it intends to extract its unconventional resources in the future, in particular the source rock of the Ghawar field. Water supply for hydraulic fracturing could be a blocking factor. China is facing a double challenge: reducing its GHG emissions by displacing its power generation from coal to gas/renewable while keeping its energy dependence at an acceptable level. Therefore, China is looking forward to develop its unconventional potential which is expected to be comparable to that of North America. The resources are located in the Tarim Basin (North West) and the Sichuan Basin (South East). The depth, the complexity of geological structures, the remoteness and the aridity of the basins make the field operations difficult and expensive. Russia is now 70% dependent on its oil and gas revenues. The potential of Russia's unconventional resources is mainly associated with the gigantic Bazhenov formation located in Western Siberia. The Russian authorities, who wish to offset their declining conventional fields, have launched a legislative process associated with tax incentives. Permafrost and subartic conditions can be blocking factors as drilling and fracturing are required all over the year. In the last 30 years, competitiveness in Europe was weighed down by an oil and gas bill that represents 75% of its debt. Developing the local resources to avoid becoming 100% dependent on the suppliers is of strategic importance. However, the development costs, the regional urbanization and the societal opposition are potential blocking factors.

Recent data suggested that the current inventory emissions estimates can be improved. To address this issue, a total of 1034 individual animal records of daily methane production (MP) was used to reassess the relationship between MP and each of dry matter intake (DMI) and gross energy intake (GEI). Data were restricted to trials conducted in the past 10 years using open-circuit respiration chambers, with cattle fed forage-based diets (forage >70%). Results from diets considered to inhibit methanogenesis were omitted from the dataset. Records were obtained from dairy cattle fed temperate forages (220 records), beef cattle fed temperate forages (680 records) and beef cattle fed tropical forages (133 records). Relationships were very similar for all three production categories and single relationships for MP on a DMI or GEI basis were proposed for national inventory purposes. These relationships were MP (g/day) ≤ 20.7 (±0.28) × DMI (kg/day) (R2 ≤ 0.92, P < 0.001) and MP (MJ/day) ≤ 0.063 (±0.008) × GEI (MJ/day) (R2 ≤ 0.93, P < 0.001). If the revised MP (g/day) approach is used to calculate Australia's national inventory, it will reduce estimates of emissions of forage-fed cattle by 24%. Assuming a global warming potential of 25 for methane, this represents a 12.6 Mt CO2-e reduction in calculated annual emissions from Australian cattle. © CSIRO 2016.","beef; dairy; emissions intensity; tropical.","cattle; dairy farming; data set; dry matter; emission inventory; estimation method; forage; global warming; methane; methanogenesis; tropical region; Australia; Animalia; Bos",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958211645

The use of accurately quantified petrophysical volumes derived from seismic data during geological model building can help improve the understanding of the reservoir and in maximizing the value of seismic data. During this case study for two sour gas carbonate reservoirs-reservoir units C & D, in an onshore Abu Dhabi field, the acoustic impedance volume from seismic inversion and the seismic data itself were further converted into a porosity volume by a probabilistic neural network (PNN) approach. This nonlinear transform approach establishes the link between seismically-derived impedance and porosity through an optimized training correlation and error method approach at each well location. A combination of the following factors pertaining to training dataset, established a successful neural network based porosity prediction workflow for the reservoirs: • Amplitude preservation of seismic data (target-reservoir specific re-processing) • Many calibration wells with good quality calculated log porosity • High quality inverted seismic impedance. A high correlation of predicted porosity to measured well porosity was achieved at all the well locations. In addition, reservoir unit C porosity grades from a very high but thinner porosity at the top to mediumhigh thicker porosity at the base, which was well resolved within the available seismic bandwidth and the PNN method of porosity prediction matched this variation of the log porosity. High cross-validation scores achieved during PNN training for porosity prediction, in effect provided the confidence in prediction away from the wells. Furthermore, a close match of predicted and measured porosity at blind test wells drilled in the field extended the confidence in the porosity prediction results. The porosity prediction successfully delineated regionally known non-porous lineaments and faults (encountered while drilling wells) on mean porosity maps of the two reservoirs. The main objective of reservoir-focused reprocessing was to minimize the amplitude damaging effects of the near-surface, mainly due to presence of large sand dunes, and adequately prepare the data for seismic inversion. Successfully estimating seismically derived porosity was an important tool for well planning, geosteering long reach horizontals and also a key input for reservoir characterization to improve our understanding and distribution of reservoir properties in our geologic model.

[1] To make the most of this abundant natural resource and at the same time reduce emissions of harmful greenhouse gases it is imperative that we fully understand the catalytic reactions which are used in methane processing - particularly in the case of methane steam reforming (MSR). MSR produces around 98% of the world's hydrogen gas supply. Additionally, MSR is one of main reactions that occur on the Ni-based anode for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). [2] MSR is our reaction of interest because the conversion of methane to syngas greatly affects the charge-transfer chemistry and consequently influences the SOFCs' performance. There are two significant issues facing MSR: (i) Coke formation; (ii) High temperatures of above 900 K. [3] To address these issues, we are interested in the effect of an electric field on this process. A large electric field can rearrange the potential energy states of molecular orbitals, alter adsorbate-surface interactions, and directly change the overall catalytic activity of Nibased catalysts. [4-8] Based on the DFT results, an electric field can greatly influence the stabilities of intermediates, the activation energies and the reaction energies of the MSR-related elementary reactions. Both the established microkinetic model and the corresponding experimental evidence of the field-dependent MSR-over-Ni have shown that the presence of a positive electric field can decrease the formation of coke and reduce the MSR reaction temperature significantly while maintaining the overall methane conversion (Figure. 1).[9-14] Therefore, the importance of considering the electric field effects on the catalytic reactions in a fuel cell system is self-evident. This information can also be used to design new electrochemical systems and to enhance the catalytic performance of Ni-based steam reforming operations.

Because the laser spot pictures obtained from the thermal infrared imager are irregular, the edge detection is an important process. The image edge is one of the most basic characteristics of the image, and it contains most of the information of the image. Generally, because of the thermal balance effect, the partly temperature of objective is no quite difference; therefore the infrared imagery's ability of reflecting the local detail of object is obvious week. At the same time, when the information of heat distribution of the thermal imagery was combined with the basic information of target, such as the object size, the relative position of field of view, shape and outline, and so on, the information just has more value. Hence, it is an important step for making image processing to extract the objective edge of the infrared imagery. Meanwhile it is an important part of image processing procedure and it is the premise of many subsequent processing. So as to extract outline information of the target from the original thermal imagery, and overcome the disadvantage, such as the low image contrast of the image and serious noise interference, and so on, the edge of thermal imagery needs detecting and processing. The principles of the Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt and Canny operator were analyzed, and then they were used to making edge detection on the thermal imageries of laser spot, which were obtained from the jamming effect experiments of CO2 laser jamming the thermal infrared imager. On the basis of the detection result, their performances were compared.

Wind energy is one of the popular renewable energy resource and this paper deals with a novel charging mechanism utilizing this resource for automatically charging the battery packs of electric vehicles (EVs). In this study, the wind speed is determined for Chennai city in India for four different seasons. The hourly average wind speed for one day has been estimated by Weibull distribution and it is compared with three different methods for the hourly averaged wind data. The results show that the power density method outperforms and the Weibull distribution fit with the wind data. The energy and power density for each season are calculated and the performance of four different small scale turbines has been evaluated. Automatic recharging can reduce the requirement of fossil fuels to generate electricity, as a result CO2 related emissions are reduced tremendously and increase of the travelling distance is minimized. Hence it is not necessary to wait for recharging in various stations and the vehicle can move long distance after one full charge by this method. The simulation result shows that the performance of small scale turbine is satisfactory and the batteries are recharged without using recharging stations. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

What's more, CO2 gas sources contain various impurities, which may have a great influence on the physical properties of CO2. So understanding the physical and chemical properties of CO2 with impurities as well as the differences of between it and pure CO2, is the basis of carrying out pipeline technology for transporting CO2. By comparing the various equations of state, we choose PR equation to calculate the phase state and physical properties of CO2 containing impurities. In addition, we have used HYSYS software conduct research on 30 MT/a CO2 with impurities of Yan Chang Oilfield. The study shows that its critical point is T=30.37°C, P=7.55MPa. Compared with the pure CO2, its critical temperature reduces, critical pressure rises, and there is a two-phase region in the phase diagram, which indicates that the existence of impurities makes it harder to convey CO2 in the pipeline. In the vicinity of critical point, tiny changes from pressure and temperature will make its density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and compression coefficient vary in a large range. Currently, China hasn't established long-distance pipeline to transport CO2, and we also lack the experience of conveying CO2 with impurities in pipeline. However, the physical properties of CO2 containing impurities is primary problem to solve in the pipeline transportation. This paper supplies some its physical properties, which is the fundamental work of developing pipeline transportation for CO2.","CCUS; CO2 containing impurities; Pipeline transportation","Equations of state; Oil fields; Oil well flooding; Physical properties; Pipeline terminals; Pipelines; Thermal conductivity; Two phase flow; CCUS; Compression coefficients; Critical temperatures; Long distance pipelines; Physical and chemical properties; Pipe-line transportations; Pipeline technology; Pressure and temperature; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035067360

However, long-term precipitation and drought series can be developed using tree-ring data, which offers researchers the ability to extend limited instrumental precipitation and drought data back several centuries. Water scarcity is the primary limiting factor in the sustainable development of Urumqi, the largest city in arid central Asia. In this study, a regional tree-ring chronology from Picea schrenkiana is used to reconstruct previous July-current June total precipitation for the Urumqi region and place the gauged precipitation (1957-2008) in a long-term, multi-century context. The precipitation reconstruction explains 52.1% of the actual precipitation variance during the common period (1957-2008) and contains a strong regional drought signal for the Tien Shan region. This reconstruction successfully captured the wetting trend that occurred from the 1980s to the 2000s and generally agreed with dry periods previously estimated from tree-ring records obtained from the surrounding areas.

However, the lack of knowledge concerning embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of cities has hampered effective mitigation. We analyse trans-boundary GHG emission transfers between five Australian cities and their trading partners, with embodied emission flows broken down into major economic sectors. We examine intercity carbon footprint (CF) networks and disclose a hierarchy of responsibility for emissions between cities and regions. Allocations of emissions to households, businesses and government and the carbon efficiency of expenditure have been analysed to inform mitigation policies. Our findings indicate that final demand in the five largest cities in Australia accounts for more than half of the nation's CF. City households are responsible for about two thirds of the cities' CFs; the rest can be attributed to government and business consumption and investment. The city network flows highlight that over half of emissions embodied in imports (EEI) to the five cities occur overseas. However, a hierarchy of GHG emissions reveals that overseas regions also outsource emissions to Australian cities such as Perth. We finally discuss the implications of our findings on carbon neutrality, low-carbon city concepts and strategies and allocation of subnational GHG responsibility. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Carbon accounting; Carbon footprint (CF); Cities; City carbon map; Multi-region input-output modelling; Urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions","Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Carbon accounting; Carbon neutralities; Cities; Embodied emissions; Input-output; Low-carbon cities; Mitigation policies; Political leadership; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982899866

Saline aquifers, coal beds, depleted oil and gas reservoirs are all ideal locations for greenhouse gas storage. For a sedimentary basin, CO2 can exist in gas, liquid or supercritical fluid phase state. It will cause totally different response for the seismic waves where seismic methods are widely used for sequestration monitoring. To better understand the phase transition effect, ultrasonic experiments were conducted in 6 natural cores with fully saturated brine and CO2, respectively. Due to the significant difference in compressibility, the obvious inflexions for both P-wave velocity and amplitude were concluded to be caused by the phase transitions. In addition, an increase in dew point pressure of CO2 in porous media was observed. Temperature and rock porosity are two key factors which dominates these changes. © 2015 Energy Institute.

In the greenhouse gas-forced scenario, reduction of radiative cooling and increase in continental surface temperature occur much more rapidly than changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Without changes in SSTs, the early summer rainfall in the monsoon region decreases (increases) over ocean (land) in most models. On longer time scales, as SSTs increase, rainfall changes are opposite. The total response to atmospheric CO2 forcing and subsequent SST warming is a large (modest) increase in rainfall over ocean (land) in the EASM region. Dynamic changes, in spite of significant contributions from the thermodynamic component, play an important role in setting up the spatial pattern of precipitation changes. Early summer rainfall anomalies over east China are a direct consequence of local land-sea contrast, while changes in the large-scale oceanic rainfall band are closely associated with the displacement of the larger-scale North Pacific subtropical high (NPSH). Ad hoc numerical simulations with the AM2.1 general circulation model show that topography and SST patterns play an important role in early summer rainfall changes in the EASM region. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Atm/Ocean Structure/Phenomena; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Monsoons; Physical Meteorology and Climatology; Sea surface temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Rain; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; East Asian summer monsoon; General circulation model; Monsoons; Regional climate changes; Sea surface temperature (SST); Sea surface temperatures; Surface temperatures; Climate change; atmospheric forcing; carbon dioxide; climate change; climatology; CMIP; meteorology; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sea surface temperature; summer; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046419418

However, most studies have failed to facilitate identifying MSW management schemes capable of comprehensively meeting the goals from decision-makers at different hierarchical levels under uncertainties. This study develops an inexact bi-level linear programming (IBLP) model for collaborative control of GHG emissions and waste management in Beijing: MGU-MCL. The MGU-MCL model implies a leader-follower decision process, with the environmental sector providing the upper-level objective and the local authority dominating the lower-level objective. Then, an interactive fuzzy possiblistic approach is introduced to represent the satisfactory degrees of different decision-making levels. Results show that the MGU-MCL model decisions would reduce GHG emissions by about 9%, but increase management costs by 4% compared with the decisions from conventional models; the contribution of the landfill facilities to GHG emissions would be predominant, especially methane emissions; while the composting and incineration facilities would account for a large proportion of management cost. Further comparative analysis among the bi-level and single-level models indicates that the bi-level model could provide coordinated schemes under an integrated consideration of economic efficiency and environmental impact. © 2016, HARD Publishing Company.

New climate models, such as the Community Climate System Model, version 3.5 (CCSM3.5), are now able to resolve the Agulhas retroflection and constrain the inertially choked Agulhas leakage to more realistic values. These ocean-eddy-resolving climate models are poised to bolster understanding of the sensitivity and influence of Agulhas leakage in the coupled climate system. Here, a strategy is devised to quantify Agulhas leakage in CCSM3.5 by applying an offline Lagrangian particle-tracking approach, finding a mean interbasin transport of 11.2 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s-1). It is shown that monthly mean outputs can be used to produce a reliable time series of Agulhas leakage variability on longer-than-seasonal time scales (correlation coefficient r = 0.88; p &lt; 0.01) by comparing to a parallel simulation that archives daily mean fields every 5 days.

Current construction management practice lacks methods to track carbon footprint of the construction phase since the application of life cycle assessment (LCA) methods has remained primarily limited to design and operation phases of a project. In addition, the current methods heavily rely on user inputs on materials and the state of planned-vs.-actual work-in-progress. The presented framework addresses existing inefficiencies by leveraging 4D building information models (BIM) in conjunction with LCA tools to benchmark carbon footprint during pre-construction phases and monitor it during the construction phase. The management framework - built on earned value management concepts - offers metrics to assess and communicate deviations between benchmarked and actual carbon footprint, and facilitates root-cause assessments to minimize performance deviations, and excessive carbon footprints. As a full proof-of-concept, an extended case study is conducted on a real-world project. The application of the proposed management framework as a mechanism for increased environmental product data in the supply chain, establishing policies requiring adherence to a carbon footprint budget during project tendering, and incentivizing reductions in carbon footprint through a cap-and-trade scheme are discussed in detail. © ASCE.",,"Architectural design; Budget control; Emission control; Life cycle; Project management; Supply chains; Value engineering; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction projects; Current construction; Design and operations; Earned value management; Environmental products; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management frameworks; Carbon footprint",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976427987

In this paper, a new scheme, namely GAFUCS, is developed for the energy management of parallel hybrid vehicles. In order to enhance the performance in uncertainty and dynamic environment, as well as to improve the performance under different driving conditions, the operation is accomplished in two tiers, namely Tier-1 and Tier-2. With the sufficient principle design of Tier-2, GAFUCS fuses Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) by performing a real time operation. Hence GAFUCS is a more robust, efficient and accurate scheme than [16] originally invented by authors. It is shown that the new scheme produces less pollutants and carbon dioxide by reducing the consumption of petroleum. Based on various realistic driving conditions, the SOC and the fuel capacity, three hundred (300) have been investigated. Evaluation reveals that GAFUCS achieves an average improvement of 35.5%. It is evaluated that GAFUCS achieves an improvement of 16.6% compared to FGAS. GAFUCS thus is a new control scheme and is proven to be the most efficient scheme for energy efficiency management and emissions reduction for PHEVs. © 2016","2-Tier Fuzzy Logic (FL); Energy management; Fuel capacity; Fuel efficiency; Genetic Algorithm (GA); Parallel hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV); State of charge of the battery (SOC)","Battery management systems; Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Computer circuits; Emission control; Energy management; Fuel economy; Fuels; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid vehicles; 2-Tier Fuzzy Logic (FL); Dynamic environments; Efficiency managements; Fuel efficiency; Parallel hybrid electric vehicles; Parallel hybrid vehicle; Real-time operation; State of charge; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016133336

However, there is limited knowledge on how the planning and promotion of synergies between M + A can be operationalized in the current efforts to mitigate climate change through forest carbon. This paper contributes to fill this knowledge gap by exploring ways of planning and promoting M + A synergy outcomes in forest carbon initiatives. It examines eight guidelines that are widely used in designing and implementing forest carbon initiatives. Four guiding principles with a number of criteria that are relevant for planning synergy outcomes in forest carbon activities are proposed. The guidelines for developing forest carbon initiatives need to demonstrate that (1) the health of forest ecosystems is maintained or enhanced; (2) the adaptive capacity of forest-dependent communities is ensured; (3) carbon and adaptation benefits are monitored and verified; and (4) adaptation outcomes are anticipated and planned in forest carbon initiatives. The forest carbon project development guidelines can encourage the integration of adaptation in forest carbon initiatives. However, their current efforts guiding projects and programs to deliver biodiversity and environmental benefits, ecosystem services, and socioeconomic benefits are not considered explicitly as efforts towards enhancing adaptation. An approach for incentivizing and motivating project developers, guideline setters, and offset buyers is imperative in order to enable existing guidelines to make clear contributions to adaptation goals. We highlight and discuss potential ways of incentivizing and motivating the explicit planning and promotion of adaptation outcomes in forest carbon initiatives. © 2016 by the authors.","Adaptation; Biodiversity and social benefits; Carbon stocks sustainability; Forest carbon; Mitigation; Synergy","Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Land use; Mergers and acquisitions; Motivation; Sustainable development; Adaptation; Carbon stocks; Forest carbons; Mitigation; Social benefits; Synergy; Forestry; adaptive management; biodiversity; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest ecosystem; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957583761

Among potential alternatives, particular attention has been recently addressed toward the exploitation of residual biomass and wastes as sources for syngas production by thermo-chemical processes for heat and power production. Fruits processing industries generate important amount of residues, which must be managed properly by recycling, incineration or land filling. Due to the high carbon content, these residues represent a significant source of energy that could be valorized by gasification processes. Hence, our attention was focused on the energy recovery from orange peels residues produced by a Sicilian agro-industrial company by steam gasification. Thermodynamic and experimental analysis were carried out. Experiments were performed in a fixed bed laboratory scale reactor working with catalytic materials (Ni/Al2O3, MgO and dolomite mineral) with the biomass in order to investigate the influence of experimental conditions on the outlet stream compositions, mainly in terms of hydrogen content of the produced syngas. Results were compared to thermodynamic data in order to gain information of the experimental method used. The results have confirmed successfully the experimental results compared with the simulation data. The highest concentration (65.9%) of hydrogen volume in the syngas mixture was reached with dolomite mineral as catalyst. © 2016 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Gasification; Organic waste; Product gas; Residues; Syngas",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019758800

The urgency for its development was partly driven by a record precipitation and flood event that occurred on July 8th, 2013, when an intense storm caused extensive flooding to key transportation assets and services in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. This event, and other stresses caused by a changing climate, has raised questions about the vulnerability of the regional transit system, and the need for the development and implementation of a resiliency and adaptation plan. While Metrolinx currently manages about $11 Billion in assets, the need to consider vulnerability and risk to future climate is further heightened in consideration of an additional $16 Billion-$50 Billion in transit investment that is expected over the next 10-20 years through the implementation of the Regional Transportation Plan, the expansion of the Regional Express Rail, and the construction of new Rapid Transit lines for light rail and buses. Understanding and effectively planning for increased vulnerability and risk to extreme weather and climate change is thus essential in terms of Metrolinx being able to manage existing and future infrastructure assets in a manner that ensures that the regional transit system is both sustainable and resilient. This paper outlines progress to date at Metrolinx to develop a resiliency and adaptation program that will lead to the establishment of a Corporate Climate Adaptation Plan. The key steps that were undertaken in year 1 are covered, that includes the creation of an internal resiliency working group, a benchmarking report comparing Metrolinx to best practices, and the application of the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Protocol to a selection of key critical assets, including rail corridors, stations, and maintenance facilities. In year 2 potential lessons learned from the PIEVC study are being used to inform the pathway forward that includes identifying high risk assets and developing climate adaptation management plans, and identifying opportunities where mainstreaming resiliency to extreme weather and climate change can be effectively applied across the organization in its practices and protocols. © 2016 TAC.",,"Benchmarking; Extreme weather; Floods; Investments; Light rail transit; Rapid transit; Changing climate; Infrastructure assets; Maintenance facility; Management plans; Public infrastructures; Regional transportation; Transit investments; Transit systems; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090538334

In Africa, managing climate change is hampered by Africa’s adaptation deficit as caused by a lack of institutional, financial or technological capacity to adapt effectively; and a lack of effective delivery mechanisms to channel climate finance resources at the sub-national level, particularly to target the poor who are also often the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In-order to encourage debate and discussion on the role to which microfinance may have in improving climate change mitigation and adaptation, this paper expounds upon the Microfinance-Climate Finance Framework that was shortlisted for the 2014 UNDP MDG Carbon Climate Finance Innovation Award. The paper shows that microfinance institutions in Africa may be sustainable mechanisms for financing climate change initiatives whilst promoting rural development and financial inclusion.

To achieve this goal, substantial financial and technological investments will be required at a rate far exceeding historical levels. Sub-Saharan Africa has a 30.5% electrification rate and policy reform issues to improve electrification have been poorly implemented thereby sprinkling doubt as to whether the region would be able to achieve 100% access to electricity for all by the year 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa faces a tough challenge in-order to achieve universal access to modern energy services since the region fails to attract energy sector investments. There is also a general perception that the region contributes very little to global greenhouse gas emissions hence offers few opportunities to reduce these emissions consequently missing out on attracting climate finance projects. A guarantee of power purchase has been shown to attract energy sector investments. However, guarantees of power purchases such as Feed-in Tariffs, are experiencing slow market growth in developing countries because of a range of technical, regulatory and financial barriers. Using Malawi as a case study of a developing country, this review provides a perspective from a Sub-Saharan Africa Least Developed Country as to the various electrification, renewable energy deployment and climate change management challenges that still require urgent attention. This study shows that despite the perceived regulatory and financial challenges, Malawi can integrate and use a combination of (adapted) price guarantee schemes, cross subsidies and environmental taxes in-order to support initiatives aimed at supporting the country׳s development of renewable energy sources and hence indirectly support the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); Climate finance; Feed-in Tariff (FIT); Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); Rural electrification; Sustainable Energy for All Initiative","Climate change; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Finance; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Clean Development Mechanism; Feed-in tariff; Millennium development goals; Rural electrification; Sustainable energy; Investments",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979784991

In a Smart Community, energy supply and demand system is developing to manage with ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to utilize energy efficiently and increase the amount of renewable energy. In one of the systems, ""Photovoltaic power generator (hereinafter referred to as PV) &amp; Electric Vehicle (hereinafter referred to as EV) Smart System"" has been developed. In the ""PV &amp; EV Smart System"", PV power is charged directly to the EV battery, and then the charged PV power is consumed by running and air-conditioning energy of a car and supplied to a home. This system is able to reduce the quantity of CO2 emissions with high economic efficiency. In order to expand the system, it is necessary to spread EV. So, it should solve the issues of short driving distance, the high cost of storage battery and the risk of dead battery. Therefore, the authors have proposed an advanced EV such as AI-EV (Airconditioner Integrated Electric Vehicle). AI-EV has a novel hybrid system which drives the air-conditioning system and generates electric power in the case of a low air-conditioning load through the use of a small-engine. PV power can not only reduce car fuels but also replace with gas and liquid fuels which are used at a home, causing the huge effect of reducing CO2 emissions as the whole system. In this paper, a novel energy system which is integrated with solar power, advanced electric vehicle and CO2 heat pump water heater as home heat pumps has been proposed. A mathematical simulation model which evaluates for the PV power generation, AI-EV energy consumption and home heat pumps has been developed. CO2 emissions and economic efficiency are calculated and compared with those of the conventional system. As the result, the novel energy system is able to reduce more than 30% of the quantity of CO2 emissions in comparison with the conventional system as the whole system, and the system can reduce about 60% of the quantity of CO2 emissions in comparison with the conventional system as a home system. The economic efficiency is evaluated by more than 6.0% of IRR (Internal Rate of Return) without some subsidies when the legal service life of the depreciation equipment is assumed 14 years. Therefore, the novel energy system can be widely spread in the future. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Air conditioning; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Earnings; Economics; Electric batteries; Electric drives; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Heat pump systems; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Information management; Intelligent buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Vehicles; Wind power; Air conditioning load; Conventional systems; Heat pump water heater; Information and Communication Technologies; Internal rate of return; Mathematical simulation model; Novel energy systems; Photovoltaic power generators; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001959410

Under miscible conditions, higher recovery is obtained by simultaneous improvement in displacement and vertical sweepout. A compositional model for CO2-LPG-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) was applied to investigate the complicated phenomenon more accurately. The influences of LPG concentration and composition on the displacement and sweep efficiencies during CO2-LPG EOR were examined. Enhanced displacement efficiency was assessed through oil density, viscosity, and the interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and gas. Moreover, the miscible flooding induced by LPG addition resulted in increased solvent viscosity and a lower density difference between the injected fluid and reservoir oil. It also provided a smaller viscous gravity number and improved the sweep efficiency, alleviating the impact of solvent gravity override. As the mole fraction of the total injected LPG and the LPG butane contents increased, significant increments in oil recovery were obtained from the reduction of MMP, oil viscosity, and IFT. The oil viscosity was reduced to 0.65 cp by CO2 and 0.26 cp with the addition of 25% LPG leading to miscible condition. In CO2-swept regions, the IFT became non-zero due to the immiscible conditions. The addition of 25% LPG into the CO2 stream resulted in negligible IFT in the swept area, indicating miscible conditions. For CO2 flooding, 11.9% of the total reservoir area remained in unswept and immiscible conditions despite the long production time. In contrast, the unswept area was reduced to only 2.4% of the total area when 25% LPG was injected into the CO2 stream under miscible conditions, and the viscous gravity number decreased to 0.9 from 3.8 in the CO2 flooding case. For CO2-LPG EOR, oil recovery increased up to 52% as compared with that for CO2 flooding. The amount of incremental oil recovery with 100% butane in the LPG was 16%, as compared with the 100% propane case. Mitigated gravity override enabled CO2-LPG EOR to enhance sweep efficiency. Results indicated that the efficiency of the EOR process with the addition of LPG as evaluated in the compositional model provided more accurate prediction on the performance of CO2-LPG EOR.

To this end, we investigated microclimate differences within an urban park (the Singapore Botanic Gardens) to assess if variations in plot-scale land cover affect both objective (measured) and subjective (surveyed) microclimate data. Over two monsoonal seasons, we obtained data from four distinct sites-a tropical rainforest stand, a palm tree valley, a water-body feature, and the park visitors' centre. Measured climate data (e.g. air temperature, vapour pressure, wind velocity and globe temperatures) were used to derive mean radiant temperature Tmrt and three thermal comfort indices (e.g. temperature-humidity index THI, physiological equivalent temperature PET, and wet-bulb globe temperature WBGT). Concurrent to these measurements, we also surveyed park users (n = 1573) for perceived microclimate sensations and preferences in thermal, humidity, wind and sun exposure, as well as their overall assessment of climate comfort/discomfort. The results indicate significant differences in both measured and perceived microclimates over different sites and seasons, with (i) selected heat stress thresholds based on thermal comfort indices exceeded at several sites, and (ii) visitors perceived generally hot, humid and low-wind conditions throughout. Variations in respondent acclimatisation to tropical climates are observed between correlations of WBGT and some sensation votes, with apparently stronger correlations with more acclimated respondents. While humidity was voted as the most uncomfortable climate variable across all sites, a large majority of respondents felt comfortable climate conditions throughout. Present results confirm that vegetation canopy characteristics affecting wind and sun exposure appear to be important factors in outdoor thermal comfort. Lastly, we suggest that future tropical outdoor thermal comfort studies consider the critical aspects of site humidity and wind to discern comfort/discomfort levels. © 2016 The Authors.","Outdoor thermal comfort; Tropical microclimate; Urban parks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961898759

In northern Australia, heifers generally graze poorer-quality subtropical pastures and in the absence of energy-dense supplementary feed during periods of low pasture growth, liveweight (LW) gain can be restricted. This modelling study examined the time required and enteric methane (CH4) emissions produced in raising dairy heifers to a target LW for first mating by feeding a diet assuming either constant (static) or variable (dynamic) nutritive values. Using a static approach (Australian Feeding Standards methodology), and assuming a target mating LW of 360 kg, growing heifers reached their target LW at ∼18 months of age while consuming C4 grasses with a constant metabolisable energy content of 9.5 MJ/kg dry matter (DM) or 11 months of age on a diet of 11.0 MJ/kg DM. Enteric CH4 emissions were 1.2 and 0.8 t of carbon dioxide equivalents/heifer over the 18- and 11-month periods, respectively. To explore the extent with which climatic conditions influence seasonal pasture availability and nutritive value with a dynamic approach, we used a whole-farm biophysical model (SGS pasture model) to simulate diets with mean metabolisable energy values of 9.5 and 10.9 MJ/ kg DM. On average (±s.d.), heifers required 22 ± 4 and 17 ± 1 months, respectively, to reach target LW, with cumulative enteric CH4 emissions of 1.22 ± 0.20 and 0.72 ± 0.04 t carbon dioxide equivalents, respectively. The dynamic approach resulted in slower LW gain due to the variable nutritive value of the diet throughout the year, resulting in seasonal periods of LW plateauing or decline. Maintaining heifers on high-quality diets in subtropical northern Australia should result in increased daily LW gain, lower enteric CH4 emissions to mating LW and earlier calving. Together, these factors reduce their lifetime emission intensity of milk production. © CSIRO 2016.","greenhouse gas emissions; liveweight gain; SGS pasture model; subtropical pastures.","cattle; diet; emission; emission control; environmental modeling; greenhouse gas; methane; milk production; nutritive value; pasture; subtropical region; weight; Australia; Poaceae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958205919

This regulation affects new, modified, or reconstructed oil and gas sources from the wellhead to the city gate, including production facilities, natural gas processing plants, and compressor stations. While clearly this particular rule does not directly apply to the refining sector, does EPA's methane regulation agenda have the potential to affect the petroleum refining sector? There are several predominant themes in NSPS OOOOa, but the most significant are the increased focus on methane as a greenhouse gas compound and the heavy emphasis on fugitive emissions. EPA has also clearly signaled a strong preference for optical gas imaging (OGI) using infrared cameras as a means of detecting emissions, highly detailed fugitive emission monitoring plans, and the use of Next Generation approaches to recordkeeping and reporting. EPA also backed away from the concept of ""skip period monitoring"" and detailed fugitive emissions component counts including data tracking. EPA would have to go through a significant rulemaking effort to modify existing refinery regulations (for example, NSPS GGG/GGGa do not address these topics). EPA's Regulatory Agenda does not list these issues as a potential topic, so it is not likely that the current Administration will propose any changes. However, it may be prudent for the refinery sector to track these developments. In addition, EPA continues to demonstrate the ability to pursue more aggressive approaches through enforcement and use those accomplishments to drive future rulemaking, something the oil & gas sector is seeing clear evidence of at this time.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019013779

The chemical composition of their cell wall affects the development of fungal ligninolytic enzyme system as well as its ability to degrade lignin from the plant cell wall. Additionally, numerous compounds structurally similar to lignin can be degraded by the G. lucidum enzyme system which could take important roles in various biotechnological processes. The laccases, which are the dominant enzymes synthesized by G. lucidum, have been studied more extensively than the Mn-oxidizing peroxidases. Therefore, this study aimed to create the dynamics profile of Mn-oxidizing peroxidases activities in four G. lucidum strains, classifying and determining their properties depending on the cultivation type and plant residue as a carbon source in the medium, as well as to establish whether intraspecific variety exists. The findings suggest that submerged cultivation appeared to be a more appropriate cultivation type for enzyme activities compared with solid-state cultivation, and oak sawdust was a better carbon source than wheat straw. Under the optimum conditions, on day 14, G. lucidum BEOFB 431 was characterized by the highest levels of both Mn-dependent and Mn-independent peroxidase activities (4795.5 and 5170.5 U/L, respectively).

These emissions mainly result from energy, agricultural, transport and waste sectors. Several groups of scientists in Latvia using different models have estimated necessary measures to achieve expected non-ETS target, however, it seems difficult to implement these proposals by defining state policy. One of the reasons is high uncertainty about socioeconomic impacts. This article proposes that other reason may be lack of common climate change and other sustainability indicators as well as methodology, which makes difficult to compare results from different models, as well as to compare economical effect of measures proposed for different non-ETS sectors. Other problem is that modelling usually focuses on one particular target (for example non-ETS), however policy makers must focus on implementation of different sometimes synergic (non-ETS and energy efficiency), but sometimes contradictory (non-ETS and agricultural development) targets. © 2016 The Authors.","climate change policy; literature review; low-carbon strategy; non-ETS; sustainability indicators; the case of Latvia","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate models; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International law; Sustainable development; Climate change policies; Literature reviews; Low-carbon strategies; non-ETS; Sustainability indicators; the case of Latvia; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999268289

It was therefore a big challenge to maintain the citizens’ participation and to minimize panel dropout. The aim of this chapter is to investigate the extent of dropout during the processes and to understand the reasons behind it. In fact, there were two kinds of dropout. Of 1159 registered panelists at all seven sites, 36 % withdrew before entering any data for the CO2e-monitoring process, a central component of the panels’ activities (dropout 1). A further 27 % dropped out during the subsequent period of up to 2 years (dropout 2), many of them as early as in the first 2–4 months. A survey was undertaken to determine the factors that led to the decision to drop out. The most common reasons were that participation cost too much time and that data collection and entry were not trivial but quite complex tasks. To some extent, the usability of the monitoring instruments employed also caused difficulties. Another critical constant was that many dropouts did not see any possibility of further improving their carbon footprint. Less common reasons were that panelists who dropped out expected no or only relatively low effects on climate protection, did not experience energy savings or were not ready to change their lifestyles. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Climate protection; Expect value model; Rational choice theory; Technology acceptance model; Time budget",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060159373

This chapter provides an answer to this question, taking as example seven citizen panels on local climate targets in Austria, Germany, and Spain within the e2democracy (e2d) research project. The citizen panels were part of collaborative (e-)participation processes of citizens and businesses with local governments aimed at reducing carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) by at least 2 % per annum over a period of up to 2 years. After the first year, the majority of panelists in the five Austro-German panels achieved or surpassed the target; in both Spanish panels, less than half did so; after the second year, the percentages of target achievers somewhat declined. So, even though many participants achieved their reduction target, a considerable number of participants did not reach it or reduced their efforts in the second year. Across all seven panels, savings could particularly be achieved in the heating energy and electricity sections. In the fields of nutrition and consumer goods, there were even cases where emissions increased. For the mobility fields of private and public transportation as well as flights, no homogeneous tendencies could be observed among the panels. Overall, even though the size of countable CO2e reductions was not that high, citizen panels were particularly successful in achieving a reconsideration of the panelists’ lifestyles and habits and, to some extent, encouraged effective change processes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Carbon balance; Climate action; Consumption area; Public transport; Target achiever",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060157552

These challenges suggest that a combination of different methodological approaches is the best option to assess the ecological impact of the citizen panels on the collective level. Results show that, depending on the kind of calculation, some panels met the reduction targets completely, others partially, and one did not at all. However, reductions in CO2e are the general trend, even in those panels that fail to achieve the target. So, altogether, improvements of the CO2e balances on the collective level have been achieved. An important finding is that the results of the panels (improvements or deteriorations) are the same after 1 year of measuring and after 2 years.

All these clinical entities are slow growing. Salivary glands reactive lesions, such as mucoceles, can result from extravasation of saliva into the surrounding soft tissue or from retention of saliva within the duct. Sialolithiasis, one of the most common obstructive lesions, is generally due to calculi, which are attributed to retention of saliva. Monomorphic adenoma is a salivary gland benign tumor, which is exclusively resulted from proliferation of epithelial cells, with no alterations interesting the connective tissue. The elective therapy of these lesions is surgical excision because sometimes they can be accompained by difficulties during chewing and phonation and can interfere with prosthesis's stability. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CO2 laser in the treatment of patients with salivary gland diseases. Three different cases-a mucocele, a scialolithiasis and a monomorphic adenoma-were treated with CO2 laser excision (CW and 4W), under local anesthesia. Two different techniques were used: circumferential incision for the adenoma, and mucosa preservation technique for mucocele and sialolithiasis. In each case final haemostasis was obtained by thermocoagulation, but suture was applied to guarantee good healing by sewing up the flaps. The patients were checked after twenty days and the healing was good. The carbon dioxide laser (CO2 laser) was one of the earliest gas laser to be developed, and is still the highest-power continuous wave laser that is currently available. In dentistry the CO2 laser produces a beam of infrared light with the principal wavelength bands centering around 9.4 and 10.6 micrometers. Laser excision can be very useful in oral surgery. In the cases presented CO2 laser offered, differently from traditional surgery, simplified surgical technique, shorter duration of operation, minimal postoperative pain, minimal scarring, bloodless field and the possibility to realize minimally invasive surgery. These advantages made the operation tolerable for the patients, that became more compliant. Optimum functional results can be expected. © 2016 SPIE.","CO2 laser; Mucosa preservation technique; Salivary gland diseases; Surgical treatment","Biomineralization; Biotechnology; Body fluids; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide lasers; Collagen; Continuous wave lasers; Dentistry; Diseases; Gas lasers; Musculoskeletal system; Patient treatment; Surgery; Tissue; Transplantation (surgical); Tumors; Connective tissues; Epithelial cells; Minimally invasive surgery; Preservation techniques; Salivary glands; Surgical excision; Surgical techniques; Surgical treatment; Laser surgery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971219428

Vulnerability assessments, facilitated through transversal household surveys toward the end of the rainy season that covered the entire city and followed a stratified sampling approach, showed that the community's water supply comprises more than 100 wells, 33% of households report using water from wells for drinking purposes, 12% of households have their own wells in the yard, and 69% of households have latrines in the yard. The analysis also revealed considerable spatial heterogeneity of vulnerability. Considering the risks of cross-contamination of wells water by onsite sanitation facilities during flood events, communities and local governance actors should find appropriate adaptation to climate change strategies for water and health sectors starting with thematic vulnerability maps.

The catchment of the Nevėžis River, the sixth longest river in Lithuania, is among the most affected by agricultural activities. Although seriously disturbed by land reclamation and agricultural pollution, the Nevėžis River still has natural, anthropogenically unaffected stretches. Fish species were studied at two sites of the upper part of the river with different hydrological regime, exhibiting clear differences in the trophic status of fish. The combined effect of hydrogeomorphic and water-chemistry variability on the stable isotope composition of fish assemblages in Lithuania has not been investigated. The presently reported study was intended to explore the possible effects of the riverbed morphology and agricultural activities on the chemistry and stable isotope composition of the three main fish species. Materials and methods. This study covered three species of freshwater fishes: the European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; the roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); and the northern pike, Esox lucius Linnaeus, 1758. The sampling was performed in both natural and regulated river stretches using backpack electrofishing equipment. Stable isotope composition of the samples was revealed by applying stable isotope analyses (SIA) with an elemental analyser connected to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. To obtain more information about environmental variability and variation of stable isotopes δ13C and δ15N in fish, the entire data matrix was analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results. In the study sites on the Nevėžis River, algal carbon isotope ratios were more 13C- depleted than those from terrestrial sources. The fishes were clearly dependent on terrestrial carbon sources in natural locations. However, the fishes collected from regulated sites had carbon isotope signatures more similar to algal than to terrestrial sources. Mean values of δ15N of the fishes from the natural sites were lower than those from the regulated ones. Conclusion. The presently reported study revealed impact of abiotic habitat variables indicating the importance of physicochemical and morphological characteristics on δ13C and δ15N isotopic values variance of fish at natural and regulated river sites. Our findings would help to evaluate and predict changes on river food webs that occur due to hydromorphological alterations determined by human activity and climate change. The results could be useful for fisheries, i.e., impact of environmental factors on fish nutrition and growth. © 2016, Scientific Society of Szczecin.

Specifically, the resilience of our transportation infrastructure to climate and the impact of our transportation systems on the aquatic environment are important to both state and federal decision makers. In is important that new, innovative approaches be developed that consider both the robustness of our infrastructure today and its ability to cope with forecasted extremes due to climate change. This paper presents ongoing research associated with the broad regional application of a hydrologic vulnerability framework for road-stream crossings. A calibrated, process-based hydrological model is used to develop estimates of flood flows at various return frequencies. Road-stream crossings are identified and the maximum critical flows for these crossings are calculated. Daily-runoff from the hydrological model is coupled with a statistical index-method to determine the average recurrence interval for flood flows at ungaged locations. Finally, a vulnerability analysis is performed that maps the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of the critical flow through crossing infrastructure to the estimated AEP of flood flows at the crossing locations. This study supports the development of a decision-support tool for prioritizingculvert repair and replacement in the region. It also creates a more robust infrastructure design that suggests adaptation strategies in conjunction with climate information.",,"Climate models; Crossings (pipe and cable); Decision making; Decision support systems; Floods; Hydraulics; Hydrology; Rivers; Roads and streets; Runoff; Transportation; Water resources; Adaptation strategies; Annual exceedance probabilities (AEP); Decision support tools; Hydrological modeling; Infrastructure design; Transportation infrastructures; Vulnerability analysis; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976502919

It is therefore necessary to understand the mechanics behind injection strategies which are capable of reducing these emissions while also maintaining the performance and efficiency of the engine. This study investigates the effect of varying the number fuel injection events and equivalence ratio on the operation of a wall-guided SIDI (WG-SIDI) engine. Of particular interest is how increased mixture homogeneity achieved by the double injection events impacts in-cylinder conditions and flame development. Performance parameters derived from in-cylinder pressure data are analysed alongside high speed natural flame chemiluminescence images in order to obtain relationships between engine output and the physical properties associated with air/fuel mixing and flame propagation. Compared to the single injection event, the results show that the double injection strategy leads to significantly higher net indicated mean effective pressure (IMEPn) and total heat release for the same fuel mass, which is consistent with the increased flame propagation speed. The mechanisms behind this trend are then further explored through the analysis of flame shape parameters such as flame boundary eccentricity, orientation and apparent flame boundary deviation (i.e. a wrinkling level) of the line-of-sight integrated image. It is found that single injection strategies tend to result in stretched flame fronts with a high elliptical eccentricity, regardless of equivalence ratio. The orientation of the semi-major axis of this elliptical flame is perpendicular to the injection momentum axis and is aligned closely with the tumble flow axis, indicating that fuel inhomogeneity occurring along the path of the fuel jet is a significant factor for flame distortion. Compared to the single injection strategy, the flame eccentricity is consistently lower for the double injection events, likely due to increased mixture homogeneity. Changes in the deviation in flame boundaries are found to be due to the global eccentric nature of the flame, rather than increased localised wrinkling of the apparent flame front; and, the difference in apparent flame boundary wrinkling across both injection strategies is either non-existent or too negligible to be resolved by the method used in this study, suggesting the wrinkling is not significantly impacted by localised regions of lean or rich mixture but is due entirely to turbulence intensity and length scale. © 2016 SAE International.",,"Air engines; Chemiluminescence; Diesel engines; Engine cylinders; Fighter aircraft; Fuels; Image analysis; Mixing; Mixtures; Flame propagation speed; Flame-chemiluminescence; In-cylinder pressures; Indicated mean effective pressure; Performance parameters; Port fuel injections; Turbulence intensity; Unburned hydrocarbons; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018372615

Abatement potential in Latin America, among other things, is influenced by its development status, the large contributions of non-CO2 and land use change CO2 emissions, and energy endowments. In most scenarios in this study, the economic potential to reduce fossil fuel CO2 as well as non-CO2 emissions in Latin America in 2050 is lower than in the rest of the world (in total) when measured against 2010 emissions, due largely to higher emission growth in Latin America than in the rest of the world in the absence of abatement. The potential to reduce land use change CO2 emissions is complicated by a wide range of factors and is not addressed in this paper (land use emissions are largely addressed in a companion paper). The study confirms the results of previous research that the variation in abatement costs across models may vary by an order of magnitude or more, limiting the value of these assessments and supporting continued calls for research on the degree to which models are effectively representing key local circumstances that influence costs and available abatement options. Finally, a review of policies in place in several Latin American countries at the time of this writing finds that they would be of varying success in meeting the emission levels proposed by the most recent IPCC reports to limit global temperature change to 2 °C. © 2016","Climate mitigation; Latin America; Scenarios","Fossil fuels; Land use; Abatement options; Abatement potentials; Climate mitigations; Development status; Economic potentials; Global temperature change; Latin America; Scenarios; Carbon dioxide; abatement cost; carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; land use; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979220375

Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova, Italy","The ancestor philosophers’ dream of thousands of new worlds is finally realised: about 3500 extrasolar planets have been discovered in the neighborhood of our Sun. Most of them are very different from those we used to know in our Solar System. Others orbit their parent star inside the belt known as Habitable Zone (HZ) where a rocky planet with the appropriate climate could have the availability of liquid water on its surface. Those planets, in HZ or not, will be the object of observation that will be performed by new space- and ground-based instrumentation. Space missions, such as JWST and the very recently proposed ARIEL (ESA M-Class Mission), or ground based instruments, like SPHERE@VLT, GPI@GEMINI and EPICS@ELT, have been proposed and built to measure the atmospheric transmission, reflection and emission spectra over a wide wavelength range. Exoplanets are unique objects in astronomy because they have local counterparts the Solar System planets available for comparative planetology studies, but there are also really interesting outsider cases like super Earths. In our own system, proto-planet evolution was flanked by an active prebiotic chemistry that brought about the emergency of life on the Earth. The search for life signatures requires as the first step the knowledge of planet atmospheres, main objective of future exoplanetary space explorations. Indeed, the quest for the determination of their chemical composition is of much larger value than suggested by the specific case. It opens out to the more general speculation on what such detection might tell us about the presence of life on those planets. As, for now, we have only one example of life in the universe, we are bound to study terrestrial organisms to assess possibilities of life on other planets and guide our search for possible extinct or extant life on other planetary bodies. The planet atmosphere characteristics and possible biosignatures will be inferred by studying such composite spectrum in order to identify the emission/absorption lines/bands from atmospheric molecules as water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3) etc. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons",,"Astrophysics; Atmospheric chemistry; Biology; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Earth (planet); Emission spectroscopy; Geochemistry; Interplanetary flight; Orbits; Philosophical aspects; Planets; Solar system; Space flight; Atmospheric molecules; Atmospheric transmissions; Chemical compositions; Comparative planetology; Ground-based instrumentation; Ground-based instruments; Solar system planets; Terrestrial organisms; Extrasolar planets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040683139

Being the sources and sinks of transport activities, Europe's cities are strongly affected by the resulting undesirable effects of transportation. This applies in particular to North West Europe (NWE), one of the most urban regions in Europe. NWE therefore stands in urgent need of solutions for efficient urban freight logistics. Focusing on the last mile of freight deliveries the INTERREG IVB NWE project LaMiLo (Last Mile Logistics) addressed this issue. The project promoted Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) as they allow and encourage transport consolidation as well as modal shift. Decoupling the last mile at the city borders, large vehicles are used for bundled, long haul transports outside the city whilst sustainable transport means are used inside. In the knowledge that UCC attempts with huge government subsidies have been made several times before but rarely succeeded, the core of the LaMiLo project was to enable environment for UCC operations that accomplish a sustainable last mile and can as well be transformed in successful business models. Thereto, UCC concepts were operationalised and implemented in a number of pilots in metropolitan areas and cities all around NWE:Paris: A UCC was field-tested to which freight was brought by truck and afterwards delivered by cargo bikes.Netherlands: Central hubs were put into operation to streamline the home delivery of parcels. Thereto, a Freight Circle service was launched in the cities of Nijmegen and Maastricht which used e-bikes and enabled customer-specific delivery times.London: A UCC was set up to bundle goods for the public sector which were destined for the boroughs of Camden and its partners Enfield and Waltham.Brussels: A UCC was launched at the Port of Brussels offering warehouse services and deliveries to retailers in the city. The key results gained from the studies primarily include the demonstration of UCCs as possible last mile solutions. Beyond their economic performance, their environmental effects as well as their social impacts were evaluated. Exemplary results include that all the pilots contributed towards emission reduction and total distance travelled through city centres and residential areas. Gained best practice and lessons learnt about the examined UCC concepts were discussed and shared at transnational level to encourage relating solutions for further cities. © 2016 The Authors.

The effectiveness of these replications is questionable, because it is necessary to align the set-up of learning processes with the social, economic and environmental conditions of the local context. In this paper, we compare the theory of social learning in Learning Alliances with a Working Group for climate change adaptation in Can Tho City in Vietnam to see how far it is possible to extrapolate current social learning concepts from developed countries to developing countries. The Working Group facilitates participation processes among stakeholders to use and produce knowledge, to work together on problems and to further develop solutions. This is mostly similar to the social learning form of a Learning Alliance. However, the interactions among stakeholders in the Working Group evolve in a much more formal way, which leads to several problems caused by the relative inflexibility of the top-down stipulation of stakeholders’ participation, planning procedures and solution approaches. To overcome this challenge, we recommend introducing elements of Learning Alliances to the Working Group, in order to stimulate an open dialogue with incentives and an extension of an action practice approach. © IWA Publishing 2016.","Climate change adaptation; Developing countries; Learning alliances; Social learning; Vietnam; Working groups","Developing countries; Mobile telecommunication systems; Climate change adaptation; Learning alliances; Social learning; Viet Nam; Working groups; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; developing world; learning; social organization; social theory; Can Tho; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975840828

Here we focus on analyzing the transmissibility and mortality burden of this pandemic in Arizona, a setting where the dry climate was promoted as reducing respiratory illness transmission yet tuberculosis prevalence was high. Methods: Using archival death certificates from 1954 to 1961, we quantified the age-specific seasonal patterns, excess-mortality rates, and transmissibility patterns of the 1957 H2N2 pandemic in Maricopa County, Arizona. By applying cyclical Serfling linear regression models to weekly mortality rates, the excess-mortality rates due to respiratory and all-causes were estimated for each age group during the pandemic period. The reproduction number was quantified from weekly data using a simple growth rate method and assumed generation intervals of 3 and 4 days. Local newspaper articles published during 1957-1958 were also examined. Results: Excess-mortality rates varied between waves, age groups, and causes of death, but overall remained low. From October 1959-June 1960, the most severe wave of the pandemic, the absolute excess-mortality rate based on respiratory deaths per 10,000 population was 16.59 in the elderly (≥65 years). All other age groups exhibit very low excess-mortality and the typical U-shaped age-pattern was absent. However, the standardized mortality ratio was greatest (4.06) among children and young adolescents (5-14 years) from October 1957-March 1958, based on mortality rates of respiratory deaths. Transmissibility was greatest during the same 1957-1958 period, when the mean reproduction number was estimated at 1.08-1.11, assuming 3- or 4-day generation intervals with exponential or fixed distributions. Conclusions: Maricopa County exhibited very low mortality impact associated with the 1957 influenza pandemic. Understanding the relatively low excess-mortality rates and transmissibility in Maricopa County during this historic pandemic may help public health officials prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks of influenza. © 2016 The Author(s).","1957 influenza; Arizona; Asian influenza; H2N2 virus; Maricopa County; Mathematical epidemiology; Mortality rates; Reproduction number; Transmissibility","age distribution; Arizona; Article; Asian influenza; climate; death certificate; disease association; disease transmission; dry climate; epidemiological data; human; mortality; mortality rate; pandemic; reproduction number; seasonal variation; virus transmission; adolescent; adult; aged; child; factual database; female; history; infant; Influenza A virus (H2N2); Influenza, Human; isolation and purification; middle aged; mortality; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; publication; survival rate; transmission; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Arizona; Child; Child, Preschool; Databases, Factual; Female; History, 20th Century; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Influenza A Virus, H2N2 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Middle Aged; Newspapers as Topic; Pandemics; Survival Rate; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991759917

Roadway networks needs to be more sustainable by utilizing its full capacity before using more materials to construct an expanded roadway. The understanding of the operational benefits has been the focus of much HSR research as it is an operational focused Active Traffic Management (ATM) strategy. Before HSR can be utilized, its effects on safety and the pavement structure on the shoulder need to be understood. While it has been found to improve the road operation, it must be safe and structurally sound.

The concept emerged in 1999, in a seminal book sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and finds its origins in economic theory. The economic literature defines public goods as non-rival, since anyone can benefit from them without diminishing the quantity available to other consumers, and non-excludable, as no one can realistically be excluded from their consumption. Nowadays, an increasing number of public goods transcend national boundaries. For instance: climate change mitigation, the eradication of infectious diseases, the fight against corruption, or the protection of the ozone layer are all seen as GPGs. But despite its topicality, the concept has attracted little attention from legal scholars around the globe. Not only this, but among the few authors that actually engage with the topic, the majority focus on issues related to the provision of GPGs, while the question of what goods should be publicly provided in the first place, as well as the decision-making process underlying such a determination, has been left largely unexplored. It is with respect to this specific issue that we wish to contribute to the debate. In our view, the definition of GPGs is a matter of policy choice, as it goes beyond economic, value-free considerations. Therefore, it cannot lie beyond the control of democratic structures. GPGs cannot be defined in a democratic and legal vacuum—a legitimate and inclusive decision-making process is required. In this article, we endeavour to explain how international legal scholarship, in particular the global administrative law and global constitutionalism projects, can contribute to integrating democratic standards in the process of defining GPGs. © Authors.","Democracy; Global administrative law and global constitutionalism; Global public goods; Participation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095945483

We provide information to assess trade-offs associated with the management of seagrass beds, which provide a number of ecosystem services, but are presently impacted by many stressors. We develop an interdisciplinary framework for valuing multiple ecosystem services and apply it to the case of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a dominant seagrass species in the northern hemisphere. We identify and quantify links between three eelgrass functions (habitat for fish, carbon, and nitrogen uptake) and economic goods in Sweden, quantify these using ecological endpoints, estimate the marginal average value of the impact of losing one hectare of eelgrass along the Swedish northwest coast on welfare in monetary terms, and aggregate these values while considering double-counting. Over a 20-50 year period we find that compared to unvegetated habitats, a hectare of eelgrass, including the organic material accumulated in the sediment, produces an additional 626 kg cod fishes and 7535 wrasse individuals and sequesters 98.6 ton carbon and 466 kg nitrogen. We value the flow of future benefits associated with commercial fishing, avoided climate change damages, and reduced eutrophication at 170,000 SEK in 2014 (20,700 US$) or 11,000 SEK (1300 US$) annualized at 4%. Fish production, which is the most commonly valued ecosystem service in the seagrass literature, only represented 25% of the total value whereas a conservative estimate of nitrogen regulation constituted 46%, suggesting that most seagrass beds are undervalued. Comparing these values with historic losses of eelgrass we show that the Swedish northwest coast has suffered a substantial reduction in fish production and mineral regulation. Future work should improve the understanding of the geographic scale of eelgrass functions, how local variables affect the value of these functions, and how to defensibly aggregate a multitude of economic values. © 2016 Cole and Moksnes.","Double-counting; Ecological endpoints; Fish production; Non-market valuation; Nutrient regulation; Social cost of carbon; Swedish northwest coast; Zostera marina",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008716315

Using Ostrom's theory of collective action for common pool resource management, we evaluated the institutions governing indigenous participation in the Programa Socio Bosque incentive-based conservation program in Ecuador. We conducted structured interviews with 94 members in 4 communities to assess community institutions for 6 of Ostrom's principles, using 12 measures we developed for the principles. We found substantial variation between communities in terms of their institutional performance. The best-performing community performed well (>50% of interviewees reported successfully meeting the measure) on 8 of the 12 measures. The weakest performed well on only 2 out of 12 measures. Overall, our results indicate that there is stronger performance for constitutional-level institutions, which determine who gets to make the rules, and some collective-choice institutions, which determine how local rules are made. We identified specific challenges with the day-to-day operational institutions that arise from participation in nation state– community conservation programs, such as restricted resource appropriation, monitoring and compliance, and conflict resolution. We found that top-down policy making has an important role to play in supporting communities to establish constitutional-level and some collective-choice institutions. However, developing operational institutions may take more time and depend on local families’ day-today use of resources, and thus may require a more nuanced policy approach. As some countries and donors find a jurisdictional REDD+ approach increasingly attractive, complementing top-down policy measures with bottom-up institutional development could provide a stronger platform to achieve the shift from current land use driving deforestation to a lower-carbon-emissions land management trajectory. © 2016 by the author(s).","Amazon; Common pool resource (CPR); Forest governance; Forest policy; Socio bosque","common property resource; deforestation; emission control; forest management; forestry policy; institutional framework; local planning; national planning; nature conservation; top-down approach; Amazonia; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976536593

The production process of biodiesel from microalgae generally consists of five different phases: cultivation, harvesting, drying, lipid extraction and transesterification. While existing technologies are available to undertake each of these phases, the process would benefit from enhanced sustainability achieved by reducing environmental impact and costs. One process innovation currently under consideration is the use of waste products as inputs to the process, including CO2 captured from industrial flue gas, or nutrients from wastewater. These could be employed in algae cultivation. The co-location of an algae cultivation plant with other industrial facilities, such as a cement plant or a wastewater treatment facility, could result in significantly reduced atmospheric emissions and improve wastewater effluent discharges. A comparative life cycle assessment approach is used to examine two different, realistic alternatives for the co-location of an algae cultivation plant with an existing cement plant or wastewater treatment facility near Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The study seeks to identify a preferred siting option from the perspective of minimizing environmental impacts. The first alternative involves the co-location with the Lafarge Cement plant, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, near Bath Ontario. The second alternative consists in the co-location with the Ravensview wastewater treatment facility east of the city of Kingston on the St. Lawrence River. The algae production plant is based on an open pond technology and is assumed to have a production capacity of about 120 tons of dry microalgal biomass per year. © 2016 The Authors.","CO2; life cycle assessment; microalgae cultivation; plant co-location; wastewater","Algae; Biodiesel; Carbon dioxide; Cement plants; Cements; Cultivation; Effluent treatment; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Industrial emissions; Industrial water treatment; Lakes; Life cycle; Location; Microorganisms; Reclamation; Sustainable development; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Atmospheric emission; Colocations; Comparative life cycle assessment; Environmental assessment; Industrial facilities; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Microalgae cultivation; Wastewater treatment facilities; Effluents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999277867

Knowledge of spatial pattern of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing it in various soil-landscapes are essential for understanding global C cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate at profile scale SOC stock in a forested area of southern Italy (Calabria) in relation to soil properties and landscape position. Twenty-eight soil profiles were sampled to cover all soil types and physiographic units of the study area and each horizon was sampled and characterized for its physical-chemical properties (bulk density, texture, pH, SOC, and nitrogen). Moreover, the organic horizon (O) was sampled and SOC concentration was determined. Then, the SOC stock for the organic layer and mineral horizons was calculated. Soils developed in the study area belong to the Inceptisol and Entisol orders varying from shallow to moderately deep, with chemical and physical characteristics mainly controlled by granitic parent rock. SOC stock for the organic layer varied from 3 Mg ha− 1 to 6 Mg ha− 1 whereas for mineral horizons ranged between 20.2 Mg ha− 1 and 310.9 Mg ha− 1. The results showed a different behaviour of physical-chemical properties and carbon storage for coarse-textured soils and more fine-textured soils. In addition, soil types and topographic features such as slope gradient, slope curvature and landscape position controlled SOC stored in mineral horizons through changes in both in-depth variability of SOC concentration and profile thickness. In particular, higher SOC stocks were recorded in flat areas than on steep slopes, and Inceptisols developed on slopes with concave morphology exhibited higher values than Entisols located on convex slope. © 2016","Carbon storage; Forest soils; Slope morphology; Soil characteristics; Southern Italy","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; curvature; Entisol; forest ecosystem; forest soil; Inceptisol; landscape; organic carbon; physicochemical property; slope; soil carbon; soil horizon; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); sampling; soil profile; soil property; soil type; Calabria; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981313174

Therefore, integrated adaptation plans are essential for turning them into resilient cities. National competitiveness strategies are, however, increasingly at odds with the very idea of resilient cities, either forcing urban sprawl to its limits or transforming green spaces into grey spaces within the city. In the midst of heated conflict about how to use public land, the role of networks of local initiatives to protect green spaces and residential rights of poor and marginal groups becomes pivotal to achieve equity and urban resilience. The aim of this paper is to explore the dynamics of such networks in Istanbul and investigate how to integrate them into local climate change adaptation plans. Conflicts over Istanbul’s historical urban vegetable gardens (bostan) and the construction of the third bridge are good examples of sites of contestation which, unless resolved, seriously hinder any possibility of agreement and action on climate adaptation plans. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate change; Green spaces; Local adaptation; Resilience; Urban farming",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018639487

Such changes are due to physical alterations to the structure of the accretion inflow and gaseous outflows. LMXBs spend most of their time in a hard state (wherein their X-ray spectra are power laws and thus dominated by higher energies), with order-of-magnitude variations in luminosity. A key issue in physically characterising this state is finding a way to dissect the components contributing to this power law emission: this has up to now proved challenging due to degeneracies in spectral modelling. Solving this issue of modelling degeneracy is vital in the broader context of understanding the physics of accretion around black holes, solar mass and supermassive alike—this is a key factor in the fields of active galactic nuclei feedback and supermassive black hole growth. It is also required for the determination of black hole spin via X-ray reflection modelling, since the results of such studies depend on the assumed geometry of the irradiator. In order to disentangle these components, one needs to invoke all the available spectral and timing information, and build a self-consistent physical picture. I will present work we have been doing on attempting to break modelling degeneracies by fitting a semi-analytical outflow-dominated model to broadband observations of GX 339-4 from radio to X-ray, tracking the evolution of key model parameters with the X-ray variability properties of the source. We jointly model the broadband spectra during states of similarity in variability properties, and find key best fit parameters hold indistinguishable values. I will discuss further work we are doing to advance X-ray reflection modelling by adding X-ray emission from the jet to current models. © Copyright owned by the author(s)",,"Astrophysics; Fighter aircraft; Gamma rays; Gravitation; Luminance; Stars; X ray optics; Active galactic nuclei; Broadband spectra; Low-mass X-ray binaries; Physical pictures; Spectral fitting; Supermassive black holes; Timing information; X-ray variability; X rays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050635384

Previously, only emissions of methane and nitrous oxide were accounted in greenhouse gas budgets. The new approach is based on a modification of the Olson fuel accumulation equation. This modification includes the mean post-fire residue and accounts for losses from both fire and decomposition and for gains from grass production, tree litter fall and the death of trees. We apply the approach to a case study in western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia, in which the fire regime has been changed and the project has achieved recognised abatement of methane and nitrous oxide emissions. The carbon sequestration in the dead organic matter is ∼85 times the annual emissions abatement in this project area and when expressed as an annual rate is ∼3.5 times the abatement. We also show that the emissions abatement has previously been underestimated owing to an inability to fully account for dead organic matter dynamics. Future work could refine the models of dead organic matter to include seasonal dynamics in inputs. © IAWF 2016.","ash; coarse woody debris; combustion; decomposition; fuel; residue",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003005727

In this paper, we present an array of actions that can be undertaken by communities or regions to address ocean acidification. The actions can be coupled, completed one at a time, or aligned with other environmental initiatives, and they can be tailored to the prevailing political or economic environment. We review which actions have been used by different U.S. states and identify common themes and popular choices. We close by suggesting combinations of conditions and clusters of activities that seem to promote rapid and sustained action.

Fossil records of Lesleya are almost exclusively found in basinal lowlands. For example, occurrences in Early Pennsylvanian-age, seasonally dry, parautochthonous deposits in basinal lowlands of North America (e.g., Illinois Basin, USA) indicate that Lesleya lived in that region in low-altitude (lowland) paleoenvironments during dry climatic intervals. In this paper, we document the first occurrence of Lesleya during the Carboniferous on the Iberian Massif, in lower Gzhelian (Upper Pennsylvanian) strata of the Douro Carboniferous Basin, in northwestern Portugal. This newly discovered occurrence includes a new species, Lesleya iberiensis sp. nov., recognized on the basis of natural molds of leaves. The Portuguese Lesleya fossils are from upland intramontane deposits and occur between coal beds. Their fossil remains are preserved in mica-rich shales that were deposited between sandstone-dominated fluvial and shale-dominated lacustrine deposits, suggesting that this megaflora was deposited near freshwater bodies. These new data provide evidence that this megaflora grew in mountain riparian environments within the Variscan orogen, either in localized, well-drained areas or during drier climatic intervals in the Late Pennsylvanian. © 2016, Canadian Science Publishing.

Manufacturing operations design has shifted from a traditional strictly cost and quality approach to more recently including energy efficiency, zero waste and reduced carbon emissions. Whilst manufacturing companies have focused on reducing energy at a facilities level, research indicates that specific production processes generate a significant environmental impact through energy consumption, resource depletion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To understand the consumption of energy in a production environment it is important to relate the specific energy usage to the operating processes and production outputs. This allows the identification of auxiliary (non-value added) energy within production which is as the area with the greatest potential for savings through changes in operational behaviour. This paper outlines the monitoring at a factory and at machine level that can identify where and, more importantly, when waste energy occurs. The analysis of the cost of auxiliary energy is shown to be a motivational factor for company management to engage with energy efficiency measures and finally the paper discusses the eight dimensions necessary to engage employees and to drive cultural change in an organisation. The current state of practice in relation to energy in a case-study in the Precision Manufacturing Sector in Ireland was investigated and the proposed approach was applied and has been shown to successfully deliver verifiable savings with low implementation costs. © 2018 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

The biorefinery is the case study of the BIT3G project, a national funded research project, and it uses the lignocellulosic biomass that is available in the territory as input materials for biochemical purposes, such as cardoon and carthamus. The whole plant is composed of several sections: the cardoon and carthamus seed milling, the oil refinement facilities, and the production section of some high quality biochemicals, i.e., bio-oils and fatty acids. The main goal of the research is to demonstrate energy autonomy of the latter section of the biorefinery, while only recovering energy from the residues resulting from the collection of the biomass. To this aim, this work presents the quantification of the energy requirements to be supplied to the considered biorefinery section, the mass flow, and the energy and chemical characterization of the biomass. Afterwards, some sustainability strategies have been qualitatively investigated in order to identify the best one to be used in this case study; the combined heat and power (CHP) technology. Two scenarios have been defined and presented: the first with 6 MWt thermal input and 1.2 MWe electrical power as an output and the second with 9 MWt thermal input and 1.8MWe electrical power as an output. The first scenario showed that 11,000 tons of residual biomass could ensure the annual production of about 34,000 MWht, equal to about the 72% of the requirements, and about 9600 MWhe, equal to approximately 60% of the electricity demand. The second scenario showed that 18,000 tons of the residual biomass could ensure the total annual production of about 56,000 MWht, corresponding to more than 100% of the requirements, and about 14,400 MWhe, equal to approximately 90% of the electricity demand. In addition, the CO2 emissions from the energy valorization section have been quantified and the possibility of re-using the CO2 flow in order to produce methane is described. © 2016 by the Authors.","Biorefinery; Cardoon; Carthamus; Energy recovery; Sustainability","Bioconversion; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Electric power utilization; Fatty acids; Seed; Sustainable development; Biorefineries; Cardoon; Carthamus; Chemical characterization; Combined heat and power technologies; Energy recovery; Lignocellulosic biomass; Sustainability strategies; Refining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987933100

A building integrated approach of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation and photovoltaic power generation (PV) known as Combined Heat and power with PV (CHPV) is emerging as an energy supply solution in the design of sustainable commercial buildings and local energy systems. The merits for the building user/owner of this approach are; to reduce life time energy running costs; reduce carbon emissions to contribute to UK's 2020/2030 climate change targets and provide a more resilient energy supply solution. Soft target markets for CHPV are building clusters such as; public buildings such as hospitals, colleges, universities and buildings and private sector complexes such as retail parks and science parks. The control methodology of CHPV systems is the main research challenge to provide reliable system performance to enhance the successful deployment of these systems. The CHPV solution provides all heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) facilities as well as electrical power supply. This power is generated by a locally connected CHP system to a private wire network (PWN) which simultaneously allows the utilisation of building side installed PV power generation to be shared with all buildings in the cluster/complex. This paper presents a novel CHPV system design topology for robust, reliable and high performance control of building temperatures and the local energy system's power supply. This system's topology includes; a PV array installed on the building and backup/supplementary power provided by the national grid. The advanced control system solution presented in this paper, aims to achieve desired building temperatures using thermostatic control whilst simultaneously tracking a specified national grid power demand profile. The results from simulations presented in the paper show the efficacy of the novel control strategy of CHPV to control energy utilisation of the building's heat and power whilst tracking a required national grid power demand. © 2016, Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Two types of auriferous mineralizations were distinguished: Sb-Au and Au-As. Two gold free/poor types are also present: Pb-Zn-(Ag) and W-Sn. Controls of mineralizations include structural and litostratigraphic features. There exists also a genetic relation with hidden granitic apexes. Country rocks of the area consist of Cambrian to Carboniferous metasediments, acid and basic volcanics, subvolcanics and Variscan granites. Two main episodes of folding, one ante-Stephanian and the other one post-Stephanian, are recognized. The major ante-Stephanian structure is the Valongo Anticline, N 150-160° E trending with axial plunge toward NW. Another prominent structural feature is the sinistral “Douro Shear Zone” (DSZ), along the western limb of the Valongo Anticline. Carboniferous basins are settled up all along this structure. Several shear-zones sub-parallel to the DSZ crosscut the studied area, notably the “Santa Justa Shear-Zone” (SJSZ) along the hinge zone of the Valongo Anticline. Volcanic rocks linked to a rifting at the Cambrian-Ordovician transition seem also associated to shear zones. Pegmatitic, aplitic, microgranitic and doleritic sills are frequently emplaced in the same fractures, with spatial relationship with mineralizations. The most evident lithostratigraphic control concerns the Au-As mineralization hosted by the Floian succession composed of quartzites, slates, wakes, ironstones with intercalations of volcano-sedimentary layers, along the Eastern limb and in the nose of the Valongo Anticline. Most of the Sb-Au veins occur west of the Western limb of the Valongo Anticline. Deposits are hosted by competent successions: mainly conglomerates, quartzites and slates, with acid and basic volcanics and diabases (weathered dolerites) intercalations of Cambrian age (Montalto Formation), and in some cases by the Carboniferous basal breccia and the overlying wackes. More recently a relationship between Upper Ordovician glacigenic rocks of Sobrido Formation (Hirnantian age) and Au-Sb-As anomalies was reported. The most marked structural control is the alignment of most of the Sb-Au deposits at short distances from the DSZ, in the Montalto Formation domain, of Cambrian age, West of the Valongo Anticline. SJSZ along Montalto Formation in the core of Anticline also controls Sb mineralizations. Another structural control was evidenced along the Eastern limb of the Valongo anticline, in Au-As and Sb-Au deposits: the mineralized veins are emplaced in sub-vertical faults in the hinge zones of anticlines associated with the major folding, subsequently affected by deformation. © SGEM2016.","Antimony; Gold; Shear zones; Variscan ore deposits; Volcanic rocks","Antimony; Antimony compounds; Antimony deposits; Deposits; Gold; Gold compounds; Mineralogy; Slate; Stratigraphy; Structural dynamics; Volcanic rocks; Volcanoes; Genetic relations; Litho-stratigraphic; Sedimentary layers; Shear zone; Spatial relationships; Structural control; Structural feature; Variscan; Gold deposits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994149324

High dynamic range far-infrared imaging of the Musca cloud with SPIRE and PACS reveals at least two types of filamentary structures: (1) the main ∼10-pc scale high column-density linear filament; and (2) low column-density striations in close proximity to the main filament. In addition, we find features with intermediate column densities (hair-like strands) that appear physically connected to the main filament. We present an analysis of this filamentary network traced by Herschel and explore its connection with the local magnetic field. We find that both the faint dust emission striations and the plane-of-the-sky (POS) magnetic field are locally oriented close to perpendicular to the high-density main filament (position angle ∼25-35°). The low-density striations and strands are oriented parallel to the POS magnetic field lines, which are derived previously from optical polarization measurements of background stars and more recently from Planck observations of dust polarized emission. The position angles are 97 ± 25°, 105 ± 7°, and 105 ± 5°. From these observations, we propose a scenario in which local interstellar material in this cloud has condensed into a gravitationally-unstable filament (with ""supercritical"" mass per unit length) that is accreting background matter along field lines through the striations. We also compare the filamentary structure in Musca with what is seen in similar Herschel observations of the Taurus B211/3 filament system and find that there is significantly less substructure in the Musca main filament than in the B211/3 filament. We suggest that the Musca cloud may represent an earlier evolutionary stage in which the main filament has not yet accreted sufficient mass and energy to develop a multiple system of intertwined filamentary components. © ESO, 2016.","Infrared: ISM; ISM: clouds; ISM: individual objects: Musca; ISM: structure; Stars: formation","Dust; Gravitation; Infrared imaging; Magnetic fields; Stars; Thermography (imaging); Infrared: ISM; ISM : clouds; ISM: individual objects; ISM: structure; Stars: formation; Magnetism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971440139

The main disadvantages of DCS are high initial investment costs and long payback period. Distribution network represents a large share of initial investment costs; therefore it has a great impact on the eligibility of construction of a district cooling system. In order to ensure the competitiveness of district cooling systems, distribution network has to be optimized. In this paper the exergoeconomic concept is applied for the evaluation of a distribution network in a district cooling system. The production of cold and its related subsystems and technologies are not considered in this study. The objective function in the analysis is defined as the exergy–based cost of the final product, in our case – cold. The exergy–based cost of cold depends on the total annual cost of a distribution network, the input exergy to the distribution network, exergy losses and exergy destruction. The aim of this study is to find the exergetic optimal pipe diameter and exergetic optimal insulation thickness as well as exergoeconomic optimal pipe diameter and exergoeconomic optimal insulation thickness.

Its aim is to speed up the integration of electricity markets in Europe and to further encourage the use of renewables and the pursuit of energy efficiency, while at the same time placing European consumers at the heart of this project. This Policy Brief sheds light on the Commission’s proposal – which runs to no less than 5000 pages – by examining its three major innovations and looking in depth at issues that remain unresolved in terms of pricing. • Putting the consumer at the centre of the policy. In concrete terms, consumers must be able to participate more fully in the functioning of the electricity market, both as self-producers and as contributors to demand-side responses. • Strengthening the governance of grids and markets. National capacity markets must be open to other Member States and to all technologies. The only exception is coal-fired power plants, the most polluting technology, which should be totally eliminated from the capacity markets in the long term. • Improving the integration of renewables. The project puts an end to the priority of access to grids that has benefited renewables so far and recommends the eventual removal of production support mechanisms. • The issue of electricity pricing appears to be inescapable given increasing inputs of decentralized renewable electricity that are destabilising the standard principle of electricity pricing at marginal cost. Alternatives – pricing at average cost or on the basis of capacity – will need to be explored. The central role of the carbon price and the implications of its insufficiently high level, which penalizes the competitiveness of low-carbon energies, are hidden. The reform of support mechanisms for renewables is no substitute for an ambitious carbon pricing policy. © FrancoAngeli.","Electricity pricing; EU energy policy; Governance; Renewables",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022205416

But proposals to slow population growth can encounter stiff resistance. The real problem, some argue, is that energy consumption will grow much faster than population as the world gets richer - and in any event, past initiatives to slow population growth have sometimes taken sinister forms.

Improving the reproductive performance of cows has been identified as a key target for increasing profitability, and this higher efficiency is also likely to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of beef production. The effects of strategies to increase the fertility of breeding herds and earlier joining of heifers as yearlings were studied on two properties at Longreach and Boulia in western Queensland. The beef production, GHG emissions, emissions intensity and profitability were investigated and compared with typical management in the two regions. Overall weaning rates achieved on the two properties were 79% and 74% compared with typical herd weaning rates of 58% in both regions. Herds with high reproductive performance had GHG emissions intensities (t CO2-e t-1 liveweight sold) 28% and 22% lower than the typical herds at Longreach and Boulia, with most of the benefit from higher weaning rates. Farm gross margin analysis showed that it was more profitable, by 62000 at Longreach and 38000 at Boulia, to utilise higher reproductive performance to increase the amount of liveweight sold with the same number of adult equivalents compared with reducing the number of adult equivalents to maintain the same level of liveweight sold and claiming a carbon credit for lower farm emissions. These gains achieved at two case study properties which had different rainfall, country types, and property sizes suggest similar improvements can be made on-farm across the Mitchell Grass Downs bioregion of northern Australia.","carbon farming; grazing systems; rangelands; tropical pastures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976527158

This rule has been anticipated for multiple years and follows the Clean Power Plan Proposed Rule, which was initially released on June 18th, 2014. The Clean Power Plan sets limits on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from existing stationary fossil-fuel-fired electricity generating units (EGUs). The CPP is implemented primarily by states, who must each develop and submit to the EPA a State Plan that will bring CO2 emissions from affected EGUs in their jurisdiction into compliance with the limits the EPA has established. In this paper, we analyze the situation in four states (Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, and Georgia) to identify the potential impacts and unintended consequences of the rule on electricity supply and carbon emissions. Some key findings: (1) The Clean Power Plan presented an opportunity for the EPA to properly value the reliability and low environmental impact of nuclear energy facilities, but that opportunity has been partially missed. (2) The EPA missed a particularly important opportunity to value nuclear energy in its decision not to allow credits for generation from nuclear energy facilities operating under a renewed license. (3) The existing nuclear fleet can only participate in CPP compliance if plant capacity is uprated. (4) These case studies confirm that new nuclear capacity can make substantial contributions toward CPP compliance and will definitely do so in Georgia. (5) Massachusetts may satisfy its final State Goal simply by replacing 2012 coal generation with increased use of current natural gas generators. New York comes very close to compliance by doing the same. (6) Analysis of scenarios in Massachusetts and New York confirms findings from previous investigations showing that, in some states and scenarios, it is possible to comply with the CPP State Goal while increasing the mass of total CO2 emissions. (7) In both MA and NY, this can be accomplished by replacing both coal and nuclear generation with generation from new natural gas capacity. New NGCCs may also be the cheapest way each state could increase its generation capacity. (8) Large investments in new, low-emission generators are likely to be necessary in coal-intensive states, even in a case like Illinois where substantial low-emission capacity is already present and the statewide emission rate is below the national average.",,"Carbon dioxide; Coal; Electric equipment protection; Environmental impact; Environmental Protection Agency; Fossil fuels; Gas generators; Investments; Natural gas; Nuclear energy; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Carbon dioxide emissions; Electricity supply; Generation capacity; Nuclear energy facilities; Nuclear energy industries; Nuclear generation; Unintended consequences; United states environmental protection agencies; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986218403

Several countries have objectives to substitute a part of the energy of traffic by ethanol as the renewable energy source. The global share of Bioethanol used for transportation is continuously increasing. Investigations of limited and unregulated emissions of a flex fuel vehicle with gasoline-ethanol blend fuel have been performed in the present work on the chassis dynamometer according to the measuring procedures, which were established in the previous research in the Swiss Network to adequately consider the transient (WLTC) and the stationary operation (SSC). The investigated fuel contained ethanol (E), in the portions of 10% &amp; 85% by volume. The investigated vehicle represented a newer state of technology and an emission level of Euro 5. The engine works with homogenous GDI concept and with 3-W-catalyst (3WC). Since there is a special concern about the particle emissions of gasoline cars with direct injection, the nanoparticle counts measurements were systematically performed with SMPS at stationary and with CPC at dynamic operation. The non-legislated gaseous emissions were tested at the tailpipe with FTIR, this with special focus on NH3, N2O and HCHO (Formaldehyde). The main results obtained from the investigated test vehicle are: the particle counts emissions are generally significantly reduced with Ethanol blend fuels at all operating conditions,in WLTC there is a clear increase of NH3 with E85 and an insignificant tendency of increasing NH3 with E10,with all fuels (E0, E10 &amp; E85) there are no emissions of N2O and no increase of HCHO (below 1 ppm), in WLTC warm,at cold start (22-25°C) there are emission peaks with all investigated fuels, with Ethanol blends there are emission peaks of Formaldehyde HCHO, which do not exist with gasoline and which are higher with higher Ethanol content. The present research did not address the durability aspects and the cold startability in extreme conditions.

The oil production is based on a previous study, which indicates that in 2050 the pre-salt oil production can reach up to 3,160,000 bpd, and the total Brazilian oil production can be up to 3,765,000 bpd. Simulations were made to try to estimate the natural gas production for the period between 2015 and 2050. One great challenge of the petroleum production in this area is to deal with the large amount of CO2 present in these fields. This study considered Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a mitigating option for the CO2 that would be emitted during the petroleum extraction. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognised as a technology capable of reducing the large-scale emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is an important part of the portfolio of alternatives necessary to achieve significant reductions in the global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). This study identified that the most suitable carbon capture method for the platforms (Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSOs)) that will operate in Brazil’s pre-salt fields is the use of membranes. Based on this capture method (membranes), the UOP Separex™ module system is selected as the standard to be tested. It is a compact module that can be installed on FPSOs. Because there remains considerable uncertainty over the precise amount of CO2 present in the natural gas from the pre-salt fields, a wide range, between 10 and 45 %mol of CO2 content was considered. The membrane area for each module was considered to be equal for both 10 %mol and for 45 %mol of CO2. The results show that in 2050, the gas production in the pre-salt region can be around 35,000 Mm3 per year, considering that the amount of CO2 in the natural gas is 10 %mol. However, it can be up to 20,000 Mm3 when considering that the amount of CO2 present in the natural gas is around 45 % mol. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Burning; Dioxide; Hydrate; Permeability; Petroleum","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Crude oil; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Hydrates; Mechanical permeability; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Natural gas well production; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum industry; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Dioxide; Floating production , storage , and offloading; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Natural-gas production; Offshore reservoirs; Petroleum extraction; Petroleum production; Subsalt strata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029725955

This paper investigates the energy saving obtainable by using air conditioning systems provided with suitable earth-To-Air (EAHX) and/or air-To-Air (AAHX) heat exchangers, for two different Italian climates: Palermo, a city of Southern Italy characterized by hot summers and mild winters, and Milan, a city of Northern Italy characterized by hot summers and cold winters. A case study is analyzed by means of dynamic building energy performance software, with reference to the same designed office building with or without the two types of heat exchangers. The seasonal results show that in winter the AAHX reduces the energy requirement more than the EAHX, while in summer the EAHX is more effective. Yearly results show that the use of the EAHX is preferable in mild or hot climates. Moreover, basing on the seasonal results, the two technologies are combined (using the AAHX in winter and the EAHX in summer). The results show that the coupling of the two heat exchangers is more convenient for Milan (saving up to 74%) than for Palermo (59%). Finally, the CO2 emission reductions and discounted payback periods for the two technologies are evaluated.","Air-To-Air; Building energy performance software; Discounted payback; Earth-To-Air; Heat exchangers","Air conditioning; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Investments; Office buildings; Air-to-air heat exchanger; Building energy performance; CO2 emission reduction; Discounted payback; Energy requirements; Northern Italy; Payback periods; Southern Italy; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994607343

The OCC consists of a semi-closed topping Bryton cycle, and a traditional bottoming Rankine cycle. The topping cycle operates with a working medium mixture of mainly CO2 and H2O. This CO2-rich working fluid has significantly different gas properties compared to a conventional open gas turbine cycle, which thereby affects the aerodynamic turbine design for the gas turbine units. The aerodynamic turbine design for oxyfuel gas turbines is an unexplored research field. The topic of this study was therefore to investigate the aerodynamic turbine design of turbines operating with a CO2-rich working fluid. The investigation was performed through a typical turbine aerodesign loop, which covered the 1D mid-span, 2D through-flow, 3D blade profiling design and the steady-state 3D analysis. The design was performed through the use of conventional design methods and criteria in order to investigate if any significant departures from conventional turbine design methods were required. The survey revealed some minor deviations in design considerations, yet it showed that the design is feasible with today's state-of-the-art technology by using conventional design practice and methods. The performance of the oxy-fuel combined cycle was revised based on the performance figures from the components design. The expected total performance figures for the oxy-fuel combined cycle were calculated to be a net electrical power of 119.9 MW and a net thermal efficiency of 48.2%. These figures include the parasitic consumption for the oxygen production required for the combustion and the CO2 compression of the CO2 bleed stream. © 2016 by ASME.",,"Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Design; Fluids; Fuels; Gas turbines; Thermoelectric power plants; Turbomachine blades; Turbomachinery; Bottoming rankine cycles; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Conventional design; Conventional design methods; Design considerations; Gas turbine cycles; State-of-the-art technology; Thermal power plants; Aerodynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991822127

Recent findings Many studies have shown changes in production, dispersion, and allergen content of pollen and spores because of climate change with an increasing effect of aeroallergens on allergic patients. Summary Over the last 50 years, global earth's temperature has markedly risen likely because of growing emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. Major changes involving the atmosphere and the climate, including global warming induced by human activity, have a major impact on the biosphere and human environment. Urbanization and high levels of vehicle emissions are correlated to an increase in the frequency of polleninduced respiratory allergy prevalent in people who live in urban areas compared with those who live in rural areas. Measures of mitigation need to be applied for reducing future impacts of climate change on our planet, but until global emissions continue to rise, adaptation to the impacts of future climate variability will also be required. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","Air pollution and respiratory diseases; airways hyperreactivity; climate change and respiratory allergy; climate change andasthma; thunderstorm asthma","air pollution; asthma; biosphere; climate change; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; human; hurricane; pollen allergy; prevalence; priority journal; respiratory tract allergy; Review; sensitization; urbanization; adverse effects; animal; environmental exposure; immunology; plant; pollen; Respiratory Hypersensitivity; allergen; exhaust gas; Air Pollution; Allergens; Animals; Climate Change; Environmental Exposure; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Plants; Pollen; Respiratory Hypersensitivity; Urbanization; Vehicle Emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981747145

The SCC essentially quantifies the damages due to carbon emissions that a proposed rulemaking would mitigate over the next 300 years. Although this is nice for EPA to use in justifying rulemaking, it doesn't represent a real cost of carbon emissions from an operating refinery or petrochemical plant. We all know that the ""Paris Climate Deal"" is likely going to force the United States' hands to further regulate carbon emissions, we just don't know- exactly what that might look like. There are a number of regulatory models for reducing carbon emissions in practice already world-wide including cap-And-Trade, carbon tax, energy efficiency requirements, etc. Therefore, many oil companies have defined what has been coined a ""shadow cost of carbon"". This is the cost that one would expect to spend on each ton of carbon emitted given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory schema. Everyone from refining majors to entertainment giants have published these shadow costs and purportedly uses them in project justification. However, the low cost of energy today makes it very hard to justify any significant project expense directed at energy efficiency (or reducing carbon emissions) since the payout does not meet typical financial and business models for operating companies. The paper will explore the various costs of carbon and give perspective on these costs to consumer and an operating company.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019049611

However, there remains a disconnect between intent and reality in terms of implement-ability, willingness and a certain sluggishness in the system. While an overwhelming mandatory regime will be debilitating for a developing economy and be met with great resistance, a combination of incentivization and an enabling legal-fiscal environment targeting low hanging fruits initially and with progressively increasing stringency, could achieve broader acceptability with far reaching results. This paper further builds on the premise that green or sustainable design, cannot be viewed as just a building mandate or bye law but rather an economically sustainable lifestyle choice, and hence to incentivize this drive, will develop it as a social and cultural movement. © 2016 International Committee of the SCMT conferences.

It considers the prospects for reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) which, according to the scientific consensus, are the key anthropogenic drivers of climate change. The focus is on two major areas of economic activity, the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector and the energy sector, which together account for around 60% of global GHG emissions. Total global emissions almost doubled in the 40-year period since 1970 and the annual rate of increase rose sharply in the 2000-2010 period. In the medium-to-long term, the emerging and developing economies will have a growing influence on global emissions given their populations and anticipated rates of economic growth. The extent to which the Paris COP21 Agreement can be considered binding on the parties is open to question. It is concluded that there are neither easy nor simple solutions for reducing global emissions. Reductions in emissions intensities should be possible, but it is argued that a stabilization path for total future emissions seems more likely than significant reductions. © 2016 CAB International.","Agriculture; Climate change; COP21; Energy; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Land use; Policy responses",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014054139

These laws and regulations require industry to estimate emissions and model pollutant concentrations for permit applications, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation, and for facility-wide health risk assessments (HRAs). The procedures for assessing cancer risk, which are currently under evaluation by regulatory authorities, are developed based upon periodic review, new technologies, and health studies. The procedural adjustments that may result from this evaluation could require facilities to perform HRAs for the first time or to re-open and revise past HRAs. When large industrial sources model pollutant concentrations and quantify health effects, a number of variables exist that can affect predicted cancer risk. These include representative characteristics of source operation and configuration, emission inventory estimation, and meteorological data. Our study evaluates potential impacts on a facility's strategy for assessing and disclosing cancer risk in the context of the current regulatory risk assessment guidelines and recommended changes to HRA procedures. We will also explore scenarios that will assess the variability in predicted cancer risk due to these revised regulatory risk guidelines. The scenarios presented in this study will explore these variabilities while maintaining exposure modeling parameters and emissions as constants. The potential impacts under these scenarios evaluate the relative comparison in risk due to regulatory changes, emissions, and exposure modeling in the context of different industrial settings across the United States (US). © 2016, Air and Waste Management Association.

Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plants, typically, have authorized stack emissions for primary pollutants (like CO, NOx, particulate), for selected trace organics (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or dioxins), metals or for total organic compounds (TOC). Odour control is limited on recommendations of good practices for the waste receiving areas and storage, generally on the air management systems. In Italy there is an increasingly number of requests, to environmental inspection authorities, Agenzia Regionale per la Protezione Ambientale (ARPA), Regional Environment Agency, to quantitatively describe possible odour annoyance effects from different industrial plants, including MSW incineration plants. Recently ARPA Piemonte has been asked to perform one odour survey for the newly incinerator for the city of Torino, that burns 500,000 t/y of MSW recovering energy through cogeneration. The plant is equipped with a pollutant's automated measuring system (AMS) to assess the compliance with the emission limit values, but not to measure odour emissions. For this reason, it is necessary to assess odour emissions as well, in order to prepare an exhaustive environmental odour scenario for the whole area. We recently presented a risk assessment approach, to evaluate non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic compounds for different sample types, based on STEL or TWA data, or EPA slope factors values respectively. It has been decide to follow this approach to define potential sample toxicity (PT), using the different risk occupational scenarios proposed, before odour concentration analysis of stack emissions samples. Using emission limit values that are set in the permit, PT has been defined. Since samples are presented to assessors in an ascending concentration series, workers exposure has been limited to acceptable levels defining the specific minimum dilution value to be used in the ARPA Piemonte olfactometric laboratory standard procedures. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Air pollution; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Digital storage; Environmental Protection Agency; Incineration; Industrial plants; Odor control; Organic pollutants; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Toxicity; Trace elements; Waste incineration; Waste management; Assessment approaches; Automated measuring system; Carcinogenic compounds; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Occupational exposure; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Regional environments; Total organic compounds; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988908455

In order to reach this goal, the city's public transport has been restructured with an emphasis on rail transit systems. The city will host the 2016 Olympic Games and this has encouraged the transformation of public transportation. One of the new projects is the construction of a new metro line, Line 4, to connect the downtown area to the city's fastest growing part, the western region, which will also be a venue for many events during the Olympic Games. This article presents and applies a procedure for calculating energy use and emissions avoided by Line 4 by attracting users from other transport modes in the period from 2016 to 2040. The procedure uses a detailed demand forecast for this period and considers the local transport profile and the different fuels used. The net amount of carbon dioxide avoided was 55,449 tonnes per year and 44.53 grams per passenger kilometer. The avoided energy reached 0.76 MJ per passenger kilometer. © 2016 by the authors.","Avoided emissions; CO2 emissions; Emission reduction; Mode shift; Rail transit systems","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy dissipation; energy use; greenhouse gas; Olympic Games; project management; public transport; railway transport; Brazil; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960423512

The use of urea coated with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) has been reported to substantially decrease N2O emissions and increase crop yields in humid, high-intensity rainfall environments. However, it is still uncertain whether this product is similarly effective in contrasting soil types in the cropping region of north-east Australia. In this study the grain yield response of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) to rates of fertiliser N applied as urea or urea coated with DMPP were compared in crops grown on a Vertisol and an Oxisol in southern Queensland. Seasonal N2O emissions were monitored on selected treatments for the duration of the cropping season and the early stages of a subsequent fallow period using a fully automated high-frequency greenhouse gas measuring system. On each soil the tested treatments included an unfertilised control (0kgNha-1) and two fertilised treatments chosen on the basis of delivering at least 90% of seasonal potential grain yield (160 and 120kgNha-1 on the Vertisol and Oxisol respectively) or at a common (suboptimal) rate at each site (80kgNha-1). During this study DMPP had a similar impact at both sites, clearly inhibiting nitrification for up to 8 weeks after fertiliser application. Despite the relatively dry seasonal conditions during most of the monitoring period, DMPP was effective in abating N2O emissions on both soils and on average reduced seasonal N2O emissions by 60% compared with conventional urea at fertiliser N rates equivalent to those producing 90% of site maximum grain yield. The significant abatement of N2O emissions observed with DMPP, however, did not translate into significant yield gains or improvements in agronomic efficiencies of fertiliser N use. These results may be due to the relatively dry growing season conditions before the bulk of crop N acquisition, which limited the exposure of fertiliser N to large losses due to leaching and denitrification. © CSIRO 2016.","automated greenhouse gas measuring system; denitrification; nitrogen response.","Crops; Cultivation; Denitrification; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Rain; Urea; Grain yield response; High frequency HF; High intensity rainfall; Measuring systems; Monitoring periods; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen response; North-east australia; Soils; biogenic emission; comparative study; crop yield; denitrification; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; growing season; inhibitor; measurement method; nitrification; nitrous oxide; Oxisol; sorghum; urea; Vertisol; yield response; Australia; Queensland; Sorghum bicolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981539646

Nevertheless, we found dramatic changes in coral communities on the reef slopes of Curaçao and Bonaire since 1973. Cover and abundance declined for virtually all coral species. The data show a shift from communities dominated by framework building species (e.g., Orbicella spp.) to communities consisting of small opportunistic, phenotypically plastic, species, including few remaining structural colonies. Madracis mirabilis, Porites astreoides, Diploria strigosa, and Agaricia lamarcki are at present modest winners in the coral assemblage, although overall cover declined also for these species. Increased frequency and intensity of events inducing coral mortality and ongoing reduction in suitable hard substratum, provided by the remnants of large colony building species, could reduce the chance of these species to remain winners in the longer run. The observed loss in coral cover and the shift from larger structural to smaller opportunistic species reduced reef carbonate production by 67% and therewith, in combination with a trend toward smaller coral colonies, reef complexity. Alarmingly, reefs at upper-mesophotic depths (30-40 m) did not escape the general degradation of the coral community. The negative effects are larger around densely populated areas where local stressors are adding to degradation caused, for instance, by region wide mass bleaching. Without proper conservation and management this already dramatic degradation will continue and turn more and more coral species into losers. © 2016 De Bakker, Meesters, Bak, Nieuwland and Van Duyl.","Anthropogenic stress; Carbonate production; Caribbean; Coral; Coral community dynamics; Reef degradation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008704814

Odour legislation has been decentralized to local governments. Depending on the situation the provinces or municipalities are the competent authority to issue permits. In most cases the mayor and aldermen now hold authority to grant or refuse an All-in-one Permit. In a few cases, the provincial executive or relevant minister holds this authority. Local authorities may develop their own odour policy within general national defined rules. These rules are: - if there is no nuisance, no mitigation measures to reduce odour emissions are necessary; - in case of an unacceptable level of nuisance companies have to apply best available techniques to reduce the nuisance; - the competent authority defines which level of nuisance is acceptable. The city of Helmond is situated in the south of the Netherlands. It is an industrial city with large odour emitting industries, especially food and feed industries and intensive livestock farms. Major odour producing industries and farms are situated in the centre of the city or south from neighbourhoods. Residents of these neighbourhoods complain about odour nuisance. Also the spatial development of old industrial estates in the centre of the town is complicated due to existing permitted odour contours . An additional complicating factor is the fact that the province of Noord Brabant is the competent authority for the major odour emitting companies in Helmond. For these reasons Helmond decided to develop a local odour policy. Buro Blauw was asked to assist in the development of this odour policy. The major goal of this policy is to define a balance between a good environmental quality for odour and a good establishment for business. This policy consists out of: - Applying the odour policy of the province of Noord Brabant; - Applying best available techniques to reduce odour nuisance; - An acceptable odour nuisance level based on the hedonic tune of the emitted odours; - The cumulative odour concentration; - Applying the systemic of the national health authorities for defining the health quality of the living environment on the basis of the odour exposure; - A standard for the cumulative ambient odour concentration applicable for new activities or expansion of existing activities. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Chemical engineering; Chemical operations; Best available techniques; Competent authorities; Environmental permits; Environmental quality; Living environment; Mitigation measures; Odour concentrations; Spatial development; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988835568

Variations of CO2 fluxes in the soil were explained mainly by soil humidity and, in the legumes, under conventional system, by soil NH4+-N concentration. Plots with legumes under no-tillage system had higher annual emissions of CO2, NOx, and N2O than natural fallow. Results show that the use of legumes as cover crops favors the emissions of NOx-N + N2O-N and CO2-C. However, when considering the potential for mitigation of CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions from the soil, it is important to evaluate changes in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks.","Carbon and nitrogen stocks; Cerrado; Crotalaria juncea; Mitigating greenhouse gases; Mucuna pruriens",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007415562

Namely, they reduce buildings’ energy consumption and improve cities’ urban environment by heat island mitigation. They may also increase rooftop comfort conditions for the users during summer days. Therefore, the assessment of the hygrothermal vegetative roof behavior is very important for a correct quantification of its impacts. Irrigated vegetative roofs are necessary for certain climates and plant species during summer; however, data concerning the ideal water requirements are still scarce. This study assesses the vegetative roof performance for a temperate climate concerning the effect on the outdoor environment, based on surface temperatures and heat fluxes, with and without the contribution of irrigation. The experimental vegetative roof setup located in Porto provides data for the hygrothermal analysis. The monitored parameters—temperature profiles, heat fluxes and water content profiles, together with outdoor conditions—allow a detailed analysis of the real behavior in summer with varying irrigation. The air temperature, solar radiation, and irrigation amounts, together with irrigation schedules and antecedent irrigation periods, were found to be determinant on the heat fluxes variation and on surface temperature reduction. The available hygrothermal simulation tools for vegetative roof, key for studying the roof response, were briefly assessed. The major limitations are related to the water balance and the properties of the vegetation and substrate. © 2016 U.S. Government.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Energy utilization; Heat flux; Irrigation; Surface properties; Buildings; Hygrothermal analysis; Hygrothermal simulation; Irrigation schedule; Monitored parameters; Outdoor environment; Surface temperatures; Temperature profiles; Water content profiles; Roofs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053638728

In this sense, the carbon trade follows the logic advocated by Coase. Since the carbon market is influenced by many factors, some structures have grown more than others. Relevant examples of market mechanisms are those related to project-based emission reductions, and the cap and trade principle, which establishes limits on GHG emissions based on trade allowances. Given that carbon market solutions are a mechanism created in order to contribute to a decrease in GHG, this paper presents economic theories related to this market; analyses carbon markets with a focus on advantages and problems; and offers an action and development plan for the carbon market road map.

The nanoparticles presented superparamagnetism and stability in neutral pH medium. The bare iron oxide nanoparticles provoked the fluorescence quenching of the dye, whilst the core-shell silica-iron oxide system preserved the ESIPT emission. The silica network gives a protection against fluorescence quenching of the dye. The ESIPT dye in this case showed only an emission band assigned to the keto tautomer.

There is broad consensus that, although emissions have been below the intended objective during this period, this result is hardly due to the ETS. In these 10 years, several changes have been introduced to the initial rules. Lately, the European Council and Parliament, based on proposals from the European Commission (EC), decided to reform the ETS by introducing a market stability reserve (MSR) with the aim of overcoming the lack of effectiveness regarding ETS, as implicitly recognized by these institutions. In fact, there were other possibilities for reforming the ETS. The purpose of this paper is to present the reasons that favour the introduction of a reserve price for auctions of EU emissions allowances (EUAs) as soon as possible, but at least by the fourth phase of the ETS. It also explains why it would be an effective and no-regret option to start from a low level of the reserve price and reaching in about ten years the level making it convenient to switch from coal to gas in electricity production. The paper is divided into five sections. The first section summarizes the key stages of the history the EU ETS with some comments. The second section analyses the factors that explain the reduction in emissions, particularly during the second phase of the ETS. The next section examines the decisions that have been taken regarding the amount of primary offering of emission permits. The fourth section discusses the reasons that have led to the surplus of permits in circulation since the end of the second ETS phase and the remedies proposed by the European Commission. Finally, the paper presents the case for the introduction and fixing of the minimum and maximum price during the auction for the sale of permits. © 2016, FrancoAngeli.","Cap and trade; Climate change mitigation policy; Emissions trading; EU ETS; EUAs price",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019224198

Vulnerability to drought-induced cavitation is a key trait of plant water relations, and contains valuable information about how plants may cope with drought stress. There is, however, no consensus in literature about how this is best measured. Here, we discuss detection of acoustic emissions as a measure for drought-induced cavitation. Past research and the current state of the art are reviewed. We also discuss how the acoustic emission technique can help solve some of the main issues regarding quantification of the degree of cavitation, and how it can contribute to our knowledge about plant behavior during drought stress.

Many people believe that tackling this problem is exclusively the job of governments and supranational institutions (especially the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). This argument can be traced back to the delegated authority model, according to which the legitimacy of political institutions depends on their ability to solve problems that are difficult to address at the individual level. Since the institutions created to tackle climate change fail to do so, their legitimacy is under great pressure and can only be saved by considerations of feasibility. We argue that democratically elected representatives are able to claim that a more robust climate policy is unfeasible, but only because the mandate we as citizens grant them is very restrictive. Instead of shifting responsibility for the thoroughly inadequate response to climate change fully to political representatives, we should highlight the failure of the political community as a whole to fulfil its responsibility at the input-side of the delegation of authority.

Urban transport systems are integral elements of the European transport system and are therefore of concern for the Common Transport Policy. Thus, the 2011 Transport White Paper calls for cities to implement a range of strategies to face these challenges - strategies include: land-use planning, pricing schemes, efficient public transport services, infrastructure for non-motorised modes and charging/refuelling of clean vehicles to reduce emissions - and encourage to develop Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) that bring all of these elements together. Tools and guidance documents are key instruments for the development of these strategies in order to help city authorities understanding the range of possible actions and steps to successful implementation. This paper presents an overview of the web based policy support tool developed in the European Urban Roadmaps study, supported by DG Move and underpinned by a range of stakeholders' engagement activities. The aim of the web based tool is to support authorities of small and medium sized cities in Europe who may not have the resource to major policy assessment and modelling work. The tool provide the local transport policy maker with the ability to readily identify, develop, screen and assess different measures and policies scenarios, thereby enabling city authorities to quickly gather a sense of the scale of impacts that could be expected. It is adaptable to different city circumstances, covers all the transport/travel modes that are used in urban areas and provides quantitative outputs covering a range of different metrics, including costs and cost effectiveness, covering the time period until 2030. The development of the tool is complemented by the preparation of different road maps, designed to provide examples of policy selections that could be implemented by a city to work towards the European Commission goals for sustainable urban transport until the year 2030. © 2016 The Authors.","on-line tool; policy assessment; policy scenarios; SUMP; urban transport",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991404484

However, because electricity markets remain integrated at a shallow level (with different pricing regulations), many gains from deeper integration (adoption of marginal cost pricing everywhere) are yet to be realized. This paper assesses the benefits of deep integration between a ""hydro"" jurisdiction and a ""thermal"" one. It also underscores the inefficiency of trade when pricing rules differ. Our detailed hourly model, calibrated with real data from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Canada, estimates price, consumption, emissions and welfare changes associated with fully integrating electricity markets, under transmission constraints. A negative abatement cost of $37/tonne of CO2 was found (for more than 1 million tonnes), clearly illustrating the untapped potential of wealth creation in carbon reduction initiatives. Furthermore, given the inefficiency of shallow integration between markets, we found that removing interconnections between markets offers a relatively affordable CO2-reduction opportunity, at $21.5/tonne.

Findings of our study highlight fishers’ capability to plan and construct creative livelihood strategies and their adaptability in the face of stresses. We observed that fisher’s coping strategies comprise a fluid combination of complex overlapping set of actions that they undertake based on their capabilities, socio-cultural embeddedness, and experiential learning under different adverse situations. Broadly, the coping strategies embody under economic, physiological, social, survival, institutional and religiosity-psychological factors.

As solar capacity increases, it can provide many environmental and market benefits, such as reducing emissions and the total dispatch cost. However, it also introduces greater volatility and lower net loads to the electric grid, and requires faster ramp rates from thermal plants to provide firming power. Generators respond to these flexibility requirements by cycling more often, ramping more quickly, and operating at lower-efficiency output levels. These responses increase generators' operating expenses. Expanding our understanding of the cost impacts of flexibility requirements will improve the ability of grid operators to efficiently integrate solar generation into the electric grid. This paper quantifies the relationships between flexibility requirements and integration costs by simulating increasingly volatile solar profiles in a unit commitment and dispatch model of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Each solar profile exhibits increasing levels of volatility while the maximum ramp rates, minimum net loads, and total energy production remain constant. The changes in simulated market dispatch show how generator startup costs, capacity factors, efficiencies and other integration costs change with increasing net load volatility. These results are intended to inform grid planners as they consider the integration costs of solar.",,"Commerce; Costs; Electric power plants; Integration; Solar power generation; Capacity factors; Capacity increase; Electric reliability council of texas; Market benefits; Operating expense; Reducing emissions; Solar generation; Solar integrations; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013888319

The effects of climate change can be readily seen in glacier melt and differences in sea ice. Meanwhile, significant changes in fisheries governance are seen through the introduction of new management plans in which the trickle-down of neoliberal ideas are evident. The most recent and significant changes taking place currently are in the coastal Greenland Halibut fishery where restructuring is expected to provide additional revenue for the government. This article presents the 2012 Coastal Greenland Halibut Management Plan, explores the alterations made to plan regulations in 2014, and discusses the implications of the ongoing reform process. The changes being made to coastal Greenland Halibut fishery management highlight a difficult balancing act between the neoliberal reorganization of the fisheries and the sustainability of coastal society and culture. The article concludes that decisions on fisheries regulations will remain in flux as ""business as usual,"" and confirms that the influence of the neoliberal discourse is increasing. Any inability of residents to adapt to climate-induced changes may result more from such policy constraints than from environmental change itself.

One can think of these anthropogenic effects as composed of two parts: the individual effect due to an individual anthropogenic forcing and the nonlinear effects resulting from the coexistence of two forcing factors. In this study, we explored the role of such nonlinear effects in affecting East Asian climate, as well as individual forcing effects, using the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 coupled with the Community Land Model version 4. Atmospheric responses were simulated by including anthropogenic aerosol emission only, urban cover only, or the combination of the two, over eastern China. Results showed that nonlinear responses were different from any effects by an individual forcing or the linear combination of individual responses. The nonlinear interaction could generate cold horizontal temperature advection to cool the troposphere, which induced anomalous subsidence along the Yangtze River Valley (YRV). This anomalous vertical motion, together with a weakened low-level southwesterly, favored below-normal (above-normal) rainfall over the YRV (southern China), shifting the spring rain belt southward. The resultant diabatic cooling, in turn, amplified the anomalous descent and further decreased tropospheric temperature over the YRV, forming a positive feedback loop to maintain the nonlinear effects. Consequently, the nonlinear effects acted to reduce the climate anomalies from a simple linear combination of two individual effects and played an important role in regional responses to one anthropogenic forcing when the other is prescribed. © 2016.

Understanding the drivers behind CO2 emission changes can help decouple economic growth from CO2 emissions. However, previous studies on the drivers of CO2 emissions in less-developed regions that focus on both production and final demand have been seldom conducted. In this study, a structural decomposition analysis-logarithmic mean Divisia index (SDA-LMDI) model was developed to find the drivers behind the CO2 emission changes during 1997-2012 in Yunnan, based on times series energy consumption and input-output data. The results demonstrated that the sharp rise in exports of high-carbon products from the metal processing and electricity sectors increased CO2 emissions, during 2002-2007. Although increased investments in the construction sector also increased CO2 emissions, during 2007-2012, the carbon intensity of Yunnan's economy decreased substantially because the province vigorously developed hydropower and improved energy efficiency in energy-intensive sectors.

Climate change and other anthropogenic factors are predicted to affect coral-reef ecosystems where these sulfur compounds are particularly abundant. We review the processes that regulate the production of dimethylated sulfur compounds in coral reefs and the potential consequences of environmental changes on their biogenic cycle in such fragile ecosystems under future climate change scenarios. AbstractDimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and its main breakdown products dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) are biogenic species in the marine environment. In coral reefs, these dimethylated sulfur compounds (DSCs) have been reported at greater concentrations than in other marine ecosystems, which is most likely attributable to the extraordinary large biodiversity of coral reef communities (e.g. corals, macroalgae, coralline algae, invertebrates) and to the unique ability of zooxanthellate corals to synthesise DMSP from both the animal host and algal symbionts. Besides the various biological functions that have been attributed to DSCs, including thermoregulation, osmoregulation, chemoattraction and antioxidant response, DMS is suspected to take part in a climate feedback loop that could help counteract global warming. Nowadays, anthropogenic effects such as pollution, overfishing, increased sedimentation and global climate change are imminently threatening the health of coral reef communities around the world, with possible consequences on the natural cycle of DSCs within these ecosystems. This review provides insight into the biogeochemistry of DSCs in coral reefs and discusses the implications of projected changes in DSC production in these increasingly stressed ecosystems under future climate change scenarios. It shows that DSC dynamics will incontestably be affected in the near future, with possible feedback consequences on local climate. © CSIRO 2016.",,"alga; anthropogenic source; antioxidant; biogeochemistry; climate change; climate feedback; coral reef; dimethylsulfide; dimethylsulfoniopropionate; global climate; invertebrate; marine ecosystem; osmoregulation; sedimentation; symbiont; algae; Animalia; Anthozoa; Invertebrata",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961601231

This research deals with performance evaluation of selected wall systems in all eight International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) U.S. climate zones. The performance ranges are representative of generic exterior insulation and finish wall systems but not of a specific manufactured product. A comparison was performed among three different exterior insulation and finish system (EIFS) walls and a brick wall system. Two steps were required to perform this work. The first step required the model validation of eight distinct wall systems previously measured in Charleston, SC. The validation was performed using WUFI-ORNL (Version 5) software, and a comparison of the measured versus simulated results from these wall systems indicated that the simulation model accurately captured the hygrothermal response of the wall systems. The second step was to simulate four wall systems in the eight climate zones. Each wall system was modeled with and without a vapor retarder and with and without a ""leak."" For this study, a leak is defined as the percentage of rainwater that strikes a wall's facade and that is assumed to get past the cladding as well as the water-resistive barrier and into the exterior sheathing. All of the simulations followed the recommendations prescribed in ASHRAE Standard 160, Design Criteria for Moisture Control in Buildings. Two specific criteria were extracted from the simulations to assess the hygrothermal properties of the wall systems. The average monthly heat flow into the building interior was used to evaluate the energy efficiency, and the average monthly moisture content of the exterior sheathings was studied to measure the moisture performance of the wall systems. © Copyright 2016 by ASTM International.","Durability; Energy efficiency; Exterior insulation and finish system (EIFS); Moisture","Computer software; Durability; Energy efficiency; Hydrophobicity; Innovation; Insulation; Moisture; Moisture control; Prestressed materials; Rain; Stucco; Verification; Building interiors; Exterior insulation and finish systems; Hygrothermal performance; Hygrothermal properties; Manufactured products; Moisture performance; Simulated results; Water resistive barriers; Walls (structural partitions)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974577238

The region is characterized by low relief, flat topography, and hydrology driven by a delicate balance between rainfall and evapotranspiration, high surface-water and groundwater interaction, presence of urbanized areas along the coast, significant agricultural areas, and a protected natural area - the Everglades. The water resources of this complex region is managed by the South Florida Water Management District (District). The district operates this system for flood control, water supply, water quality treatment, and ecosystem restoration. The hydrology of this region is driven mainly by rainfall and evapotranspiration. Thus, knowledge of changes in future climate parameters that affect these hydrologic components is critical for (i) projecting water resources availability, (ii) identifying water management system vulnerability, and (iii) designing adaptation measures. In an attempt to evaluate future water resources availability of the region, downscaled daily bias-corrected and constructed analogs of precipitation, minimum temperature and maximum temperature projections from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model dataset were analyzed. Data analysis included (i) identification of future trends in precipitation and temperature based on a total of 119 models and three climate forcing scenarios, (ii) evaluation of future seasonal water availability of the region, and (iii) assessing the impact of changes in precipitation, temperature and sea level on south Florida's water management system.

Kalapara has faced several cyclones, floods, storm surges in the recent years. Loss or damage of human life, livestock, bio-diversity, valuable goods etc. is significant consequences which press especially the low income people in a severe miserable platform. The study analyses the vulnerability of these low income people in respect to the last 25 years' natural disasters. After that, it represents some key strategies both for household and community levels to minimize the risk. The study based on both primary and secondary data. The primary household survey was conducted mainly to realize the fact on social vulnerability and secondary information dealt with hazard vulnerability. At the end, total vulnerability score was calculated through compilation of the social and hazard vulnerability index at total value of 1 in the context of exposure, sensitivity and adaptation. The structured household questionnaire responses facilitated different scenarios under sensitivity and adaptation which later on shaped the scale of vulnerabilities referring the renowned models of Haki and others. The outputs were flourished through vulnerability mapping dividing the total study area into small grids using GIS which outlines the high spatial susceptibility in those urban clusters where the concentrations of poor people are higher. It also attempted to correlate the vulnerability score with household perception level (local weather patterns and changes with global climate, their institutional linkages, local climate policy etc.) which predicts worrisome situation defining the impact of disasters in the next century may be even worse than today's. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

The life-cycle cost of electric vehicles has been widely studied to evaluate their competitiveness compared to conventional vehicles. However, the competitiveness of electric vehicles is highly dependent on government promotion policies, and the effects of non-economic incentive policies are currently difficult to include in life-cycle cost analysis. These non-economic effects are usually measured by the intangible cost. Traffic policies represent typical non-economic incentive policies. In China, electric vehicles are exempted from purchase restrictions (license plate control policy) and driving restrictions; thus, the intangible cost of traffic policies has significant effects on the comparison of electric vehicles and conventional vehicles. In this paper, from the consumers’ perspective, the intangible cost of purchase and driving restrictions is modeled and expressed in monetary terms; then, the impact of these non-economic incentive policies are compared with subsidies and other costs of vehicles. Thus, a more comprehensive comparison between electric and conventional vehicles can be provided. Using three selected typical battery electric vehicles and three correspondingly similarly sized conventional vehicles in China, the private life-cycle costs of battery electric vehicles and conventional vehicles are calculated and compared, a parametric variation analysis is performed, and the effects of economic and non-economic incentive policies in different cities are discussed. The comparison shows that, considering the tangible costs of vehicles, battery electric vehicles are not currently economically competitive compared with conventional vehicles, and both national and local subsidies are necessary for battery electric vehicles to compensate the cost gap between battery electric vehicles and conventional vehicles in the short term. However, considering the intangible costs, the advantages of traffic policies are very prominent in mega-cities but are significantly smaller in second-tier cities. With the increasingly worse traffic and environmental problems China facing, it is suggested that the promotion of electric vehicles in mega-cities be prioritized and that electric vehicle promotion policies based on taxes, subsidies and traffic control be balanced. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Driving restriction; Electric vehicle (EV); Intangible cost; Life-cycle cost (LCC); Policy benefits; Purchase restriction","Battery electric vehicles; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Crashworthiness; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; License plates (automobile); Life cycle; Sales; Secondary batteries; Traffic control; Vehicles; Comprehensive comparisons; Driving restrictions; Environmental problems; Intangible costs; Life cycle cost analysis; Life cycle costs (LCC); Parametric variation; Transportation sector; Electric machine control; comparative study; competitiveness; cost analysis; electric vehicle; governance approach; greenhouse gas; incentive; megacity; mobility; traffic emission; traffic management; transportation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979893741

As a stable gas with zero ozone depletion potential, SF6 is the standard insulation medium for high voltage metal enclosed gas insulated switchgear (GIS). However, SF6 has a CO2 global warming equivalent of 22'800. An alternative to SF6 could further reduce the carbon footprint of the electric grid. ABB investigated the use of an alternative candidate to SF6 based on a perfluorinated ketone with 5 carbon atoms (C5 PFK) with a systematic name 2-Butanone, 1,1,1,3,4,4,4-heptafluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)-. With a CO2 equivalent of one and an ozone depletion of zero, the C5 PFK is an ecofriendly alternative to SF6. To examine the impact of the alternative insulation on the environment, a life cycle assessment of the GIS insulated with C5 PFK has been conducted. Method and results are presented in this paper. As the vapor pressure of C5 PFK is significantly lower than the one of SF6, the insulation medium consist of a mixture of CO2 and O2 to increase electric strength and current interruption performance. This gas mixture allowed for the development of a GIS with 170 kV rated voltage based on an ELK-14 C, 245 kV GIS. During the development a cooperation with ewz, a large Swiss utility was started to bring the new technology into the grid in a pilot installation. After completing all relevant type tests, 8 bays of a 170 kV switchgear were installed in a new ewz substation in the city of Zurich. The indoor substation comprises all components of a typical GIS with cable terminals. The paper explains the experience made during type testing and manufacturing of the GIS as well as installation and commissioning of this 170 kV GIS substation pilot. Filling and reclaiming of the gas mixture is done with dedicated gas handling equipment. While the gas handling of the gas mixture requires additional equipment compared to SF6, the reporting of the new insulation media is not necessary. This simplifies the administrative burden of customers. The installation is an important milestone to gather long-term operational experience with the technology. Compared to the four decades experience with SF6, this technology is still in the starting phase. Further investigations are required to reach a similar maturity grade than SF6 based switchgears and to clarify the application range of this SF6 alternative. © 2016 CIGRE.

Forecasts suggest that climate change has the potential to have a major impact upon levels and patterns of demand for leisure flying as seasons change, as some traditional locations become less attractive and as new markets emerge, either at different times of the year or in new geographical regions. This paper deals with the key challenges and issues for the aviation and tourism sectors towards a climate change adaptation strategy for attractive tourist destinations. Through a top-down analysis, the variables of climate change that impact on the supply and demand equilibrium for tourism and aviation are defined, and based on a gap analysis framework, the relationship of these variables to the aviation and tourism equilibrium is given. Conventional wisdom is to provide key messages to aviation authorities, decision makers and stakeholders regarding the expected changes in demand, the implications in airport operation and the effects in regional economic development, especially, for regions that are highly reliant upon income from tourism. The application includes the aviation and tourism in Greece, which is a very attractive tourist destination in southeast Mediterranean, highlighting the diverse impacts of a changing climate on aviation and tourism, that expected to have significant implications for air traffic flows and the economies across Europe. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Aviation; Aviation-Tourism equilibrium; Climate Change; Implications; Tourism",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071392064

Although previous studies focused on the relationships of urbanization, air pollution, and climate change in Western countries, this study evaluated long-term variations of air quality and meteorological factors in Taiwanese metropolitan areas (Taipei area, Taichung City, and Kaohsiung City) and a rural area (Hualien County) between 1993 and 2012. The influence of a mass rapid transit (MRT) system on air quality was also evaluated. Air pollutant concentrations and meteorology data were collected from Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) air monitoring stations and Central Weather Bureau stations in the surveyed areas, respectively. Analyses indicate that levels of air pollution in metropolitan areas were greater than in the rural area. Kaohsiung City had the highest levels of O3, SO2, and particulate matter 2.5 or 10 mm in diameter (PM2.5 and PM10). Clear downward trends for CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and especially SO2 concentrations were found in the surveyed areas, whereas O3 showed no decrease. Both O3 and PM concentrations showed similar bimodal seasonal distributions. Taiwan's air quality has improved significantly since 1993, indicating the effectiveness of promoting air pollution strategies and policies by the TEPA. Air pollution had an obvious improvement in Taipei area after the MRT system began operations in 1996. Because global climate may potentially affect urban air pollution in Taiwan, further study to clarify the mechanisms by which air pollution may affect human health and other biological effects is warranted. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

Since it is an integral part of the hydrologic cycle, management of groundwater resources must consider not only the management of surface flows but also the variability in climate. In addition, agricultural and urban activities both affect the availability of water resources and are affected by it. Arguably, the Central Valley of the State of California, USA, can be considered a basin where all stresses that can possibly affect the management of groundwater resources seem to have come together: a vibrant economy that depends on water, a relatively dry climate, a disparity between water demand and availability both in time and space, heavily managed stream flows that are susceptible to water quality issues and sea level rise, degradation of aquifer conditions due to over-pumping, and degradation of the environment with multiple species becoming endangered. Over the past fifteen years, the California Department of Water Resources has developed and maintained the Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM) to aid in groundwater management and planning under complex, and often competing, requirements.

Furthermore, such oaks may become prone to infestation with mistletoe (Loranthus europaeus) and competition from neighbouring trees. We tested these predictions in the warm, south-eastern part of the Czech Republic, a drought-prone area where oaks die prematurely. We compared the radial growth patterns of eight categories of oaks differing in age (younger or older than 60 years), presence of neighbouring trees (solitary versus grouped) and infestation with mistletoe (infested versus healthy), and their responses to variation in both annual and intra-annual temperature (T) and precipitation (P). We analysed long-term data from tree rings and detailed dendrometer records of daily increments using moving correlations and regression trees. Oak growth is affected by (i) dry and cold winters, resulting in root damage and water shortages during summer, (ii) a cool and wet March-April, hampering the onset of earlywood growth, and (iii) a hot and dry May-July period, reducing latewood formation. Latewood width increases when February P > 55 mm, March T > 3.3 °C, April P < 60 mm, May P > 50 mm, June T < 19 °C and August P > 40 mm. Latewood width decreases with tree age, mistletoe infestation and competiton from neighbouring trees. These factors are responsible for different climate-growth responses. Infested oaks develop less latewood if T in June-July is high and this is associated with drought. In healthy oaks May P determines how quickly earlywood growth is completed and hence when latewood formation starts. Grouped trees that compete for soil water are more prone to June-July droughts but less harmed by cold springs than solitary oaks. Dendrometer records show that the net daily increments (ΔR) recorded for oaks growing in groups are mainly associated with water deficit, whereas those of solitary oaks with high summer T, which fluctuates more in open landscape than in woods, resulting in a reduced number of days with a positive ΔR. However, under optimal conditions (soil moisture > 20%, mean daily T 10-20 °C), the ΔR phase recorded for solitary oaks is longer than for oaks in groups, which results in greater annual increments. Hence, the differences between solitary oaks and those in groups is due to a difference in the period of time they spend growing rather than the speed of growth. Infested oaks have smaller ΔRs and annual increments because they grow for a shorter period rather than differences in metabolic activity. These results provide support for the crucial role of climate change (decline in rainfall and increase in summer temperatures over the last three decades) and biotic interactions (mistletoe hemiparasites, inter-tree competition) in oak growth and population decline.","Conditional inference trees; Dendrometers; Growth-climate relationships; Intra-annual variation; Loranthus Europaeus; Moving response function; Quercus robur; Stem contraction; Tree-water relations","abiotic factor; annual variation; climate change; competition (ecology); deciduous tree; dendroclimatology; drought stress; growth response; hemiparasite; population decline; soil water; Czech Republic; Loranthus europaeus; Quercus; Quercus robur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990036943

In order to assess the financial and technical outcome of connecting five adjacent district heating systems, a linear continuous optimization model that minimizes total socio-economic costs was developed. Geographical distribution of different district heating systems was truly represented. The model was adapted to the case of Sønderborg municipality in Denmark and the results show that three out of four interconnections are economic feasible in the present system. In the reference year (2013) total system costs were 4.1 % lower, while total primary energy supply was reduced by 1.76 %.

Modern dielectric dispersion tools are sensitive to dielectric anisotropy across their full frequency range except for the high limit near 1 GHz. This high level of sensitivity to the anisotropy in complex permittivity (i.e., in both conductivity and permittivity) has been commonly observed in field examples; however, it is yet to be exploited for interpretation purposes. A fully anisotropic dielectric dispersion model developed from first principles is used to characterize the complex permittivity anisotropy. It is shown that any variation in water volume, water salinity, or water-phase tortuosity inside a microscopically laminated formation can make the conductivity and permittivity properties both anisotropic and dispersive within the frequency range of modern dielectric dispersion tools. Further, the dispersive signature of the complex permittivity can be linked to the petrophysical factors that cause the anisotropy in the formation. The complex permittivity anisotropy coefficients are themselves frequency dependent, so the conductivity anisotropy coefficient estimated within the frequency range of a dielectric tool cannot directly be compared with the DC resistivity anisotropy coefficient Rv/Rh from a triaxial induction measurement. In an anisotropic formation, conventional dielectric interpretation makes use of an isotropic dispersion model by considering only the horizontal components of the complex permittivity obtained from the longitudinal (ZZ-) measurements. Analysis shows that making use of an anisotropic dispersion model and considering all the dielectric measurements that are sensitive to anisotropy leads to a more robust and accurate determination of the water-filled porosity, water salinity, and tortuosity of the water phase in the formation. The use of an anisotropic dispersion model for the dielectric interpretation also enables reconstructing both the horizontal and the vertical components of the DC resistivity. This makes it possible to compare the resistivity anisotropy from a shallow region estimated from dielectric dispersion to the resistivity anisotropy from a much deeper region estimated from triaxial induction. For millimeter- to centimeter-scale shale-sand laminations, this comparison can be used to detect the hydrocarbon movability for the case of a water-base-mud well and to detect the formation water movability for the case of an oil-base-mud well.

Dielectric dispersion data can be inverted to estimate water saturation in conditions where the interpretation of resistivity with traditional saturation equations is problematic, such as low and variable water salinities, complex texture, and unknown wettability. There is, however, a recognized limitation: salinity can be estimated only in the low to medium range. Above about 60 ppk, water salinity, which influences the estimated water volume, must be fixed in the dielectric interpretation. The thermal neutron capture cross-section (sigma) measurement primarily responds to the volume and salinity of the water that is present in the region of the formation seen by the tool. It provides an excellent complement to dielectric measurements for several reasons. Sigma is highly sensitive to the salinity of the water phase, particularly at high salinities. Both sigma and dielectric measurements have a similar volume of investigation and so can be interpreted in a joint inversion. We developed a joint inversion of dielectric dispersion and neutron sigma measurements that solves for the water volume, water salinity, and tortuosity of the water phase. The addition of neutron sigma to the dielectric dispersion measurements extends the interpretation to high-salinity conditions, and enables the capability of quantifying water salinity in conditions where this was previously not possible. We illustrate the benefits of this joint inversion on some log examples. In a well drilled with water-based mud and fully invaded, the inversion provides a robust estimate of filtrate salinity even for highly saline filtrate and reduces the uncertainty on the estimated residual hydrocarbon. In the case of oil-based mud invasion, the method quantifies the salinity of the formation water even for moderately to highly saline water.

The present paper proposes an improved two-step soot model. The model is applied in the Kiva-Chemkin program to simulate the processes of spray impinging, fuel mixture preparation, combustion and soot formation in a typical turbocharged downsized GDI engine. The simulation results show that soot formation in the GDI engine is attributed to non-uniform distribution of the air-fuel mixture and pool fire of wall film in the cylinder. Under homogeneous mode, increasing the injection advance angle can optimize fuel atomization and improve air-fuel mixing, thus reducing soot formation. However, an excessive injection advance angle may cause spray to impinge on the cylinder wall and this will sharply increase the soot emission. Under stratified operation, soot formation can be attributed to combustion of locally fuel-rich mixture. The soot model proposed can satisfactorily predict the trends of soot formation in a GDI engine.

Therefore, it is important to improve knowledge on its density, current and future spatial distribution. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the tree density, the climate change effects on the spatial distribution of the species in the future for better conservation. The modeling of the current and future geographical distribution of the species was based on the principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) using a total of 286 occurrence points from field work and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF-Data Portal. Two climatic models (HadGEM2-ES and Csiro-mk3-6-0) were used under two scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for the projection of the species distribution at the horizon 2050. Correlation analyses and Jackknife test helped to identify seven variables which are less correlated (r < 0.80) with highest contribution to the model. Soil, annual precipitation and temperature (diurnal average Deviation) are the variables which have mostly contributed to the models. Currently, 53% of national territory of Benin, spread from north to south is very suitable for P. biglobosa. At the temporal horizon 2050, the scenarios have projected loss of habitats, which are currently very suitable for P. biglobosa. 51% and 57% are the highest proportions of this habitat lost, which has been registered with HadGEM2-ES model under two scenarios. In order to limit damages such as decreased in productivity and extirpation, some appropriate solutions must be found.

However, BECCS will likely be more costly and less efficient at power generation than conventional CCS. Thus, approaches to improve BECCS performance and reduce costs are of importance to facilitate the deployment of this key technology. In this study, the impact of biomass co-firing rate and biomass moisture content on BECCS efficiency with both post- and oxy-combustion CO2 capture technologies was evaluated. It was found that post-combustion capture BECCS (PCC-BECCS) facilities will be appreciably less efficient than oxy-combustion capture BECCS (OCC-BECCS) facilities. Consequently, PCC-BECCS have the potential to be more carbon negative than OCC-BECCS per unit electricity generated. It was further observed that the biomass moisture content plays an important role in determining the BECCS facilities' efficiency. This will in turn affect the enthalpic content of the BECCS plant exhaust and implies that exhaust gas heat recovery may be an attractive option at higher rates of co-firing. It was found that there is the potential for the recovery of approximately 2.5 GJheat per tCO2 at a temperature of 100 °C from both PCC-BECCS and OCC-BECCS.

The photoluminescence spectra in solution for both the complexes are characterized by wavelength emission maxima at around 510 nm and higher quantum yields. In the solid state, the emission spectrum of the complex with L2 is characterized by higher emission intensity than the [Ir(F2ppy)2L1](PF6) complex. This behavior is explained as due to the effect of the more bulky structure of the L2 ligand, which prevents, in a more efficient way compared to the complex with L1, the auto-quenching processes in the solid packing. DFT calculations were performed to understand the photophysical behavior of the complexes, and an excellent agreement between experimental and theoretical data was observed. For the complex with L2, the electronic density of the HOMO is located in the chain and phenyl fragment of this ligand. This behavior is quite different from that expected for a typical Ir(iii) cyclometalated complex, where the electron density of the HOMO is located on the metal (t2g orbitals)/phenyl fragment of the cyclometalating ligand. In spite of these differences, both complexes are good emitters, and in both cases the emission comes from a single T1 emitter state with the contribution of the MLCT and LLCT. In order to get a first approximation of the behavior of these complexes in LEC (light emitting electrochemical cells) applications, the electroluminescence spectra with an applied bias of 12 V were obtained.

The second industry as the leading industrial structure has an obvious driving effect on carbon emissions, but its carbon emission intensity is decreasing and its proportion of GDP is positive relevant with per capita carbon emission. The relationship between per capita GDP and per capita carbon emission presents the inverted N-shape. With the Per capita GDP increasing, the personal average carbon emission at the beginning increases at an increasing rate and then at the decreasing rate. Owing to the proportion of secondary industry decreasing and proportion of tertiary industry increasing, the momentum of rapid growth of carbon emissions has been suppressed.

To feed the growing population and meet the increasing needs of economy, the expansion of social energy sector cannot be avoided, which puts more pressures on the fresh water supply for cities. Meanwhile, cities suffers a lot from severe water scarcity problems. At another hand, energy consumption has a positive correlation with carbon emissions which is proved by previous studies, and urban areas accounts for more than half of the total global carbon emission. Therefore, this study aims to develop a framework for modelling energy-water-carbon nexus at urban scale, and facilitate the mitigation of carbon emission in urban area.

The establishment of this model is a salutary attempt to Sinicize the global integrated assessment model that combines economy, energy, and environment systems. The simulation results indicate that: (1) for majority of regions, ETS is more effective in cutting CO2 emissions than a harmonized carbon tax (HCT), but this might not be true for the entire country, which means that these two options have little difference in overall carbon reduction; (2) carbon tax policy is a more cost-effective option in curbing CO2 with respect to ETS in the long run; (3) neither ETS nor pure carbon tax provide enough incentives for the breakthrough of carbon-free energy technologies, which illustrates that matching with some other support policies, such as subsidies and R&amp;D investment, is essential to extend the niche market; and (4) In the context of ETS, the diffusion of non-fossil technologies in regions that act as sellers performs much better than this diffusion in the buyer regions. © 2016 by the IAEE.

The main aim of this article is to determine principle regularities that stipulate and restrict abilities of the BRICS countries to use the renewable energy sector in order to replace high-carbon consumption in economic and social sector. Basic conclusions of this work are the following: (1) The aggregate of economic, social, ecological, and energetic problems faced by the modern civilization are directly interrelated. That is why in order to preserve the environment and natural resources for future generations, it is necessary to refuse from resources of unsustainable and high-carbon areas of development, (2) the concept of green economy lies in the fact that needs of the humankind must be rationalized, above all, in the power context, through ensuring a reasonable refusal from using economically destructive carbons by replacing them with renewable power sources, (3) a lot of European countries made the power breakthrough simultaneously developing traditional and renewable energetic. However, it is impossible to make the same conclusion in relation to the BRICS countries. In the BRICS coalition only one country – China - can be acknowledged as a leader in using the renewable energy sector. However, at the same time this country is an “anti-leader” in polluting the environment, (4) at the present time economy of the BRICS countries cannot be yet acknowledged as green. However, along with this, India, China, RSA, Russia, and Brazil have a considerable natural, climatic, and geographical potential for efficient use of benefits of the renewable energy sector. In the future it will allow them to transfer from the industrial and unsustainable vector of development to ecologically responsible development. © 2016, Econjournals.

Truck tyre wear (10% improvement) and wet safety performance levels will also be additionally improved. This proposed concept is going beyond current state of art and stakeholder or market expectations regarding tyre rolling resistance, mileage, driving safety, driving performance and material and manufacturing sustainability. To reach this objective, a multidisciplinary approach has been initiated covering the fields of tyre technology, rubber and filler technology, nanotechnologies, composite physics, sensory, transport and road infrastructure. A complete set of complementary scientific evaluation methods enable the understanding of interactions between new tread pattern design and new material composites as well as the tyre performance dependency on tyre-vehicle operation and road conditions.

This model confirms the fragmentation mechanism of hadronization (in vacuum). It allows to estimate mean multiplicity at 500 GeV and 1 TeV. Gluon dominance model is the modification of this model for the description of hadronic interactions. It was realised by an inclusion of gluons. It demonstrates very strong evidence of the recombination mechanism of hadronization. In this case, the mean multiplicity of hadrons formed from a single gluon grows with energy and it exceeds the corresponding values for lepton interactions. At the same time, the region of high multiplicity is stipulated for splitting of active gluons.

This paper seeks to address this gap, presenting a climate justice toolkit (indicator set and guidance) that enables the consistent assessment of distributional impacts of climate policy, and thus allows cumulative impacts to be assessed across the broad suites of policies that comprise national adaptation programmes. The objective in so doing is to inform the selection of appropriate policy options and to identify situations where supplementary policy may be required to redress negative or inequitable impacts. Drawing on a pilot impact assessment of the Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme, this paper discusses the rationale behind the development of a climate justice indicator set and presents a guide to the screening of large policy suites for potential cumulative impacts across communities of living (households) and working (private and public sectors). The methodological perspectives discussed can be useful in studies of climate change and social issues elsewhere, particularly in assessing the likely ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ of policy implementations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Adaptation; Climate justice; Climate policy; Impact assessment; Scotland; Vulnerability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071359233

The ongoing research surrounding this system is looking both towards new ways to molecularly bind phosphorus and nitrogen to a functionalized biochar and disinfect water resources in order to produce reusable water and a nutrient rich soil amendment for agricultural applications. Nutrient enriched biochar used as a soil amendment will sequester carbon from the atmosphere while offsetting the demand for fertilizers produced through mining and industrial processing. The intention of this project is to conduct a life cycle analysis surrounding the N-E-W Tech system. Life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-grave analysis and establishes benchmark of the energy required to operate the system, energy efficiency optimization opportunities, and an analysis of potential reductions in the harvesting of natural resources. Additionally, due to the potential offsets in the demand for natural resource extraction, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere via the mining, processing, and production of agricultural fertilizers. Currently, the N-E-W Tech system can achieve full operations utilizing approximately 5.7 kW of electricity and is capable of processing 1000 gallons (12 gpm) of waste water for approximately 0.60 dollars.

Models such as i-Tree Eco enable decision-making by quantifying effects associated with particular tree species. Of specific concern are emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, particularly isoprene, that contribute to the formation of photochemical smog and ground level ozone. Few studies have quantified these potential disservices of urban trees, and current models predominantly use emissions data from trees that differ from those in our target region of subtropical Australia. The present study aimed (i) to quantify isoprene emission rates of three tree species that together represent 16% of the inventoried street trees in the target region; (ii) to evaluate outputs of the i-Tree Eco model using species-specific versus currently used, generic isoprene emission rates; and (iii) to evaluate the findings in the context of regional air quality. Isoprene emission rates of Xanthostemon chrysanthus (Myrtaceae) and Buckinghamia celsissima (Proteaceae) were 2.61 and 2.06 μg g-1 dry leaf weight h-1, respectively, whereas Harpullia pendula (Sapindaceae) was a nonisoprene emitter. We substituted the generic isoprene emission rates with these three empirical values in i-Tree Eco, resulting in a 182 kg yr-1 (97%) reduction in isoprene emissions, totaling 6284 kg yr-1 when extrapolated to the target region. From these results we conclude that care has to be taken when using generic isoprene emission factors for urban tree models. We recommend that emissions be quantified for commonly planted trees, allowing decision-makers to select tree species with the greatest overall benefit for the urban environment. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Decision making; Forestry; Isoprene; Quality control; Sustainable development; Volatile organic compounds; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Environmental benefits; Ground-level ozone; Photochemical smog; Regional air quality; Regional air quality modeling; Sustainable management; Urban environments; Trees (mathematics); isoprene; ozone; 1,3 butadiene; hemiterpene; isoprene; pentane; air quality; air quality standard; Article; Australia; Buckinghamia celsissima; Harpullia pendula; Myrtaceae; photochemical smog; Proteaceae; Sapindaceae; tree; urban area; Xanthostemon chrysanthus; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; theoretical model; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Australia; Butadienes; Cities; Hemiterpenes; Models, Theoretical; Pentanes; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957586005

The most mature technology for post-combustion capture uses a liquid sorbent, amine scrubbing. However, with the existing technology, a large amount of heat is required for the regeneration of the liquid sorbent, which introduces a substantial energy penalty. The use of alternative sorbents for CO2 capture, such as the CaO-CaCO3 system, has been investigated extensively in recent years. However there are significant problems associated with the use of CaO based sorbents, the most challenging one being the deactivation of the sorbent material. When sorbents such as natural limestone are used, the capture capacity of the solid sorbent can fall by as much as 90 mol% after the first 20 carbonation-regeneration cycles. In this study a variety of techniques were employed to understand better the cause of this deterioration from both a structural and morphological standpoint. X-ray and neutron PDF studies were employed to understand better the local surface and interfacial structures formed upon reaction, finding that after carbonation the surface roughness is decreased for CaO. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies showed that carbonation with added steam leads to a faster and more complete conversion of CaO than under conditions without steam, as evidenced by the phases seen at different depths within the sample. Finally, in situ X-ray tomography experiments were employed to track the morphological changes in the sorbents during carbonation, observing directly the reduction in porosity and increase in tortuosity of the pore network over multiple calcination reactions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994240202

In the early 1990s, the rediscovery of villages for tourism purposes caused a change in approach to conservation policies and village management. Today, villages are subjected to climate change with mass tourism as a contributing factor. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether the village community is climate change aware and to identify best practises for it. Design/methodology/approach: In this case study, the authors adopted a visual research technique called Photovoice. It is a research method which combines preliminary data collection and initial analysis processes. The main goals of adopting Photovoice are to enable community members to record and reflect their community’s strengths and concerns, to promote dialogue and knowledge exchange among community members regarding critical local social or environmental issues through small group discussion, and to report to policymakers. Findings: This research demonstrated that both visitors and hosts shared common thoughts on tourism interests, impacts and current actions regarding climate change. Age, level of education or origin did not interfere and it shows a common awareness regarding the effects of climate change. It confirms the structural assumption that local and expertise knowledge are complementary. Originality/value: At a time when awareness of climate change is affecting almost every debate concerning development strategies, future planning, governance and action implementations, very little has been written on the climate change impact on villages from a community perspective. Even less has been researched on what are called “urban rural villages”, that are villages located at the close periphery of a large urban agglomerations or cities in China. © 2016, International Tourism Studies Association.","China; Climate change; Photovoice; Rural village; Tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045618237

However, the well-established occurrence of widespread regional disconformities in the abyssal plains of the Southern Ocean attests to extensive erosion of deep-sea sediments during the Quaternary. We show that a wide belt of rapid sedimentation rates (>5.5 cm/k.y.) along the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR) is a global anomaly and occurs in a region of low surface productivity bounded by two major disconformity fields associated with the Kerguelen Plateau to the east and the Macquarie Ridge to the west. Our high-resolution numerical ocean circulation model shows that the disconformity fields occur in regions of intense bottom-current activity where current speeds reach 0.2 m/s and are favorable for generating intense nepheloid layers. These layers are transported toward and along the SEIR to regions where bottom-current velocities drop to <0.03 m/s and fine particles settle out of suspension, consistent with focusing factors significantly greater than 1. We suggest that the anomalous accumulation of sediment along an 8000-km-long segment of the SEIR represents a giant succession of contourite drifts that is a major extension of the much smaller contourite east of Kerguelen Plateau and has occurred since 3-5 Ma based on the age of the oldest crust underlying the deposit.

This paper examines the factors that contribute to the success of such networks by drawing on unique data from two pilot projects with 34 energy efficiency networks in Germany. The objective is to explain why companies participating in such networks are much faster at reducing their energy costs than the average in similar businesses. Possible explanations for the success of energy efficiency networks include: (1) energy audits make profitable potentials visible; (2) the joint network targets for efficiency and emissions increase the motivation of energy managers, decision-makers and other staff members; (3) the meetings and site visits to the network participants act like an intensive training course. They increase the knowledge of eficient solutions, change decision routines, and lead to trust among the participants, thereby reducing transaction costs. In our data, we find support for the first and the third explanations, i.e. the audits make profitable potentials visible and networks function as a training course to increase knowledge. The impact of network goals, on the other hand, appears to have both up- and downsides. We conclude with the need for further research in order to capture these mechanisms in more detail. © 2018 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

The solvatochromism of 8 was studied by DFT and ADC(2) calculations to show that, depending on the polarity of the solvent, emission either from the planar or the twisted conformation of the excited state can occur. The nucleoside was converted to its triphosphate variant dCFLTP which was found to be a good substrate for DNA polymerases suitable for the enzymatic synthesis of oligonucleotide or DNA probes by primer extension or PCR. The fluorene-linked DNA can be used as fluorescent probes for DNA-protein (p53) or DNA-lipid interactions, exerting significant color changes visible even to the naked eye.

Regional GHG emissions associated with beef production are reported for 21 defined agricultural statistical regions within state/territory jurisdictions. A management scenario for reduced emissions that could qualify as an Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) project was used to illustrate the effect of regional level model parameters on estimated abatement levels. Using regional parameters, instead of state level parameters, for liveweight (LW), LW gain and proportion of cows lactating and an expanded number of livestock classes, gives a 5.2% reduction in estimated emissions (range +12% to -34% across regions). Estimated GHG emissions intensity (emissions per kilogram of LW sold) varied across the regions by up to 2.5-fold, ranging from 10.5kgCO2-ekg-1LW sold for Darling Downs, Queensland, through to 25.8kgCO2-ekg-1LW sold for the Pindan and North Kimberley, Western Australia. This range was driven by differences in production efficiency, reproduction rate, growth rate and survival. This suggests that some regions in northern Australia are likely to have substantial opportunities for GHG abatement and higher livestock income. However, this must be coupled with the availability of management activities that can be implemented to improve production efficiency; wet season phosphorus (P) supplementation being one such practice. An ERF case study comparison showed that P supplementation of a typical-sized herd produced an estimated reduction of 622 tCO2-eyear-1, or 7%, compared with a non-P supplemented herd. However, the different model parameters used by the National Inventory Report and ERF project means that there was an anomaly between the herd emissions for project cattle excised from the national accounts (13479tCO2-eyear-1) and the baseline herd emissions estimated for the ERF project (8896tCO2-eyear-1) before P supplementation was implemented. Regionalising livestock model parameters in both ERF projects and the national accounts offers the attraction of being able to more easily and accurately reflect emissions savings from this type of emissions reduction project in Australia's national GHG accounts.","carbon farming; phosphorus supplementation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976533531

The appearance of Islam and allegories of paradise taken from that in Koran and Saints' sayings gave spirituality to garden construction. Climate conditions have also had an important role in this respect but little research has been done about it and most of the investigations have referred to spiritual aspects and forms of garden. The cold and dry climate that has enveloped parts of West and North West of Iran has many gardens with different forms and functions, which have not been paid much attention to by studies done so far. The aim of this paper is to identify the features and specifications of cold and dry climate gardens with an emphasis on Tabriz's Gardens. Due to its natural and strategic situation, Tabriz has always been in the attention of governments throughout history; travellers and tourists have mentioned Tabriz as a city that has beautiful gardens. But, the earthquakes and wars have left no remains of those beautiful gardens. This investigation, by a comparative study of the climates in Iran and the effect of those climates on the formation of gardens and garden design, tries to identify the features and characteristics of gardens in cold and dry climate.

It contributes to increase the knowledge of where the plants grow. This study was conducted to determine the main autecological characteristics of Salvia hydrangea L. which is an endemic plant distributed in Mazanadarn province, Iran. The habitats of this species (altitude of 1100, 1700 and 2000m) were identified (2014) and then, the climatic and edaphic characteristics of habitats were determined. Surveys of the plant in the habitats were done along the transect (100m) within quadrant (4m2) with a systematically randomized method during major phenological stages of the plant. Phenological stages and some plant characteristics such as density, canopy cover, plant height and root system were studied. Results showed that in lower altitudes, vegetative growth starts in the middle of February and follows the flowering at the end of May whereas in higher altitudes, the plant starts vegetative growth in the early March and reaches fully flowered at the end of June. The mean annual rainfall and temperature of the habitats ranged from 383-540 mm and 21-24°C, respectively. Results showed that the plant density and canopy cover decreased slowly with increasing altitude while reaching the minimum value in the altitude of 2000m. The root depth of plant in the loamy sand soils was deeper than the clay loamy soils. Density and other measured vegetal factors of plant decreased with decreasing the nutrient content of soil. Loamy sand and clay loamy soils of the habitat had pH near neutral and EC varying from 0.43 to 0.90 dS m-1. It was concluded that the plant generally prefers the climate conditions with high temperature and high rainfall. In lower altitudes with more soil nutrients, there are more optimal conditions for the domestication and harvesting of S. hydrangea L. as a medicinal plant.","Autecology; Ecological factors; Phenology; Salvia hydrangea L",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018888425

Therefore, widespread electrification, i.e., switching direct fossil fuel use to electricity, along with smart grid deployment, is essential for meeting deep emissions reduction targets. In this study, the load-balancing and emission impacts of electrifying end-use energy sectors while decarbonizing power generation, and deploying smart-grid technologies are analyzed using detailed modeling of infrastructure, feedstocks and economic dispatch of the electric grid. In the most comprehensive scenario, all end-use energy sectors are partly electrified by 2030 via replacing gas-fired end-uses with highly efficient electric technologies. The electric power generation sector is decarbonized through installing higher levels of renewable power meeting nearly 50 percent of total California electric energy demand in 2030. Various smart grid technologies including battery energy storage, demand response, and smart electric vehicle charging are implemented in the end-use sectors in order to accommodate and complement higher levels of renewable power resources. It is found that decarbonizing the electric power generation without electrifying end-use sectors increases CO2 emissions by 3.1 percent, while end-use electrification alongside utility scale and distributed renewable resource integration and smart grid technology implementation can yield up to a 29 percent reduction in CO2 emissions in 2030 compared to 1990 levels. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Crashworthiness; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Grid computing; Scheduling; Sustainable development; Battery energy storage; Detailed modeling; Economic Dispatch; Electric vehicle charging; Emissions reduction; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Renewable resource; Smart Grid technologies; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997531415

This is especially the case for high volatile feedstocks such as lignites and biomass and for sub-bituminous coals with high ash content. As it is employed below the ash softening point of the feedstock it has a low specific oxygen demand. The fluidized-bed gasification process was developed in the 1920's in Germany by Fritz Winkler. From the 1950s to the 1970s more than 70 units have been build and operated. In the 1970's Uhde (now thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions) together with Rheinische Braunkohlenwerke AG (now RWE) commenced with the development of a pressurized version of the Winkler gasifier - the High-Temperature Winkler (HTW™) gasification process. The HTW™ process enables shorter residence time, higher reaction velocity, higher reactor throughput for larger plant capacity, higher carbon conversion rate, higher plant efficiency and improved syngas quality. A lot of knowledge has been generated and experience gained since then in the engineering, construction and operation of various pilot, demonstration and commercial plants. However none of these plants is available for testing and research anymore. The construction and commissioning of a new, state of the art HTW™ pilot plant was successfully completed in 2015 at the Institute for Energy Systems and Technology of TU Darmstadt in cooperation with thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions as the technology owner. Since then several test runs have been carried out with Rhenish lignite (as reference coal) and high volatile bituminous coal in long term test runs of one week and more. The experimental data generated during the gasification test provides valuable information about the gasification behavior at different operation conditions, thus creating the required data set for upscaling and design of industrial scale facilities. The pilot plant in Darmstadt is ready for future tests with customer coals and other suitable feedstocks. In addition the HTW™ gasifier will be part of ongoing and future research projects in the field of gasification. Promising coal value chains can hereby be evaluated in practice. © 2016, Deutsche Wissens. Gesell. fur Erdoel, Erdgas und Kohle EV.

This is particularly useful because local ozone production essentially depends on this single parameter rather than on the details of the underlying hydrocarbon mixture (Klemp et al., Schriften des Forschungszentrums Jülich, Energy &amp; Environment, 2012, 21). The VOC composition also enables us to pin down the major emission source of hydrocarbons in urban areas to be petrol cars with temporarily reduced catalyst efficiency (the so-called cold-start situation) whereas the source of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) is expected to be nowadays dominated by diesel cars. The observations in the vicinity of main roads in German cities show a decrease in the ratio of OH reactivities of VOC and NO2 (RVOC/RNO2) by a factor of 7.5 over the time period 1994-2014. This is larger than the expected decrease of a factor of 2.9 taking estimated trends of VOC and NOx traffic emissions in Germany (Umweltbundesamt Deutschland, National Trend Tables for the German Atmospheric Emission Reporting, 2015), during this time period. The observed reduction in the RVOC/RNO2 ratio leads to a drastic decrease in local ozone production driven by the reduction in hydrocarbons. The analysis reveals that the overall reduction of ozone production benefits from the low decrease of NOx emissions from road traffic which is a consequence of the eventual absence of catalytic converters for nitrogen oxide removal in diesel cars up to now. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979007780

Indeed, in 2012, groundwater extractions reached 608 million m3 while groundwater potential was only 347 million m3, yielding a deficit of nearly 300 million m3. Moreover, climate change will have a certain impact on the future of these resources. Recent studies predicted an increase in the mean annual temperature ranging between 0.1 and 1.4?C by the period 2010-2030, and a decrease in the average annual rainfall of about 200 mm. The demand for irrigation water and drinking water will yet increase given the population growth coupled with progressive economic development. Climate change will adversely have an impact on aquifers recharge and the level of their water table, and consequently, the gap between supply and demand will increasingly rise. Groundwater models that take into account regional climate scenarios, are necessary to predict the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater resources sustainability. In this work, a reflection on a more efficient and sustainable management of groundwater resources in the Oum Er Rabia basin will be presented. The primary goal is to fill the gap between water supply and demand through climate change adaptation actions, in particular, the use of non-conventional water resources such as desalination of sea water, reuse of treated wastewater, rainwater harvesting, optimization of irrigation infrastructures and the adoption of projects of water transfer from other national basins with excess water. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Aquifers; Climate models; Desalination; Economics; Engineering research; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Irrigation; Population statistics; Potable water; Seawater; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water supply; Water treatment; Climate change adaptation; Groundwater extraction; Groundwater management; Groundwater potentials; Mean annual temperatures; Non-conventional water resources; Sustainable management; Water supply and demands; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015022554

The present paper explores aspects of travel behavior in one of Egypt's largest and most dense informal settlements, Ezbet El-Haggana, through a qualitative study of children's travel to school. The key research question was: How do children interact with transport options to access schools in a dense informal settlement in Egypt? Ten Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) for this research were conducted, 4 with mothers, 5 with children, and 1 with transport service providers. Design of FGDs leveraged existing behavioral theories commonly used in exploring travel behavior and also included photo-elicitation. Qualitative data was also complimented with field observations and interviews with community leaders and government officials. Findings highlighted the high degree of children's independent mobility (CIM) and the diversity of modes of transport used and multitude of trip-to-school arrangements facilitated by community collaboration and entrepreneurial initiatives standing in contrast to current mainstream knowledge about trips to school in formal urban areas. Another distinct feature is prevalence of strong socio-cultural factors strongly inhibiting the consideration of cycling as a mode of transport, more so for older females, but also for all other segments. Implications for accompanying culturally-sensitive gender-specific soft measures that are needed together with the planned hard interventions are discussed in order to (a) maintain existing elements of sustainable travel behavior observed today (mode choices and efficient trip planning) sustaining their relatively low carbon footprint, and (b) mainstream underutilized modes such as cycling and Walking School Buses (WSB), and (c) inhibit adoption of unsustainable travel behavior in the future as found in the formal counterpart of the city that informal settlements are converging with. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the natural gas that is produced from non-thermal oil recovery processes, the gas contains high amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and condensable C7+ hydrocarbons. It has a low BTU content (e.g. 400-700 Btu/scf) and is not suitable for selling. Instead, it is usually incinerated through flaring or commingled with the steam generator fuel gas stream. In either case, all of the H2S that is present must be removed so that sulfur products of combustion are not released to the atmosphere with the flare or steam generator exhaust gas. A term used for H2S removal is natural gas ""sweetening."" Among the various effective sweetening methods is the flow of natural gas through a bed of wood chips impregnated with iron oxide within a reactor called an iron sponge. The H2S in the produced natural gas reacts with the iron oxide to produce insoluble iron sulfide and water. The reaction renders the natural gas free of H2S. But, the reaction is impeded when the bed is contacted by hydrocarbon liquids. This is because a thin film of the liquid forms over the iron oxide and blocks the reaction from occurring. Hydrocarbon liquids form when the feed gas pressure and temperature go beyond the gas mixture's dew point and cross into the PVT phase equilibrium envelope. The capacity for H2S removal by the iron sponge is reduced as hydrocarbon liquids precipitate from the flowing gas. In this study, fluid simulation software is used to calculate the effects of different fluid compositions on the produced gas dew point. Understanding this behavior enables one to pick suitable temperature and pressure-operating points that promote high H2S removal by avoiding hydrocarbon liquid precipitation. Phase envelopes, from which the dew point is obtained, change depending on gas composition. Relative amounts of light and heavy hydrocarbons were found to have the most significant effects. The gas compositions used in this study correspond to that measured at Santa Maria Energy's (SME) cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) project located in the Orcutt oil field in northern Santa Barbara County, California. Corresponding phase equilibrium envelopes were calculated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. This paper provides a range of practical operating pressures and temperatures for improving the performance of SME's iron sponge H2S removal system. This discussion follows an overview of the iron sponge sweetening process and the phase envelope calculation results for the project's produced gas.

Although CO2 capture accounts for 70% of the total cost of CCS, large-scale CCS projects have significant transportation costs. Therefore, there is a growing need to explore alternatives to reduce transportation costs. The goal of this project was to propose an optimized pipeline network capable of transporting 33 million tons of CO2 per year from 6 emission sources to adequately sized and characterized reservoirs (sinks) for sequestration within Alberta. The proposed 1200km-long pipeline network gathers CO2 from sources in Fort McMurray and transports it to the Nisku formation in central Alberta for storage. The sources connected in the pipeline network include the Canadian Natural Resources Horizon Oil Sands, Muskeg River Cogeneration Station, Shell Albian Oil Sands, Syncrude Mildred Lake Plant, Suncor Oil Sands, Suncor Firebag Oil Sands and Nexen Long Lake Oil Sands. Measures have been proposed to ensure that the pipeline is inherently safe. For example, the pipeline has been routed such that no highly-populated areas are traversed. The closest high-populated area is situated 1.5 km away from the pipeline network. CO2 dispersion modeling simulations indicate that this distance ensures no harmful impact on the occupants of these areas. © IEOM Society International.","Carbon dioxidey; Emission; Optimization; Pipeline netweork",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018984795

However, due to the inflexibility in nuclear and wind productions, and the increased efficiency of appliances and equipment, Ontario is left with an excess base load of electricity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of an electrolytic-hydrogen production plant that utilizes this excess electricity with the goal of minimizing total cost and emissions. Load-shifting using compressed storage is considered, and total cost compared with conventional methods, namely steam methane reforming.

Five selection criteria, namely, methanol yield, reduction in CO2 emissions, usable energy, capital cost and payback period are used to compare four design alternatives for a peat gasification process. Two types of gasifiers (i.e., updraft fixed-bed and dual fluidized-bed) and two types of methanol synthesis reactors (i.e., gas-phase and liquid-phase) are paired to create four design alternatives that are modeled in Aspen Plus. The chosen design is then refined with detailed modeling of the power generation section and energy integration. The final design consumes 1,000 tonne peat/day, produces 214 tonne methanol/day, and generates 56 MW of electricity. Furthermore, GHG emissions are reduced by 22.4%. © IEOM Society International.","Aspen Plus simulation; Methanol synthesis; Peat gasification; Techno-economic",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018938966

Determining how different jurisdictions fare in the quest to reduce GHG emissions associated with the oil and gas industry is essential because: policy makers have realised the advantages of market-based regulation over the command-and-control regulation; and in the light of various pledges different countries have made in different forum to reduce the emission of GHGs, particularly in the wake of the recently held Paris climate change conference. Design/methodology/approach-Library-based approach is used, providing conceptual and theoretical understanding of climate change, GHG emissions and various market-based regulatory tools utilised in the United Kingdom and Nigeria in regulating emission associated with operations in the oil and gas industry. Findings-The study reveals the significance of environmental regulations that encourage region integration and flexibility in the implementation of environmental policies. Moreover, it finds that the Paris Agreement re-affirms the utilisation of market-based regulations and indicates a future for investment in the oil and gas industry. Practical implications-The study revealed that there are lacunas in regulations and strategies for the implementation of environmental regulations which need to be addressed in order to achieve zero or a significant decrease in gas flaring. Originality/value-This study provided an ample opportunity to theoretically examine market-based regulatory tools utilised in the oil and gas industry in a developed country in relation to a developing country. © 2017 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Climate change; Gas flaring; Greenhouse gases; Market-based regulation; Paris agreement",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006341788

The main reasons for this trend are the potentials for CO 2 reduction, the requirement for higher electrical performance from the vehicle power net point of view, the stricter future emissions legislation and last but not least improving the driving performance. In order to achieve this demands an additional range of functions is necessary. This enhancement should ideally be integrated into already in powertrain existing control units. The technique of embedding additional functionality into third party control units defined as “software sharing” has become state-of-the-art in AVL. In an easy fashion the standard functionality can be replaced by proprietary control functions. Over the course of numerous e-mobility activities, AVL created a strictly modular, component-based function library for every powertrain control unit. This includes conventional units (e.g. engine management system, transmission control unit) and specific electrified systems (belt starter generators, etc.). The software components are fully anchored in a total software architecture derived from the corresponding project-specific requirements. Both the steady state data interfaces and the dynamic architecture (scheduling) are precisely defined. So, the efficient integration of the software system in the target control unit can be achieved. The integration of additional software components for electrified powertrain systems into existing third party control units will be shown as example on a 48V system architecture. AVL utilizes a generic developed function library that permits the targeted fulfilment of even specific customer demands. © 2016, FISITA.

Roads constitute a fundamental part of this system for both passenger and freight transports. Freight transport is expected to increase throughout Europe by 80% until 2050 (EU, 2011). ITF (2015) stated that international freight transport to ports will increase fourfold until 2050. This will, ceteris paribus, result in a severe increase of congestion and incidents. In turn, incidents will worsen congestion even more. This paper, which draws on current work in CEDR and PIARC, describes the role of the road in the freight transport system. The background to this paper comes from reports that state the road network alone cannot cope with the expected increase in transport flows. Important road freight areas and issues about how to reach a more sustainable freight system are identified and discussed in this paper. These discussions include multimodal terminals and operations, autonomous vehicles, ITS, infrastructure usage, economies of scale, and behaviour/educational issues. The function of the road, from a freight perspective, is manifold. It is used for small shipments over short distances as well as their counterparts. Road freight is most often necessary in the beginning and in the end of the multimodal transport chain (first/last mile logistics). Furthermore, road freight is the only mode involved in many door-to-door freight chains, as it is usually the only mode involved. Such a chain might constitute one or several truck movements. Peak car is widely discussed but peak truck/peak freight might be something that needs to be considered for many reasons. The European climate and transport policies push for a modal shift from road to other modes of transportation. To meet this challenge the market-based transport system must develop into a truly multi-modal system. A smarter utilisation of the transport system is important from the perspective of economic, environmental, and social sustainability. However, more importantly there is a need to make road freight more sustainable in itself. Therefore one important role for the road is to try to stimulate and promote the possibilities for modal shift while another is to optimize its characteristics. © 2016 The Authors.","co-modal; freight transports; logistics; multimodal; Piarc",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991409708

To maintain or improve upon existing safety performance, it is imperative that these press-hardened components maintain adequate toughness and resistance to fracture during impact events wherein a range of deformation states are present. It is shown that steel chemistry and austenitization practice significantly influence the impact performance of the resultant martensite in press-hardened steel as measured by laboratory-scale methods and component-level validation.

The most notable decrease in performance occurs when grain sizes exceed approximately 30 μm, although such grain sizes and reduced performance are not observed when steels are processed within the generally recommended processing window.

It is the largest neutrino telescope in the Northern hemisphere. After the discovery of a cosmic neutrino diffuse flux by the IceCube detector, the search for its origin has become a key mission in high-energy astrophysics to which ANTARES can bring a valuable contribution. The ANTARES sensitivity is large enough to constrain the origin of the IceCube excess from regions extended up to 0.2 sr in the Southern sky. Assuming different spectral indexes for the energy spectrum of neutrino emitters, the Southern sky and in particular central regions of our Galaxy are studied searching for point-like objects and for extended regions of emission. The search program also includes multi-messenger analyses requiring time and/or space coincidences with other cosmic probes, for instance gamma rays as detected by Fermi. Recently, ANTARES has participated, with IceCube, to a high-energy neutrino follow-up of the gravitational wave signal GW150914, providing the first constraint on high energy neutrino emission from a binary black hole coalescence.

A total of 644 strains (21.8%) acquired polymorphisms relative to the input parental strain. The fabT gene, encoding a transcriptional regulator of fatty acid biosynthesis genes, contained 54.5% of these changes. The great majority of polymorphisms were predicted to deleteriously alter FabT function. Transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of a wild-type strain and an isogenic fabT deletion mutant strain found that between 3.7 and 28.5% of the S. pyogenes transcripts were differentially expressed, depending on the growth temperature (35°C or 40°C) and growth phase (mid-exponential or stationary phase). Genes implicated in fatty acid synthesis and lipid metabolism were significantly upregulated in the fabT deletion mutant strain. FabT also directly or indirectly regulated central carbon metabolism genes, including pyruvate hub enzymes and fermentation pathways and virulence genes. Deletion of fabT decreased virulence in a nonhuman primate model of necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, the fabT deletion strain had significantly decreased survival in human whole blood and during phagocytic interaction with polymorphonuclear leukocytes ex vivo. We conclude that FabT mutant progeny arise during infection, constitute a metabolically distinct subpopulation, and are less virulent in the experimental models used here. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Area of study: The study was conducted on experimental sites established in two locations within the Turkish red pine natural distribution areas, namely Duacı and Nebiler close to Antalya city. Material and methods: Data were collected from the experimental sites established as a Nelder design (fan-shaped), with 72 rays and 18 arcs (circles), and trees were planted (almost square) at distances ranging from 1.15 to 4.77 m. Soil type of both sites is loamy, with soil clay content varying between 70-87% in Duacı and 51-70% in Nebiler. Soils are deep being more than one m in both sites, but rockier in Nebiler, providing better soil drainage in this site. Main results: The results showed that mean total height was greater at closer spacing than those of wider spacing until age eight. Growth retardation at wider spacing in early years may be related to water loss due to evaporation in hot summer days and weed suppression. Following the age eight, competition among trees appears to be the major factor reducing the growth and carbon fixation. Diameter at breast height and individual tree volume increased, while stand volume, mean annual volume increment and annualcarbon storage per hectare considerably decreased for wider spacing. Our results suggest that in order to obtain higher yieldand more carbon fixation, short rotation plantations should initially be established in closer spacing, followed by thinning in subsequent years as required by silvicultural concerns. In this context, spacing 3.0 × 1.0 m or 3.0 × 1.5 m (3.0 and 4.5 m2 growing area per tree, respectively) seems to be more plausible, providing farm machinery for maintenance and harvesting. We also found that mean annual volume increment per unit area can be considerably increased by using improved seed and deep soil cultivation in plantations. Research highlights: Results encourage managers for short rotation management in industrial plantations using closer spacing in terms of carbon sequestration as well as wood production. © 2016 INIA.","Carbon sequestration; Forest growth and yield; Nelder experimental design; Pinus brutia Ten; Spacing",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978811200

Disaster risk management plans must be developed and updated to keep up with the effects of climate change. Currently, such plans in the Philippines often lack updated data on the location of infrastructure and residential areas. Thus, building footprint extraction is an important task. One of the tasks of our project, UPLB Phil-LiDAR 1, is to extract building footprints in the Laguna and MIMAROPA areas of the Philippines. Manual digitization of building footprints using GIS is tedious. With limited personnel and an extensive area to cover, devising an automated workflow is important. Through the use of remote sensing techniques, building footprint extraction can be automated. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is one of the most powerful remote sensing technologies nowadays. We have developed an automated workflow for building footprint extraction and regularization from LiDAR datasets. One of the problems encountered with the created workflow is its running time. A 1km × 1km LiDAR tile of an urban area would take hours to finish. In order to address this problem, we developed BERTUD, a distributed system to enable full utilization of the available computing resources of our project. Distributed systems are systems that make networked computers finish a big task. The system was able to fully utilize the computing resources of our project by providing two layers of maximization: macro-level and micro-level. On the macro-level, BERTUD divides large areas for building extraction to multiple computers effectively speeding up the process. On the micro-level, the slave program maximizes the available resources of its host computer by utilizing multiple CPU cores, without interrupting its current user.","Disaster risk management; Distributed computing; Multi-core processing","Automation; Buildings; Climate change; Disasters; Extraction; Multicore programming; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Risk management; Volcanoes; Building extraction; Distributed systems; Light detection and ranging; Multi-core processing; Networked computers; Remote sensing techniques; Remote sensing technology; Risk management plans; Distributed computer systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018940258

As a result, there are large uncertainties in the total emission flux of mineral dust, its natural variability at various timescales, and the possible contribution from anthropogenic land use changes. This work aims for estimating dust emissions and reduces their uncertainty over the Sahara desert and the Arabian Peninsula-the largest dust source region of the globe. We use a data assimilation approach to constrain dust emission fluxes at a monthly resolution for 18 subregions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite-derived aerosol optical depth is assimilated in a regional configuration of a general circulation model coupled to an aerosol model. We describe this data assimilation system and apply it for 1 year, resulting in a total mineral dust emissions flux estimate of 2900 Tg yr-1 over the Sahara desert and the Arabian Peninsula for the year 2006.

This inhomogeneity may lead to localized corrosion. During carbon steel corrosion experiments conducted in electrolytes containing high Ca2+concentrations, inhomogeneous corrosion product layers with the composition FexCayC03 (x+y= 1) were indeed observed, along with non-uniform corrosion. Determining relative molar fractions of Ca2+ and Fe2+ in FexCayC03 is paramount to predicting the relative properties and stability of such mixed metal carbonates. Using Bragg's Law and equations to relate inter-planar spacings to unit cell parameters, X- ray diffraction (XRD) data yielded values for the molar fraction of Ca2+ in FexCayC03. Procedures in the current experimental study were designed to develop a range of specific corrosion product layers on mild steel samples. Experiments were conducted at constant CI"" concentration with and without 10,000 ppm Ca2+ in stagnant conditions, for two different flow conditions. In stagnant conditions, localized corrosion was associated with the presence of Ca2+ and the inhomogeneity of the corrosion product layer.

Although European energy intensive industries have already achieved significant energy and greenhouse gas reductions in the past, much remains to be done to make a significant contribution to achieving European as well as national climate mitigation targets of greenhouse gas emission reductions by -80 % or more (compared to the baseline of 1990). North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) is a European hotspot for coping with this challenge, accommodating more than 10 % of the energy intensive industries of the EU28. It is also the first German state to have adopted its own Climate Law, enacting state-wide CO2 emission reductions by 80 % until 2050 compared to 1990. The state government initiated the project ""Platform Climate Protection and Industry North-Rhine Westphalia"" to identify and develop the necessary far-reaching low carbon innovation strategies for energy intensive industries. Heart of the project was a dialogue process, which involved a broad spectrum of stakeholders from steel, chemical, aluminium, cement, glass and paper producing industries. Besides enhancing and broadening the knowledge on high efficiency and low-carbon technologies within industries, the aim was to explore possible pathways and preconditions for the application of these technologies in energy intensive industries as well as to strengthen the motivation of companies for initiatives and investments in technologies with lower CO2 emissions. The results of the dialogue shall provide a basis for a possible low-carbon industry roadmap NRW and may also serve as an example for other industrialized regions in the EU and globally. The paper sketches the structured dialogue process with the stakeholders from companies as well as industrial associations and presents the learnings regarding the engagement of energy intensive industries into ambitious climate policies on a regional level. These include existing limitations as well as chances in the respective sectors on the state level, regarding their economic and technical structures as well as their innovation systems. The findings are based on more than a dozen stakeholder workshops with industry companies and more than 150 individual representatives of NRW's energy intensive industries as well as on background research in the initial phase of the project. © 2018 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Through the use of multiple climate scenarios from 12 regional climate model simulations, the ensemble mean, and three synthetic simulations generated by a weighting procedure, we investigated intermodel seasonal climate change signals between current and future periods, for both median and extreme precipitation/temperature values. A significant dependence of seasonal climate change signals on the model biases over southern Québec in Canada was detected for temperatures, but not for precipitation. This suggests that the regional temperature change signal is affected by local processes. Seasonally, model bias affects future mean and extreme values in winter and summer. In addition, potentially large increases in future extremes of temperature and precipitation values were projected. For three synthetic scenarios, systematically less bias and a narrow range of mean change for all variables were projected compared to those of climate model simulations. In addition, synthetic scenarios were found to better capture the spatial variability of extreme cold temperatures than the ensemble mean scenario. These results indicate that the synthetic scenarios have greater potential to reduce the uncertainty of future climate projections and capture the spatial variability of extreme climate events. © 2016 Hyung-Il Eum et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956911256

Deforestation - the clearing and modification of native forest for agricultural, urban and industrial development - remains a significant threat to Australia's biodiversity. Substantial policy reform over the last 40 years has delivered a range of policy instruments aimed to control deforestation across all Australian States and Territories. Despite these policy efforts - as well as strong governance and high institutional capacity - deforestation rates in Australia were nonetheless globally significant at the turn of this century. Legislation introduced in Queensland and New South Wales during the mid-2000s was at the time seen to have effectively ended broad-scale clearing; however, recent policy changes have raised concerns that Australia may again become a global hotspot for deforestation. Here, I describe the deforestation trends, drivers and policy responses in Australia over the last four decades. Using satellite imagery of forest cover and deforestation events across Australia between 1972 and 2014, I present a comprehensive analysis of deforestation rates at a fine resolution. I discuss trends in deforestation with reference to the institutional, macroeconomic and environmental conditions that are associated with human-induced forest loss in Australia. I provide a detailed history and critique of the native vegetation policies introduced across Australia over the last 40 years, including recent legislative amendments and reviews. Finally, I comment on future prospects for curbing deforestation in Australia, including the role of incentive-based policies such as carbon farming, private land conservation and biodiversity offsets. Despite being a highly active policy space, very little is known of the effectiveness of policy responses to deforestation in Australia, and whether the recent shift away from 'command and control' policies will necessarily lead to better outcomes. My analysis demonstrates the need for an effective policy mix to curb deforestation in Australia, including a greater focus on monitoring, evaluation and policy learning. © CSIRO 2016.","biodiversity; biodiversity offsets; carbon farming; conservation; environmental policy; environmental regulation; native vegetation; remote sensing","biodiversity; deforestation; environmental conditions; environmental policy; forest cover; habitat loss; industrial development; macroeconomics; policy approach; policy reform; remote sensing; satellite imagery; terrestrial environment; territory; urban development; vegetation cover; Australia; New South Wales; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974644231

It is common for most DSI and ACI systems to use injection lances, which insert into the flue gas duct at varying lengths to assist with sorbent dispersion. Such injection lances often turn out to be maintenance-intensive due to sorbent buildup within the sorbent convey lines and lance plugging. More importantly, injection lances promote poor mixing and dispersion of the sorbent in the flue gas, leading to high sorbent usage for the targeted reduction goal. This paper will present the basis of a proprietary lance-less sorbent injection technology. Unlike conventional injection lances, lance-less injection technology is mounted flush to the duct wall, using high velocity/low pressure ambient air to deliver maximum sorbent mixing and dispersion. The lance-less injection technology can provide up to 40% reduction in sorbent usage, providing significant reduction in sorbent costs for the client. Additionally, each injector is less susceptible to build-up and plugging, resulting in a system that is easy to maintain, provides increased system availability and reduced maintenance costs. The paper will importantly present the performance achieved on one of the initial projects at Trimble County Generating Station on their dry sorbent injection system, injecting hydrated lime for ammonium bisulfate (ABS) mitigation.",,"Activated carbon; Air; Availability; Carbon; Cost reduction; Costs; Ducts; Electric substations; Flue gases; Flues; Gas emissions; Hydrated lime; Mixing; Pollution; Power control; Sorption; Waste incineration; Waste management; Activated carbon injection; Conventional injections; Dry sorbent injection; Generating stations; Injection technology; Mixing and dispersions; Reduced maintenance costs; System availability; Sorbents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020702368

When emission prices are perceived as short-lived, socially cost-effective upfront investment in climate technologies may be hampered. This paper compares the social abatement cost of a uniform GHG pricing system with two policy options for overcoming such regulatory uncertainty: One combines the emissions pricing with a state guarantee scheme whereby the regulatory risk is borne by the government and one combines the system with subsidies for upfront climate technology investments. A technology-rich computable general equilibrium model is applied that accounts for abatement both within and beyond existing technologies. Our findings suggest a tripling of abatement costs if domestic climate policies fail to stimulate investment in new technological solutions. Since the cost of funding investment subsidies is found to be small, the subsidy scheme performs almost as well as the guarantee scheme. © 2016 by the IAEE.

We experimentally restored available calcium (Ca) to soils of a forested watershed at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, and measured the response of fine root biomass 14 years after treatment. In this northern hardwood forest, fine root (<1 mm diameter) biomass declined significantly in response to the Ca-addition treatment relative to pretreatment and reference forest conditions. The decline was greatest in the mid- and high-elevation hardwood zones of the watershed, where soils are thinnest and have the lowest base saturation and exchangeable Ca pools. Restoration of soil Ca appears to have reduced the allocation of carbon (C) to root systems, coincident with observed increases in aboveground biomass and productivity. Therefore, we suggest that relatively higher tree C allocation to roots in the past contributed to the depressed aboveground productivity observed in northern hardwood forest ecosystems impacted by acid deposition. © 2016 NRC Research Press.","Acidification; Allocation; Leaf area index; Mycorrhizae; Production","Acidification; Air pollution; Biomass; Calcium; Carbon; Conservation; Deposition; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Production; Productivity; Restoration; Soils; Watersheds; Above ground biomass; Allocation; Eastern north america; Fine-root biomass; Forested watersheds; Leaf Area Index; Mycorrhizae; Northern hardwood forest; Forestry; aboveground biomass; acid deposition; calcium; experimental study; fine root; forest ecosystem; forest health; forest soil; leaf area index; mycorrhiza; root system; soil remediation; watershed; Hubbard Brook; New Hampshire; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964763165

Although tremendous progress has been made to improve the understanding of basic physical mechanisms of aerosol-cloud interactions and reduce their uncertainties in climate forcing, there is still poor understanding of 1) some of the mechanisms that interact with each other over multiple spatial and temporal scales, 2) the feedbacks between microphysical and dynamical processes and between local-scale processes and large-scale circulations, and 3) the significance of cloud-aerosol interactions on weather systems as well as regional and global climate. This review focuses on recent theoretical studies and important mechanisms on aerosol-cloud interactions and discusses the significances of aerosol impacts on radiative forcing and precipitation extremes associated with different cloud systems. The authors summarize the main obstacles preventing the science from making a leap-for example, the lack of concurrent profile measurements of cloud dynamics, microphysics, and aerosols over a wide region on the observation side and the large variability of cloud microphysics parameterizations resulting in a large spread of modeling results on the modeling side.

The mixed oxide catalysts mainly consisted of homogeneous and stable non-stoichiometric cobalt-based spinel phases Co(Co,Al)2O4 and Ni(Co,Al)2O4. The 500 °C calcined catalysts showed nanoflowerlike morphology, while the 800 °C calcined catalysts presented disorderly stacked states consisting of severely agglomerated irregular nanoparticles. The catalysts Co3AlO-500 and Co2NiAlO-500 presented excellent catalytic NO oxidation performance, with the maximum conversion efficiency ca. 88.8% and 87.6% (285 °C), respectively, which is much higher than those of Co3AlO-800 and Co2NiAlO-800 (55.6% and 66.6% at 350 °C). The excellent catalytic NO oxidation performance of Co3AlO-500 and Co2NiAlO-500 could be attributed to the much larger amount of surface active sites endowed by these catalysts with smaller crystallite sizes of cobalt-based spinel phases, higher specific surface areas, and mesoporous structure. The active sites and NO oxidation pathways of the present catalysts were tentatively proposed. Although Co2NiAlO-500 possessed a slightly smaller amount of active sites (Co3+ and Ni3+ associated with surface adsorbed oxygen), compared to Co3AlO-500 with active sites (Co3+ associated with surface adsorbed oxygen), catalyst Co2NiAlO-500 possessed higher reducibility, leading to their similar desorption amount of NO2, thus similar NO oxidation performance. Moreover, the lower cost of catalyst Co2NiAlO-500 gives it a greater potential for practical applications. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aluminum; Calcination; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Cobalt; Decomposition; Nickel; Nitric oxide; Oxidation; Precipitation (chemical); Calcined catalysts; Combinational technique; Coprecipitation method; Efficient oxidations; Mesoporous structures; Mixed oxide catalysts; Non-stoichiometric; Surface active sites; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997521673

Vaca Muerta play in the central Neuquen basin position has a remarkably thick continuous organic-rich section (approximately 350m). Chevron Argentina is evaluating the Vaca Muerta potential in the El Trapial exploitation lease. Data available includes 500 km2 of 3D seismic data, wire-line and mud log data from 4 exploratory vertical wells with full e-log suite and 415 meter of core, and from 5 legacy wells with basic e-logs. Vaca Muerta outcrops in an analog stratigraphic setting are located 40 km away from El Trapial. Initial results of the stratigraphic analysis were based on seismic interpretation, well log evaluations and core data analysis. Correlations and comparisons between the subsurface interpretation and the outcrops of Vaca Muerta allowed us to tie stratigraphic sequences in El Trapial to the regional framework. This study builds upon previous regional sequence stratigraphic interpretations and provides a refined stratigraphic framework for distal facies of the Vaca Muerta. Similar to other shales worldwide, Vaca Muerta deposition was initiated with a marine transgression over non-marine deposits of the Tordillo Formation. This transgression is expressed as a condensed section with high gamma-ray and TOC values in the basal section. Accommodation changes and paleo-depositional trends were interpreted based on strata cyclicity, thickness variations, and seismic stacking patterns. An internal Vaca Muerta stratigraphic subdivision was defined based on seismic data, logs, thin sections, facies and organic geochemistry analysis. Recognition of lateral and vertical heterogeneity within Vaca Muerta will lead to better planning and exploitation of hydrocarbons through enhanced reservoir models and improved target identification, which will ultimately reduce risks and costs. Stratigraphy plays a key role in the identification of the most productive stratigraphic interval (i.e., Sweet Spot), and most prospective region (i.e., Core Area), to develop an unconventional project.

The region had experienced the early signs of a prosperous period which looked as to have kick started some momentum with many projects being planned. The subsequent fall off in activity was largely attributed to the global financial crisis, amongst other factors. This paper looks briefly at Munich's geothermal journey and then provides an update on the activities in the region and the prospects for the future. The Bavarian city of Munich in the south east of Germany benefits from a strong local economy and the ideal geological conditions for direct use geothermal heat schemes. The carbonate Malm reservoir, which is found between 2000m and 3000m depth below the city, is known to have good natural porosity and the geothermal fluid to be low in salinity. This together with its naturally high yield makes the Malm the ideal source for direct use district heating. During the last 15 years Munich has experienced strong growth within the geothermal sector despite regional and global economic uncertainties. Project experience and collaborative research has assisted in developing robust frameworks and methodologies for executing low enthalpy projects within the Bavarian region. Through this work, the assessment of geological uncertainties in respect to the potential productivity of a geothermal well and approaches to drilling and well design have been optimized. The prospects for Munich look strong as the Stadwerke München (SWM), in English ""Munich City Utilities"" pushes geothermal utilization to another level, by setting the goal of making Munich the first European city with a district-heating network supplied 100% from geothermal energy by 2040. This is being made possible through a collaborative research projected called GRAME, which was founded with support from the Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi), in English ""Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy"".","Deep geothermal; Direct use; District heating; ERDWERK; GRAME; Lessons learnt; Low enthalpy; Molasse Basin; Munich; SWM; Uncertainty analysis","District heating; Economics; Enthalpy; Geology; Geothermal fields; Geothermal wells; Storm sewers; Uncertainty analysis; Deep geothermal; Direct use; ERDWERK; GRAME; Lessons learnt; Low enthalpies; Molasse basin; Munich; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018561735

Besides, being renewable, it is biodegradable and non-toxic fuel. This paper aimed to study the production of this green fuel using industrial, competitive techniques; base-catalysed transesterification and supercritical methanol transesterification. The research involved techniques for reaction parameters optimisation and thus embedded optimum values into a simulation-based design procedure for overall energy optimisation/integration and emissions reduction. Literature experimental reaction data for the two technologies conduct an optimisation for biodiesel production. The state-of-the-art process flowsheets for the two processes were used for the study. This optimisation was done for the most affecting parameters on the production processes. The experimental results from the literature for the two techniques were optimally analysed using parameters analyse carried out using Pareto chart, contour plot methodology, and surface plot methodology. The research study revealed that the key process variable for the base-catalysed process was the catalyst loading. On the other hand, for the supercritical methanol process, the most prominent variable was the methanol to oil ratio. The optimal process conditions were used to build an ASPEN HYSYS rigorous simulation model for the previous techniques. The supercritical based-process was chosen for further studies for its better economic performance. Pinch Analysis principles through ASPEN Energy Analyser software were employed to analyse the energy performance of the overall optimum model obtained from ASPEN HYSYS. The energy targets were calculated for biodiesel production using supercritical methanol approach. Composite curves resulted in 3.4 and 3.7 MW for heating and cooling requirements, respectively compared with 4.4 and 4.7 MW for the original process. Finally, a heat exchanger network was developed to accomplish the energy targets proposed by the composite curves. The resulting integrated process flowsheet has better energy saving opportunities. The energy consumption of the optimum case has been reduced by 25 %, and thus substantial cut in the CO2 emissions. Utility curves were also generated to determine the loads of hot utilities to be produced by the proposed energy integration.

This paper discusses new sources of sustainable carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels for Europe, and a respective business case for the Maghreb core region (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Western Sahara), in 2030 and 2040. Hybrid PV-Wind power plants can be used to harvest the excellent solar and wind energy potentials of the Maghreb region. This can power power-to-gas (PtG) and power-to-liquids (PtL) facilities to generate synthetic natural gas (SNG) or synthetic liquid fuels (SLF), mainly diesel, respectively. RE-SNG can be injected into the European gas grid through natural gas pipelines connecting the Maghreb region to Southern Europe or liquefied into LNG and shipped to Northern Europe for the least transportation cost. RE-diesel and RE-jet fuel can be also shipped to European ports. Calculations for hybrid PV-Wind power plants, batteries, CO2 capture plants, water desalination, PtG and PtL plants are done based on an hourly resolution to find the least cost combination of different technologies in a 0.45° × 0.45° spatial resolution. The results show that, for 7% WACC, the RE-SNG and RE-diesel can be produced in 2030 for a minimum cost of 73 €/MWh (28.5 USD/MBtu) and 81 €/MWh (0.78 €/l), respectively. While in 2040, the minimum production costs for RE-SNG and RE-diesel can drop to 65 €/MWh (25.4 USD/MBtu) and 73 €/MWh (0.71 €/l), respectively. The production cost can be decreased by about 21%, depending on access to a WACC of 5% in a de-risking project and oxygen sales. In an optimized combination of PV and wind installed capacities with maximum land usage of 10% for each, the generation potential of synthetic fuels would be about 18,500 TWh and 23,000 TWh in 2030 and 2040, respectively. In the best scenario, RE-diesel can reach the fuel-parity for crude oil prices of 95 and 82 USD/bbl in 2013 and 2040, respectively. Thus, RE-synthetic fuels could be produced to answer fuel demand and to remove environmental concerns in Europe for an affordable cost. This could be an opportunity for the Maghreb countries to export carbon neutral hydrocarbons to Europe, where environmental limitations on conventional hydrocarbons are getting increasingly tighter. © SGEM2016.

However, it is less clear how climate variability influences changes in land uses, and their implications for human well-being. We examined how forests and trees can reduce human vulnerability by affecting the three components of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. A total of 24 focus group discussions and 256 household surveys were conducted in two smallholderdominated rural landscapes in Indonesia, which were affected by floods, drought and disease outbreaks. Our results suggest that forests and trees are important in supporting community resilience and decreasing their vulnerabilities to climaterelated stresses in different ways. The role of trees varied according to the type of ecosystem service, whether provisioning or regulating, in relation to the phase of the climatic hazard, either in the pre-disaster phase or in the post-disaster recovery phase. It is therefore important to distinguish between these elements when analyzing people’s responses to climatic variability in order to fully capture the contribution of forests and trees to reducing people’s vulnerability. Landscape spatial characteristics, environmental degradation and community awareness of climate variability are crucial because if their linkages are recognized, local people can actively manage natural resources to increase their resilience. Interventions related to forests and trees should take into consideration these aspects to make ecosystem services a valuable option for an integrated strategy to reduce disaster risks and climate-related vulnerabilities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Climate change adaptation; Climate variability; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Natural resource management; Social vulnerability; Social-ecological systems",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014054059

Both vehicle types can facilitate the integration of intermittent renewables. H2 generation and storage infrastructure to support FCEVs is a promising opportunity for synergy between the transportation and building sectors in renewables integration, through grid storage and Power2Gas (i.e. blending H2 into the natural gas supply). However, as FCEVs also require more than twice as much electric energy per distance traveled than BEVs, an integrated analysis is necessary to evaluate which electric vehicle (EV) offers the lowest cost for reducing CO2 emissions. We use an integrated analysis to determine the overall cost and CO2 emissions when BEVs or FCEVs are deployed in two communities in southern Germany. Based on a comprehensive scenario for future cost and technology developments for 2025 and 2035, the cost-optimal mix of energy generation and storage technologies is determined to meet all energy demands (heating, electricity and transportation) in the communities. This integrated analysis finds, that the higher energy consumption of FCEVs could not be compensated by system benefits like Power2Gas and grid storage. The result is consistent with a similar analysis of a community in California. The simulation results reveal, that while the two vehicle types enable similar CO2 emission reductions, these can be realized at lower costs with BEVs than with FCEVs. The most striking observation was, that in the event seasonal H2 grid storage becomes necessary, FCEVs would in fact be less favorable than BEVs, which require less energy per km traveled and therefore leave more energy available for stationary applications. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","battery vehicles; energy transition; fuel cell vehicles; hydrogen infrastructure; Power-to-Gas","Blending; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Costs; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Fuel cells; Gas supply; Natural gas transportation; Secondary batteries; Vehicles; Battery vehicles; Energy transitions; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Fuel cell vehicles; Hydrogen infrastructure; Intermittent renewables; Renewables integrations; Stationary applications; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014994487

Reduction of costs and CO2 emissions can be reached with a high penetration of renewable sources. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and design the integration of a central solar heating plant with seasonal storage into the district heating system of the city. An economic assessment was made with a pessimistic and an optimistic prediction of the solar heat cost for ground mounted collectors and roof mounted collectors.

Two martensitic carbon steels were selected for the investigations: A high strength low alloy (HSLA) carbon steel commonly used for drill pipe (G41000) and a newly designed ultra-high strength low alloy (UHSLA) steel (G41300). Electrochemical and mass loss measurements found corrosion rates on the order of 0.05 mm y1 in the systems containing H2s and CO2+H2s, while the CO2 systems saw corrosion rates between 0.5 and 2 mm y1. Surface analyses of the tested samples were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to identify corrosion products. The corrosion products were unstable and oxidized quickly after taking out of the system. All samples had a high oxygen content across the surface, though the samples exposed to H2s and CO2+H2s had relatively higher levels of sulfur present in an inner region of the film. Experimental corrosion rates were compared to model predictions, and a good agreement was found for the CO2 and H2s cases. However, the model predicted that corrosion rates in the mixed case would match those of the CO2-only system. The experimental results showed that CO2:H2s ratios as high as 1000 can result in predominantly sour corrosion at the low temperature, high pressure conditions tested. © 2016 by NACE International.","CO2 corrosion; Cold-climate conditions; Corrosion rate; Corrosion scales; H2s corrosion; Martensitic carbon steels","Alloy steel; Carbon dioxide; Carbon steel; Corrosion rate; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; High strength alloys; High strength steel; Martensitic steel; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature; Water; X ray spectroscopy; Cold climate; Corrosion scale; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; High strength low alloys; High-pressure condition; Mass-loss measurement; Subsurface environment; Ultra high strengths; Corrosion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991508133

The effects of this phase pattern on ground and weather targets were evaluated and were found to be much more pronounced for point targets than for distributed targets.

The drying of either light or heavy water results in a significant reduction of radioactive dose, emissions and associated hazards during maintenance. However, specialized equipment (vacuum pumps, heat exchangers, heaters, etc.) are required in order to successfully implement vacuum drying in the primary heat transport or moderator systems in a CANDU plant.

Yet, in order to meet the 20% EU renewable energy target by 2020, the demand for biomasses is increasing sharply, thus increasing the risk of conflicts on land use due to competition for food and feed. Therefore, segregating the growth of dedicated biomass crops on marginal land is an option to overcome these conflicts. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine if producing perennial grasses on marginal soils as feedstock for bioenergy, could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions without depleting soil nutrients, water supplies, or negatively impacting biological and landscape diversity. This study, funded by European Union (EU), was conducted under project OPTIMA (Optimization of Perennial Grasses for Biomass Production) using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) protocols to identify opportunities and constraints of cultivating perennial grasses, in marginal soils. Results indicate that sustainability of perennial grasses production in marginal soils depends on the productivity. The productivity loss diminishes the energy, and the greenhouse savings but the presence of vegetation may contribute to improve the quality of soil and waters and the biological and landscape diversity. However, a higher land area is demanded to produce the same amount of biomass feedstock and the quality of the biomass may limit its use. © 2016 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Bioenergy; Environmental impact; Marginal land; Mediterranean region; Perennial energy crops; Sustainability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019694916

Perennial grasses and systems derived are being considered as viable substitutes to non-renewable chains. As bioenergy carriers or as bio-based products they offer ecological advantages by contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases. Nonetheless, the intensive cultivation of theses grasses may lead to soil nutrient and water depletion, and impacts on the biological and landscape diversity. In this context, a study was conducted within the project OPTIMA (“Optimization of Perennial Grasses for Biomass Production”), funded by European Union (EU), which aimed to assess the local environmental impacts of the cultivation, processing and use of several perennial grasses, in the Mediterranean region, based on elements borrowed from Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Different end uses were investigated and, as ambitioned by the project, use of marginal land was considered for the biomass chains, being compared with use of standard soils. Results from EIA suggest that the biogenic system cultivated in marginal soils present higher environmental sideeffects than in standard soils, mostly due to the higher land area needed to produce the same amount of energy or biomass feedstock. Yet, this difference is not significant and in the cultivation phase, some aspects are beneficial, such as impacts on biodiversity and landscape. Compared to idle land, it was concluded that the cultivation of perennial grasses on marginal land in the Mediterranean provides comparatively minimal environmental side-effects. The reduced soil tillage and the high biomass production support the increased biological and landscape diversity, the lower erodibility potential and improvement of soil properties, namely structure and soil organic matter, and the hydrological impacts and effects on the NPK status are negligible. Miscanthus performs well at the local level because of its low nutrient demand and high yield. However, other crops perform better regarding specific impacts, e.g., cardoon’s flowering effect on biodiversity and landscape. Regarding the best performing use option, small CHP and domestic heat use options are considerably more beneficial than conversion to ethanol or 1,3-propanediol. However, process optimizations are expected and therefore use options need to be continuously reviewed. © 2016 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Bioenergy; Environmental impact; Marginal land; Mediterranean region; Perennial energy crops; Sustainability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019669802

Based on these approaches, the assessment of the energy demand fluctuations of the building stock is preliminary for energy planning at district scale, since systems' operation requires a complex balancing for maximizing the efficiency or minimizing the cost, combining the intermittent nature of RES (except biomasses) with non-RES and/or storage technology. Surveyed literature concerning recent studies aimed at optimizing district energy scenarios revealed that most of the assessment are limited to the seasonal and/or annual based buildings energy needs, while the ones that deal with a proper time scale (i.e. hourly based) refer to specific case studies, which are hardly replicable in other urban contexts.

Therefore, a set of building models, representative of typical solutions of different historical periods, was defined for both residential and diffuse tertiary (offices) use. Once elaborated accurate hourly internal loads curves, it was possible to provide, performing detailed simulations with TRNSYS model, profiles of energy need density, referred to cubic meter of building volume, for typical buildings placed in different climatic locations, covering the wide range of Italian context. Based on both the building typologies and the climatic variability considered, assumptions adopted for the study could be extended to other comparable context in southern Europe. © 2016 The Authors.","buildings hourly energy loads; thermal energy needs density profiles; typical building energy models; urban energy planning","Complex networks; Cooling systems; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Network architecture; Renewable energy resources; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Urban planning; Zoning; Building energy model; Climatic variability; Density profile; Distributed energies; District energy systems; District heating and cooling; Integration of renewable energies; Urban energy planning; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997830886

Striving towards energy self-sufficiency, implementing regional resource cycles, retrofitting of the built environment, turning energy consumption towards renewables as well as generally decoupling urban development from energy consumption are crucial for a city’s future vulnerability and resilience against changes in general resource availability. The challenge gets further complex, as resource and energy efficiency in a city is deeply interwoven with other aspects of urban development such as social structures and the geographical context. As cities are the main consumer of energy and resources, they are both problem and solution to tackle issues of energy efficiency and saving. Cities have been committed to this agenda, especially to meet the national and international energy targets. Increasingly, cities act as entrepreneurs of new energy solutions acknowledging that efficient monitoring of energy and climate policies has become important to urban branding and competitiveness.

Political conservatives and progressives are divided on their beliefs about climate change, farmers come into conflict with scientists and environmentalists over water allocation or species protection, and communities oppose big business and mining companies that threaten their local environment. These intergroup tensions are reminders of the powerful influence social contexts and group memberships can have on attitudes, beliefs, and actions relating to climate change and the environment more broadly. In this paper, we use social identity theory to help describe and explain these processes. We review literature showing, how conceiving of oneself in terms of a particular social identity influences our environmental attitudes and behaviors, how relations between groups can impact on environmental outcomes, and how the content of social identities can direct group members to act in more or less pro-environmental ways. We discuss the similarities and differences between the social identity approach to these phenomena and related theories, such as cultural cognition theory, the theory of planned behavior, and value-belief-norm theory. Importantly, we also advance social-identity based strategies to foster more sustainable environmental attitudes and behaviors. Although this theoretical approach can provide important insights and potential solutions, more research is needed to build the empirical base, especially in relation to testing social identity solutions. © 2016 Fielding and Hornsey.","Climate change; Intergroup; Norms; Pro-environmental attitudes; Pro-environmental behavior; Social identity",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971516908

As long as humans are in the loop, over a half century of research in human factors suggests that this hope is unlikely to become a reality unless careful attention is paid to human behavior and, conversely, the potential for harm is real if little attention is given to said behavior. Different challenges lie with each of the two middle levels of automation which are the primary focus of this article. With Level 2 automation (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; NHTSA), the driver is removed from always having to control the position and speed of the vehicle, but is still required to monitor both position and speed. Humans are notoriously bad at vigilance tasks, and can quickly lose situation awareness. Moreover, even if vigilant, the driver needs to interact with the vehicle. But voice-activated systems which let the driver continue to glance at the forward roadway are proving to be a potential source of cognitive distraction. With Level 3 automation (NHTSA), the driver is out of the loop most of the time, but will still need to interact with the vehicle. Critical skills can be lost over time. Unexpected transfers of control need to be considered. The surface transportation and aviation human factors communities have proposed ways to solve the problems that will inevitably arise, either through careful experimentation or extensions of existing research.","Automation Levels 1-4; Distraction; Drivervehicle interfaces; Human factors; Intelligent vehicles; Situation awareness; Supervisory control and; Transfer of control; Vigilance","Automation; Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Highway traffic control; Human engineering; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Automation levels; Distraction; Driver-vehicle interfaces; Situation awareness; Supervisory control; Transfer of controls; Vigilance; Accidents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034848388

This paper formulates the determination of the most appropriate gear shift map for a Dual Clutch Transmission as a multi objective optimisation problem. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is complemented by a new repair mechanism to enforce acceptable driveability in the solutions produced as well as a new problem specific local search operator exploiting engineering knowledge to determine feasible gear shift maps that result in reduced emissions. The solutions are evaluated against standard as well as novel objective formulations that take into account CO2, driveability, gearbox durability and other practical implementation considerations. A correlation analysis, combined with Pareto analysis, is performed to identify and visualise related objectives that can be combined using a traditional weighted sum approach and those that should be handled separately using a Pareto front approach to facilitate the trade-offs identification and resolutions. The first set of objectives aim to reduce CO2, the second to maintain driveabil-ity, and the third to consider durability. The novel approach was used to identify trade-off solutions focusing on reducing CO2 emission. These solutions were validated on a prototype vehicle on a rolling road using the New European Driving Cycle, confirming the expected CO2 savings whilst conserving good driveability characteristics. © 2016",,"Durability; Economic and social effects; Engines; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Transmissions; Automatic transmission; Brake specific fuel consumption; Dual clutch transmission; Engineering knowledge; Local search operators; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; New european driving cycles; Weighted sum approaches; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991067405

Poor outdoor air quality can impact on human health and the environment and can also negatively impact on infrastructure as well as natural resources. The latter is due to the cycling of pollutants in the atmosphere, which can lead to wet or dry deposition thereof into water systems, onto soil or onto the surfaces of plants, for example. In this manner, outdoor air quality may impact on food production and livelihoods. A number of ambient air pollutants are thus governed by standards, such as the criteria pollutants of the US EPA, which include ozone, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, lead and particulates. In addition, there are numerous other outdoor air pollutants, including volatile and semivolatile organic compounds such as benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides. These are usually present at low levels in comparison to the criteria pollutants, but are hazardous and may therefore still incur human and environmental health risks.

The external use of this heat, if a civil or industrial demand exists, can be an opportunity, but requires large investments has long payback time and requires co-operation by external user(s). If the recovered heat has temperature above 250°C, a way to generate value from it is to convert it into electricity, usually self-consumed by the industrial plant. The diffusion of waste heat recovery for electricity generation differs by sector: in the glass and scrap based steel production (electric arc furnace) sectors there are about 10-20 plants installed worldwide1. The situation is quite different for the cement sector with over 800 waste heat recovery plants installed around the world, mostly in Asia and about five in European Member States. This paper analyses the configuration, specification, working data, economics and emission reductions of some ORC based waste heat recovery systems in Europe in each of the three above sectors. Some of these systems are also connected to a district heating network, an interesting synergy with local initiatives. The paper also draws possible further developments of the ORC based waste heat recovery for electricity generation systems increasing the recovered energy, the efficiency of transformation and lowering the investment cost making these systems more appealing for decision makers. © 2018 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

It is important to understand the potential effectiveness of these technologies in meeting the State goals. To this end, scenarios were examined using the HiGRID model, comparing the deployment of 5 GW of fuel cells to pumped hydro, compressed air, and flow battery storage. Cases were run for the California electricity grid at 33% and 50% renewable energy, and each scenario was evaluated based on carbon reduction potential and cost per ton carbon dioxide equivalent reduced. Fuel cell scenarios showed greater emissions reductions compared to energy storage for all cases and lower cost per ton CO2 reduced for all cases, except for pumped hydro at 50% renewables. As renewable levels increase, so does the reliance on new peaker capacity, slightly undermining emission reduction gains from fuel cell deployment. Dynamic, energy storage technologies, on the other hand, minimize new peaker capacity at high renewable levels, alluding to a greater opportunity for utilizing energy storage in the long term. While the most cost-effective energy storage technology is pumped hydro, the feasibility of large-scale deployment of pumped hydro is unclear due to the current California drought and the on-going threat of climate change. Of the technologies studied, high-efficiency baseload fuel cells show the greatest potential to support CO2 reduction goals in the near term, with the grid benefiting from more dynamic dispatch at higher renewable levels. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Compressed air; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gases; Carbon reduction potentials; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Energy storage technologies; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Large-scale deployment; Renewable energies; Renewable generation; Gas fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962762943

We derived daily ammonia emissions using NH3 total columns measured from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on board Metop-A, at a relatively high spatial resolution (grid cell of 0.5° × 0.5°). During the European spring haze episodes of 24–31 March 2012 and 8–15 March 2014, IASI reveals NH3 total column magnitudes highlighting higher NH3 emissions over central Europe (especially over Germany, Czech Republic, and eastern France) from the ones provided by the European reference European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme inventory. These ammonia emissions exhibit in addition a large day-to-day variability, certainly due to spreading practices. The increase of NH3 emissions in the model, that reaches +300% locally, leads to an increase of both NH3 and PM2.5 surface concentrations and allows for a better comparison with independent measurements (in terms of bias, root-mean-square error, and correlation). This study suggests that there are good prospects for better quantifying NH3 emissions by atmospheric inversions. ©2016. American Geophysical Union.

To date most studies have focused on the environmental factors controlling N2O production although N2O uptake has been observed in a variety of coastal ecosystems. In this study, we examined sediment fluxes of N2O during 2 years (2012-2013) in a shallow temperate estuary (Waquoit Bay, MA, USA). Overall sediments were a net N2O sink (-23 ± 5.2 nmol m-2 h-1, mean ± SE, significantly less than zero p &lt; 0.0001). N2O fluxes were significantly correlated to water column dissolved N2O (% saturation; p &lt; 0.0001), inorganic phosphorus (DIP; p = 0.0017), and nitrogen (DIN; p = 0.0019), as well as to temperature (p = 0.0192). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between sediment N2O uptake and both oxygen (O2) and DIP uptake (p = 0.0002 and p &lt; 0.0001, O2 and DIP sediment uptake, respectively). Results from this study indicate that sediments in shallow coastal ecosystems can be a strong sink of dissolved N2O, and therefore may mitigate N2O efflux to the atmosphere and export to the coastal ocean. Establishing the nature and strength of relationships between environmental conditions and sediment N2O fluxes moves us toward better-constrained models that will improve ecosystem management strategies, N2O budgets, and our ability to predict the response of coastal ecosystems to local and global change. © 2016 Foster and Fulweiler.","Coastal ecosystem; Estuary; Greenhouse gas; Nitrous oxide; Sediment biogeochemistry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008689683

In this regard, however, the current state of the art does not achieve full potential. Indeed, a conservative approach is generally adopted in order to guarantee a high degree of reliability and avoid operating failures as much as possible. This is mainly due to the limited knowledge about the actual customer profiles under real operating conditions. In this context, an online and real-time Condition Prediction system, so-called lifetime monitoring system, was developed at the Institute for Mechatronic Systems in Mechanical Engineering (IMS) of the TU Darmstadt, which is intended for implementation in standard control units of series production cars. The lifetime monitoring system is used as an input-module for the introduction of innovative procedures to cost-efficient lightweight design and more load appropriate dimensioning in transmission engineering. This is based on damage-oriented operating strategies (so-called eLIFE) and a paradigm change in the design philosophy based on a big data approach (so-called ecoLIFE3). This paper presents the lifetime monitoring system by the example of two concrete application cases, namely a manual and dual clutch transmission (DCT). Furthermore, the concepts of eLIFE and ecoLIFE3 will be introduced and the economic and ecologic potentials of the approach will be discussed and quantified on basis of a business case for a DCT. © VDI Verlag GmbH Düsseldorf 2016.",,"Clutches; Cost engineering; Online systems; Powertrains; Real time systems; Vehicle transmissions; Concrete applications; Conservative approaches; Degree of reliability; Dual clutch transmission(DCT); Real operating conditions; Reduction of emissions; Transmission design; Transmission engineering; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105985671

We studied DMSP concentrations inside corals and unveiled the linkage between DMSP availability and the abundance of DMSP-degrading bacterial groups inhabiting the corals' surface. Our findings suggest that DMSP mediates the interplay between corals and microbes, highlighting the importance of sulfur compounds for microbial processes in corals and for the resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Abstract Corals produce copious amounts of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a sulfur compound thought to play a role in structuring coral-associated bacterial communities. We tested the hypothesis that a linkage exists between DMSP availability in coral tissues and the community dynamics of bacteria in coral surface mucus. We determined DMSP concentrations in three coral species (Meandrina meandrites, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea) at two sampling depths (5 and 25m) and times of day (dawn and noon) at Curaçao, Southern Caribbean. DMSP concentration (4-409nmolcm-2 coral surface) varied with host species-specific traits such as Symbiodinium cell abundance, but not with depth or time of sampling. Exposure of corals to air caused a doubling of their DMSP concentration. The phylogenetic affiliation of mucus-associated bacteria was examined by clone libraries targeting three main subclades of the bacterial DMSP demethylase gene (dmdA). dmdA gene abundance was determined by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) against a reference housekeeping gene (recA). Overall, a higher availability of DMSP corresponded to a lower relative abundance of the dmdA gene, but this pattern was not uniform across all host species or bacterial dmdA subclades, suggesting the existence of distinct DMSP microbial niches or varying dmdA DMSP affinities. This is the first study quantifying dmdA gene abundance in corals and linking related changes in the community dynamics of DMSP-degrading bacteria to DMSP availability. Our study suggests that DMSP mediates the regulation of microbes by the coral host and highlights the significance of sulfur compounds for microbial processes in coral reefs. © CSIRO 2016.",,"community dynamics; concentration (composition); coral reef; dimethylsulfoniopropionate; ecosystem resilience; gene expression; hypothesis testing; microbial community; mucus; polymerase chain reaction; relative abundance; Anthozoa; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cura; Meandrina meandrites; Porites astreoides; Siderastrea siderea; Symbiodinium",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961575642

The accuracy of 3D geomechanical models relies highly upon proper tectonic strain and stress calibration using in situ straddle packer microfrac testing conducted in vertical pilot wellbores. Pipe-conveyed straddle packer microfrac tests have become an important technology to measure in-situ fracture closure stress in depleted and non-depleted reservoir layers in order to quantify the stress contrast among multiple intervals with different reservoir pressure regimes. This case study describes the use of microfrac tests to validate and calibrate the horizontal stress profile in various reservoir intervals of a carbonate formation that had been developed to a substantially depleted condition. Well-injection plans, cap-rock integrity assessment, stress contrast, hydraulic fracture containment, and minimum horizontal stress estimations can all be quantified from multiple microfrac tests recorded at various depths of the reservoir formation. The fracture closure analysis was conducted using three different methods: (i) square-root of time, (ii) G-function and (iii) Log-Log plot. The final fracture closure measurement was obtained after consolidating the three fracture closure identification methods in all injecting cycles conducted on each microfrac station. The integrated post job microfrac analysis includes borehole acoustic processing and resistivity imaging. The borehole acoustic response is used to estimate not only formation mechanical properties but also log-derived stress profiles while borehole Imaging is used to select the microfrac points and to confirm the induced borehole fracture created during the pressurization of the straddle packer tool. Formation breakdown, fracture reopening, propagation and closure at multiple reservoir layers provide the necessary in situ measurements to calibrate the stresses change due to pore pressure depletion. This information provides a better understanding of the in situ stress state in depleted formations that reduce risk in designing future gas development strategies in the field.

Behavior change programs are a highly cost effective method of reducing costs and carbon emissions; however most facilities and sustainability offices lack training in the social science of behavior change. This paper introduces readers to Community Based Social Marketing (CBSM), a systematic, empirically grounded approach to behavior change. A team of faculty, staff, and students used CBSM to develop the behavioral component of Oberlin College’s Climate Action Plan—targeted to eliminate 10–15 % of the College’s carbon emissions. After analyzing the College’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory we identified a short list of behaviors associated with significant carbon emissions to target for further study. Quantitative surveys, qualitative focus groups, and field observations were used to collect baseline data on these behaviors, as well as to identify the key barriers to changing them. Two behaviors were targeted for initial intervention: turning off lights in unused classrooms, and using cold water for washing laundry. We developed interventions using insights from our survey results as well as insights from behavior change research, and conducted two field studies to evaluate their effectiveness. This paper concludes with a discussion of lessons learned and suggestions for the implementation of CBSM research programs at other institutions.

This paper presents two different feasibility studies: the first proposes two plants based on wind and sea wave resource for the production, storage and distribution of hydrogen for public transportation facilities in the West Sicily; the second applies the same approach to Pantelleria (a smaller island), including also some indications about solar resource. In both cases, all buses will be equipped with fuel-cells. A first economic analysis is presented together with the assessment of the avoidable greenhouse gas emissions during the operation phase. The scenarios addressed permit to correlate the demand of urban transport to renewable resources present in the territories and to the modern technologies available for the production of hydrogen from renewable energies. The study focuses on the possibility of tapping the renewable energy potential (wind and sea wave) for the hydrogen production by electrolysis. The use of hydrogen would significantly reduce emissions of particulate matter and greenhouse gases in urban districts under analysis. The procedures applied in the present article, as well as the main equations used, are the result of previous applications made in different technical fields that show a good replicability. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.","Fuel; Hydrogen; Mobility; Pollution; Renewable energy; Sea wave","Carrier mobility; Economic analysis; Fuel cells; Fueling; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Pollution; Solar power generation; Urban transportation; Water waves; Wave energy conversion; Hydrogen production by electrolysis; Hydrogen technologies; Production of hydrogen; Public transportation; Renewable energies; Renewable energy potentials; Sea waves; Transportation sector; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016981877

First, the impact of the COP21 Agreement reached on 12 December 2015 in Paris stressed the need to focus on the reduction of carbon emissions had arrived definitively. This brought sharply into focus the International Energy Agency's proposed a ""Bridge Scenario"" which, it is claimed, could deliver a peak in energy-related emissions by 2020, relying solely on proven technologies and without changing economic development prospects of any region by virtue of five key initiatives: increased energy efficiency; the progressive reduction and phasing out of inefficient coal-fired power plants; phasing out fossil fuel subsidies by 2030; reducing methane emissions in oil and gas production; and increasing investment in renewable energy technologies from US$270 million in 2014 to US$400 billion in 2030. Second the declaration, following the confirmation of the International Atomic Energy Authority, on 15 January 2016 that Iran had satisfied the conditions for the implementation of the Joint Co-operation Plan of Action signaled the return of one of the world's few three million plus barrels per day suppliers of petroleum to the international market. The Iranian supply side impact paralleled with recurring concerns about the health of the Chinese economy and the impact on the demand side as the industry grappled to understand the longer term impact of the 30% downward lurch in the value of listed Chinese shares in July 2015. Thirdly, no doubt influenced by the above developments, the price of oil slumped to US$27 a barrel dispelling hopes of an early recovery in 2016 and raising existential fears for those in the industry focused on higher cost exploration and/or production segments of the industry such as deepwater, shale gas and tar sands/heavy oil. The North Sea, with a cost base in the US$50 to US$60 dollars a barrel range breathed in and held its breath. Although the OPEC nations committed not to raise production levels, it was clear that the current down turn was no simple repeat of 1986 and 1998 and different dynamics and forces were at large.

This study addressed that gap and by taking a life cycle approach, current and projected emissions for the eThekwini Municipality situated in South Africa are calculated. These calculations use country specific emission factors for the different waste management processes and include upstream, downstream and operational GHG emissions. These emission factors are applied to different amounts of waste materials processed though different waste management processes (transported, landfilled, recycled, composed and/or anaerobically digested) and the overall GHG emissions for the system have been calculated. Three scenarios are defined, namely the current situation, the expected situation in 2014 after the closure of one landfill and the projected situation for 2020. In 2012 (considered current situation) the GHG emissions from the entire waste management system in this municipality were in fact net savings of about -1,61,780 tonnes CO2 e (CO2 equivalents). The closure of one of the three local landfill sites in 2014 and the re-directioning of the majority of waste to another landfill site which does not have landfill gas collection and utilisation, will cause an increase of GHG emissions to 294,670 tonnes CO2e. For the year 2020 an increase in recycling can save -2,07,056 tonnes CO2e and the introduction of anaerobic digestion about -157682 tonnes CO2e. However, the introduction of landfill gas collection and utilisation systems for the Buffelsdraai landfill site will result in the highest possible overall GHG savings of -630,867 tonnes CO2. The results presented in this paper show that life cycle based GHG emission factors for waste and their use can support decision-making for municipalities in the local context and aid in optimising integrated waste management systems as to achieve the highest possible GHG savings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, air pollution control policies are often expensive and have side effects, especially by increasing or decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and thus influencing climate change. An integrated assessment of air pollution control policies thus has to take the effects on climate change into account and furthermore has to ensure, that the most efficient policy, i.e. the bundle of measures with the highest net benefit is chosen. Here, a methodology for carrying out an integrated assessment of air pollution control policies, the impact pathway approach, is described. The methodology includes the estimation of utility losses and is able to assess as well technical measures (that change emission factors, e.g. by using improved filters) as non-technical measures (e.g. changes in behaviour/activities, e.g. using public transport after an increase in fuel taxes). The method is then applied for identifying the most effective and efficient measures for reducing air pollution from transport activities in Europe. The results show, that the most efficient transport policies for improving air quality and protecting climate are more use of bicycles and e-bikes, better traffic management, rail replacing air transport, shore based electricity and tighter emission limits for ships, tighter EURO limits (EURO 7), low emission zones in cities (≥EURO V), improved tyres, brake pads and road cover and promotion of CNG and electric drive. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Air pollution control; Greenhouse gas reduction; Integrated assessment; Transport policies",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091519952

In the face of rapid deforestation, Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been heralded as a potential avenue for financing conservation, although PES schemes remain in an embryonic state for mangroves. Several challenges must be overcome if mangrove PES is to advance. Firstly, challenges exist in quantifying multiple ecosystem services, especially those that contribute to DRR, such as wave attenuation and the control of coastal erosion. Secondly, the permanence of quantified ecosystem services is a central tenet of PES, but is not guaranteed in the dynamic coastal zone. Mangroves are affected by multiple stressors related to natural hazards and climate change, which are often outside of the control of a PES site manager. This will necessitate Financial Risk Management strategies, which are not commonly used in coastal PES, and introduces a number of management challenges. Finally, and most importantly, PES generally requires the clear identification and pairing of separate service providers and service users, who can potentially overlap in the context of DRR. This chapter reviews and discusses these emerging issues, and proposes potential solutions to contribute to the more effective implementation of mangrove PES. Ultimately however, difficulties in pairing separate and discreet service providers and users may render PES for DRR unfeasible in some settings, and we may need to continue traditional modes of DRR finance such as insurance and donor support. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Blue carbon; Coastal erosion; Permanence; REDD+; Valuation; Wave attenuation; Wetland",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014053333

Here we present and discuss a detailed record of calcareous nannofossil and foraminiferal assemblages coupled with high-resolution geochemical, isotopic, and environmental magnetic records across the middle Ypresian at the Contessa Road section (Gubbio, Italy). This allows characterization of the Eocene Thermal Maximum 3 (ETM3, K or X) and recognition of four minor (I1, I2, J, L) hyperthermals. At the Contessa Road section, the ETM3 is marked by short-lived negative excursions in both δ13C and δ18O, pronounced changes in rock magnetic properties, and calcium carbonate reduction. These changes coupled with the moderate to low state of preservation of calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera, higher FI and agglutinated foraminifera values, along with a lower P/(P + B) ratio (P-planktonic; B-benthic) and coarse fractions provide evidence of enhanced carbonate dissolution during the ETM3. A marked shift toward warmer and more oligotrophic conditions has been inferred that suggests unstable and perturbed environmental conditions both in the photic zone and at the seafloor. © 2016 The Geological Society of America.

Furthermore, N2O is considered the most critical O3- depleting substance emitted in this XXI century. In spite of the environmental relevance of this pollutant, very little research on biotechnologies for the treatment of N2O emissions has been conducted. In this study, the potential of a bubble column (BCR) and an internal loop airlift (ALR) bioreactors of 2.3 L was evaluated for the abatement of N2O from industrial emissions from nitric acid plants along 62 days of operation. The systems were inoculated with a methylotrophic Paracoccus denitrificans strain (DSM 413) and continuously supplied with methanol as a carbon and electron donor source for the anoxic reduction of N2O. The simulated waste gas consisted of a N2 gas stream containing 1 ± 0.1 % of O2 and 3377 ± 312 ppmv of N2O at the inlet of the BCR and 1 ± 0.1 % of O2 with N2O concentration of 3617 ± 342 ppmv at the inlet of the ALR. This N2-laden stream was supplied at a constant flow rate of 110 ml min-1 in each reactor. The performance of the BCR was characterized by a steady state N2O removal efficiency (RE) of 87 ± 3 % with CO2 productions of 308 ± 36 g m-3 d-1 and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations of 867 ± 109 mg L-1. On the other hand, the ALR showed a N2O RE of 88 ± 2 % with productions of CO2 of 346 ± 28 g m-3 d-1 and TSS concentrations of 874 ± 88 mg L-1. This work constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic study of a biotechnology for the continuous abatement of N2O from nitric acid plants. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Biotechnology; Bubble columns; Carbon; Chemical plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Industrial plants; Nitric acid; Nitrogen oxides; Constant flow rates; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas emission inventories; Internal loop airlift; Nitric acid plants; Paracoccus denitrificans; Removal efficiencies; Total suspended solids; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988856276

As a result, MEA with 10 wt.% CNF addition showed the highest IV performance even though porosity itself was better for 20 wt.% CNF addition.

Future air quality results predicted that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration will decrease nationwide, especially in the eastern US and west coast. However, the ozone concentration was projected to decrease in the Eastern US but increase in the Western US. Future mortality was assessed under two scenarios, i.e., holding future population and baseline incidence rate at the present level; and using the projected baseline incidence rate and population in 2050. The entire continental US showed a decreasing trend of PM2.5-related mortality by the 2050 in Scenario (1), primarily resulting from the emissions reduction. While in Scenario (2), almost 50% of the continental states showed an increasing tendency of PM2.5-related mortality, due to the dominant influence of population growth. In particular, the highest PM2.5-related deaths and the biggest discrepancy between present and future PM2.5-related deaths will both occur in California in 2050s. For the ozone-related premature mortality, the simulation showed an increasing tendency in under both two scenarios, mainly due to the projected increase of methane, ozone concentration, and population.This is an abstract of a paper presented at the A&amp;WMA's 109th Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition (New Orleans, LA 6/20-23/2016).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016515718

The Energy-Saving and Emission-Reduction (ESER) evolution system can synthetically reflect the development trend of energy, environment and economy of a region. Based on the good efficiency of impulsive control, coordinated development of ESER evolution systems is researched by using synchronisation theory as the regulation theory for regional coordinated development. First, the synchronisation is realised with the impulsive control theoretically. Parameters of the evolution system are estimated from real data about energy and economy. Furthermore, the realisation of impulsive control is verified with fixed parameters and showed by numerical simulations. The evolution trend of energy intensity is obtained from the ESER system, which fits the actual developing trend well. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Empirical analysis; Energy-saving and emission-reduction; Evolution system; Impulsive control","Emission control; Development trends; Empirical analysis; Energy and the environment; Energy saving and emission reductions; Evolution systems; Impulsive controls; National strategies; Yangtze river delta; Energy conservation; development control; development strategy; economic development; emission control; empirical analysis; energy conservation; national strategy; regional development; China; Yangtze Delta; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953410324

Specimen temperature is above 1200K so that long wavelength radiation is significant and the DIC technique is not easy to apply. A heat resistance random pattern on the specimen surface, which is made by ceramic materials, and optical filter allow to apply the DIC method.

However, material recovery facilities (MRFs) that sort the municipal recycled streams do not recover 100% of the incoming material. Consequently, they landfill between 5% and 15% of total processed material as residue. This residue is primarily composed of high-energy-content non-recycled plastics and fiber. One possible end-of-life solution for these energy-dense materials is to process the residue into Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) that can be used as an alternative energy resource capable of replacing or supplementing fuel resources such as coal, natural gas, petroleum coke, or biomass in many industrial and power production processes. This report addresses the energetic and environmental benefits and trade-offs of converting non-recycled post-consumer plastics and fiber derived from MRF residue streams into SRF for use in a cement kiln.An experimental test burn of 118. Mg of SRF in the precalciner portion of the cement kiln was conducted. The SRF was a blend of 60% MRF residue and 40% post-industrial waste products producing an estimated 60% plastic and 40% fibrous material mixture. The SRF was fed into the kiln at 0.9. Mg/h for 24. h and then 1.8. Mg/h for the following 48. h. The emissions data recorded in the experimental test burn were used to perform the life-cycle analysis portion of this study.The analysis included the following steps: transportation, landfill, processing and fuel combustion at the cement kiln. The energy use and emissions at each step is tracked for the two cases: (1) The Reference Case, where MRF residue is disposed of in a landfill and the cement kiln uses coal as its fuel source, and (2) The SRF Case, in which MRF residue is processed into SRF and used to offset some portion of coal use at the cement kiln.The experimental test burn and accompanying analysis indicate that using MRF residue to produce SRF for use in cement kilns is likely an advantageous alternative to disposal of the residue in landfills. The use of SRF can offset fossil fuel use, reduce CO2 emissions, and divert energy-dense materials away from landfills. For this test-case, the use of SRF offset between 7700 and 8700Mg of coal use, reduced CO2 emissions by at least 1.4%, and diverted over 7950Mg of energy-dense materials away from landfills. In addition, emissions were reduced by at least 19% for SO2, while NOX emissions increased by between 16% and 24%.

Bhd, PCSB, Malaysia","Perched-water conditions have been observed infrequently in oil and gas fields in zones above fine-grained material that may be located a few to 100 meters above the oil water contacts. Although infrequent in scale of number of fields globally, perched-water zones are important consideration when evaluating reserves and planning field development. The study described in this paper was conducted to examine perched-water conditions and quantitatively evaluate factors that control perching behavior and its impact on field development plans. The differences between perched-water and hydrodynamically-tilted contacts have to be understood and clearly identified in a given reservoir by studying geological controls. The geological controls that shape contacts either perched or hydrodynamically tilted do play vital role in field development plans because of their structural differences leading to pressure communication or the lack of it. A perched-water zone in subsurface is defined as a water-saturated zone that is above contact or as a water-saturated zone not-directly-connected to the regional oil-water contact. Perching phenomena may occur in a permeable layer overlaying a relatively impermeable layer and conditions that could force water to infiltrate vertically through low permeability layer. The stress conditions that lead to formation of perched-water are extraneous. However, petrophysical properties of the subject rock that is exposed to the prevalent conditions determine the viability of formation of a perched-water structure. Hence, neither structural geology, stratigraphy and depositional environment studies nor facies and petrophysical evaluations can be performed alone to decipher if a structure is/can be considered perched-water. Therefore, the cases evaluated in this study are interrogated from structural, hydrodynamic and petrophysical perspectives to decide if subject structures can be deemed to contain perched-water. The correct diagnostic brings additional hydrocarbon pore volumes or cost savings when drilling below apparent hydrocarbon-water contacts with misconception of a probable perched-water both affecting the financial positively. © 2016, Offshore Technology Conference",,"Deposition; Fluid dynamics; Gas industry; Groundwater; Hydrocarbons; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore technology; Petroleum reservoirs; Petrology; Petrophysics; Stratigraphy; Structural geology; Carbonate reservoir; Depositional environment; Field development plans; Fine-grained material; Petrophysical evaluations; Petrophysical properties; Pressure communication; Structural differences; Oil field equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051640945

The maps of the content and maturity of organic matter were built, the lithological composition of the Domanik horizon was evaluated, and the comparative evaluation of the domanikite parameters at the commercially developed fields of the USA and Canada was performed. Within the frames of this work the results of studies of domanikites as an unconventional hydrocarbon source at the area of the Timan-Pechora (Republic of Komi) and Volga-Ural provinces (Perm Territory and Samara Region, Figure 1) were considered. The Domanik deposits of the East European platform and the Cisurals (D3f) are developed at the northeastern slope of the South Timan, in the Perm Territory, in Udmurtia, Tataria and Bashkiria. The outcrops of these deposits stretch in the form of a long chain from the North Urals across the Middle and Southern Urals. The Domanik deposits are confined to the Semiluksky horizon of the Frasnian stage. Their analogies are also found in the Sargayevsky and Buregsky horizons of the Frasnian stage and partially in the Famennian stage at the area of the Kama-Kinelsky system of downfolds. The Domanik deposits are a highly carboniferous thin-stratified formation, capable of both generating hydrocarbons (HC) and accumulating them in deconsolidated strata and zones fulfilling the role of a reservoir and forming autochthonous hydrocarbon deposits. Highly carboniferous formations occur in the conditions of non-compensated sedimentation at significant depths (more than 300 m) without access of oxygen, which leads to deposition of sapropelic organic matter. Low rates of clastic sedimentation define the abrupt predominance of carbonates, silica and pyrite in Domanik shales. After accumulation of sediments organic matter is oxidized and transformed to CO2, which influences the future diagenetic processes. Calcite gets dissolved in the presence of CO2, also from fauna skeletons. Increase of the concentration of hydrocarbonate ions leads to pH increase in sludge waters. When such waters move to permeable zones, reverse falling out of carbonates and reduction of permeability as the result occur. © 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Biogeochemistry; Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Deposits; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Lithology; Petroleum geology; Pyrites; Sedimentation; Silica; Comparative evaluations; Diagenetic process; European Platform; Hydrocarbon deposits; Lithological composition; Maturity of organic matters; Oil and gas provinces; Unconventional hydrocarbons; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048591213

In the context of the urban railway area, the energy consumption is huge. It is respectively split into 70% for the traction and 30% for station consumers. Many works have already been carried out on traction systems, but very few of them were oriented towards the station energy problematic. This paper describes the project led by ""Efficacity"" Institute which concerns the use of the braking energy to manage and optimize the railway station energy consumption. Efficacity investigates energetic concepts in order to store the braking energy of the trains with a stationary electrical saving system, and to reutilize it for the power supply of electric and thermal consumers or actuators in a railway station thanks to a microgrid. The idea is to store train braking energy in hybrid storage system (composed of batteries and super-capacitors cells) and to restate it judiciously at different moments of the day (during peak or low energy consumption hours) to various kind of station loads. © 2016 The Authors.","braking electrical disturbance; braking energy; electrical grid; microgrid; storage system; train station",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991222659

In this paper, we discuss Ecological Modernization Theory as a tool for understanding the complexity of climate governance at the sub-national level. In particular, we explore the emergence of hybrid governance arrangements during the local implementation of federal energy efficiency programs in US cities. We analyze the formation and advancement of programs associated with one effort to establish a sub-national low carbon energy policy: the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program administered by the US Department of Energy. Our findings highlight the diverse range of partnerships between state, private, and civil society actors that emerged through this program and point to some of the challenges associated with collaborative climate governance initiatives at the city level. Although some programs reflected ecologically modern outcomes, other cities were constrained in their ability to move beyond the status quo due to the demands of state bureaucracies and the challenges associated with inconsistent funding. We find that these programs cultivated hybrid arrangements in an effort to sustain the projects following the termination of federal grant funding. Overall, hybrid governance plays an important role in the implementation and long-term sustainability of climate-related policies. © 2016 by the authors.","Collaborative governance; Ecological modernization; Environmental state; Hybrid arrangements","ecological theory; energy conservation; energy efficiency; environmental policy; federal system; governance approach; local participation; long-term change; modernization; policy implementation; public-private partnership; sustainability; theoretical study; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956674405

The current context of climate change and water crisis in Brazil (particularly in the Southeast) amplifies the vulnerability of traditional and coastal communities. Therefore, the development of participatory alternatives to promote equity is fundamental to address territorial needs, thus generating solutions that consider the local context and traditional knowledge and increasing the resilience of affected communities. Based on the fact that sanitation was considered a priority for Praia do Sono—and through an approach that not only combines permaculture, education and sanitary engineering, but also establishes a dialogue between academia, local community and public managers—the Observatory of Sustainable and Healthy Territories, a partnership between the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), the National Health Foundation (FUNASA) and the Forum of Traditional Communities (FCT) has developed comprehensive social technologies. Raisin awareness in the community aims at the fully incorporating of the proposed solution in a future step.

The results revealed that RSAS showed better fidelity in simulating monsoon features from diurnal to daily scales during active and break periods as compared to SAS simulation. Prominent improvement can be noted in simulating diurnal phase of precipitation in RSAS over central India (CI) and equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) region during active periods. The spatial distribution of precipitation largely improved in RSAS simulation during active and break episodes. CFSv2 with SAS simulation has noticeable dry bias over CI and wet bias over EIO region which appeared to be largely reduced in RSAS simulation during both phases of the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO). During active periods, RSAS simulates more realistic probability distribution function (PDF) in good agreement with the observation. The relative improvement has been identified in outgoing longwave radiation, monsoon circulations, and vertical velocities in RSAS over SAS simulation. The improvement of rainfall distribution appears to be contributed by proper simulation of convective rainfall in RSAS. CFSv2 with RSAS simulation is able to simulate observed diurnal cycle of rainfall over CI. It correctly reproduces the time of maximum rainfall over CI. It is found that the improved feedback between moisture and convective processes in RSAS may be attributed to its improved simulation. Besides improvement, RSAS could not reproduce proper tropospheric temperature, cloud hydrometeors over ISM domain which shows the scope for future development. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

The presence of imine (-NH-) and pyridinic (-NC-) functional groups on the r-GO-Apy-CC electrode plays a critical role in the formation of bacterial colonization and enhanced extracellular electron transfer (EET) over a considerable period. The bacterial colonization over the r-GO-Apy-CC electrode was investigated in a Sacrificial Electrode Mode Reactor (SEMR) in which attached bacterial density with extracellular polysaccharides was monitored over a period. Simultaneously, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) reactor, resulting in an increased current density-voltage response from 0.27 mA cm-2 to 1.84 mA cm-2 over a period of time. In addition, when r-GO-Apy-CC was employed as an anode in MFC, the power density was nearly two times (1253 mW m-2) than that of the MFC employed with plain carbon cloth (PCC) (663.7 mW m-2) at a steady state condition. It was proposed that the combined effect of Apy hybridized with nanostructured r-GO provides a large surface area for bacterial colonization. Moreover, the high bioelectrocatalytic activity was attributed to the low molecular nature of the Apy, which incorporated well into the EET pathway of the exoelectrogens by a redox mechanism. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cyclic voltammetry; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electron transitions; Fuel cells; Graphene; Organic compounds; Bacterial colonization; Bioelectrocatalytic activity; Bioelectrochemical systems (BES); Carbon-cloth electrodes; Extracellular electron transfer; Extracellular polysaccharides; Reduced graphene oxides; Steady-state condition; Microbial fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979955039

Both series and parallel configurations for the hybrid case were studied. The simulation results indicated that series hybrid buses have the greatest overall advantage in fuel economy. The series and parallel hybrid buses were predicted to produce similar carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon tailpipe emissions but were also predicted to have reduced tailpipe emissions of nitrogen oxides compared with the conventional bus in higher speed cycles. For the New York bus cycle, which has the lowest average speed among the cycles evaluated, the series bus tailpipe emissions were somewhat higher than they were for the conventional bus; the parallel hybrid bus had significantly lower tailpipe emissions. All three bus power trains were found to require periodic active diesel particulate filter regeneration to maintain control of particulate matter.

A stronger awareness in preserving the environment has pushed forward more stringent IMO (International Maritime Organization) legislation that imposes on ship owners and managers the use of new technologies which affect the day by day running of the vessel, starting with the choice of fuel, through changes in the engine operational parameters, and culminating in a severe reduction in allowable exhaust emissions. These changes combined with a volatile fuel market, high competition in cargo rates, the pressure to reduce operating costs and the introduction of new technological advancements have brought the industry into uncharted operational territories, abandoning the 'comfort zone' that has been enjoyed in the last twenty years or so. The present changeable environment has a significant impact in the way two-stroke, slow speed, diesel engines are managed, introducing new challenges for different fuel types, different lubricants and ancillary equipment required to meet the new requirements. Field experience has shown that all these factors can lead to unintended consequences, including engine damage caused by poor fuel quality, lack of training/knowledge of the operators, incorrect lubrication choice and poor set up.

The reaction order for CO2partial pressure is confirmed to be zero, while that related to hydrogen pressure is near 0.38 and activation energy ranges 60–75 kJ/mol. Arrhenius plot demonstrates that only at reduced reactant partial pressure (3% CO2) or high contact times, a contribution due to some diffusional limitation is present.

Reliable quantification of directional pore network connectivity and characterization of pore architecture is, however, challenging. The objectives of this paper include (a) quantifying the directional connectivity of pore network and rock components, (b) investigating the consistency of the estimated directional connectivity at a given rock type in the formation, (c) identifying geometry-defined fabric features that cause the connectivity variations within the same formation, and (d) improving assessment of hydrocarbon saturation using the introduced quantitative directional pore-network connectivity factor. We introduce a new directional pore-network connectivity factor to quantify rock fabric. In order to evaluate its consistency in pore- and log-scale domains in the same rock types, the first step includes rock classification based on well logs and well-log-based estimates of petrophysical/compositional properties. Then rock samples from each rock type are scanned using a micro-Computed Tomography (CT) scanner, processed, and digitized into pore and grain regions. Afterwards, the pore-network connectivity of the three-dimensional (3D) pore-scale images are obtained using a semianalytical streamline algorithm. The geometrical features are quantitatively evaluated from these images and combined with the estimated connectivity. The new quantitative connectivity factor is finally used to improve evaluation of electrical resistivity logs for assessment of hydrocarbon saturation. We successfully applied the introduced method to a carbonate formation. The results confirmed that the introduced directional connectivity factor can detect rock fabric features and is a function of the directional diffusivity coefficient. This parameter remains persistent in the same rock type in the formation, which enables a reliable and enhanced interpretation of electrical resistivity logs in formations with complex pore structure. The quantification of rock fabric and pore network connectivity improved the estimation of hydrocarbon saturation by up to 61% when compared to conventional methods. The use of such parameter for rock fabric characterization minimizes the need for calibration efforts in interpretation of borehole geophysical measurements. Few cuttings from different rock types are sufficient for the proposed method.

The estimated trend (~9% per decade) is about a factor of 2 larger than the rate of increase that can be ascribed to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 (~5% per decade). Here we investigate whether the observed trends of CO2 and COx can be reproduced using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), a comprehensive global model with interactive chemistry, wherein vertical eddy diffusion is estimated from a parameterization of gravity wave breaking that can respond to changes in the model climate. We find that the modeled trends of CO2 and COx do not differ significantly at any altitude from the value expected from anthropogenic increases of CO2 and that WACCM does not produce significant changes in eddy diffusivity. We show that the discrepancy between model and observations cannot be attributed to uncertainties associated with geophysical noise and instrumental effects, to difficulties separating a linear trend from the 11 year solar signal, or to sparse sampling by ACE-FTS. Estimates of the impact of vertical diffusion on CO2 in the model indicate that a large increase in Kzz (~30% per decade) would be necessary to reconcile WACCM results with observations. It might be possible to ascertain whether such a large change in vertical mixing has in fact taken place by examining the trend of water vapor in the upper mesosphere. ©2016.

At low loads, high diesel substitution ratios result in excessive total unburned hydrocarbon emissions due to bulk flame quenching, and consequently lower substitution ratios in combination with intake air heating, throttling and increased turbulence should be adopted (or even full diesel operation) in order to meet emission legislation targets. At those operating points where combustion efficiency is not a limiting factor, engine operation can be really flexible and different options can be implemented. Conventional dual-fuel (CDF) pilot-ignition and reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion have been evaluated and compared based on emissions, heat transfer and efficiency. The results presented in this paper show that CDF is a really robust combustion mode but efficiency and NOx emissions are not optimal when substitution ratio is not maximized. Diesel injection close to TDC promotes fuel rich areas and NOx is formed in near-stoichiometric regions surrounding the diesel jets, so diesel fuel amounts should be kept to a minimum in order to reduce NO X emissions and heat losses. However, excessively low fuel quantities turn out in combustion phasing control and ignition quality problems and consequently high hydrocarbon emissions. Efficiency at low substitution ratio is reduced due to the effect of fuel trapped in crevices and excessive combustion temperatures, resulting in high heat losses through combustion chamber walls. For these reasons, RCCI combustion mode allows a more efficient use of CNG at high substitution ratios than CDF because of high reactivity fuel dispersed over the entire combustion chamber, including squish volume, while NO X emissions are sharply reduced compared to less premixed combustion modes. © 2016, FISITA.

We find that the solvent produces dramatic modifications on the free energy profile of the S1 state. Two twisted structures that are minima in the gas phase could not be localized in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the relative stability of minima and conical intersections (CIs) is reverted with respect to the gas phase values, affecting the prevalent de-excitation paths. As a consequence of these changes, three competitive de-excitation channels are open in aqueous solution: the fluorescence emission from a planar minimum on S1, the trans-cis photoisomerization through a CI that involves the rotation of the vinyl double bond and the non-radiative, non-reactive, de-excitation through the CI associated with the rotation of the single bond adjacent to the phenyl group. In the gas phase, the minima are the structures with lower energy, while in solution the CIβ structure, characterized by a large charge separation, is strongly stabilized by interactions with water molecules and becomes the structure with the lowest energy on S1. These facts explain the low fluorescence signal of pCE- in aqueous solution and the presence of partial trans-cis photoisomerization in this system. © 2016 the Owner Societies.",,"bacterial protein; propionic acid derivative; solvent; trans-3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid; visual proteins and pigments; Bacterial Proteins; Photoreceptors, Microbial; Propionates; Solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991106807

Despite the breakthroughs in milk production, average productivity of livestock is quite low in the region, mainly because of imbalanced feeding in terms of protein, energy and minerals. Farmers do not have adequate knowledge, resources and skills to formulate a least cost balanced ration. Feed shortages notwithstanding in the region, considerable potential exists for improving livestock productivity and reducing the carbon footprint of milk by ration balancing with available feed resources. The National Dairy Development Board of India has developed a user-friendly ration balancing software for preparing a least cost balanced ration, using available feed resources and area-specific mineral mixtures. To educate farmers, a large-scale ration balancing programme has been implemented in different states of India. Various studies indicate that ration balancing has resulted in an increase in farmers' net daily income by increasing milk yield or milk fat, while reducing feeding costs. Ration balancing has also helped improve feed conversion efficiency and microbial protein synthesis, while reducing enteric methane emissions. A study on the cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment of lifetime milk production indicated that enteric methane is the largest contributor to the carbon footprint of milk. A significant reduction in the carbon footprint of milk has been observed when feeding a balanced ration. The present review summarizes the application of ration balancing approach at the farmers' doorstep that could serve as a climate-smart strategy for achieving sustainable increases in livestock productivity in developing countries. © 2016 CAB International.","Balanced ration; Carbon footprint; Enteric methane; Milk production; Smallholding systems",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013867526

Developing countries such as India are good candidates for LCA research because of the large contribution of smallholder dairy system to the production of agricultural products such as milk. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the carbon footprint of milk production under the multi-functional smallholder dairy system in Anand district of Gujarat state, western India. A cradle-to-farm gate LCA was performed by covering 60 smallholder dairy farms within 12 geographically distinct villages of the district. The average farm size was 4.0 animals per farm, and the average number of each category of animal was 2.5 lactating cows, 1.4 lactating buffaloes, 1.8 replacement cows, 1.6 replacement buffaloes, 2.0 retired cows, 1.3 retired buffaloes and 1.0 ox per farm. The emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) on CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) basis from feed production, enteric fermentation and manure management were allocated to fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) on the basis of mass balance, price and digestibility. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O from cattle contributed 11.0%, 75.4% and 13.6%, respectively, to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The contribution of CO2, CH4 and N2O from buffalo was 8.2%, 80.5% and 11.3%, respectively, to the total GHG emissions of farms. The average carbon footprint (CF) of cow milk was 2.3, 1.9 and 2.0 kg CO2-eq/kg FPCM on mass, economic and digestibility basis, respectively, whereas for buffalo, milk CF was 3.0, 2.5 and 2.7 kg CO2-eq/kg FPCM, respectively. On the basis of digestibility allocation, emissions from retired (&gt;10 years of age and incapable of or ceased producing milk) cows and buffaloes were 1571.3 and 2556.1 kg CO2-eq/retirement year, respectively. Overall, the CF of milk production under the smallholder dairy system in Anand district was 2.2 kg CO2-eq/kg FPCM, which reduced to 1.7 kg CO2-eq/kg FPCM when milk, manure, finance and insurance were considered as economic functions of the smallholder system. The CF was lower by 65% and 22% for cow and buffalo milk, respectively, than were the estimates of FAO for southern Asia, and this was mainly attributed to difference in the sources of GHG emissions, manure management systems, feed digestibility and milk production data used by FAO. © CSIRO 2016.","attributional life cycle assessment; climate change; co-product allocation; emission intensity.","agricultural production; biomass allocation; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; climate change; dairy farming; digestibility; emission control; environmental impact; Food and Agricultural Organization; life cycle analysis; manure; milk production; smallholder; village; Anand; Gujarat; India; Animalia; Bos; Bubalus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958225783

However, to make it economically and technically feasible, capture plants must follow the fast and large load changes of the power plants without decreasing the overall performance of the plant. Dynamic modeling and simulation is therefore needed to evaluate the performance of this plant under critical operation. In this work, we evaluate the transient response of an absorber and a desorber for step changes of key process parameters, e.g. flue gas flow and composition, lean and rich CO2 loading, etc. We show the results for the baseline 30 wt% MEA and the low energy piperazine (PZ) solutions. This analysis reveals that the absorber reaches steady-state faster using MEA compared to PZ. This is related to the shift of the mass transfer zone due to changes in temperature. The transient operation in the regeneration unit is somewhat similar while using both solvents: an initial fast decrease of the lean loading is followed by a slow transient period as the system approaches steady-state conditions. We show the presence of inverse response in the stripper column when the rich loading decreases or the feed's temperature reduces using PZ solvent. Thus, we demonstrate that the dynamics of the MEA system cannot be extrapolated to other solvents. © 2016","CO2 post-combustion capture; Modelling; Plant wide Control; Process Optimization; System Identification","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Flow of gases; Identification (control systems); Mass transfer; Models; Optimization; Power plants; Solvents; Transient analysis; Critical operations; Dynamic model and simulation; Plantwide control; Post-combustion captures; Simulation and analysis; Steady-state condition; Transient operation; Transient periods; Loading",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991029160

In most areas, the severity of winter conditions varies from year to year. Modern society has become more vulnerable to these effects. The primary objective of winter maintenance is to provide snow and ice-free conditions on the highway network. Compared with other road activities, winter maintenance is characterized by the need for a fast response, and by the impacts of the measures taken being short-lived. That is why scientifically based methodology (optimisation of winter maintenance techniques) is needed to reduce the above negative consequences. The main aim of the research work carried out at KTI Non-Profit Ltd, Budapest was to optimise the efficiency and the timing of salt storage and road de-icing policy as a function of environmental, economic and traffic safety aspects. The selected methodology, Capacitated Arc Routing Problem helps the road managing agencies in optimising road winter maintenance fleet routing, with reduced air pollution, fuel consumption, in accelerating the related activities, besides in reducing road user costs significantly. In the research work performed several scenarios on different decentralisation levels of salt storage depots were also modelled, and investigated from environmental and economic view-points. The scenario on heavy de-icing vehicles of standard load capacities with a centralized depot was considered as standard variant, while the heavy vehicles of variable load capacities and the silos with unlimited capacities were also modelled. A Cost Benefit Analysis of the timing of salt depot decentralisation proved that the immediate set-up of silos is the most economic and efficient variant. The methodology developed can also help the local road administrations in devising their winter policy documents covering the related objectives, standards, intervention levels, priorities for action within the road network, the response times, snow clearing and salting routes, salt spreading rates, and personnel strategy. © 2016 The Authors.","de-icing salt; salt storage depot; salting route; winter maintenance vehicle fleet; Winter road maintenance",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991268623

One approach here is to increase payload while retaining the legally limited axle loads. The key is to substitute plastic for metal. For air springs this route has been pursued consistently for decades. Using the method of integrative computation described in this paper, even air springs for tractors, trucks and buses can be designed with a lightweight construction, with the internal volume of the piston being used to increase driving comfort. It is possible to obtain a more realistic indication of stress in the component by transferring the results of mold flow analysis into the theoretical strength analysis by means of FEM analysis. The result is a much reduced material consumption. Material costs and cycle times in production are minimized. The result is air suspension systems which, compared with the state of the art, deliver a weight saving of up to 15 kg in the case of a four-air-spring drive axle. The reduction in CO2 emissions resulting from this can be as much as 200 kg over a driven distance of 400,000 km.

This causes environmental pollution in domestic and foreign areas generated by demand that results from urban development. Input-output analyses have been widely used to estimate urban environmental pollution. However, most previous studies adopted a single-region approach, which assumed that the same production technology was used in local, domestic, and foreign urban production systems. Here we constructed a 3-scale input-output model that assumed different production technologies for these 3 types of production systems to more accurately estimate urban environmental pollution. Due to the service-dominated economy of Beijing, a 3-scale input-output subsystem model was constructed and applied to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the 3 production systems caused by local service development in Beijing. Specifically, we investigated methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions associated with 3 sources (local production and domestic and foreign imports), 4 components (external, induced, internal, and demand-level components), and 5 demand categories (household consumption, government consumption, investment, domestic exports, foreign exports) of the service sector in Beijing in 2010. Total CH4 and N2O emissions from the service sector were estimated to be 5641.25 × 103 and 674.05 x 103 t CO2-equivalent, accounting for 15.20 and 13.39% of the total CH4 and N2O emissions from Beijing, respectively. Local production played a major role in emissions, followed by domestic and foreign imports. Our model can isolate the effects of individual sectors on GHG emissions at different scales, helping urban policymakers formulate specific emission-reduction regulations according to different goals. © Inter-Research 2016.","Developing economy; Greenhouse gas; Input-output model; Service development; Urban climate","atmospheric pollution; climate modeling; emission control; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; market conditions; methane; nitrous oxide; policy making; service sector; urban climate; urban development; urban economy; urban policy; urban pollution; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984688933

From that time up to the late 1990s, implementation was typically a government-led, top-down, incentivebased (food-for-work) approach that prioritized engineering measures. During this phase, the programs focused primarily on reducing soil erosion. In the early 2000s, community-based integrated watershed development was introduced to promote watershed management as a means to achieve broader integrated natural resource management and livelihood improvement objectives within prevailing agro-ecological and socioeconomic environments. Through an analysis of six watershed programs in three regions (Oromia, Amhara and Tigray), we review this latter phase of watershed management in Ethiopia to understand the extent to which the related interventions have supported improved productivity, and environmental and smallholder livelihood outcomes. Across the six watersheds, the results suggest that watershed management has had a positive impact on natural resource conservation, crop-livestock production and productivity, socioeconomic conditions and livelihoods. The data indicate that watershed management has improved farm incomes and food security by an average of 50% and 56%, respectively. Also, in some watersheds, the risk of crop failure due to moisture stress and climate shocks has reduced by up to 30%. However, the nature and scale of the impact varies significantly across the six watersheds. For example, vegetation restoration and land cover has improved by an average of 40% in the three poorly performing (less successful) watersheds, and by about 85% in the three other well-performing (successful) watersheds. Moreover, the factors that contribute to the success of watershed management are multidimensional, including biophysical, institutional and socioeconomic elements, and watersheds with permeable lithology (e.g., sandstone or alluvial deposits) and a concave shape show good upstream-downstream hydrological linkages, while the opposite is true in areas dominated by limestone lithology. Other factors that were found to significantly influence the 'success' of watershed management include the presence of supporting institutional structures and the extent of community participation. Several challenges were also identified that threaten the success of watershed management. These include the lack of technical advice and information to support the selection of interventions suitable for the local context; uncoordinated interventions, institutions and actors within a watershed; and, importantly, the uneven distribution of the water management costs and benefits. To address these challenges and support the scaling up of best practices, this study recommends (i) linking physical and biological conservation activities with income-generating and livelihood improvement activities; (ii) tailoring technologies and implementation approaches to prevailing agro-climatic, biophysical and socioeconomic conditions; (iii) co-managing surface and subsurface water resources to improve water productivity; (iv) strengthening institutional mechanisms to foster partnership among stakeholders, and ensure the fair and equitable sharing of costs and benefits; (v) supporting community participation with adequate technical and financial support; (vi) improving access to markets; and (vii) developing guidelines for the collection of baseline data, and monitoring and evaluation of water management interventions. © 2012, by IWMI.",,"Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Environmental management; Food supply; Lime; Lithology; Productivity; Rivers; Soil conservation; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Community participation; Integrated watershed management; Management interventions; Monitoring and evaluations; Natural resource management; Socio-economic conditions; Socio-economic environments; Watershed management projects; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012165796

However, at the same time, it promised to reduce carbon emission and planned to use more renewable energy. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose an optimal energy mix planning model in electricity generation from various energy sources, such as gas, coal, nuclear, hydro, wind, photovoltaic, and biomass, which considers more renewable and sustainable portions by imposing governmental regulation named renewable portfolio standard (RPS). This optimization model minimizes various costs such as construction cost, operation and management cost, fuel cost, and carbon emission cost while satisfying minimal demand requirement, maximal annual installation potential, and renewable portfolio standard constraints. Results showed that this optimization model could successfully generate energy mix plan from 2012 to 2030 while minimizing the objective costs and satisfying all the constraints. Therefore, this optimization model contributes more efficient and objective method to the complex decision-making process with a sustainability option. This proposed energy mix model is expected to be applied not only to Korea, but also to many other countries in the future for more economical planning of their electricity generation while affecting climate change less. © 2016 by the authors.","Energy mix; Korea; Optimization; Renewable portfolio standard","carbon emission; climate change; cost analysis; electricity generation; energy flow; energy planning; energy resource; energy use; optimization; regulatory framework; renewable resource; standard (regulation); state role; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971280953

Given the very low correlation coefficients between the Rn and hydrocarbon components of the soil gases, factor analysis was used to reveal a background process controlling the common migration of hydrocarbon and Rn components. The lateral distribution of the factor scores were studied using sequential Gaussian distribution. The E-type grid generated from 100 realizations indicated several positive anomalies at the surface. Indications with a larger than 0.7 probability were kept for further analysis. Seismic sections of a 3D survey support the comparison of the surface locations of these anomalies and the surface projections of the known reservoirs. The results proved the connection between the known reservoirs and the Rn and HC components of soil gases. From the positive verification, regions with a high probability positive anomaly of factor scores, but without any reservoir counterparts may be suggested as targets for further surface hydrocarbon exploration. © 2016, Institute of Geology.

The recent scientific literature has shown a growing interest to assess climate adaptation plans at the urban level, in recognition of the important role played by urban areas in addressing climate change challenges. However, little information is available on the combination of these two issues, i.e., the actual inclusion of EbA measures in climate adaptation plans at the urban level. This paper addresses this gap by developing a framework to analyze the treatment of EbA in urban level climate planning, and apply it to a sample of climate adaptation plans in Europe. The framework consists of a classification of EbA measures, and a scoring system to evaluate how well they are reflected in different components of the plans. The results suggest that there is in general good awareness in plans of EbA measures, and of their potential role in addressing climate change challenges. However, their treatment in climate adaptation plans at the urban level often lacks sufficient baseline information, as well as convincing implementation actions. The paper concludes by offering recommendations to improve future practice, in terms of enhancing the baseline information to improve the proposal and design of EbA measures, improving the treatment of co-benefits associated to EbA measures, and strengthening coordination with other planning tools. Possible future development of this works include the integration of the proposed EbA classification, and the analysis of a larger sample of territorial plans. © 2015 The Authors.","Climate change; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Urban ecosystem services; Urban planning","adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem service; urban area; urban planning; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942010105

However, it is unable to realize the low pollution characteristics because in the transportation and delivery process, a lot of carbon emissions would be generated due to scattered supply nodes and obvious periodical fluctuation. Therefore, effective locating of the distribution center is very critical to biofuel. The main purpose of this article is to research the biofuel location problem from the perspective of carbon emissions, in which process a hybrid genetic algorithm is used to get the optimal location with applications in a cassava biofuel enterprise, for instance. First, a mathematic model is constructed in this paper based on the factors of location selection and requirements of the building process within the distribution center. Second, the mathematical methods, combined with genetic algorithm and mountain climbing algorithm are employed so as to analyze an enterprise example and acquire the locating result. Finally, this paper discusses the location result of the instance location, which thus proves the practicability of this paper. Moreover, the results obtained in this paper will help achieve sustainability of biofuel transport and distribution, thereby promoting the development of biofuel industry in China. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Alternative fuels; Carbon; Genetic algorithms; Location; Pollution; Urban planning; Warehouses; Distribution centers; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Location problems; Location selection; Mathematical method; Mountain-climbing; Optimal locations; Periodical fluctuations; Biofuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016782902

The upcoming Stage V emissions regulations in Europe will make DPFs a standard component for emissions reductions for non-road engines. The tightening in NOx emissions standard has resulted in the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology for NOx reduction and as a result the general trend in engine technology as of today is towards a higher engine-out NOx/PM ratio enabling passive regeneration of the DPF. The novel filter concept discussed in this paper is optimized for low pressure drop, high filtration efficiency, and low thermal mass for optimized regeneration and fast heat-up, therefore reducing CO2 implications for the DPF operation. In addition, compact filter designs can be achieved by using the proprietary Asymmetric Cell Technology (ACT) providing a larger inlet channel volume and therefore a higher ash storage capacity in the same space envelope without compromising the filter bulk heat capacity and mechanical integrity. In this paper we will discuss two cell technologies of this novel filter concept: (i) standard cell technology for the highest reduction in pressure drop, improved filtration with increased ash storage capacity compared to conventional DPFs, and (ii) ACT design for a life time pressure drop solution. The benefit from ACT design may be utilized in different ways depending on the application requirements, like lower lifetime pressure drop or longer service interval for the same filter size or a smaller filter volume with the same service interval compared to conventional DPF systems. The filter technologies are based on a thin-wall design with optimized material and microstructure, resulting in very linear pressure drop response with soot loading in both bare and catalyzed state.

These benefits are a potential improvement in aircraft design to save weight and reduce fuel consumption. A carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite is one of the types used for aircraft structural applications. Carbon fibers are mechanically stronger and lighter than aluminum. In a CFRP composite, carbon fiber acts as reinforcement and provides mechanical strength, and epoxy resin is the supporting matrix. Therefore, carbon fibers greatly improve composite's overall material properties. They can be fabricated in a desired stacking sequence, with various fiber orientations. From an electrical point of view, a composite can be designed so that it will conduct current asymmetrically in one direction as compared to another. A fiber orientation in a CFRP composite results in strong anisotropic material properties. This indicates that the composite exhibits different conductivity in each direction, along the fibers or transverse to the fibers. In this paper, variation in electrical properties of CFRP caused by relatively low magnitude current impulses discharged through CFRP coupons are reported, and internal changes of the composite, due to current impulses, are studied. Based on electrical resistance measurements caused by these currents, property changes in CFRP composite coupons of two different carbon ply orientations are compared. Furthermore, it will be investigated if the changes caused by current impulses are mainly focused in the region of the current injection at the edges of composite coupons, or are they distributed uniformly through the bulk of the composite.",,"Aircraft materials; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Fighter aircraft; Reinforcement; Stiffness; Aircraft industries; Carbon/epoxy composites; Current injections; Electrical resistance measurement; Stacking sequence; Strength and stiffness; Strong anisotropic materials; Structural applications; Epoxy resins",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013891180

Since the country's independence, the agricultural sector has undergone many agricultural and rural development programs and structural reforms to enable the country to achieve food security and contribute to the economic growth. Fertilizer use in Morocco is still low and covers barely 50% of the real needs. Also, the quantities used in average are well below the recommended ones. The mean consumption is about 50 kg fertilizers/ha with excessive application in some areas. Given this fact, fertilizer use must increase in order to reverse the current trends of low crop productivity and land degradation. Soils and soil fertility research conducted in Morocco have played a major role in the improvement of fertilizer use. Initial efforts focused on the identification of nutrient constraints in the field, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus. However, despite such developments, the impact at farm level is still far from satisfactory in terms of yield increases. IPNI North Africa is focusing on the implementation of the concept of 4R Nutrient Stewardship by conducting research platforms on efficient use of fertilizers through the evaluation of fertilizer sources and their application rates and time in dryland and irrigated agriculture under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The approach is the integrated plant nutrition approach which seeks to improve nutrient-use efficiency, to build up nutrient stocks in the soil, and to limit losses to the environment. During the last two years, several research platforms were conducted in such a way to cover different agro-ecological zones, soil types and cropping systems in order to establish fertilizer recommendations for crops base on the cropping system practiced. Also, brochures, training materials and pocket guides on best management practices were developed. In addition to training, field days and farmers field schools. Research platforms concerned both cereal and olive tree production systems. Fifty platforms on cereals have been conducted in four different regions in Morocco and one region in Algeria and four platforms on olive trees two in Morocco and two in Tunisia. © 2016 The Authors.",,"Agriculture; Crops; Economics; Engineering research; Food supply; Forestry; Nutrients; Regional planning; Soils; Agro-ecological zones; Best management practices; Irrigated agriculture; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Nutrient management; Nutrient-use efficiencies; Rain fed agriculture; Socio-economic development; Fertilizers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979622990

However, most plans for wastewater treatment systems do not consider the renewable support required to dilute plants' emissions. Solutions for mitigating environmental impacts and achieve sustainable environments with low carbon depend on the accounting for the available local resources and the environmental services required for diluting emissions. Two example applications of domestic wastewater treatment metabolism are discussed using sustainability indicators and inputs to the greenhouse gas emissions calculation.

We measure the Doppler broadening of the H3+ emission lines in order to evaluate the kinetic temperature of the molecules, and we obtain a value of 1390 ± 160 K. We also measure the relative intensities of lines in the ν2 fundamental in order to calculate the rotational temperature, obtaining a value of 960 ± 40 K.

However, while citizens may endorse broad energy-mitigation policies, they often resist the implementation of such policies via smart growth and other mitigation initiatives in their own neighborhoods. This study looked at whether public understanding and acceptance of smart-growth policies could be improved if citizens were provided with timely, accessible visualizations about why and how such policies can help reduce energy use. This paper reviews two public-engagement workshops that utilized a collaborative touch table combined with three-dimensional visualizations and metrics that were updated in real time. Working both individually and collaboratively on an urban-design task, all participants improved the smart growth and energy-related performance of the study areas via their solutions in the first workshop, but they did not all further improve the energy-related performance of the areas after receiving additional energy knowledge and metrics in a follow-up workshop.

FARM implements the SAPRC99 gas-phase chemical mechanism and the AERO3 aerosol module, derived from CMAQ model. Simulations were performed on a 316 km x 248 km domain, covering the entire region with 4 km grid spacing. The meteorological fields necessary for dispersion simulations came from the meteorological model RAMS. Emission data were derived from the regional INEMAR inventory, updated to the year 2013, while the emissions from the neighbouring regions were taken from the Italian national emission inventory. Initial and boundary conditions were provided by a national-scale simulation performed by the Air Quality Forecasting System QualeAria. According to the INEMAR emission inventory, the most relevant pollutant sources in the region are a steel plant, the largest in Europe (in Taranto area), a coal fired plant, the second most powerful in Italy (in Brindisi area) and biomass burning for residential heating. Simulation results evidenced exceedances for PM10 daily limit value and BaP annual limit values occurring at some areas. To evaluate the model performance, hourly and daily data, measured by the 35 monitoring stations belonging to the regional air-monitoring network, were compared with the simulation results, for the main pollutants regulated by the European Directive 2008/50/EC. The comparison between simulated and experimental data evidenced a good capability of the modelling system to reproduce the spatial distribution and the temporal variability of the observations. Some exceptions occurred, probably due to the adopted model spatial resolution, the uncertainties in emission inventories and the spatial representativeness of air quality monitoring stations. The interesting results obtained suggest the use of this modelling strategy for further source apportionment studies, in order to identify and to implement proper emission control strategies. © 2018 Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Electronic noses, initially developed as cheap, easy tools to detect volatiles, may have the required time-resolved coverage of the odor emission phenomenon in a cheap and feasible way with respect to chemical analysis of air. One crucial issue to resolve is to evaluate the discriminant capacity of a sensor array in-field and under working conditions. In this paper the authors have studied the responses of electronic noses of different technologies to odors emitted from a waste management plant, by integrating results obtained with dynamic olfactometry and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry/olfactometry, in the aim to implement a monitoring system and improve cleaner production technologies. Three most impacting odor sources in the waste management plant were detected: biogas, a by-product of mechanical treatment of municipal solid wastes, with low organic fraction and a sludge pressed and dehydrated from treatment of urban wastewater. The most odor impacting source was the sludge and the major responsible of the odor impacts were aromatics (in particular 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene), aliphatic hydrocarbons, terpenes and sulphur volatiles (methyl disulphide, carbon disulphide, dimethyltrisulphide). Ten Metal Oxide Semiconductors and 32 polymer/black carbon (Nano Composite Array) sensors in two electronic noses, were tested for discrimination source capabilities. Results of linear discriminant analysis and cross validation give 86.7% successful recognition for Metal Oxide Semiconductors, 53.3% for Nano Composite Array and 93.3% for a selection of sensors belonging to both technologies chosen according to the selectivity towards the odor active molecules. The containment of odors could also be achieved by spraying a specific product and monitoring the process using selected sensors of the arrays. The results of the in-field work demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of different construction technologies in the e-noses arrays, to characterize and monitor in-site and in real time odor emissions from waste management plants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic olfactometry; Electronic nose; Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry/olfactometry; Volatile organic compound; Waste management plant","Chemical analysis; Chromatography; Discriminant analysis; Electronic equipment; Electronic nose; Fragrances; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metallic compounds; Metals; MOS devices; Municipal solid waste; Nanocomposites; Nanosensors; Odor control; Odors; Oxide semiconductors; Pollution control; Spectrometry; Transistors; Volatile organic compounds; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; 1 ,3 ,5-trimethyl benzene; Aliphatic hydrocarbons; Construction technologies; Dynamic olfactometry; Linear discriminant analysis; Mechanical treatments; Metal oxide semiconductor; Waste management plants; Waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982684004

A big effort from a control and calibration point of view is required in order to optimize the coordination among them. Furthermore, the air-path process is highly nonlinear, based on thermodynamic phenomena. The objective of this study is to investigate a nonlinear model-based multivariable (MIMO, Multi Input Multi Output) technique to decouple actuators interaction and to reduce the calibration effort, while increasing control performances and robustness with respect to model uncertainties and system parameter variations. The presented methodology uses a nonlinear physical model of the diesel air and charging system, and the control architecture is mainly based on the feedback linearization technique that decouples actuators’ interactions and compensates for nonlinearities. System differential equations are transformed through the Feedback Linearization in order to define a new set of virtual inputs. Relation among the new virtual inputs and the outputs is purely linear and decoupled, meaning that each virtual input affects linearly only one output. Moreover, a linear control block is added to guarantee requested transient and steady state performances and closed loop robustness. This additional control block is composed by four SISO (Single Input Single Output) linear controllers (e.g. four PID controls) tuned over the obtained linear system. © 2016, FISITA.

The aim of these systems is to improve the in-cylinder mixture preparation (in terms of homogeneity and temperature) and therefore enhance the combustion, which ultimately increases thermal efficiency and fuel economy while lowering the emissions. This paper describes the effects of dual injection systems on combustion, efficiency and emissions of a downsized single cylinder gasoline direct injection spark ignited (DISI) engine. A set of experiments has been conducted with combined port fuel and late direct fuel injection strategy in order to improve the combustion process. Several steady state points were selected for this study to represent the typical engine conditions in use. Direct injection timings were varied to find the best injection timing for optimum in-cylinder conditions and therefore optimum efficiency at each speed and load. The results show that net indicated specific fuel consumption (NISFC) could be decreased by up to 9% at 1000 rpm and 8.83 bar NIMEP (net indicated mean effective pressure) using the optimized PFI/late DI injection. At the other test points, NISFC was similar to those with DI-only operation despite higher in-cylinder pressures and slightly shorter combustion durations. In terms of emissions, there was an increase of CO when using both PFI and late DI, while HC decreased slightly at the same conditions. The smoke number shows a significant reduction at most cases compared to the direct injection-only operation.

In the present work, we report a systematic study of structural and electronic properties of graphene oxide for different oxidations levels (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) using density functional calculations for electronic ground state and a statistical approach on carbon-carbon bond length obtained after the geometric optimization of graphene covered with epoxide and hydroxyl functional groups. The theoretical models proposed and studied here are accord with the well-known experimental data. Our statistical results of the carbon-carbon bond length shown that hydroxyl groups disturbs the structure of graphene more than epoxide groups, however, both hydroxyl and epoxide groups are responsible of the change of hybridization sp2 to sp3, while the degree of oxidation increase. In addition, our electronic structure calculations confirm that with low degree of oxidation, the graphene oxide is semiconductor, and with full degree of oxidation graphene oxide is an insulating material. The minimum of total energy is found when the graphene oxide has full coverage.

Emerging magnetic flux is frequently related to eruptive events, because when emerging they can reconnected with the ambient field and release magnetic energy. We will use a physic-based model to reconstruct the evolution of the solar emission based on the configuration of the photospheric magnetic field. The structure of the coronal magnetic field is estimated by employing force-free extrapolation NLFFF based on vector magnetic field products (SHARPS) observed by HMI instrument aboard SDO spacecraft from Sept. 29 (2013) to Oct. 07 (2013). The coronal plasma temperature and density are described and the emission is estimated using the CHIANTI atomic database 8.0.

The analysis includes the technical and economic feasibility, as well as the greenhouse gases emission reduction achieved by implementing this technology. The building used in this study has an annual electricity consumption of 2.7 GWh and a cooling space of 18000 m2. The proposed system consists on the installation of a GSHP to complement the existent HVAC system. Total initial cost for this particular project implementation is around 1,193,000 MXN with an IRR on equity of 20%, a payback period of less than 8 years and a NPV of almost 4 million MXN. Moreover, annual savings were calculated to be over 2 million MXN with a Benefit-Cost ratio of 6.11. The cost of electricity has the greatest impact on the estimation of the NPV according to the risk analysis. Other benefits of implementing this system also include an annual greenhouse gas emission reduction of almost 61 tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to savings of more than 26,000 litres of gasoline that would not be consumed. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

We propose a multi-objective memetic algorithm that hybridizes an enhanced version of the NSGA-II dominance-based evolutionary algorithm with a multi-objective local search based on hill-climbing. Given the non-regularity of the energy consumption objective function, we design a low-polynomial energy post-optimization procedure which attempts to reduce the energy cost of a solution without increasing its total weighted tardiness. We report results from an experimental study where we analyse our method and demonstrate that the proposed post-optimization procedure adds a significant improvement in its performance, obtaining results that outperform those of the state-of-the-art.

This scenario removes 940 GtC from the atmosphere and mitigates 1.5 K of global warming within this century. The climate adjusts to the lower CO2 concentration preventing the loss of sea ice and high sea level rise. Seawater pH and the carbonate saturation state (Ω) rise substantially above levels of the current decade. Pronounced differences in regional sensitivities to AOA are projected, with the Arctic Ocean and tropical oceans emerging as hot spots for biogeochemical changes induced by AOA.

The need to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions was one of the reasons that gave rise to dynamic windows. The ideal window would be one with optical properties that could readily adapt in response to changing climatic conditions or occupant preferences. The emerging concept of ""dynamic window"" is more as a multifunctional envelope that produces and manages energy rather than simply a static piece of coated glass. These facade systems include switchable windows and shading systems such as motorized shades, switchable electrochromic or gas chromic window coatings, Suspended Particle Device (SPD) Windows and double-envelope window-wall systems that have variable optical and thermal properties that can be changed in response to climate and building system requirements. Water flow glazing is a different concept of ""dynamic window"". Water flow glazing provides control over the thermal load striking the surface, without compromising on transparency. The circulating water through the chamber both absorbs infrared radiation and reduces the temperature of the interior glass pane. Alongside, it provides thermal inertia to the window and a great potential to absorb and transport energy.","energy management in buildings; geothermal heat exchangers; water flow glazing","Carbon dioxide; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Geothermal heating; Glass; Glazes; Hydraulics; Infrared radiation; Memory architecture; Optical properties; Urban planning; Climatic conditions; In-buildings; Occupant preferences; Optical and thermal properties; Reduce energy consumption; Shallow geothermal systems; Suspended particles; Water flows; Flow of water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997820972

Goodarzi et al (2012) investigated the feasibility of securely storing CO2 in Nisku geological formation located in Wabamun Lake area (Alberta, Canada) using a coupled flow, thermal and geomechanical model. Due to lack of field and lab measurements, the results of the study were reported as pessimistic. This paper utilized recently recorded well log, well test and lab measurements specific to the study area to build porosity, absolute and relative permeability, thermal, mechanical property and stress profiles required for refining the results of the aforementioned study. The results show that injection in the Nisku aquifer (below or at fracture pressure with 1-2 Mt/year) causes only small surface heave in the range of 2-3 mm. Injection above the fracture pressure at 2 Mt/ year results in higher well injectivity but also increases the possibility of caprock fracturing. The degree of vertical propagation strongly depends on the caprock stress state and mechanical properties. The importance of the proper site characterization is highlighted by comparison of our current results with our earlier work on the same site reported in Goodarzi et al. (2012), in which estimates were used for many parameters. The predicted fracture dimensions based on updated fluid and rock mechanical properties in the current work are significantly larger than the dimensions reported in the 2012 study. The primary reason for this is the lower initial fracture pressure and higher stiffness of the reservoir rock formation used in this study.This causes smaller fracture width and lower leak-off which will be compensated by larger extent of fracture both horizontally and vertically.. Thermal effects of cold CO2 injection reduce significantly the fracture pressure and enhance the horizontal fracture propagation. The vertical extension of fracture in the thermal model was shown to be smaller than in the isothermal model due to the confining stress contrast created by thermoelastic stresses. This in turn resulted in larger horizontal propagation of fracture in the thermal model. The reduction of fracturing pressure due to thermal effects will reduce the well injectivity if the well is to be operated below fracture pressure, and increase fracture propagation if fracturing is allowed. This aspect needs to be taken into account by operators as well as by regulatory agencies. If it is required to operate below fracturing, the time variation of fracture pressure under injection condition can be determined using geomechanicaly coupled model and its historical minimum value should be taken as the maximum operating pressure.

Efforts to extend this technology to longer wavelengths are meeting with some success, but the trend remains that longer wavelengths correlate with greatly reduced power. The carbon dioxide (CO2) laser is capable of delivering high energy, 10 micron wavelength pulses, but the gain structure makes operating in the ultra-short pulse regime difficult. The Naval Research Laboratory and Air Force Research Laboratory are developing a novel CO2 laser designed to deliver ∼1 Joule, ∼1 picosecond pulses, from a compact gain volume (∼2x2x80 cm). The design is based on injection seeding an unstable resonator, in order to achieve high energy extraction efficiency, and to take advantage of power broadening. The unstable resonator is seeded by a solid state front end, pumped by a custom built titanium sapphire laser matched to the CO2 laser bandwidth. In order to access a broader range of mid infrared wavelengths using CO2 lasers, one must consider nonlinear frequency multiplication, which is non-trivial due to the bandwidth of the 10 micron radiation. © 2016 SPIE.","carbon dioxide laser; infrared laser; short pulse; terawatt","Bandwidth; Carbon dioxide lasers; Energy gap; Infrared devices; Infrared lasers; Optical resonators; Pumping (laser); Research laboratories; Resonators; Sapphire; Solid state device structures; Solid state lasers; Ultrashort pulses; Air Force Research Laboratory; Mid-infrared wavelengths; Naval Research Laboratory; Short pulse; Solid state technology; Terawatt; Titanium sapphire laser; Ultra-short pulse laser; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983319969

The time-lapse analysis of zero-offset VSP measurements shows that CO2-induced amplitude changes can be observed on near-well corridor stacks. Further, we investigate whether CO2-induced amplitude changes in the monitoring data can be used to derive geometrical and petrophysical parameters governing the migration of CO2 within a brine saturated sandstone aquifer. 2D seismic-elastic modelling is done to test the processing workflow and to perform a wedge modelling study for estimation of the vertical expansion of the CO2 plume. When using the NRMS error as a measure for the similarity between the modelled and recorded repeat traces, the best match is achieved for a plume thickness of 6-7 m within the reservoir sandstone of 8 m thickness. With band limited impedance inversion a velocity reduction at the top of the reservoir of 30%, influenced by casing reverberations as well as CO2 injection, is found. The relation of seismic amplitude to CO2 saturated layer thickness and CO2-induced changes in P-wave velocities are important parameters for the quantification of the injected CO2 volume. © 2014 Julia Götz et al.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon storage; hydrocarbon reservoir; P-wave; plume; reservoir; sandstone; seismic migration; two-dimensional modeling; vertical seismic profile; Berlin; Brandenburg [Germany]; Germany; Ketzin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975295538

Currently the transport sector is one of the biggest greenhouse gas emission producer in the EU [2]. Drop-in biofuels can contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions in the transport sector. Diesel R33, a newly developed biofuel enables sustainable mobility fulfilling the European diesel fuel specification and reduces the GHG emissions by about 18.2 % against fossil diesel fuel. Diesel R33 is made of 7 % used cooking oil methyl ester, 26 % hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and 67 % high quality diesel fuel. HVO was produced from rapeseed and palm oil. This new biofuel was tested in a fleet of 280 vehicles (passenger cars, light duty vehicles, off-road vehicles and urban buses) covering all emission classes. The impact of the new fuel on the vehicles, their emissions and the engine oil aging was investigated. Additional to the extended fleet test, thermo-oxidative laboratory aging tests using Diesel R33 in non-additivated base oil, in squalane as model substance for base oil and in real engine oil were carried out systematically to determine the impact of Diesel R33 on oil sludge formation. Moreover, five passenger cars (emission classes Euro 3, Euro 5 and Euro 6) were intensively tested on exhaust gas emissions of regulated and non-regulated components. The results showed all vehicles fulfilled the exhaust gas regulation on running on CRC reference diesel fuel as well as on Diesel R33. HC and CO were reduced with Diesel R33 but NOx emissions were slightly increased. Non-regulated emissions such as carbonyls were found to have reduced. The mutagenicity of the exhaust gases can be reduced by using Diesel R33. These positive impacts were clearly observed only with the Euro 3 passenger car. Due to the overall low emission level, Euro 6 cars showed no significant changes in the non-regulated emissions or health effects. © 2016 SAE International.",,"Automobile engines; Biofuels; Diesel fuels; Exhaust gases; Exhaust systems (engine); Fleet operations; Greenhouse gases; Lubricating oils; Off road vehicles; Palm oil; Thermal processing (foods); Greenhouse gas (GHG); Light duty vehicles; Positive impacts; Regulated emissions; Sustainable mobility; Thermo-oxidative; Transport sectors; Used cooking oil; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019557092

We aim to understand long-term trends in community responses to cope with droughts, to explain how many preindustrial societies coevolved with local hydro-climatic dynamics and coped with climate extremes over time. The specific goals of this work are: (1) to analyze how local communities experienced droughts over long periods of time and (2) to document the spectrum of recorded community responses to drought. Our research covers over one century (1605-1710) of responses to drought in the community of Terrassa, Barcelona, Spain. Data were collected through archival research. We reviewed and coded 2076 village council minutes. Our results show that the local community adopted a mixture of symbolic, institutional, and infrastructural responses to drought and that drought-related decisions varied through time. We discuss adaptation strategies on the basis of the distinct physical signals of drought propagation and the role of nonclimatic historical factors, such as warfare and public debt, in shaping responses. We conclude that long-term perspectives on premodern history and comparable empirical studies are fundamental to advance our understanding of past social responses to hydro-climatic extremes. © 2016 by the author(s).","Adaptation; Drought; Early modern period; Environmental history","adaptive management; climate change; community response; documentary source; drought; environmental history; extreme event; global change; seventeenth century; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Terrassa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976530299

These provide a useful first estimate of natural, unaltered soil conditions before agricultural development, which are potentially important for many carbon-accounting schemes such as those prescribed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, carbon-turnover models such as RothC, and soil-condition monitoring programs. The modelling approach adopted included multiple linear regression and Cubist piecewise linear decision trees. It used 1690 soil profiles from undisturbed or only lightly disturbed native vegetation sites across all of eastern Australia, together with a range of covariates representing key soil-forming factors. The digital soil maps of pre-clearing SOC (% and mass) over New South Wales provide a more sophisticated alternative to currently available, equivalent maps. Independent validation of the SOC mass predictions over the top 30cm revealed a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.76, which was 13% higher than the currently used map. Total pre-clearing SOC stocks amount to 4.21Gt in the top 30cm, which compared with a current stock estimate of 3.68Gt, suggesting a total SOC loss of ∼0.53Gt over the entire state. The extent of SOC decline in both absolute and relative terms was found to be highly dependent on the climate, parent material and land use regime, reaching a maximum decline of 44.3t/ha or 50.0% relative loss in cooler (moist) conditions over mafic parent materials under regular cropping use. The models also provide valuable pedological insights into the factors controlling SOC levels under natural conditions.

Many decisions regarding energy and transportation infrastructures, buildings, sanitary and storm-water management, flood risk assessment and also biodiversity protection take place at the city level. In this context, climate change issues have been recognized as fundamental for urban planning, requiring an integrated response with combined mitigation and adaptation strategies. This paper develops an approach to assess some of the trade-offs between climate change vulnerability and mitigation options for the residential building stock of 29 Portuguese Municipalities, within the context of a comprehensive Municipal Adaptation Strategies Project, ClimAdaPT.Local. The paper presents a methodology to evaluate climate change vulnerability of the residential building stock regarding thermal comfort of the occupants, based on expected impacts from climate change measures and adaptive capacity. Moreover, the impact on climate change vulnerability is assessed as a function of a set of mitigation options taken at the building level aiming to explore whether it would be cost-effective to invest on mitigation or adaptation measures or both. Results are presented for the municipality of Cascais and major findings show the interplay between mitigation and adaptation measures which can be synergetic or antagonistic.

The ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecosystem services component of the assessment largely drew upon the findings of a transdisciplinary workshop aimed at developing technical input for the assessment, involving participants from diverse sectors. A small author team distilled and synthesized this and hundreds of other technical input to develop the key findings of the assessment. The process of developing and ranking key findings hinged on identifying impacts that had particular, demonstrable effects on the U.S. public via changes in national ecosystem services. Findings showed that ecosystem services are threatened by the impacts of climate change on water supplies, species distributions and phenology, as well as multiple assaults on ecosystem integrity that, when compounded by climate change, reduce the capacity of ecosystems to buffer against extreme events. As ecosystems change, such benefits as water sustainability and protection from storms that are afforded by intact ecosystems are projected to decline across the continent due to climate change. An ongoing, sustained assessment that focuses on the co-production of actionable climate science will allow scientists from a range of disciplines to ascertain the capability of their forecasting models to project environmental and ecological change and link it to ecosystem services; additionally, an iterative process of evaluation, development of management strategies, monitoring, and reevaluation will increase the applicability and usability of the science by the U.S. public. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA) 2015.","Author team; Climate change impact; Ecosystem service; Sustained assessment; Technical input",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067938054

The relationship between energy and urban structure provides a framework for discussing the role of urban planning to increase energy efficiency in cities by means of three in-depth case studies of medium-sized cities in Northern Europe: Eskilstuna in Sweden, Turku in Finland and Tartu in Estonia. In some ways these cities go ahead when it comes to their national climate and energy policies and aim to establish urban planning as an instrument to regulate and influence the city’s transition in a sustainable way. At the same time, the cities are constantly facing goal conflicts and limitations to their scope of action, which creates dilemmas in their strategic orientation and planning activities (e.g. regional enlargement and increased commuting vs. compact urban development). Finally, considering urban form and spatial structure along with the policy context as well as regional drivers and functional relations is suggested as a suitable approach for addressing the challenges of energy-efficient urban development. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Climate change; Energy efficiency; Northern Europe; Sustainable development; Urban form; Urban planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025451188

They are used to estimate real world fuel consumption as well as real world emissions. The latter has recently become more important with the stronger focus on green driving, resulting in much stricter emission regulations, while fuel consumption still remains one of the most important aspects in terms of economy and long term costs for the vehicle owner. However these cycles do not reflect the actual behaviour of the driver or regional influences (i.e. topography). Therefore, manufacturers have developed their own usage and test cycles and are able to extract data from the vehicle to analyse the individual driving behaviour and vehicle usage. Apart from that, Naturalistic Driving Observation (NDO) is interested in understanding the driver. Thus, methods are required to create individual driving cycles (or derive them from large sets of recorded data) that can be used to describe the behaviour of a single driver as well as a group. However, creating driving cycles “by hand” is time consuming and less effective due to the large amount of data. The paper presents the Individual Driving Cycle Builder (IDCB), a software tool that automatically creates an individual driving cycle based on individual driving data. The cycle construction process itself is based on the same method used to create the ARTEMIS driving cycles. To verify the IDCB method, 15 created cycles are compared against the original data as well as several standardised driving cycles.

Therefore, it is important that oil and gas be produced in a sustainable way during the next decades. This requires technology development to ensure that the environmental impact and pollution from these activities are minimal. The following aspects are being highlighted in this paper: • Development of projects with the minimum of impact on the environment and problems for local populations. • Sustainable drilling without the use of oil-based mud, and collection of all drilling waste during offshore drilling operations in the most environmentally sensitive areas. • Treatment of produced water, sand and minerals from the well stream to avoid pollution. • Limitation of flaring to be performed only when required for safety reasons. • Continuous checking of pipelines to ensure that gas pipelines are run within their actual pressure capacity and that oil pipelines are not leaking into rivers and lakes. • Provision of sufficient storage capacity for gas to ensure timely delivery of gas during high demand peaks. • Injection of CO2 into sealed underground formations where large quantities are produced, such as at LNG factories. • Optimization of production from existing fields to avoid huge amounts of oil and gas being left in place, following a 'hit and run' recovery plan. Furthermore, all primary energy sources need to be converted into end-user energy services known as mechanical work, electricity, heating and cooling. In the process of conversion, only a portion of the primary energy is transformed into the new form, while the rest remains unaltered and is lost. The various forms of energy services produced represent different values or qualities, e.g. heat holds an energy quality ranging from 0 and upwards, depending on the temperature difference which is utilized, as defined by the second law of thermodynamics. Energy efficiency in this context may also be defined as the ratio between energy quality output and input. Practically, all fossil fuels are converted into energy services via combustion and heat, i.e. the conversion efficiency is solely determined by temperatures, meaning that high-energy efficiency can only be obtained at large temperature differences, such as in power generation, while ordinary domestic heating will yield a very low efficiency. Given that some 30-40 % of all fossil fuels today are used for domestic heating, representing an end-user energy quality of (say) 1/10 of what is obtained in modern power generation, there is a large potential globally for energy efficiency improvements, not to mention the associated emission reductions. The obvious solution is to pay more attention to the second law of thermodynamics, i.e. to shift from direct combustion heating to thermodynamic principles, e.g. by the use of electrical-driven heat pumps and/or combined heat and power as another alternative. The objectives of this paper are to highlight how energy production could become more effective, thus leading to a reduction in pollution to land, sea and atmosphere and also to identify how energy production should be carried out to minimize the polluting effects. The goal is to provide a reminder that much can be gained with respect to the reduction of pollution by focusing on cleaner energy production. © 2016 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.","Efficiency; Electricity; Energy; Environment; Flaring; Pollution; Sustainable oil and gas production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070256220

This article reviews and compares the ventilation flow rates in residential buildings in various countries: the United States of America, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain. It also compares the requirements of these countries with the requirements of the Passivhaus construction standard, which is recommended by the European Union as an example of nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB). Furthermore, a model for a dwelling is created using TRNSYS software. First, simulations have been performed with the flow rates, ventilation strategies and envelope transmittance required by the regulations of each country. The cooling and heating demands have been obtained for representative cities in different climate zones. With these results, the impact of ventilation parameters in the heating demand of the proposed Spanish dwelling is analyzed. Secondly, the same dwelling has been simulated with the thermal envelope transmittance values recommended by the Passivhaus standard. The ventilation strategies of each country have been maintained. The influence of the ventilation can be observed uninfluenced by other design parameters. It is found that with the current ventilation strategies, the heating and cooling demand values required by Passivhaus can be reached in only a few warm climates. In other cases, the ventilation strategies will need to change, and heat recovery ventilation will be required. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climatic zones; European regulations; Passivhaus; Residential dwellings; Ventilation","Buildings; Heating; Housing; Neonatal monitoring; Waste heat; Climatic zone; European regulation; Passivhaus; Residential dwelling; Thermal comfort in dwellings; United States of America; Ventilation requirements; Zero energy building (ZEB); Ventilation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979900841

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi obtain carbon from host plants and contribute to the acquisition of mineral nutrients, mainly phosphorus. The presence of invasive plants has been identified as a soil disturbance factor, often conditioning the structure and function of soil microorganisms. Despite the investigation of many aspects related to the invasion of Acacia dealbata, the effect produced on the structure of AMF communities has never been assessed. We hypothesize that A. dealbata modifies the structure of AMF community, influencing the establishment and growth of plants that are dependent on these mutualisms. To validate our hypothesis, we carried out denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and also grew plants of Plantago lanceolata in pots using roots of native shrublands or from A. dealbata, as inoculum of AMF. Cluster analyses from DGGE indicated an alteration in the structure of AMF communities in invaded soils. After 15 weeks, we found that plants grown in pots containing native roots presented higher stemand root growth and also produced higher biomass in comparison with plants grown with A. dealbata inoculum. Furthermore, plants that presented the highest biomass and growth exhibited the maximum mycorrhizal colonization and phosphorus content. Moreover, fluorescence measurements indicated that plants grown with A. dealbata inoculum even presented higher photosynthetic damage.

As a tropical country, Sri Lanka consisted with different forest types having very high biomass and productivity. Variety of approaches have been developed to derive aboveground biomass by many scientists, however, methods differ in procedure, complexity and time requirement depending on the specific aim of these estimations. Currently, Remote Sensing (RS) is popular approach as a nondestructive method of biomass estimation since it can reduce the measurements and monitoring in the field to a considerable extent, minimizing the cost. This study focused to estimate above ground biomass of Montane Forests located in Horton Plains National Park and surrounding areas of Sri Lanka. Initially, field based biomass estimation was done by data collecting in 55 field sampling plots (size 30×30m). The forest stand parameters; diameter at breast height (dbh), total tree height, and canopy cover percentage, slope of land and GPS locations of each sampling plots were collected. Six allometric equations were used to estimate AGB using correlation with dbh and height data of the field sampled plots and observed the best fit models for the local conditions. The observed biomass data were correlated with Back Scatter Coefficient values (HH and HV) of ALOS PALSAR image; Vegetation Indices (VI) derived from Landsat 8 OLI image (Normalized Difference VI, Soil Adjusted VI, Advanced VI and Ratio VI) and land surface temperature generated form Landsat Thermal Infra-Red Sensor (TIRS) image. The relationship between satellite data and field estimated biomass was done by observing the Pearson's correlations through statistical analysis. The results observed, a positive linear correlation between field's estimated AGB and NDVI was relatively high compared to other VI's. There is a negative linear correlation observed in Back Scatter Coefficient with the AGB. The land surface temperature from the TIRS observed the strong correlation with forest canopy cover percentage rather than AGB of the forest. Accordingly, the average montane forest biomass content derived as follows; from NDVI (42 t/ha), backscatter HH (38 t/ha) and HV (32 t/ha) and TIRS (48 t/ha). The accuracy of the AGB estimation from remote sensing methods varies from 61-72 percent and this applications can be used for other forest types also to estimate AGB as a less time consuming, economical and non-destructive method.","Above ground biomass; Forest; Remote Sensing; Satellite images","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric temperature; Backscattering; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Nondestructive examination; Radar imaging; Radar signal processing; Remote sensing; Satellites; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Above ground biomass; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Diameter-at-breast heights; Forest; Land surface temperature; Measurements and monitoring; Normalized differences; Satellite images; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018436010

The lake chemistry recovered following the closure of the local smelter and major reductions (approximately 95%) in acid and metal emissions from other area smelters, leading to recolonization of the lake with fish and other biota. However, the littoral macrobenthos community remain severely impoverished. The catchment liming sustained improved stream water quality for 20 years after the initial aerial treatment and created a littoral zone hot spot for the recolonization of Hyalella azteca. Colonization at delta sites of untreated catchment drainage areas, in the same lake, were low and highly variable, and these sites appeared to be impacted from soil erosion and episodic release of acid and metals.

However, it has raised serious concerns that some ship designers might choose to lower the installed power to achieve EEDI requirements not accounting satisfactorily for ship safety. This has encouraged investigations addressing the ability of ship to maintain maneuverability in adverse sea states. The Interim Guidelines proposed in 2013, in IMO Res. MEPC.232 (65), recommend minimum propulsion power to maintain ship maneuvering ability in adverse weather conditions for bulk carriers and tankers. These guidelines are mainly based on statistical analysis and equilibrium analysis in a steady state. Today, most of the available tools and methods handle ship responses in waves by separating it into seakeeping and maneuvering. The present study investigates ship maneuverability by use of a recently developed time domain code which combines the sea-keeping and maneuvering equation to predict ship responses in waves. In this way, better insight into ship responses in adverse conditions is obtained. The numerical results presented in the study are validated by model tests. The limitations of the time-domain code are discussed and future research needs are pointed out.

These engines utilize diesel fuel that is imported at great expense and generate green-house gas (GHG) and pollutant emissions. Replacing diesel fuel in these engines by syngas derived from a thermo-chemical treatment of local renewable biomass can not only lower the fuel cost but also reduce GHG and pollutant emissions for remote communities. Besides, syngas-diesel dual fuel combustion can maintain the ability to revert back to diesel operation and therefore ensure reliable heat and power supply when syngas is not available. In this study, the combustion and emissions performance of a syngas-diesel dual fuel engine was investigated at low and medium loads. A single cylinder direct injection diesel engine was modified to operate using a dual fuel strategy. The diesel fuel was directly injected to the cylinder, while syngas was injected into the intake port. The effects of syngas fraction and composition on energy efficiency, cylinder pressure, exhaust temperature, and combustion stability were recorded and analyzed. The emissions data, including PM, NOx, CO, and unburned hydrocarbon, were also analyzed and reported in the paper. The results suggest that the substitution of diesel by a syngas caused a slight decrease in brake thermal efficiency and an increase in CO emissions. The effect of a syngas on soot emissions depended on the composition and/or quality. The inert component content of a syngas significantly affected NOx emissions in a syngas-diesel dual fuel internal combustion engine.

Sulfur dioxide (SD) emissions are shown to impact rainfall more strongly than black carbon (BC) aerosols, causing reduced rainfall especially over northern India. Significant perturbations due to BC are not noted until its emissions are scaled up in a sensitivity test, resulting in rainfall increases over northern India due to the elevated heat pump mechanism, enhancing convection during the premonsoon, and bringing forward the monsoon onset. Second, the impact of anthropogenic aerosols is compared to that of increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations and observed sea surface temperature (SST) warming. The tropospheric temperature gradient driving the monsoon shows weakening when forced by either SD or imposed SST trends. However, the observed SST trend is dominated by warming in the deep tropics; when the component of SST trend related to aerosol emissions is removed, further warming is found in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere that tends to offset monsoon weakening. This suggests caution is needed when using SST forcing as a proxy for greenhouse warming. Finally, aerosol emissions are decomposed into those from the Indian region and those elsewhere in pairs of experiments with SD and BC. Both local and remote aerosol emissions are found to lead to rainfall changes over India; for SD, remote aerosols contribute around 75% of the rainfall decrease over India, while for BC the remote forcing is even more dominant. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Aerosols; Atm/Ocean structure/phenomena; Climate change; Monsoons; Physical meteorology and climatology; Precipitation","Aerosols; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Precipitation (chemical); Sulfur dioxide; Surface waters; Anthropogenic aerosols; Black carbon aerosol; Greenhouse warming; Indian summer monsoon rainfall; Monsoons; Northern Hemispheres; Sea surface temperature (SST); Tropospheric temperature; Rain; aerosol; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climatology; meteorology; monsoon; precipitation intensity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991237164

Divider wall turbochargers have two exhaust gas inlets and twin scrolls with the divider cast wall connected. Turbochargers with divider wall feature could conserve an engine's exhaust pulse kinetic energy for great turbine wheel efficiency. It is widely used in 6-cylinder engine applications. Turbochargers with divider wall configuration operate in very hostile conditions with high temperature and great thermal gradient. Using thinner divider wall feature benefits aerodynamic performance, but with the configuration turbine housing may show cracks and large deformation during thermal cycling. In order to achieve the balance between mechanic and aerodynamic, design study of a reasonable divider wall is required. This paper first presents the initial design with thinner divider wall, which experienced severe cracking problem in the divider wall location during the engine thermal shock testing. In order to capture the failure mode at divider wall region, finite element analysis (FEA) with thermal mechanical fatigue (TMF) and creep interaction is performed. The simulation repeats the failure mode very well which shows this numerical analysis method is convincing and fast for further study. Base on the failure case and successful cases, TMF with creep interaction simulation criteria is proposed. The criteria could be used as the reference for the further design, and the design should be controlled within the criteria limit. Based on the methodology and the criteria, the new design is analyzed and the simulation result shows the risk is low. Engine thermal shock testing is done for the final validation. This design has acceptable cracks and no large deformation at divider wall location under the testing condition. TMF and creep interaction gives a right and fast methodology to capture the failure mode at divider wall. Meanwhile it provides a knowledge base for the turbine housing divider wall design. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.","Creep; Divider Wall; FEA.; TMF; Turbine Housing; Turbocharger","Aerodynamic configurations; Aerodynamics; Compressors; Cracks; Creep; Deformation; Engines; Failure modes; Finite element method; Gas turbines; Heat transfer; High temperature effects; Housing; Internal combustion engines; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Knowledge based systems; Numerical methods; Shock testing; Superchargers; Thermal shock; Turbines; Turbomachinery; Aero-dynamic performance; Divider Wall; Engine application; Interaction simulations; Performance requirements; Thermal mechanical fatigue; Turbine housings; Turbocharger; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991661145

The study also investigated farmers’ perceptions of contemporary forecasts and the reliability of both IKS and contemporary forecasts. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected among small holder farmers in Guruve District using household interviews and focus group discussions in three wards in the district, grouped according to their agro-climate into high and low rainfall areas. To get an expert view of the issues, key informant interviews were held with key agricultural extension personnel and traditional leaders. Findings – Results obtained showed show high dependence on IKS-based forecasts in the district. Over 80 per cent of the farmers used at least one form of IKS for short- and long-range forecasting, as they are easily understood and applicable to their local situations. Tree phenology, migration and behaviour of some bird species and insects, and observation of atmospheric phenomena were the common indicators used. Tree phenology was the most common with over 80 per cent of farmers using this indicator. While some respondents (60 per cent) viewed forecasts derived from IKS as more reliable than science-based forecasts, 69 per cent preferred an integration of the two methods. Originality/value – The simplicity and location specificity of IKS-based forecasts makes them potentially useful to smallholder farmers, climate scientists and policymakers in tracking change in these areas for more effective climate change response strategies and policymaking. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Indigenous knowledge systems; Rainfall season quality; Seasonal climate forecasts","agricultural extension; agricultural worker; climate change; climate prediction; environmental indicator; indigenous knowledge; knowledge based system; perception; phenology; policy making; precipitation quality; rainfall; smallholder; tree; weather forecasting; Zimbabwe; Aves; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971567653

We report the accuracy of using Landsat images for CC prediction in boreal forests validated with field reference plots (N = 250) covering large variation in latitude, forest structure, species composition, and site type. We tested two statistical models suitable for estimating CC: the beta regression (BetaReg) and random forest (RanFor). Landsat-based predictors utilized include individual bands, spectral vegetation indices (SVI), and Tasseled cap (Tass) features. Additionally, we tested an alternative model based on spectral mixture analysis (SMA). Finally, we carried out a first validation in boreal forests of the recently published Landsat Tree Cover Continuous (TCC) global product. Results showed simple BetaReg with red band reflectance provided the highest prediction accuracy (leave-site-out RMSECV 13.7%; R2CV 0.59; biasCV 0.5%). Spectral transformations into SVI and Tass did not improve accuracy. Including additional predictors did not significantly improve accuracy either. Nonlinear model RanFor did not outperform BetaReg. The alternative SMA model did not outperform the empirical models. However, empirical models cannot resolve the underestimation of high cover and overestimation of low cover.

Mitigation actions have also received more private sector funds as compared to adaptation. The current financial flows targeted at adaptation fall short of the current estimates for funding needs and call for increased private sector involvement and finance. This article discusses the mobilisation of private sector funds for climate change adaptation using experiences from the Nordic Climate Facility (NCF), a competitive partial grant facility, as a case study. Since its launch in 2009 NCF has approved financing for 49 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in selected developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The aim of this paper is to showcase, using selected NCF projects as examples, how adapting to climate change can also have business linkages, especially when combined with mitigation activities, and how public sector funding can be used to leverage private sector funds through local business development for climate change adaptation. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation; Business; Climate change; Climate finance; Private sector",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071389876

Locke Rd, Austin, TX  79734, United States","Together with the ongoing major instrument upgrade of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) we present the planned upgrade of the HET Segment Control System (SCS) to SCS2. Because HET's primary mirror is segmented into 91 individual 1-meter hexagonal mirrors, the SCS is essential to maintain the mirror alignment throughout an entire night of observations. SCS2 will complete tip, tilt and piston corrections of each mirror segment at a significantly higher rate than the original SCS. The new motion control hardware will further increase the system's reliability. The initial optical measurements of this array are performed by the Mirror Alignment Recovery System (MARS) and the HET Extra Focal Instrument (HEFI). Once the segments are optically aligned, the inductive edge sensors give sub-micron precise feedback of each segment's positions relative to its adjacent segments. These sensors are part of the Segment Alignment Maintenance System (SAMS) and are responsible for providing information about positional changes due to external inuences, such as steep temperature changes and mechanical stress, and for making compensatory calculations while tracking the telescope on sky. SCS2 will use the optical alignment systems and SAMS inputs to command corrections of every segment in a closed loop. The correction period will be roughly 30 seconds, mostly due to the measurement and averaging process of the SAMS algorithm. The segment actuators will be controlled by the custom developed HET Segment MOtion COntroller (SMOCO). It is a direct descendant of University Observatory Munich's embedded, CAN-based system and instrument control tool-kit. To preserve the existing HET hardware layout, each SMOCO will control two adjacent mirror segments. Unlike the original SCS motor controllers, SMOCO is able to drive all six axes of its two segments at the same time. SCS2 will continue to allow for sub-Arcsecond precision in tip and tilt as well as sub-micro meter precision in piston. These estimations are based on the current performance of the segment support mechanics. SMOCO's smart motion control allows for on-The-y correction of the move targets. Since SMOCO uses state-of-The-Art motion control electronics and embedded decentralized controllers, we expect reduction in thermal emission as well as less maintenance time. © 2016 SPIE.","Active optic; Can based array control; Decanic; Electronics minimazation; Het scs2; Microcontroller based motion control; Multi object spectrograph facility; Smoco","Airborne telescopes; Control systems; Decentralized control; Hardware; Inductive sensors; Mirrors; Motion control; Optical data processing; Pistons; Radio telescopes; Stresses; Active Optics; Decanic; Het scs2; Microcontroller-based; Multi-object spectrograph; Smoco; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001086101

Increasing the use of sustainably sourced wood in the construction could play a vital part in the transition towards eco-cities. In this paper an actual research project creates target values for cities regarding greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy and mass of renewable material for specific building plots. The proceedings and up-to-date results are shown in this paper. To achieve this, we studied life cycle assessments for different buildings. Wood as a building material is introduced for a minimal environmental footprint. The focus is set on linking the sale of building plots with the agreement to build primarily with wood. Target values for the buildings were developed in close cooperation with the city and are currently linked to tendering of the plots. The implementation of these values will be monitored in the near future.","Carbon storage; Environmental footprint; Life cycle analysis; Timber building","Carbon; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Planning; Timber; Wooden buildings; Building stocks; Carbon storage; Environmental footprints; Life cycle analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Primary energies; Renewable materials; Timber buildings; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010986646

Considering the complexity, uncertainties, and scale of possible global climate change (GCC) impacts, there is agreement that urban planning has the capacity to facilitate the development and implementation of adaptation as well as mitigation strategies. The land use planning system provides a framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions considerably by addressing central issues such as community design, transportation networks and use, and increasing development density. Planning can also play an important role in impacting public behavior, thus slowing the pace of GCC and allowing the development and implementation of adaptation measurements. The purpose of this article is to examine the important role of the planning profession in developing and successfully implementing mitigation and adaptation strategies. There is a growing sense that planning will receive increasing attention as an important policy instrument for addressing both the causes and impacts of climate change. This work also supports the argument that climate action plans can be a vital instrument in confronting the challenges of climate change and that planners need to be more involved in the development and implementation process of such plans. © 2016 by the author.","Adaptation; Global climate change; Mainstreaming; Mitigation; Urban planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011057051

Replacing furnace heating by heat pumps or district heat may also lead to problem. Also newly built attics have problems. The quite novel technical solution with controlled mechanical ventilation of the attic is generally estimated to be risk free in Swedish climate. With controlled mechanical ventilation the attic is intentionally ventilated only when the inflowing air is drying out the attic, otherwise it is shut off.

Gasoline engine downsizing is already established as a proven technology to reduce automotive fleet CO2 emissions. Additionally, alternative fuels such as natural gas, offer the potential to significantly reduce both tailpipe CO2 and other regulated exhaust gas emissions without compromising driving performance and driving range. This paper presents results showing how the positive fuel properties of natural gas can be fully utilised in a heavily downsized engine. The engine has been modified to cope with the significantly higher mechanical and thermal loads when operating at high specific outputs on compressed natural gas (CNG). In this study, peak cylinder pressures of up to 180 bar and specific power output levels of 110 kW/litre have been realised. It is also shown that having cylinder components specific to natural gas can yield significant reductions in fuel consumption, and, in conjunction with a variable geometry turbine, a port-fuelled CNG engine can achieve impressive low-speed torque (27 bar BMEP at 1500 rpm) and good transient response characteristics. The results achieved from the test engine whilst operating on CNG are compared to measurements from the baseline, gasoline-fueled, direction injection (GDI) engine. The potential CO2 savings offered by this heavily downsized CNG engine, of up to 50% at peak power and 20-40% for the drive-cycle region (including real driving emissions (RDE) testing), are presented and discussed.

Now that Acton is 15 years into the operation of the system, they have eliminated chronic septic system problems, captured targeted economic development, paid off more than half of the 30-year bonds, and built a $1 million sewer surplus. It was not easy. However, other municipalities can succeed as Acton did with the proper strategy, public and commercial support, and a long-term vision. For those communities who did not build sewer systems funded by the Clean Water Act in the late 1970s and 1980s, this success story is a model to approaching funding approvals, cash flow management, public outreach, and sewer capacity management. This presentation focuses on the financial structure and funding strategies that facilitated this massive accomplishment. It teaches practical approaches for any large-scale, multi-phased utility project, and it examines the roadmap and potential pitfalls encountered in this endeavor as well as the public consensus building and communication tactics that can be used to gain the support of local, state, and federal level stakeholders. It describes the critical issues for properly managing appropriations, state loans, and grants, all while managing the natural tensions between preservation and growth. The innovative use of grant funds, which Acton used to bridge required costs that are not typically covered by traditional funding sources, proved essential to the Town’s financial success. By attending this session, participants will understand how to build a multifaceted financial structure for utility capital costs and expansion costs and plan the funding of a fully “user-paid” utility project.

Their removal using microorganisms with multiple detoxification ability is being intensely sought as a cleaner and economic approach. Methods/Statistical analysis: A soil suspension was spread plated on a minimal salts media supplemented with molybdenum. Blue colonies, indicating molybdenum reduction was then screened for phenol and diesel degradation capabilities. Findings: A molybdenum-reducing bacterium locally isolated showed the ability to grow on phenol and diesel. The bacterium required pHs of between 5.8 and 6.3 and temperatures of between 30 and 40oC for optimal reduction. Among the carbon sources tested for supporting reduction, glucose was the best. A critical concentration of phosphate at just 5 mM was required, while molybdenum (sodium molybdate) was required between 15 and 25 mM. The absorption spectrum of the Mo-blue produced showed a characteristic maximum peak at 865 nm. The reduction of molybdenum was inhibited by the ions mercury, copper, chromium, lead and silver by 78.9, 78.4, 77.4, 53.5 and 36.8%, respectively. Analysis using phylogenetic analysis identifies the bacterium as Enterobacteriaceae bacterium strain DRY7. Growth on phenol and diesel as carbon sources showed that the optimal concentrations supporting growth was between 300 and 400 mg/L and between 300 and 500 mg/L, respectively. Application/Improvements: The capacity of this bacterium to detoxify a number of toxicants is an important property or bioremediation of soils contaminated with multiple toxicants.","Bioremediation; Detoxification; Diesel; Enterobacteriaceae; Molybdenum; Phenol",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979737457

The PM2.5 amounts are within WHO limits in the absence of natural dust storms. Elemental composition and phase identification of major pollutants were determined. In the absence of dust storms, fossil fuel burning originating from traffic and energy generation are the major sources of PM2.5 in the form of secondary phases formed from gaseous precursors. Primary pollutants such as quartz, calcite and gypsum and sea salts are the main pollutants during dusty days. Natural sources such as sea salts and crustal materials also contribute to PM2.5 both as primary sources and through interaction with anthropogenic emissions to form new secondary phases depending on factors such as the ambient conditions and primary pollutants. Integration of different techniques provided us with a better understanding of sources of pollutants and their interaction during their transport in the atmosphere. Reduction of major secondary pollutants in PM2.5 has already been observed through various clean energy initiatives in the country and by implementing green building codes and enforcing strict regulations on industrial emissions. © Avestia Publishing, 2017.","Aerosol; Air pollution; Dust storms; PM2.5; UAE; XRD; XRF anthropogenic emissions",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045004923

Whipstocks are set deep in the 9 5/8-in. casing, after which the 8 3/8-in. and 5 7/8-in. holes are drilled to access the target Lower Carbonate and Sand reservoirs. Deeper kickoffs also avoid contact across the water-bearing Carbonate A, aiming for displacement across Carbonate B or C reservoirs. Isolation from Carbonate A is important for multistage fracturing completions as they are still not proven for the long-Term isolation of water-bearing zones. Regardless of the deeper whipstock setting, the high dogleg requirements exceed the capabilities of conventional rotary steerable systems (RSS). Conventional steerable motors with high-bend housing and 70 to 80% of the sliding mode of drilling has been the only option to achieve such high dogleg severity (DLS/100ft). Drilling medium-radius wells with a conventional motor assembly requires multiple runs, wiper trips to clean the hole, and multiple reaming trips before running the liner. These operations result in poor drilling efficiency due to slow penetration rates and bit trips. A high build rate rotary steerable system (HRSS) was introduced as a solution for such challenges in the 8 3/8-in. and 5 7/8-in. sections. While the HRSS technology has been used before, this was the first time the HRSS kicked off vertically from a whipstock in Saudi Arabia or worldwide. The new technology allowed the kickoff point to be pushed further into the Sudair formation near the Sudair dolomite, reducing the risk from Jilh pressure and associated cost. The step change provided the option to slim the hole by eliminating the 8 3/8in. hole size, and kickoff was done in the 7-in. liner. Deployment of the HRSS allowed directly kicking off from a whipstock set vertically, eliminating the need for a dedicated steerable motor assembly run. Direct kickoff also meant eliminating the need for gyro tool for steerability, because conventional RSS tools could only be used outside the zone of magnetic interference, once sufficient separation from the mother bore was achieved. Consistent doglegs of more than 14°/100 ft were recorded; and the maximum dogleg was 17.44°/100 ft. Since then, this concept has been applied to other vertical re-entry wells and at an existing inclinations successfully in the 8 3/8-in. and 5 7/8-in. sections in Saudi Arabia and worldwide. The scope of the paper is limited to wells in Saudi Arabian deep gas wells only. The average rate of penetration (ROP) across this build section shows a 137% improvement over the ROP for conventional motor bottom-hole assemblies (BHA) for similar build sections. Eliminating the 8 3/8-in. section, avoiding the hazards of drilling in Jilh and Sudair formations, saving the motor trip to kick off from the whipstock, and improving ROP resulted in significant savings. This step change in drilling performance was realized by a thorough understanding of local drilling conditions and indepth analysis that enabled efficient execution. © Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Boreholes; Bottom-hole assembly; Carbonation; Efficiency; Natural gas wells; Oil well drilling; Petroleum engineering; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Rotating machinery; Well workover; Conventional motors; Dog leg severities; Drilling efficiency; Drilling performance; In-depth analysis; Magnetic interference; Multistage fracturing; Rotary steerable systems; Well drilling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994728095

From an individual vehicle standpoint however, the GHG reduction can vary significantly depending on the type of driving that the vehicle is used for. This is primarily due to conventional vehicles (CVs) having poor energy efficiency in stop-and-go city-like driving compared to their performance in steady highway-like driving. This study attempts to examine the magnitude of the differential in GHG reduction benefit for real driving behaviors obtained from California Household Travel Survey (CHTS-2013). Recorded vehicles speed traces are analyzed via a fuel economy simulator then a hybrid support vector clustering (SVC) technique is applied to form groups of vehicle samples with similar driving behaviors. Unlike many clustering techniques, SVC does not impose a pre-dictated number of clusters, but has a number of parameters that must be tuned in order to obtain meaningful results. Tuning of the parameters is performed via a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) after formulating the cluster tuning as a two-objective problem that seeks to maximize: i) differential benefit in GHG reduction, and ii) fraction of the population that groups of vehicles represent. Results show that replacing a CV with its equivalent hybrid (HEV) can reduce GHG emissions per mile of driving by 2 to 2.5 times more for a group of vehicles (best opportune for an EDV) compared to the less opportune group. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.","Electric drive vehicles; Greenhouse gas; Hybrid vehicles; Multi-objective optimization; Support vector clustering","Cluster analysis; Computer aided design; Design; Electric drives; Energy efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Multiobjective optimization; Reduction; Static Var compensators; Transportation; Tuning; Vehicles; Clustering techniques; Driving behavior; Electric-drive vehicles; Greenhouse gas reductions; Household travel surveys; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Number of clusters; Support vector clustering; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008149996

In this study, the air quality modeling system RAMS-CMAQ with zero-out sensitivity test was applied to conduct source sensitivity approaches of PM2.5 for four source categories (industry, power plants, transport, and residential) over the North China Plain (NCP) in January and July of 2013. The results show that the residential and industry emission sector were the greatest contributors to domain-wide PM2.5 in January and July, respectively. The largest variation could exceed 200 μg m−3 attributed to the residential sector in January when a heavy pollution period appeared, and could reach 40–60 μg m−3 attributed to the industry sector in July in the heavy pollution area, respectively. The nonlinear relationship between the secondary pollutant formation and its precursors was reflected by this source sensitivity approaches, as the summation of the secondary pollutant variations attributed to the four sources was obviously different from the simulated baseline concentration and the mass burden of nitrate would increase upon removal of the power plants or transport emission sector in the heavy pollution regions in January. Further analysis indicated that the improvement of atmospheric oxidation capacity due to emission sector removal coupled with the sufficient precursor nitrogen oxide under severe pollution background should be the main reason of the negative variation of nitrate appeared in the sensitivity test. This feature indicates that the atmospheric oxidation capacity is an important impact factor in determining the production rate of nitrate formation, and could further influence the variation feature of PM2.5 mass burden during the pollution episode. Thus, it is suggested that the comprehensive pollution control strategies should be implemented based on the specific pollution condition. Additionally, the nonlinearity of secondary pollutants formation should be reasonably considered for developing effective emission control strategies. © 2015 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","CMAQ; Emission control; North China Plain; PM2.5; Source sensitivity approaches",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995771995

Following the balanced mix design concept mixture tests were selected to address rutting resistance after short-term aging and durability after long-term aging. The test selected were the Hamburg Wheel Tracking (HWT) test, the semi-circular bend (SCB) test at intermediate temperature and the disc-shaped compact tension (DC(T)) test at low pavement temperatures. Asphalt binder extraction and grading from aged mix was also required. The focus of this paper is to summarize the mixture performance test and recovered binder data gathered during the pilot project on STH 77 in Ashland County, Wisconsin; suggest modifications to the SCB test procedure; and present accelerated aging protocols for continued use of performance testing in practice. Semi-circular bend test results collected during the project at 25°C did not relate well to values published in the literature or show adequate sensitivity to changes in mix properties. The effects of test temperature and an alternative analysis method are presented. Based on the results recommendations include use of a climate based approach for test temperature selection and inclusion of post peak analysis to better discriminate between mix composition and aging conditions. Accelerated long-term aging protocols involving loose mix aging at 135°C for 12 and 24 hours are compared to AASHTO R 30 compacted mix aging using recovered binder and mixture fracture properties. Results found that 12 hour loose mix aging produced similar recovered binder grading to AASHTO R 30, whereas the effect of aging on mixture fracture tests was inconclusive. The relationship between laboratory and field aging is investigated through comparison of field cores to laboratory aged plant produced mix from a project constructed in southeast Minnesota in 2006. Lastly, the laboratory performance of the high recycled and conventional mix designs are compared on the basis of mixture cracking resistance and recovered asphalt binder properties after extended aging. The high recycle mix exhibited equal or better performance relative to the conventional mix across alt selected performance tests. This comparative analysis also provides an example of how the inclusion of performance testing can influence the materials selection process and produce test results indicative of improved overall performance of the mix. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Cracking resistance; Durability; High RAP; Performance testing","Asphalt; Asphalt mixtures; Asphalt pavements; Binders; Bins; Cracks; Durability; Fracture; Fracture testing; Grading; Materials testing; Mixtures; Recovery; Recycling; Software testing; Cracking resistance; Department of Transportation; Hamburg Wheel Tracking; High RAP; Intermediate temperatures; Laboratory performance; Performance testing; Production monitoring; Aging of materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018282692

Promoting the use of natural gas vehicles is considered as one of the most important strategies towards sustainable transportation. China made remarkable progress in promoting natural gas vehicles over recent years, and its 4.6 million natural gas vehicles in 2014 represented the world׳s largest natural gas vehicle fleet. In this paper, the development of natural gas vehicles in China is reviewed based on a triple-perspective (Fuel-Vehicle-Infrastructure) technical–economical framework. The review indicates that (a) pricing of vehicle-use Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is essential in determining natural gas vehicle development. A pricing principle similar to the fixed CNG/gasoline price ratio (0.75:1) should be applied to LNG/diesel price ratio; (b) for CNG passenger vehicles, the modified CNG vehicles, with ¥3000–5000 additional cost, is more attractive to consumers than originally manufactured CNG vehicles, with about ¥10,000 additional cost. Vehicle retrofit should be permitted by the government with the precondition that retrofit standards are strictly enforced; (c) for CNG/LNG transit buses, the deployment is strongly affected by local government׳s preference. In regions with sufficient natural gas supply, the government should prioritize the deployment of CNG/LNG transit buses rather than other technologies; (d) for LNG commercial vehicles, with ¥60,000–80,000 higher cost than their counterpart diesel vehicles, financial incentive is critical for their development. China׳s current vehicle subsidy scheme should be extended to cover LNG commercial vehicles; (e) regarding refueling infrastructures, interference with urban land-use planning and long-time administrative approval are the major barriers. Local governments should launch dedicated plans and strategies to support the further deployment of CNG/LNG refueling infrastructures. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Compressed Natural Gas (CNG); Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Natural gas pricing; Natural gas vehicle; Refueling infrastructure","Air pollution; Automobile manufacture; Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Commercial vehicles; Compressed natural gas; Costs; Economics; Fleet operations; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel purification; Gas supply; Gases; Land use; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas; Natural gas transportation; Retrofitting; Vehicles; Additional costs; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Financial incentives; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Local government; Natural gas pricing; Passenger vehicles; Sustainable transportation; Natural gas vehicles",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979775121

Incomplete combustion of hydro-carbon fuel/s produce very large amount of harmful emission gases resulting into smog in cities &amp; reduces performance of the system. These systems, equipped with Internal Combustion or External combustion produces large amount of exhaust gases CO, HC and NOx like monoxides etc. Since hazardous emissions which are harmful to human life and ecosystem resulting in many types of diseases of human especially in urban areas where automobile vehicle equipped with IC engine density is very high. These emissions have effect on result in environmental cycles also. In today's globalised world, many attempts are made to reduce intensity of hazardous emissions of an IC engine through pre processing of fuels and post processing combustion exhaust gases in IC engine by many means like MPFI, PCV, EGR , catalytic converter, supercharger, turbocharger, etc. In order to handle, these issues, additional attempt is made. This attempt uses Air conditioner/Energizer for Pre-processing air and unit developed called as Magnetic air Conditioner (MAC). A permanent magnet, magnetic air conditioner (MAC) is mounted in path of air lines. Mounting MAC in air line enhances quality of air and air molecules properties like it aligns and orientations, especially in an oxygen molecule. Better atomization of an oxygen molecule which further enters into combustion chambers of SI engine along with air. In a conventional four stroke spark Ignited engine , oxygen molecules reacts with hydro -carbon ,which assist for complete combustion of hydro-carbon. Use of such Magnetic air conditioners improves performance of SI engine. The specific fuel consumption also decreases, resulting in to decrease in BSFC with increase in load. Use of MAC in engine also reduces emissions like CO, HC, ultimately resulting into reduction in smog in urban areas. The present article describes the mechanism of MAC, objectives and its effect on SI engine, such as enhanced performance parameter, various efficiencies like mechanical, brake thermal, volumetric saving in fuel, and reduced emission. One case study is presented in which ferrite magnets are used as MAC which improves performance and reduces emissions.

The study utilised an array of approaches, including participatory scenario building, GIS modelling and economic evaluation. Based on a participatory input by local stakeholders, four adaptation scenarios were created, formulating various possibilities of future development in the area as well as potential vulnerabilities and adaptation needs. The scenarios subsequently served as the basis for biophysical modelling of the impacts of adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures on the provision of ecosystem services with the InVEST modelling suite, focusing on climate regulation, water quality and hydropower production. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted, quantifying management and investment costs of each adaptation scenario, and benefits originating from the provision of previously modelled regulating ecosystem services, together with a supplementary selection of provisioning services. This study serves as an example of combining stakeholder views, biophysical modelling and economic valuation in the cost-benefit analysis of ecosystem-based adaptation and disaster risk reduction, which provides the opportunity to find shared solutions for the adaptation of social-ecological systems to global change. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Climate change; Cost-benefit analysis; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Participatory scenarios",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014027560

The physical processes are largely understood when exciton formation and recombination lead to the magnetic field effects. Recently, magnetic field effects in some co-evaporated blends have shown that exciplexes deliver even larger responses. In either case, the magnetic field effects arise from some spin-mixing mechanism and spin-selective processes in either the exciton formation or the exciplex recombination. Precise control of light output is not possible when the spin mixing is either due to hyper-fine fields or differences in the Lande g-factor. We theoretically examine the optical output when a patterned magnetic film is deposited near the OLED. The fringe fields from the magnetic layers supply an additionally source of spin mixing that can be easily controlled. In the absence of other spin mixing mechanisms, the luminescence from exciplexes can be modified by 300%. When other spin-mixing mechanisms are present, fringe fields from remanent magnetic states act as a means to either boost or reduce light emission from those mechanisms. Lastly, we examine the influence of spin decoherence on the optical output. © 2016 SPIE.","Magnetic field effects; Magnetic patterning; Organic light emitting diodes; Organic magnetoresistance; Organic semiconductors; Thermally assisted delayed uorescence","Excitons; Light; Luminescence; Magnetic domains; Magnetic field effects; Mixing; Semiconducting organic compounds; Semiconductor diodes; Exciton formation; Magnetic patterning; Mixing mechanisms; Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs); Organic magnetoresistance; Patterned Magnetic Films; Selective process; Thermally assisted delayed uorescence; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006284994

We have a European Union (EU) wide focus, and from this deduce what recommendations could be provided for countries intending to encourage e-mobility in the near future. For this task we integrate two in-house models of the vehicle fleet and market developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre. Our main policy conclusion is that although ambitious policy may lead to great improvements in specific efficiency and emissions, second order effects could lead to increased passenger car activity, limiting the overall emission improvement achieved. Therefore, any policy portfolio requires not only technological policies (aimed at both users and manufacturers), but also would need to address wider mobility patterns in an integrated approach. As such not only do we present findings relevant for policy decision making but also contribute to methodological approaches regarding the use and integration of modelling tools in support to policy design. © 2016 The Authors.","electro-mobility; emissions; energy; modelling",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991670296

The three areas covered are the Aarhus Convention, which is probably the clearest example of international treaty obligations in a domestic context, the EU chemicals regime, REACH, and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which implements the international Kyoto Protocol, and now the Paris Agreement, in the EU. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters (Aarhus Convention) consists of three pillars, access to environmental information, participation in the environmental decision-making process, and access to environmental justice. Under the REACH regime, EU manufacturers and importers are required to share certain data for the purposes of registering REACH chemical substances with the ECHA. The EU ETS has not been a runaway success, mainly because it has not been possible to achieve a good price for carbon. This is in part due to the economic downturn, but also to overgenerous allocation of free EU allowances (EUAs). In July 2015, the European Commission published a draft directive amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emissions reductions and low carbon investments, which will implement a number of changes to the EU ETS for Phase IV. In October 2015, the (EU) Council Decision on the creation of a market stability reserve (MSR) for the EU ETS was published. The MSR will automatically adjust the annual supply of EUAs to be auctioned, either downwards or upwards, if the total number of EUAs in circulation is outside a predefined range.",,"decision making; emission control; emissions trading; environmental legislation; European Commission; European Union; international agreement; international law; international organization; Kyoto Protocol; law enforcement; local participation; transboundary cooperation; United Nations; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010902417

Indonesia’s geographic and geological characteristics are also easily affected by climate change, natural disasters (earthquakes and tsunamis), and extreme weather (long drought and floods). Its urban areas also have high pollution levels. Much evidence can be seen, ranging from an increase in global temperature, variable season changes, extremely long droughts, high incidences of forest fires, and crop failures. This paper describes some evidences of climate change in Indonesia to weather disasters such as floods, landslides, and drought, burden of vector-borne diseases, air pollution from transportation and forest fires, and reemerging and newly emerging diseases. An evidence of health related to climate is based on a vulnerability assessment for dengue fever. To respond to its negative impacts to human, the health adaptation strategy and efforts undertaken in Indonesia nowadays include the following: to increase awareness of health consequences of climate change, to strengthen the capacity of health systems to provide protection from climate-related risks and substantially reduce health system’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to ensure that health concerns are addressed in decisions to reduce risks from climate change in other key sectors. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Adaptation strategy; Climate change; Health impact; Vulnerability assessment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031718111

However, this demand arises not solely due to increased passenger numbers but also due to the need of replacing current aircraft as a consequence of their increasing service life. Since fuel consumption accounts for about onethird of operating costs, airlines need efficient jet engines to meet reduced noise emissions and fuel consumption demands in order to withstand international cost pressures. The development of new aircraft types focuses on the aspect of weight reduction. The aerospace industry is characterized not only by innovations in material science and technology, but also by increased integral construction of individual components for the sake of weight reduction. Integral components are characterized by deep cavities and consist of difficult-to-cut materials to achieve weight reduction, presenting challenges for manufacturing technology. The most commonly encountered manufacturing technology for integral components is high performance cutting (HPC), using tools with a large overhang, whereby the process chain consists of two stages: roughing and finishing. However, manufacturing of integral components pushes HPC milling to its productivity limits. The interaction between work piece and end mill in the form of radial cutting forces leads to tool deflection and therefore limits the manufacturing of deep cavities. The present experimental study contributes to the analysis of tool deflection in the end milling of integral components, e.g., a blade integrated disk made of titanium for the aerospace industry. The goal is to identify and describe tool deflection during milling and to analyze its interdependence with form deviation, as well as the local and global tool load. A dynamometer is used to measure the global load on the tool and an experimental setup is designed and implemented to measure tool deflection and to identify the influence of the tool holder on total tool deflection. To determine tool deflection, the tool's stiffness is determined by a reference measurement. Tool stiffness is utilized to determine tool deflection during the process and the results are illustrated for a range of technology parameters and tool wear. Tool deflection leads to a form deviation of the finished component as well as to changing contact conditions of the cutting edge, leading to increased tool wear. This study aims at providing a basic understanding of the relationship between milling force, tool deflection and form deviation under the influence of technology parameters and tool wear.

The paper explores the optimal dimensioning of heat storages, heat pumps and solar collectors. In order to do this, we perform the optimal hourly scheduling of heat production and storage in the DH network of Järvenpää and Tuusula (78,000 inhabitants) in Southern Finland in 2050. These results are used to find the most cost effective combinations of the aforementioned district heating technologies. The studied DH network includes both CHP plant, fired mainly by biomass and heat only boilers. As future electricity prices are highly sensitive to the future shares of wind power and PV, we study three different scenarios with varying shares of wind power and PV (40% and 60%) in 2050. When the impacts of different system components were analyzed separately, it was found that a small heat storage is not a profitable investment but a larger heat storage (100,000 - 110,000 m3) is economical. In addition, the results indicate that the most economical size for a heat pump is around 20 – 25 MW. Yet, the most profitable solution was to include both a heat storage and a heat pump in the DH system. According to our results, solar collector was not a profitable investment in the studied DH system. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","District Heat; Heat Pump; Renewable Energy; Thermal Energy Storage",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084245462

The team leveraged a reanalysisderived database to estimate the wind and solar power resources and their interannual variability under current climate conditions (1985-2005). Then, a projected future climate database for the time range of 2040-69 was derived on the basis of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) regional climate model (RCM) simulations driven by free-running atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. To compare current and future climate variability, the team developed a baseline by decomposing the current climate reanalysis database into self-organizing maps (SOMs) to determine the predominant modes of variability. The current climate patterns found were compared with those of an NARCCAP-based future climate scenario, and the CRCM-CCSM combination was chosen to describe the future climate scenario. The future climate scenarios' data were projected onto the Climate Four Dimensional Data Assimilation reanalysis SOMs. The projected future climate database was then created by resampling the reanalysis on the basis of the frequency of occurrence of the future SOM patterns, adjusting for the differences in magnitude of the wind speed or solar irradiance between the current and future climate conditions. Comparison of the changes in the frequency of occurrence of the SOM modes between current and future climate conditions indicates that the annual mean wind speed and solar irradiance could be expected to change by up to 10% (increasing or decreasing regionally). © 2016 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate models; Climatology; Conformal mapping; Database systems; Electric power system interconnection; Self organizing maps; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Wind; Wind effects; Atmosphere ocean general circulation models; Four-dimensional data assimilation; Future climate scenarios; National center for atmospheric researches; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Regional climate changes; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Self organizing maps(soms); Climate change; annual variation; climate conditions; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; computer simulation; regional climate; solar power; wind power; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958753732

The AACC project team developed a database of educational resources which provided educators with regional information related to animal agriculture and climate change. The AACC project team is comprised of Extension specialists from six Land-Grant Universities in partnership with the Livestock and Poultry Environmental Learning Center (LPELC). Team members from five different US regions (Southeast, Northeast, Midwest, Southwest, and Western U.S.) developed regionally-relevant educational materials, hosted workshops and conferences, and collaborated with key stakeholder organizations to disseminate climate change information. Nationally, the AACC team administered a comprehensive online course for Extension educators and technical service providers who serve livestock and poultry producers, and collaborated with the Livestock and Poultry Environmental Learning Center's Waste-to-Worth conferences to facilitate international involvement. The online course includes modules on climate and weather trends, and climate change impacts and adaptation, risk management, climate science, sources and mitigation of greenhouse gases, regulation and carbon marketing, and communication strategies.

As a typical coal resource-exhausted city and a node city of the South-to-North Water Transfer East Route Project in China, Zaozhuang City's water resources management faces multiple constraints such as transformation of economic development, restriction of groundwater exploitation, and improvement of water environment. In this paper, we develop a linear optimization model by input-output analysis to study water resources management with the introduction of three advanced sewage treatment technologies for pollutant treatment and reclaimed water production. The simulation results showed that from 2014 to 2020, Zaozhuang City will realize an annual GDP growth rate of 7.1% with an annual chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions reduction rate of 5.5%. The proportion of primary industry, secondary industry, and tertiary industry would be adjusted to 5.6%, 40.8%, and 53.6%, respectively. The amount of reclaimed water supply could be increased by 91% and groundwater supply could be decreased by 6%.

The main component in the films prepared at lower CH4-Ar ratios (&lt;5%) was Be2C, while hydrocarbon (CH) films were formed at higher CH4-Ar ratios (&gt;15%). The films exhibited a nanocomposite structure consisting of Be2C nanocrystals (3 to 5 nm in size) embedded in amorphous hydrocarbon matrices. A smooth surface and columnar structure on the cross-sectional view were revealed.

However, recent advances in process design and cost reduction have resulted in smallscale GTL systems profitable at gas flows of 110,000 to 540,000 Nm3/d (4-20 MMcf/d). Small-scale GTL units are now an attractive option for monetizing associated petroleum gas that would otherwise be flared. This paper describes the application of a smallscale GTL solution for flared gas monetization, and details the process design, feed gas requirements, and liquid product specifications. To address the problem of oilfield flared gas, a standard, modular lump-sum GTL system has been developed to convert flows as small as 110,000 Nm3/d (4 MMcf/d) of wellhead associated gas into high quality gasoline (a.k.a. petrol). The system accepts a wide range of wellhead gas types without modification, for example wet or dry gas, and gas with up to 25% CO2 content are suitable feedstocks. The unit utilizes the STG+™ process, which features a series of fixed bed catalytic reactors that convert gas into petrol in a single gas phase closed loop via syngas, methanol and dimethyl ether intermediates. Process water and unreacted light gases are recycled within the system, minimizing hydrocarbon loss and the need for wastewater treatment. The resulting petrol product can be sold into the regional fuel market or mixed in with the crude oil onsite for simpler logistics. Compliance with antiflaring regulations, monetization of associated gas, reduction of CO2 emission, and increased liquid output are achieved via implementation of the GTL system. This standardization of small-scale GTL technology as a cost effective modular unit enables distributed deployment directly at the wellhead that was previously not possible with traditional larger scale GTL technology.

Conceptualisations of human-nature relations must recognise both human power and its embeddedness within material relations. Hope is a risky and complex process of possibility that carries painful emotions; it is something to be practised rather than felt. As centralised governmental solutions regarding climate change appear insufficient, intellectual and practical resources can be derived from everyday understandings and practices.

This panel recognized the multidisciplinary nature of space-based Earth observations and the value of coordinating international Earth observation efforts to benefit society. Accordingly, the original function of CEOS was to coordinate and harmonize Earth observations to make it easier for the user community to access and utilize data. CEOS initially focused on interoperability, common data formats, the intercalibration of instruments, and common validation and intercomparison of products. Since the inception of CEOS, the circumstances surrounding the collection and use of space-based Earth observations have changed. The number of Earth-observing satellites has vastly increased. As of January 2016, CEOS Agencies operate over 130 Earth observing space missions. Onboard instruments are more complex, and are capable of collecting new types of data in ever-growing volumes. The user community has expanded and become more diverse, as different data types become available and new applications for Earth observations are developed. Users have become more organized, forming several international bodies that coordinate and levy Earth observation requirements. In response to this changing environment, CEOS has also evolved, becoming more complex, and expanding the number and scope of its activities. In addition to its original charge, CEOS now focuses on validated requirements levied by external organizations, works closely with other satellite coordinating bodies (e.g., the Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites [CGMS]), and continues its role as the primary forum for international coordination of space-based Earth observations. CEOS has played an influential role in the establishment and ongoing development of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Indeed, CEOS coordinates the GEOSS space segment.

From studies across 15 Pacific island nations, a key barrier to improving national resilience to disaster risks and climate change impacts has been identified as a lack of capacity and expertise resulting from the absence of sustainable accredited and quality assured formal training programmes in the disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation sectors. In the 2016 UNISDR Science and Technology Conference on the Implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, it was raised that most of the training material available are not reviewed either through a peer-to-peer mechanism or by the scientific community and are, thus, not following quality assurance standards. In response to these identified barriers, this paper focuses on a call for accredited formal qualifications for capacity development identified in the 2015 United Nations landmark agreements in DRR and CCA and uses the Pacific Islands Region of where this is now being implemented with the launch of the Pacific Regional Federation of Resilience Professionals, for DRR and CCA. A key issue is providing an accreditation and quality assurance mechanism that is shared across boundaries. This paper argues that by using the United Nations landmark agreements of 2015, support for a regionally accredited capacity development that ensures all countries can produce, access and effectively use scientific information for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The newly launched Pacific Regional Federation of Resilience Professionals who work in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation may offer a model that can be used more widely. © The Author(s) 2016.","Accreditation; Capacity development; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; Training","accreditation; climate change; disaster; human; model; Pacific islands; quality control; risk reduction; United Nations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009499868

This document has four sections. Section 1 covers the ecology and silvics of yellow-cedar, as well as other background information. Section 2 outlines knowledge on the extensive mortality to yellow-cedar, including the role of climate. Section 3 describes opportunities for the conservation and active management of yellow-cedar on lands that are considered either suitable or unsuitable for yellow-cedar. Section 4 uses risk models and yellow-cedar distribution data to evaluate, quantify, and map areas of habitat suitability for yellow-cedar, both now and predicted through the year 2100. Yellow-cedar at risk of forest decline by the end of the century varies considerably by geography in coastal Alaska. Some areas are already heavily affected by decline, and risk is not expected to increase appreciably. Other areas are currently unaffected but are expected to develop decline. Still other areas are expected to remain healthy. This report provides a vulnerability assessment and the scientific foundation for conservation and active management of yellow-cedar on suitable and vulnerable lands. Specific management considerations are presented regionally and for 33 separate geographic zones where yellow-cedar grows in coastal Alaska. © 2016, USDA Forest Service.

The authors argue that the natural distribution, obtained from an ensemble of trajectories differing solely in their initial conditions, of the snapshot attractor corresponding to a particular forcing scenario should be determined in order to quantify internal variability and to characterize any instantaneous state of the system in the future. Furthermore, as a simple measure of internal variability of any particular variable of the model, the authors suggest using its instantaneous ensemble standard deviation. These points are illustrated with the intermediatecomplexity climate model Planet Simulator forced by a CO2 scenario, with a 40-member ensemble. In particular, the leveling off of the time dependence of any ensemble average is shown to provide a much clearer indication of reaching a steady state than any property of single time series. Shifts in ensemble averages are indicative of climate changes. The dynamical character of such changes is illustrated by hysteresis-like curves obtained by plotting the ensemble average surface temperature versus the CO2 concentration. The internal variability is found to be the most pronounced on small geographical scales. The traditionally used 30-yr temporal averages are shown to be considerably different from the corresponding ensemble averages. Finally, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, related to the teleconnection paradigm, is also investigated. It is found that the NAO time series strongly differs in any individual realization from each other and from the ensemble average, and climatic trends can be extracted only from the latter. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Atm/Ocean Structure/Phenomena; Circulation/Dynamics; Climate change; Climate variability; Ensembles; Forcing; Models and modeling; Nonlinear dynamics; North Atlantic Oscillation; Physical meteorology and climatology","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climatology; Dynamics; Time series; Climate variability; Ensembles; Forcing; Intermediate complexity; Internal variability; Natural distribution; North Atlantic oscillations; Surface temperatures; Climate models; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric dynamics; atmospheric structure; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; conceptual framework; ensemble forecasting; North Atlantic Oscillation; probability; teleconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957711819

In response to these changes, studies concerning indigenous knowledge (IK) and climate change vulnerability, resiliency, and adaptation have increased dramatically in recent years. Risks to lives and livelihoods are often the focus of adaptation research; however, the cultural dimensions of climate change are equally important because cultural dimensions inform perceptions of risk. Furthermore, many Arctic and Subarctic IK climate change studies document observations of change and knowledge of the elders and older generations in a community, but few include the perspectives of the younger population. These observations by elders and older generations form a historical baseline record of weather and climate observations in these regions. However, many indigenous Arctic and Subarctic communities are composed of primarily younger residents. We focused on the differences in the cultural dimensions of climate change found between young adults and elders. We outlined the findings from interviews conducted in four indigenous communities in Subarctic Alaska. The findings revealed that (1) intergenerational observations of change were common among interview participants in all four communities, (2) older generations observed more overall change than younger generations interviewed by us, and (3) how change was perceived varied between generations. We defined “observations” as the specific examples of environmental and weather change that were described, whereas “perceptions” referred to the manner in which these observations of change were understood and contextualized by the interview participants. Understanding the differences in generational observations and perceptions of change are key issues in the development of climate change adaptation strategies. © 2016 by the author(s).","Alaska; Climate change; Indigenous knowledge; Observation; Perception; Yukon River Basin","adaptive management; climate change; elderly population; indigenous knowledge; risk perception; young population; Alaska; United States; Yukon Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989172799

Injectability and compressibility of semi-finished textiles are known to be influential on mould filling processes. Compaction response has been studied extensively, with measurements being conceptually simple, and easily applicable in a non-destructive format. Flow resistance of fibre reinforcements, or ""injectability"", is commonly quantified by permeability, for which the vast majority of reported measurement techniques are destructive, requiring cutting of reinforcement to a specific sample size, and often involve infusion with a test fluid. The presented method provides a highly effective and reliable non-destructive characterization of semi-finished textiles applicable within an industrial production environment. General benefits and limitations of the measurement method are discussed, followed by a detailed analysis of presented injectability data and its' correlation to more classical permeability values. The paper concludes with a capability analysis, proving the sensitivity and robustness of the proposed measurement methods. © 2016, European Conference on Composite Materials, ECCM.

This paper analyses the advantages of using a private cloud architecture to share hardware and software resources when it is required. Our case study is Guadalajara, which has nine municipalities and each one monitor's air quality. Each municipality has a set of servers to process information independently and consists of information systems for the transmission and storage of data with other municipalities. We analysed the behaviour of the carbon footprint during the years1999-2013 and we observed a pattern in each season. Thus our proposal requires municipalities to use a cloud-based solution that allows managing and consolidating infrastructure to minimize maintenance costs and electricity consumption to reduce carbon footprint generated by the city. © 2016, Academy and Industry Research Collaboration Center (AIRCC).","City services; Cloud architectures; Cost estimation; Smart cities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044328672

Transforming European cities into Smart Cities not only requires holistic and integrated approaches to local economy, mobility and environment by focusing on people's needs and interests, but also suitable assessment procedures. Standards like BREEAM or LEED do not facilitate their applicability or cover all the topics behind the Smart City concept. For this reason, in this paper and under the CITyFiED project, a novel and holistic assessment procedure is proposed. It glues the main features of aforementioned standards together with other criteria based on energy efficiency, economics, social acceptance, life cycle assessment and smart homes. This procedure is being applied to three residential districts, where holistic interventions are carried out to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions and to improve the quality of life of the residents. In particular, this paper describes how this open procedure is being deployed in one of the three CITyF1ED demonstrators: Torrelago district, which is located in Laguna de Ducro-Valladolid, Spain. Within this demonstrator, a portfolio of Key Performance Indicators is defined with the objective of evaluating the sustainabi lity level considering the peculiarities of the demonstrator.","BREEAM; CITyFiED; Energy efficiency; KPIs; LEED; Life-cycle assessment; Quality of processes; Smart cities; Sustainabilily","Automation; Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental design; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; BREEAM; CITyFiED; KPIs; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Smart cities; Sustainabilily; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986882845

A research version of General Electric Aviation (GE) TAPS injector was used for the tests. Results include combustion efficiency from gaseous emission measurements, 2D planar laser-based imaging as well as basic flow visualization of the flame. Four inlet test conditions were selected that simulate various engine power conditions relevant to NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Supersonics Project and Environmentally Responsible Aviation Program. One inlet condition was a pilot-only test point. The other three inlet conditions incorporated fuel staging via a split between the pilot and main circuits of either 10%/90% or 20%/80%. For each engine power condition, three fuel mixes were used: 100% JP-8; 100% alternative; and a blend of the two, containing 75% alternative. Results for the inlet cases that have fuel split between pilot and main, indicate that fuel from the pilot appears to be evaporated by the time it reaches the dome exit. Main circuit liquid evaporates within a downstream distance equal to annulus height, no matter the fuel. Some fuel fluorescence images for a 10%/90% fuel staging case show a distinct difference between JP-8 and bio-derived fuel. OH PLIF results indicate that OH forms in a region more centrally-located for the JP-8 case downstream of the pilot, in its central recirculation region (CRZ). For the bio-derived Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel, however, we do not see much OH in the CRZ. The OH image structure near the dome exit is similar for the two fuels, but farther downstream the OH in the CRZ is much more apparent for the JP-8 than for the alternate fuel. For all conditions, there was no discernable difference between fuel types in combustion efficiency or emissions. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Policy makers set goals for sustainable development transportation. Since 1 January 2014, all new trucks have to be powered with a Euro 6 certified engine. Inland waterways are used for transportation of goods and are recognized for their contribution towards sustainable development therefore, engine's barges are old and emission of air pollutants are significant. Currently, the emission limits for inland waterway barges are defined in the Directive 97/86/CE on non-road mobile machinery. That emission limits are similar to Euro 2. The Euro 6 regulations reduced significantly the emission limits. The European Commission has recently proposed a revision of the Directive 97/86/CE which will significantly reduce emission limits. Development of new engines for the small market of small barges in France and also in Europe will be very expensive. Small barges owners should not be able to afford investments in new engines. The range of road engine power is similar to the small barges one. Using Euro 6 heavy duty engines will permit to reach low emissions of air pollutants and should be less expensive for small barges owners. A technical feasibility study had been carried out. It was based on an approach of all parameters of the re-power existing barges. Stakeholder's interviews permitted to deepen same specific topics. The technical feasibility study, added with expected environmental effect, has shown that no technical impossibility had been identified, but some key technical issues have to be considered. It has also confirmed re-powering existing barges (same propulsion power value, no change in naval transmission, etc.) with Euro 6 truck engines is interesting to limit significantly emission air pollutants. The on-board diagnostic controls monitor the engine's exhaust treatment and, it's important to adapt this monitoring for engines used in barges. © 2016 The Authors.","boat engines; Euro 6 standard; Freycinet; Inland waterways; polluting emissions; truck engines",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991234474

The historic rise in concentration is coincident with the era of the so-called ""Anthropocene."" Unlike concentrations of long-lived species such as carbon dioxide, atmospheric SOx in the United States (US) peaked between 1970 and 2005 then declined. The rise and fall of SOx is traced by comparing national data on emission changes, ambient concentrations, and precipitation sulfate from prior to World War II to the present. Surface SOx concentrations and precipitation sulfate have decreased with emissions in most parts of the US after the late 1970s. Continued reduction toward a natural ""background"" condition has depended on aggressive management of anthropogenic emission sources. Annual average ambient concentrations of SO2 and SO4 have become more uniform across the US at levels of 1-3 ppbv and 0.3-3 μg/m3, respectively. Precipitation SO4 has a nominal concentration generally less than 0.5 mg/L. The effective lifetime of SOx in the troposphere is a few days. This duration limits the spatial extent of emission source influence of SOx to regional scales, wherein spatial gradients in species concentrations lead to variations in human exposure and impacts on vulnerable terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The effects of domestic emission reductions on SOx levels are moderated by intra- and intercontinental transport of SOx from Canada, Mexico, Asia and elsewhere. The trends in tropospheric SOx concentrations illustrate the results of more than a century of rising public awareness and action to progressively reduce a US environmental risk, accomplished with advances in energy production technology that have maintained economic well-being.

However, in order for s-CO2 cycle to reach high efficiency, highly effective recuperators are needed. These recuperative heat exchangers must transfer heat at a rate that is substantially larger than the heat transfer to the cycle itself and can therefore represent up to 24% of the total power block cost in a recompression Brayton cycle [1]. Lower cost regenerators are proposed as a cost saving alternative to high cost printed circuit recuperators. A regenerator is a heat exchanger that alternately has hot and cold fluid passing through it. During the first half of its cycle the hot gas is passed over a storage media bed (stainless steel balls, screens, or similar fill material) where thermal energy is stored. During the next half of the cycle, cold fluid is passed through in the opposite direction, extracting the thermal energy from the bed. By operating a cycle with two (or more) regenerators, where one is always in a hot to cold (HTC) blow and the other in a cold to hot blow (CTH), a quasi-steady state can be achieved in the cycle to allow continuous operation. A model of the regenerator was created and used in place of a recuperator in a model of a 10MW power plant. The thermal effectiveness of the regenerator cycle was slightly lower than the recuperator cycle, however the regenerator cycle had a saving of about 9.3 percent in the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE). A scale model of the regenerator is under construction which will verify the performance of the regenerator model. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Biofuels; Brayton cycle; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Costs; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Printed circuit testing; Printed circuits; Recuperators; Regenerators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Stainless steel; Supercritical fluid extraction; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Thermoanalysis; Timing circuits; Wind power; Continuous operation; Experimental testing; High-efficiency; Quasi-steady state; Recuperative heat exchangers; Stainless steel balls; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Thermal effectiveness; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002342224

DNase I footprinting analysis showed that the RhaR protein specifically binds to the regulatory region upstream of the rhaEW gene, in which two imperfect direct repeats are included. Gel retardation analysis revealed that the direct repeat farther upstream is essential for the high-affinity binding of RhaR and that the DNA binding of RhaR was effectively inhibited by L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate, an intermediate of L-rhamnose catabolism. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the CcpA/P-Ser-HPr complex, primarily governing the carbon catabolite control in B. subtilis, binds to the catabolite-responsive element, which overlaps the RhaR binding site. In vivo analysis of the rhaEW promoter-lacZ fusion in the background of ccpA deletion showed that the L-rhamnose-responsive induction of the rhaEW promoter was negated by the disruption of rhaA or rhaB but not rhaEW or rhaM, whereas rhaR disruption resulted in constitutive rhaEW promoter activity. These in vitro and in vivo results clearly indicate that RhaR represses the operon by binding to the operator site, which is detached by L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate formed from L-rhamnose through a sequence of isomerization by RhaA and phosphorylation by RhaB, leading to the derepression of the operon. In addition, the lacZ reporter analysis using the strains with or without the ccpA deletion under the background of rhaR disruption supported the involvement of CcpA in the carbon catabolite repression of the operon. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

As the regulatory climate changed over time, so did design philosophy, along with the types of management practices, the computational methods, and the prominence of stormwater management as an integral part of the overall site planning process. The milestones of this evolution include the addition of stormwater quality treatment as a regulatory standard and, more recently, a focus on reducing the overall volume of runoff through the use of small-scale, distributed management practices (often under the banner of Low-Impact Development or Environmental Site Design). The volume reduction strategy, referred to as “runoff reduction,” has been adopted as a regulatory standard in some parts of the USA, along with new stormwater practice design specifications and computational methods. The approach demands that stormwater design reach beyond sole reliance on engineering, as the new best management practices (BMPs) include site design strategies that incorporate elements of soil science, horticulture, landscape architecture, and, importantly, site planning. These new strategies have certainly been elevated to prominence by virtue of the hydrologic benefits but also by the integration of stormwater management into Clean Water Act permits and Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) assigned to impaired urban streams and receiving waterbodies. This chapter will outline the evolution of stormwater management regulatory goals and the corresponding design strategies and include examples of how these approaches are changing the structural and nonstructural design of the urban landscape. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Channel protection; Impervious cover; Stormwater; Stormwater practice; Urban infrastructure",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043530965

Hundreds of piping components are inspected and evaluated for pipe wall loss due to flow accelerated corrosion and microbiological corrosion during a typical scheduled refueling outage. The evaluation is typically based on the original code rules for design and construction, and so often that uniformly thin pipe cross section is conservatively assumed. Code Case N-597-2 of ASME B&PV, Section XI Code provides a simplified methodology for local pipe wall thinning evaluation to meet the construction Code requirements for pressure and moment loading. However, it is desirable to develop a methodology for evaluating non-planar flaws that consistent with the Section XI flaw evaluation methodology for operating plants. From the results of recent studies and experimental data, it is reasonable to suggest that the Section XI, Appendix C net section collapse load approach can be used for non-planar flaws in carbon steel piping with an appropriate load multiplier factor. Local strain at non-planar flaws in carbon steel piping may reach a strain instability prior to net section collapse. As load increase, necking starting at onset strain instability leads to crack initiation, coalescence and fracture. Thus, by limiting local strain to material onset strain instability, a load multiplier factor can be developed for evaluating non-planar flaws in carbon steel piping using limit load methodology. In this paper, onset strain instability, which is material strain at the ultimate stress from available tensile test data, is correlated with the material minimum specified elongation for developing a load factor of nonplanar flaws in various carbon steel piping subjected to multiaxial loading.

In such reservoirs, the dominant fluid pathways are provided by networks of hydraulically conductive natural fractures. In order to predict hydrocarbon production, an accurate estimate of the effective permeability arising from these networks is essential. Because reservoir simulators typically use continuum approximations of permeability, and are discretized using volume elements that are much larger than the scale of the fractures, obtaining these estimates requires fast, accurate upscaling methods to convert discrete fracture connectivity and permeability to effective flow properties. Furthermore, fractures in the subsurface often exhibit a small number of prevalent orientations, which are the cause of frequently observed high degrees of permeability anisotropy. Because this anisotropy has a significant influence on reservoir simulation results, it is important to accurately compute directional fracture network permeability, which enables identification of the principal permeability directions. This paper presents a novel and efficient numerical upscaling method for the directional equivalent permeability of a discrete fracture network. In this method, the network is converted into a set of connected fracture segments. Using a modified equivalent pipe approach and appropriate boundary conditions, the directional permeability is computed for steady-state parallel-plate flow. The numerical method is compared to a published method that provides equivalent permeability estimates of discrete fracture networks. A consistent finding is that the computed equivalent fracture permeability is a consequence of the conceptual design of each method. This highlights the importance of comparing various methods for computing the equivalent fracture permeability in order to get a better understanding of how a particular discrete fracture network might contribute to reservoir simulation results. In a more general sense, it also underlines the importance of understanding, and retaining for analysis, any assumptions made in modeling efforts. Further, the equivalent permeability computed from each method is incorporated into reservoir simulations. Differences in simulation results are found to be direct consequences of the specific permeability maps computed with different methods. Because each method of computing equivalent fracture permeability elevates different aspects of a discrete fracture network, a comparison of results obtained with different methods allows one to quantify, and possibly to reduce, uncertainty in reservoir simulations.

Premixed lean combustion is a current standard to minimize nitrogen oxide emissions. However, the early mixing of fuel and oxidizer upstream of the combustion chamber opens up the possibility of upstream flame propagation, referred to as flame flashback. Flame flashback in gas turbines has to be prevented as it leads to immediate engine shut down or even structural damage. Due to high burning velocities and low quenching distances, flashback is especially critical in premixed hydrogen flames. In particular, the low velocity region near the burner wall promotes flashback. Diluting the mixture near the wall by fluid injection is one approach to counteract this phenomenon and to enhance the safe operating range of a gas turbine burner. This article presents an experimental study on the effect of air injection on flame flashback investigated at a channel burner configuration. Different injection mass flow rates, positions and angles are compared to a reference case without injection regarding their flashback limits. The effectiveness of the injection increases with the injected mass flow rate. The resulting flashback limits can be correlated with the equivalence ratio at the wall by concepts taken from film cooling. However, the fluid injector is a source of boundary layer disturbances leading to an initial penalty regarding flashback resistance. This penalty increases the closer the injector is located to the burner exit. Furthermore, the penalty increases for lower injection angles as the area of the injector and the corresponding boundary layer disturbances increase.

This new approach combines landmark-based geometric morphometrics with eigen analyses to analyze shape variation within P1 elements of the I. simulator group, and could be used to analyze shape variation in other morphologically similar conodont groups. Specimens analyzed were obtained from three sections of the early Gzhelian Heebner Shale of the Oread cyclothem in the North American Midcontinent region, the cyclothem from which I. simulator was originally named. This analysis shows that the I. simulator group comprises a set of at least five species with asymmetrical P1 element pairs, relatively short adcarinal ridges, and a variably developed eccentric groove. Species discrimination is based on the presence of caudal and rostral lobes, character of the adcarinal ridges, and platform shape. The species I. simulator is restricted to P1 elements with a caudal adcarinal ridge that is isolated from the caudal platform margin.

For cities aiming to address the impacts of climate change in a proactive sense as well as post-disaster, urban resilience presents itself as a useful frame, grounded in both ecological systems theory and psychological theory. This chapter tackles the question of where the notion of resilience helps, and where it holds cities back, in terms of urban planning and policy. Resilience in the urban planning and policy context may hold cities back because it lacks normative value in social and political spheres. That is, while concepts such as social justice and sustainable development suggest a normative direction for planning toward the improvement of our communities, resilience thinking does not imply any value-based criteria by which communities might determine how best to “bounce back” or “bounce forward.” Additional tools for urban resilience planning are needed, and we suggest and elaborate here upon two: the development path and regenerative sustainability. The notion of the development path originated within the IPCC process and draws upon futures studies, scenario planning and backcasting, in order to understand the social and political change and decision making implications of responding to climate change. The second concept we offer, regenerative sustainability, can be considered as the work of increasing the capacity of the current generation to give back more than we receive. The contribution of these two concepts to the value of urban resilience thinking in political contexts is explained through a discussion of five possible scenarios of urban transformation, which vary in terms of the social and political intentions at work in the strategies needed to build resilience. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate Governance; Climate Policy; Development Path; Regenerative Sustainability; Urban Transformation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075879210

Urban air quality is a serious problem nowadays as the number of vehicles increases on a yearly basis. With stricter Euro emission regulations, vehicle manufacturers are not meeting the imposed limits and are also disregarding the non-exhaust emissions. This paper highlights the relevance of non-exhaust emissions of passenger vehicles, both conventional (diesel and petrol) or electric vehicles (EV), on air quality levels in an urban environment in Belgium. An environmental life cycle assessment was carried out based on a real-world emission model for passenger cars and fuel refinery data. A cut-off was applied to the models to highlight what emissions, both from the refinery to the exhaust and electricity production for EV, do actually occur within Belgium's borders. Results show that not much progress has been made from Euro 4 to 6 for conventional vehicles. Electric vehicles pose the best alternative solution as a more environmentally friendly means of transportation. The analysis results target policy makers with the intention that regulations and policies would be developed in the future and target the characterization of non-exhaust emissions from vehicles. These results indicate that EVs offer a valid solution for addressing the urban air quality issue and that non-exhaust emissions should be addressed in future regulatory steps as they dominate the impact spectrum. © 2016 by the authors.","Electric vehicle; Emissions; Life cycle assessment; Non-exhaust; Urban","Air quality; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Gasoline; Life cycle; Particulate emissions; Refining; Electricity production; Environmental analysis; Environmental life cycle assessment; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Means of transportations; Non-exhaust; Regulations and policy; Urban; Automobile manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958576835

However, the production of renewable energy is not always an integral part of the energy system. Instead, it may have a decentralized basis, even up to the household level. In the Netherlands, this decentralizing trend coincides with developments in/of spatial planning, in which case the government is retreating to stimulate private and business development. Thus, a new kind of arrangement is emerging in the Netherlands, the so-called organic urban development, in which bottom-up trends meet top-down developments. This paper looks into such organic arrangements, especially those designed for district heating, to get a better understanding of the relationship between the energy sector and spatial planning. The main question of this paper is: How and under what conditions can district heating get a more important role in local energy systems in the Dutch context? Based on an extensive literature study on the international best practices of bottom-up energy initiatives, and two theoretical concepts – institutional theory and technical entrepreneurship – we build a theoretical framework for the organic development of urban energy projects that is then applied in two Dutch cases: the municipal heating company of Rotterdam (top-down) and the privately-owned district heating in Lanxmeer, Culemborg (bottom-up). The results of the study comprise of a practical and scientific contribution. First is a useful framework that makes the iterative and complex character of urban development processes clear and shows how urban energy projects can be successful taken into this process. Second, the study identifies a new important tactic as part of institutional theory: utilization, which represents the linking of existing physical and governance conditions to new urban energy projects. © 2016, Journal of Settlements and Spatial Planning.

These meta-scenarios provide a context for discussing specific energy policy implications both at the national scale and from the perspective of Brazil’s urban centres. Design/methodology/approach: The paper defines and uses three metrics – energy efficiency, decarbonisation and carbon efficiency – to plot both Brazil’s historic energy pathway and a set of future energy scenarios put forth by various national and international energy agencies. The authors then use a meta-scenario approach to group these alternate pathways, identifying specific policy levers associated with the realisation of each. Findings: The authors identify plausible policy changes that will help move Brazil off a current trajectory of stagnated energy performance to a “greener” scenario in which carbon efficiency improves even as Brazil’s economic growth continues. Such policies include energy efficiency programmes and continued expansion of the country’s already extensive hydropower and biomass capacity. Adoption of policies that would put Brazil on a more aggressive path towards a global sustainability scenario currently seems impractical. Originality/value: This paper brings a standardized set of metrics to bear on Brazil’s unique energy history, which in turn helps identify specific policy impacts for continued GHG reduction in Brazil’s future from national and urban perspectives. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cities; Energy; Energy management; Fuels; Global sustainability; Meta scenarios; Policy recommendations; Urban impact",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986550838

Part of the facilitation towards improvements in structures and processes in CR is to consider innovative developments especially in the area of treatment and recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW) based on mechanical biological treatment (MBT) technologies, as well as lessons learnt from other more advanced EU countries in waste management structures. An appropriate response to the climate change concerns has been the revised targets in reducing landfilling and increasing renewable energy sources towards a more sustainable energy use and waste management. In spite of the fact that the EU has issued key pieces of waste management and renewable energy Directives, compliance with diversion targets away from landfilling and renewable energy quotas are still considered too ambitious and far out of the reach of many Eastern European countries. This research holistically focuses on the MARSS1 technology and its potential application and stakeholder acceptance in CR. MARSS is one-of-a-kind proven technology to remove and stabilise the biogenic fraction of MSW, to prevent landfilling and yield a refined biomass fuel for combined heat and power (CHP) production. Results from this study indicate that the MARSS technology has a higher potential in helping CR's obligations to reduce the landfilling of organic material reduce CO2 emissions so complying with Annual Emission Agreements (AEA), as well as with adopted EU legislation in waste management, renewable energy and the circular economy. Based on the interviews carried out with key stakeholder groups, there are some positive indications that MBT plus MARSS could be an option, but it needs more time for development and implementation of new national legislation and an improvement in the markets to encourage confidence in the investment communities. © 2016 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

CLT (cross-laminated timber) construction is new to the construction industry in Denmark and has not had the benefits of time and financial investment to be able to compete commercially with PC construction. In the absence of ambitions beyond low cost and risk, the situation is destined to remain unchanged. In 2009, Copenhagen announced plans to be the world’s first CO2 neutral city by 2025. Together with the City’s plans to build 6.8 million sqm of new buildings by the same year, a new development trajectory now exists that couples development with sustainability. While this new incentive may suit the environmental benefits of CLT construction, perceived increased risk and cost represent significant barriers to its adoption in Denmark. The results of the research show that CLT construction would reduce the existing CO2 deficit of 70,000 tons by 22% - a contribution similar in magnitude to other CO2 reducing initiatives such as the use of solar cells or using new fuels for transport. However, it also shows that the cost of CLT construction is 26% higher than PC construction for the same building. The paper concludes by suggesting a number of ways to increase the adoption of CLT construction in Denmark in light of its environmental advantages and commercial disadvantages. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Architecture; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Construction industry; Costs; Precast concrete; Carbon neutrals; CO2 neutral; Copenhagen; Cross laminated; Environmental benefits; Financial investments; Low costs; Structural systems; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015065850

Results from interviews with local policy representatives and three workshops with UK academics, practitioners and local decision makers are presented. Drawing on these data, we outline three key recommendations made by participants on how the IPCC ARs can be better utilized as a form of scientific advice to inform local decision-making on climate change. First, to provide more succinct summaries of the reports paying close attention to the language, content, clarity, context and length of these summaries; second, to better target and frame the reports from a local perspective to maximize engagement with local stakeholders; and third, to work with local decision makers to better understand how scientific advice on climate change is being incorporated in local decision-making. By adopting these, the IPCC would facilitate local decision-making on climate change and provide a systematic review of how its reports are being used locally. We discuss implications of these recommendations and their relevance to the wider debate within and outside the IPCC as to the most effective way the IPCC can more effectively tailor its products to user needs without endangering the robustness of its scientific findings.

This paper focuses on opportunities for climate assessments to be used more effectively to enhance adaptive capacity, particularly drawing from experiences with the third US National Climate Assessment (NCA3). We discuss the evolution of thinking about adaptation as a process and the importance of societal values, as well as the role of assessments in this evolution. We provide a rationale for prioritizing future assessment activities, with an expectation of moving beyond the concept of climate adaptation as an explicit and separable activity from Bnormal^ planning and implementation in the future. Starting with the values and resources that need to be protected or developed by communities rather than starting with an analysis of changes in climate drivers can provide opportunities for reframing climate issues in ways that are likely to result in more positive outcomes. A critical part of successful risk management is monitoring and evaluating the systems of interest to decision-makers and the effectiveness of interventions following integration of climate considerations into ongoing strategic planning activities and implementation. Increasingly this will require consideration of path dependency and coincident events.We argue that climate adaptation is a transitional process that bridges the gap between historically time-testedways of doing business and the kinds of decision processes that may be required in the future, and that scientific assessments will be increasingly central to these transitions in decision processes over time. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA) 2015.","Adaptive capacity; Climate adaptation; Climate assessment; Climate change adaptation; Sustained assessment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068002645

However, little is known about the regional variation in plant communities at the margins (laggs) of bogs, even though they are an integral element of raised bog ecosystems. Therefore, we investigated the regional patterns in the plant communities of bogs and laggs, and the factors that control them, for thirteen bogs in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Species richness was significantly higher in the bogs and laggs of the cooler, wetter Pacific Oceanic wetland region. Beta Diversity analyses showed that bogs in the Pacific Oceanic wetland region often shared species with their respective laggs, whereas half of the laggs in the warmer, drier Pacific Temperate wetland region had no species in common with the adjacent bogs and were thus more ecologically distinct from the bog. Primary climatic variables, such as mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature and latitude, as well as climate-influenced variables, such as pH, peat depth, and Na+ concentrations were the main correlates of plant species composition in the studied bogs. Site-specific factors, particularly depth to water table, and fraction of inorganic material in peat samples, were as strongly related to lagg plant communities as climate, while hydrochemistry appeared to have less influence. © 2016 International Mire Conservation Group and International Peatland Society.","Bog; Ecotone; Lagg; Regional variation; Vegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994791964

The expanding urban areas and the increasing population, especially in the metropolitan Taipei city, result in surface runoff discharge during typhoons or rainstorms. When the surface runoff exceeds the capacity of drainage systems of the city, the urban inundation and property losses occur. The urban flooding risk assessment is a useful tool for the decision-making in flood damage mitigation. In general, hazard and vulnerability are two main factors for the risk assessment. In the present study, the Center Taipei City (CTC) is chosen as the study area. The A1B scenario simulations proposed by IPCC are used to compare the flood risks between the present situation and future condition which is under climate change scenario. The ArcGIS is used to yield the flood potential information and the flood risk for the return period of 10, 25, 100 and 200-year flood. The simulated results revealed that the increasing water storage to meet the regulation of the Taipei City government would effectively reduce the effects of climate change on the decreasing inundation areas. The adaptation strategies will also reduce the high-risk areas in the CTC according to risk assessment. The adaptation strategies composed of increasing the water storage in urban areas and reducing the social vulnerability of flooding area are the effective way for the flood risk reduction in urban area. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Risk assessment; Simulation; Urban inundation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119125585

Concentrations and sources of the pollutants varied greatly in severe haze-fog episode (P1), moderate haze episode (P2), and clear episode (P3). Both low wind speed and high relative humidity (RH) during P1 resulted in the high level pollutants of PM2.5 (240.3 ± 167.9 μg m− 3), SO2 (37.9 ± 20.7 μg m− 3), NO2 (111.5 ± 50.2 μg m− 3) and total water-soluble ions (58.73 ± 28.87 μg m− 3), indicating a strong accumulation of local pollutants and secondary species formation. During P2, air masses from the north decreased the concentration level of particles (116.1 ± 65.5 μg m− 3) and increased the visibility, resulting in a moderate degree of pollution. Most of the pollutants dropped to the lowest concentration levels due to the rainfall in P3, and the haze episode ended at 13 December. Single particle analysis showed that C-rich particles exhibited the highest number percentages (30%) in the samples of P1, S/N-rich species (35%) dominated the particles in the samples of P2, and Al/Si-rich particles (23%) were most abundant in the samples of P3. The TEM-EDS analysis confirmed that particles contained more internally mixed components during P1 and P2 than those during P3, suggesting that the particles during P1 and P2 underwent more intense aging in the atmosphere. The single particle analysis indicated that trace metals may promote the heterogeneous transformation of SO2 and NO2 on the surface of the particles during P1, which was in agreement with the highest sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) observed in the haze-fog episode.

Plankton diversity is immense with representations from all major phyla within the three domains of life. So far, plankton monitoring has mainly been based on microscopic identification, which has limited sensitivity and reproducibility, not least because of the numerical majority of plankton being unidentifiable under the light microscope. High-throughput sequencing of taxonomic marker genes offers a means to identify taxa inaccessible by traditional methods; thus, recent studies have unveiled an extensive previously unknown diversity of plankton. Here, we conducted ultra-deep Illumina sequencing (average 105 sequences/sample) of rRNA gene amplicons of surface water eukaryotic and bacterial plankton communities sampled in summer along a 2000 km transect following the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea. Community composition was strongly correlated with salinity for both bacterial and eukaryotic plankton assemblages, highlighting the importance of salinity for structuring the biodiversity within this ecosystem. In contrast, no clear trends in alpha-diversity for bacterial or eukaryotic communities could be detected along the transect. The distribution of major planktonic taxa followed expected patterns as observed in monitoring programs, but groups novel to the Baltic Sea were also identified, such as relatives to the coccolithophore Emiliana huxleyi detected in the northern Baltic Sea. This study provides the first ultra-deep sequencing-based survey on eukaryotic and bacterial plankton biogeography in the Baltic Sea. © 2016 Hu, Karlson, Charvet and Andersson.","Bacterioplankton; Baltic Sea; Brackish; Marine microbiology; Metabarcoding; Microbial ecology; Protists","brackish water; genomic DNA; RNA 18S; Alphaproteobacteria; Anabaena flos-aquae; Article; bacterioplankton; biodiversity; biogeochemical cycle; biogeography; cyanophage; DNA extraction; DNA isolation; freshwater environment; gene amplification; gene sequence; genome analysis; Hacrobia; Haptophyta; high throughput sequencing; marine environment; marker gene; mesoplankton; microbial community; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; picoplankton; Planctomycetes; polymerase chain reaction; salinity; stramenopile; water analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973541011

The correlation effects between tourism and other industries makes tourism a necessary part in dealing with energy-consumption efficiency and carbon-reduction. However, calculation of carbon emissions is rather difficult because of the intricate connections between tourism and other industries. In this paper, the ""from bottom to top"" method is applied to estimating the tourism carbon emissions in Hubei province. And the result shows the tourism carbon emissions were about 3.4006MT in Hubei province in 2013, among which travel transportation took up about 95.7%, far beyond the national and world proportion. Therefore, travel transportation especially the expressway transportation and civil aviation transportation must be the key in the process of developing low-carbon tourism.

If the initial value is not selected suitably, it is difficult to enter the convergence range, thus increasing the number of iterations. The acoustic emission source location based on phase difference time delay estimation method reduces the error of acoustic emission location, but it has some shortcomings in accuracy. Based on the above problems, this paper presents a new algorithm for Geiger optimization based on source localization. Firstly, the initial value of Geiger is obtained by using the phase difference method. Then, the optimal solution is obtained by the iterative solution of Geiger algorithm and the least square method. The simulation results show that this method can effectively solve the problem of selecting the initial value of Geiger, so that it can quickly enter the convergence range, improving the convergence speed and positioning accuracy, comparing the positioning results of the United States PCI-2 type acoustic emission instrument, the average error reduced by about 5 mm. © 2016, Allerton Press, Inc.","acoustic emission (AE); all-phase FFT phase difference; Geiger; least square methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994704798

Eli Whitney’s 1794 patent of the spiked tooth cotton gin and Henry Ogden Holmes’s 1796 patent of the saw tooth cotton gin significantly increased the ability of cotton producers to economically produce raw cotton fiber to be made into cotton textiles and were the predecessors of today’s modern cotton ginning plants. The separation of the cotton fiber from the seed and preservation of the cotton fiber quality is still the principal function of the modern cotton gin. However, the modern cotton ginning plant is a highly mechanized processing system that controls moisture and removes foreign materials while handling, transporting and packaging many tons per hour of bulk cottonseed and baled cotton fiber. Cotton gins must produce a raw ginned cotton fiber of a quality that maximizes its value for the producer while meeting the high demands of the textile industry and ultimately the consumer. Designing, operating and maintaining today’s cotton gin plant is a highly specialized field that continues to demand increasing technical knowledge and skills. This new Cotton Ginners Handbook addresses and updates changes over the past 20 years in ginning issues such as fiber quality, machinery maintenance and operation, moisture control, seed cotton and cotton fiber cleaning, energy use, waste handling and collection, and gin safety as well as gin management and state and federal air pollution regulatory requirements.

Governing involves the creation of institutions, rules and organizations, and the selection of normative principles to guide problem solution and institution building. We argue that actors involved in governing climate change adaptation, as climate change governance regimes evolve, inevitably must engage in making choices, for instance on problem definitions, jurisdictional levels, on modes of governance and policy instruments, and on the timing of interventions. Yet little is known about how and why these choices are made in practice, and how such choices affect the outcomes of our efforts to govern adaptation. In this introduction we review the current state of evidence and the specific contribution of the articles published in this Special Feature, which are aimed at bringing greater clarity in these matters, and thereby informing both governance theory and practice. Collectively, the contributing papers suggest that the way issues are defined has important consequences for the support for governance interventions, and their effectiveness. The articles suggest that currently the emphasis in adaptation governance is on the local and regional levels, while underscoring the benefits of interventions and governance at higher jurisdictional levels in terms of visioning and scaling-up effective approaches. The articles suggest that there is a central role of government agencies in leading governance interventions to address spillover effects, to provide public goods, and to promote the long-term perspectives for planning. They highlight the issue of justice in the governance of adaptation showing how governance measures have wide distributional consequences, including the potential to amplify existing inequalities, access to resources, or generating new injustices through distribution of risks. For several of these findings, future research directions are suggested. © 2016 by the author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Governance",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989182785

Urbanization in the Arab world has been fuelled by high fertility rates, substantial rural-urban migration, international labor migration and the concentration of economic activity in urban areas. Moreover, urbanization mixed with the high fertility rates and the large percentage of youth in the Arab world will continue to put pressure on federal governments to address the socio-economic problems. This paper assesses the direct effects of urban expansion on environment and society in Arab World. Approach: This paper uses information about demographic changes and hydrologic data in the Arab World for the last years. The goal is to understand the connection between urbanization, water quality pollution and biodiversity in this Region. Official reports from governments, United Nations, World Bank and Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UN-ESCWA) are used. Results: Results indicate that there has been notable urban growth, lack of access to improved water sources, pollution and a loss of biodiversity as new urban developments have appeared in these areas. The population increase in a volcanically active area is particularly troubling since it poses a potential human health risk. Conclusion/Recommendations: The review also shows a direct correlation between urbanization with the reduction of water quality, air pollution and loss in biological diversity regarding species and ecosystems.","Biodiversity; Environmental impacts; Pollution; Population growth; Urban growth; Urbanization; Water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006317186

A bifunctional catalyst material is needed and the two functions are activated by means of an isothermal unsteady-state operation (i.e. gas switching). This work employs operando space- and time-resolved DRIFTS, XAFS, and XRD to elucidate the nature and functions of Cu and the promoters. Both unpromoted and K/Ba-promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts were studied to illuminate the active surface species varying along the catalyst bed. The K promoter was found to uniquely facilitate efficient CO2 capture in the form of surface formates, dispersion of active metallic Cu and suppression of surface Cu oxidation. The CO2-trapping efficiency of the K-promoted catalyst is so high that CO2 capture takes place gradually along the catalyst bed towards the reactor outlet, hence creating large spatial and temporal gradients of surface chemical species. Understanding these features is of central importance to design efficient CCR catalysts. Furthermore, a completely different path for CO2 reduction was evidenced for the unpromoted and Ba-promoted Cu catalysts where CO2 can directly react with metallic Cu and oxidize its outer surface and thus releasing CO. These results also provide important new mechanistic insights into the widely investigated reverse water-gas shift reaction and the role that K and Ba promoters play. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Chemical shift; Water gas shift; Active surface species; Bi-functional catalysts; Critical functions; Promoted catalysts; Reverse water-gas shift reaction; Temporal gradients; Trapping efficiencies; Unsteady-state operation; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967102089

N.A.R.D.I. Fundulea during the last fifteen years experimented doubled haploids technology to wheat, as a method of reducing time for the obtaining DH lines by Zea method. The most known variety of autumn wheat obtained by this method is Glosa, which is presently cultivated on large areas, especially in South Romania. Usually, the improvement of crops requires first, the creation and introduction of genetic variation, second, inbreeding, coupled with selection and then, extensive evaluation of breeding materials in multiple locations to identify adapted and stable genotypes with desirable agronomic traits. A series of well know research institutes all over the world sustain than DH method could be very efficient in releasing valuable varieties of wheat or helpful in new genotypes breeding in order to reduce the impact of climate change. The experiment took place in the research field of Caracal Research Station. It was studied 10 synthetic amphidiploids of autumn wheat comparative with their parental forms. This station focuses on the creation of new autumn wheat (common and durum), with increased resistance to drought, productive and superior quality and testing the new Romanian and foreign genotypes for many agricultural species. The obtained results can lead to the appreciation that the utilization of the technology of DH lines may increase the genetic variability of the biological material used in breeding programs to autumn wheat.

In Europe, several R&D clusters have been set up, gathering experts from academia, industry and public administration. As these centres are dispersed around Europe, communication and coordination among them has been observed to be unstructured and limited. Whereas the European composites ecosystem remains fragmented, large-scale coordinated initiatives in other continents have been aligning efforts among academia, state and industry to accelerate research results. At the same time in Europe, stakeholders of competing solutions have come together to provide the answer to the light-weighting issue. This paper examines the potential of increasing Europe's competitiveness in the field of automotive composites by enhancing the communication, coordination, and knowledge exchange among the clusters. The paper looks into the research performed by ten clusters of excellence in six countries aiming to identify overlapping research efforts as well as explore potential synergies. The results show that, should the communication and knowledge exchange between the clusters be enhanced, research efforts could be better aligned and focused on Europe's priorities, optimising resource allocation, thus accelerating automotive composites development, reinforcing the European position and increasing EU competitiveness. © 2016, European Conference on Composite Materials, ECCM.

The decline of oil production after this peak, initiated the interest in carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery floods (CO2 EOR) in 1972 to help extend the production life of some fields. With some exceptions, (Turkey, Abu Dhabi, Brazil, China, Malaysia, and the North Sea) the use of CO2 for EOR has been minimal outside the US. The Permian Basin (PB) alone accounts for over 50% of CO2 EOR worldwide projects (Melzer, 2012). The PB encompasses over 300,000 acres of various reservoirs under CO2 EOR floods. Through 2014, current oil production is in excess of 190,000 BOPD which represents 65% of CO2 EOR production in the US. Production is projected to increase to 323,000 BOPD by 2020. Constant surveillance of the CO2 migration during flooding is critical so that the injection pattern can be modified to optimize oil sweeping efficiency. One common method for CO2 monitoring is wireline well logging. Open-hole (OH) logs are normally acquired and then interpreted to evaluate the fluid saturation of the three phases1 (oil, water and CO2). At times, due to operational conditions and efficiencies, OH logs are not available. This limits the capability for a reliable CO2 monitoring for the surveillance teams. Cased-hole logging (CH) offers an operational advantage as well as a base line log for Time-Lapse monitoring. Quantitative reservoir evaluation through casing has been accomplished for decades using a combination of neutron logging tools with different neutron sources and a variety of gamma-ray detector materials. The primary measurements of these tools are: Sigma (Σ), Thermal Neutron porosity (TPHI), Carbon-Oxygen ratio (C/O) and Gamma Ray Spectroscopy. A multimineral petrophysical analysis is then performed to provide quantitative volumetric results. One of the main challenges of this interpretation is the ability to differentiate gas filled porosity from very low porosity formations. Both measurements; Σ and TPHI respond similarly in these conditions. Unless porosity is known from other sources (i.e. OH logs), neither of these measurements alone can provide a reliable answer. A different petrophysical measurement would be desirable to allow for this differentiation. This paper shows the application of a new pulsed neutron wireline service that measures a new formation property, fast neutron cross section (FNXS). This measurement makes possible differentiating gas-filled porosity and low porosity formations. FNXS is sensitive to the formation’s atom density which is independent from Hydrogen Index and is sensitive to the gas-filled porosity. Other new features of the new tool is the ability to self-compensate for the influence of the borehole (like for instance gas filled boreholes) and the completion using a combination of near, far and deep detectors and various timing gates. These new measurement advancements allow the log analyst to solve the three phase problem via a multi-mineral solver when OH logs are not available. This paper shows three CO2 EOR case studies in the PB where CO2 has been quantified for identifying good versus poor sweep efficiencies. The analysis shown here, helped the operator to design and optimize their completion strategy as well as having better understanding of the reservoir behavior under CO2 flood.

This knowledge originates from the interaction between members of the community and the environment in which they live. Although much has been written about indigenous knowledge, its documentation in the area of disaster risk reduction and climate change in Africa has been very limited. The wealth of this knowledge has not been well-recognised in the disaster risk reduction field, as policy-makers still rely on mitigation strategies based on scientific knowledge. Colonialism and lack of proper documentation of indigenous knowledge are some of the contributing factors to this. Ignoring the importance of understanding adaptive strategies of the local people has led to failed projects. Understanding how local people in Africa have managed to survive and adapt for generations, before the arrival of Western education, may be the key to developing sustainable policies to mitigate future challenges. Literature used in this article, obtained from the books, papers and publications of various experts in the fields of disaster risk reduction, climate change, indigenous knowledge and adaptation, highlight the need for more interest to be shown in indigenous knowledge, especially in the developing country context.

The analysis is applied to a pilot net zero emission building (nZEB) called the Living Laboratory, which has been developed by the Norwegian Research Centre on Zero Emission Buildings. The impact of embodied emissions is presented through a series of sensitivity analyses that consider the definition of a functional unit and system boundary. The results for embodied emissions are presented for each building component, and highlight important design drivers for the reduction of emissions in building construction. Compared to the previous ZEB projects, the total embodied emission result from the Living Laboratory of 23.5kgCO2eq/m2/yr is considered high. This is due to the building having a more comprehensive material inventory, which includes more life cycle phases, and uses a higher level of technical equipment and state-of-The-Art materials. The results show that the outer roof, photovoltaic system and outer walls drive the highest emissions. Further analysis revealed that in some cases high emissions came from the production phase, whereas in other cases it originated from the replacement phase. The results show that timber, electrical components and metal were responsible for driving the highest emissions. The results show that certain design choices, such as a change in foundation design, can reduce embodied emissions by 21%, which could be further reduced if low carbon concrete was used.","Design drivers; Design process; Embodied emissions; Net zero emission buildings","Air pollution; Buildings; Carbon; Design; Ecodesign; Energy conservation; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Sensitivity analysis; Structural design; Sustainable development; Building design process; Design drivers; Design process; Embodied emissions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle GHG emissions; Reduction of emissions; Zero emission buildings; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986881460

The kinetic analysis of the experimental results obtained by using high-chromium steel and a former experimental study of low alloy steel showed that the reaction rate can be estimated using an integrated reaction rate. Moreover, by using this estimation method, the reaction rate of different scale experimental results can also be well predicted. 2) Argon bubbling experimental results using a 7 t-scale vacuum induction furnace showed that the bubble burst under highly reduced pressure conditions can be considered to take place at the shallow depth of 40 mm.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the engine efficiency and emissive performance of last generation engines during the cold-start phase. For this aim, an experimental-analytical procedure was optimised and applied to study the cold emission behaviour of two motorcycles, characterised by similar technical specifications; the exhaust emissions of these motorcycles were measured on a chassis dynamometer in the laboratories of the National Research Council (CNR-Italy). By using this calculation procedure and the emission results measured during the experimental tests, the duration of the cold phase and the total emissions released during the cold-start transient were evaluated for carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons. The average values of cold emission factors and warm-up transient durations obtained for unburned hydrocarbons were 1.05 g/km and 162 s, respectively. Regarding carbon monoxide, the average values of cold emission factors and warm-up transient durations were 14.9 g/km and 152 s, respectively.

In this study, for the first time, both these approaches were simultaneously applied in five municipalities in Campania (southern Italy), deserving attention for health-oriented interventions as part of a National Interest Priority Site. The pollutants covered by the inventory were CO, NOx, particulate matter (PM10), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and some heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn). The biomonitoring survey was based on the use of the devitalized moss Hypnum cupressiforme transplanted into bags, following a harmonized protocol. The exposure covered 40 agricultural and urban/residential sites, with half of them located in proximity to roads. The pollutants monitored were Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn, as well as total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) only in five sites. Using the emission inventory approach, high emission loads were detected for all the major air pollutants and the following heavy metals: Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, over the entire study area. Arsenic, Pb, and Zn were the elements most accumulated by moss. Total PAH postexposure contents were higher than the preexposure values (~20-50% of initial value). Moss uptakes did not differ substantially among municipalities or within exposure sites. In the five municipalities, a similar spatial pattern was evidenced for Pb by emission inventory and moss accumulation. Both approaches indicated the same most polluted municipality, suggesting their combined use as a valuable resource to reveal contaminants that are not routinely monitored. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is widely recognized as the primary mechanism by which El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the southeast Pacific and southwest Atlantic and in recent years has also been suggested as a mechanism by which longer-term tropical sea surface temperature trends can influence the Antarctic climate. This study presents a novel methodology for objectively identifying the PSA pattern. By rotating the global coordinate system such that the equator (a great circle) traces the approximate path of the pattern, the identification algorithm utilizes Fourier analysis as opposed to a traditional empirical orthogonal function approach. The climatology arising from the application of this method to ERA-Interim reanalysis data reveals that the PSA pattern has a strong influence on temperature and precipitation variability over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula and on sea ice variability in the adjacent Amundsen, Bellingshausen, and Weddell Seas. Identified seasonal trends toward the negative phase of the PSA pattern are consistent with warming observed over the Antarctic Peninsula during autumn, but are inconsistent with observed winter warming over West Antarctica. Only a weak relationship is identified between the PSA pattern and ENSO, which suggests that the pattern might be better conceptualized as a preferred regional atmospheric response to various external (and internal) forcings.","Circulation/Dynamics; Climate variability; Fourier analysis; Geographic location/entity; Mathematical and statistical techniques; Models and modeling; Planetary waves; Reanalysis data; Southern Hemisphere; Variability","Atmospheric pressure; Climate models; Fourier analysis; Oceanography; Orthogonal functions; Precipitation (meteorology); Sea ice; Surface waters; Climate variability; Geographic location; Planetary Waves; Reanalysis; Southern Hemisphere; Statistical techniques; Variability; Climatology; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric forcing; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; numerical method; planetary wave; regional climate; seasonality; Southern Hemisphere; trend analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Southeast); South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983537183

Roadside vegetation barriers have shown the potential to reduce near-road air pollution concentrations; however, the characteristics of these barriers needed to ensure pollution reductions are not well understood. U.S. EPA conducted several field experiments to understand the effects of vegetation barriers on dispersion of pollutants near roadways (e.g. 2008 mobile monitoring study in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and 2014 mobile monitoring study in San Francisco Bay Area, California). The results of these field studies were used to evaluate dispersion models in simulating the effects of near road barriers and to develop recommendations for model improvements. The improved models can be used for evaluating the effectiveness of vegetation barriers as a potential mitigation strategy to reduce exposure to traffic-related pollutants and their associated adverse health effects.

The experimental results demonstrated that halogen doping, especially F and Cl, could lead to more efficient removal of residual hydrogen compared to carbon synthesized with pure benzene. This phenomenon was related to the different binding energies between hydrogen and halogens to form hydrogen halides. Their crystallinity and morphology did not change and remained the same as non-doped carbon. The electrochemical evaluation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in an alkaline solution revealed that halogen doping did not play a significant role in shifting the onset potential for the ORR, while a slight enhancement in diffusion limited current density was observed at high overpotentials. Moreover, the electron transfer number involved in the ORR process determined from the Koutecky-Levich plot at -0.6 V was found to increase for halogen-doped carbons in the following order: F-CNPs &gt; Br-CNPs &gt; Cl-CNPs &gt; CNPs. The improved ORR performance of F-CNPs could reasonably be attributed to the synergistic effects of specific bonding states between the halogen and carbon, structural defects and surface functional groups. Our results confirmed the validity of using halogen doping to improve the ORR catalytic activity of CNPs. © 2016 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981294382

Methane oxidizing bacteria play a key role in these ecosystems as they reduce methane emissions to the atmosphere. Here, we describe the isolation and initial characterization of two novel moderately thermophilic and acid-tolerant obligate methanotrophs, assigned BFH1 and BFH2 recovered from a tropical methane seep topsoil habitat. The new isolates were strictly aerobic, non-motile, coccus-shaped and utilized methane and methanol as sole carbon and energy source. Isolates grew at pH range 4.2-7.5 (optimal 5.5-6.0) and at a temperature range of 30-60°C (optimal 51-55°C). 16S rRNA gene phylogeny placed them in a well-separated branch forming a cluster together with the genus Methylocaldum as the closest relatives (93.1-94.1% sequence similarity). The genes pmoA, mxaF, and cbbL were detected, but mmoX was absent. Strains BFH1 and BFH2 are, to our knowledge, the first isolated acid-tolerant moderately thermophilic methane oxidizers of the class Gammaproteobacteria. Each strain probably denotes a novel species and they most likely represent a novel genus within the family Methylococcaceae of type I methanotrophs. Furthermore, the isolates increase our knowledge of acid-tolerant aerobic methanotrophs and signify a previously unrecognized biological methane sink in tropical ecosystems. © 2016 Islam, Torsvik, Larsen, Bodrossy, Øvreås and Birkeland.","Acid-tolerant; Gammaproteobacteria; Methanotroph; Moderately thermophilic; PMMO; Terrestrial","ampicillin; erythromycin; kanamycin; methane; nalidixic acid; streptomycin; tetracycline; acid tolerance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; biochemistry; community care; controlled study; electron microscopy; environmental factor; Gammaproteobacteria; maximum likelihood method; methanotroph; Methylococcaceae; Methylococcus capsulatus; morphological trait; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phase contrast microscopy; phylogeny; temperature; thermophilic bacterium; transmission electron microscopy; Verrucomicrobia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979998479

A primary barrier to the adoption of a cap-and-trade system is the idea that variability and uncertainty in the permit price (and hence a firm’s emissions cost) has an adverse impact on domestic manufacturing firms. An emissions tax, on the other hand, can establish a fixed, certain emissions cost. Analysis in this chapter, however, suggests that variability in the emissions cost under a cap-and-trade system is beneficial, stimulating domestic manufacturing, compared to a mean-equivalent emissions tax. Hence, if emissions intensity among foreign competitors located in the region without climate policy is high, then variability in the emissions cost decreases expected emissions from production. Although global emissions may increase after a region initiates climate policy, due to a shift in manufacturing to a region without climate policy and increased transportation, that “leakage” phenomenon might be mitigated by adopting a cap-and-trade system, compared to a mean-equivalent tax. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate Policy; Consumer Surplus; Expected Profit; Facility Location; Imperfect Competition",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118795913

Ideally, adaptation policy development should be grounded in practice; support adaptation processes that reduce social and environmental vulnerability; account for short-term variations and longer-term changes in climate; recognise the importance of scale from the local to the global; be assessed in the context of human development; and, employ participatory processes throughout its formulation and implementation. At the centre of the NSW Governmentâ€™s approach, Enabling Regional Adaptation (ERA) is an on-going, multi-region, stakeholder-led process designed to inform local and regional adaptation planning and action. ERA consists of several phases that include: integrated assessment of vulnerability at regional scale (climate and socio-economic profiling, impact pathways development, adaptive capacity assessment and identification of collective actions); development of strategic adaptation pathways, change models and process benchmarking; and, place-based dialogue on transformational adaptation with local stakeholders. ERA is supported by an adaptation architecture that includes: regional capacity building, enhancement of social capital, knowledge dissemination, research partnerships and dedicated funding. Since 2010, the project has engaged 720 regional decision-makers through 33 participatory workshops and assessed adaptation in five NSW planning regions covering 75Â % of the Stateâ€™s population and 64Â % of Local Government Areas.

Simple carbidoiimide chemistry was employed to synthesize Es-PEG-CNTs and the resulting conjugate was authenticated by various spectrometric and chromatographic techniques. The nanoplexes of the resulting conjugate were carefully optimized for maximum encapsulation of pDNA (for induction of GFP). The successful encapsulation of the pDNA within nanoplexes was assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis and DNase protection assay. Exhaustive cell culture experiments have been conducted to evaluate the potential of nanoplexes in inducing the GFP expression in estrogen positive and estrogen negative cell lines. The results revealed 19.33-fold and 3.29-fold higher in vitro transfection in estrogen positive MCF-7 cells as compared to that of plain pDNA and Lipofectamine®, respectively. The remarkably higher transfection could be attributed to the intracellular localization of the surface functionalized nanoplexes in the vicinity of nucleus with Pearson's coefficient >0.9. Interestingly, >80% cell viability was noted for Es-PEG-CNTs in contrast to that of non-functionalized CNTs and lipofectamine which were found to be relatively toxic at tested concentrations. The potential of the developed nanocarrier was also challenged by intratumoral injection in animals and similar results were also noted in in vivo experiments. To conclude, the developed nanoplexes pose great potential in delivering the pDNA for difficult to treat diseases such as cancer. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Cell culture; Cells; Cytology; Einsteinium; Electrophoresis; Gene transfer; Genes; Liposomes; Molecular biology; Yarn; Agarose gel electrophoresis; Cell viability; Chromatographic techniques; Functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes; In-vivo experiments; Intracellular localization; Intratumoral injection; Protection assay; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956969488

Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems have the potential to improve the energy generation efficiency of a city or urban region by providing energy for heating, cooling, and electricity simultaneously. The purpose of this study is to estimate the water consumption for energy generation use, carbon dioxide (CO2) and NOx emissions, and economic impact of implementing CCHP systems for five generic building types within the Atlanta metropolitan region, under various operational scenarios following the building thermal (heating and cooling) demands. Operating the CCHP system to follow the hourly thermal demand reduces CO2 emissions for most building types both with and without net metering. The system can be economically beneficial for all building types depending on the price of natural gas, the implementation of net metering, and the cost structure assumed for the CCHP system. The greatest reduction in water consumption for energy production and NOx emissions occurs when there is net metering and when the system is operated to meet the maximum yearly thermal demand, although this scenario also results in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and, in some cases, cost. CCHP systems are more economical for medium office, large office, and multifamily residential buildings. © 2016 THE AUTHORS","Air-cooled microturbines; Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP); Distributed energy generation; Net metering; Water for energy production","Buildings; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Cooling systems; Costs; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Nitrogen oxides; Security of data; Turbines; Combined cooling; Distributed energies; Energy productions; Micro turbine; Net metering; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020551879

Finding appropriate permit sellers and buyers depends on their marginal costs, enthusiasm for participating in the market and the impacts on the quality of checkpoint for waste load allocation (WLA). It was recommended that the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of WQT should be analyzed in advance for practice. This needs to estimate the projected loads, environmental standard limits, the incremental and total abatement costs, and finally to optimize WLA. In addition, the assignment of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) is required. This can be carried out through the simulation methods. However, TMDLs and WLAs with focus on limiting total nitrogen (TN) may be different to the phosphorous or biochemical oxidation demand (BOD). Therefore, the outcomes of WQT may be dependent on different factors such as the spatial location of pollutants, discharge loads, river self remediation, and economical and environmental conditions. All emphasizes on this fact that WLA using WQT requires analytical studies in different cases. This research primarily aims at finding the optimal WLA in the downstream of Sefidrud in which the trading discharge permits (TDP) based on TN may qualify the pollutants for market interactions. It intends to assess the feasibility of WQT policy and compares the analytical results to the case of Gharesoo River. Finally, the effectiveness of integrating wastewater reclamation with TDP is introduced as a solution and compared with the results of Gharesoo River. Materials and methods: The study area is limited to the downstream catchment of Sefidrud in which it starts at the spillway of Sangar Reservoir at headwater. This ends up to the Caspian Sea after 55 km length. Here, the main pollutants are identified as domestic, agricultural and industrial sources. This area receives the effluents of 10 point sources and rice farm lands. The flow rates and the projected TN load (kg/day) discharged to the surface water are estimated using the export coefficients, typical concentrations of TN and the statistical reports of their discharges as for the Gharesoo River. These were simulated by Qual2kw and the terminus point is the checkpoint. TMDLs are calculated by limiting TN to 4.5 mg/L at checkpoint. The impacts of discharge load reduction incurred by emission sources are also determined through the sensitivity analysis and normalized as previous studies. This research addresses the feasibility of nitrogen discharge permit market in Sefidrud and compares its effectiveness to the Gharesoo River. For this purpose, in the first scenario, the outcomes of conventional TDP policy are calculated and in the second scenario, its integration of wastewater reclamation market is examined. Results and discussion: The simulation results reveal that the concentrations of total and organic nitrogen can be reduced from 10 and 6.6 mg/L at checkpoint to 4.5 and 1.4 mg/L, respectively. This is conducted using the TMDL policy. This improvement may totally cost 70 billion Rials in a year in the catchment. In this regard, if the wastewater treatment operators appropriately use the secondary units, it can be expected that the classification of river based on water quality index promotes one degree. In order to study the feasibility of conventional TDP, the WLA is determined using the typical procedure outlined by previous studies. Allocation of abatement duties to the pollutants with lower marginal costs as permit sellers may decrease the annual TN abatement costs about 1340 million Rials. It only saves 2% in comparison with TMDL approach and may not receive significant outcomes. In contrary, the results of TDP in Gharesoo River approved its economical efficiency. Here, total savings may exceed 35%. This is discussed as a matter of difference in the total nitrogen discharged between the domestics and agricultural users. The ratios of nitrogen loads in domestic effluent to the agricultural drainage are, respectively, 0.58 and 0.71 for Sefidrud and Gharesoo Rivers. This ratio is introduced as an index to compare the feasibility of nitrogen discharge permit market. Since the point sources are typically assigned as permit sellers to supply credits for non-point sources, this index may imply that whether the trading has sufficient permits. Studying these two cases for nitrogen permit market indicated that in lower ratios, the market may find more limits to supply credits. In this regard, it is concluded that the success of market does not rely on the expansion of catchments. It mainly depends on the existence of centralized point-sources and the agricultural land uses. It is also confirmed that the balance between permit demand and supply is the key of a successful trade. In the second scenario, this study introduces an integration of TDP and wastewater reclamation market. This intends to find an economical solution to increase the credits for trading. If the reclaimed water is used for irrigation of crop lands, about 15 credits may be added to the conventional trading. In addition, the necessity of nitrogen removal would be reduced. This is due to the fact that the agricultural users require the nutrient contents of reclaimed water and simultaneously domestic wastewater treatment plants prefer not to remove nitrogen to sell their effluents with higher values. Consequently, marginal nitrogen abatement costs are dramatically reduced. In this regard, total cost savings would be increased to 57% and 63% in Sefidrud and Gharesoo catchments, respectively. It shows that the integration of markets not only provides more flexibility to the system but also makes markets promising as an economical solution. In the first scenario, the primary price of permits can only be determined on 150 thousands Rials. Some stakeholders and dischargers may lose their economical incentives for participation in TDP. As a result, they would leave the market and make the predicted interactions fail. In order to increase the robustness of conventional market, it is recommended that point-sources should use discount factor about 15 to 25% for credits. In this condition, the equity in benefits may increase and make market more stable. However, the shadows of unstable and breakable market turn this strategy into a challenging solution. Therefore, in the second scenario, the integration market is introduced. Regarding the analytical results, it is understood that market would be changed into a more flexible strategy that no longer is dependent on the permit price for stability. In contrary to the first scenario, the point sources are not obliged to use the discount factor. However, they would freely reduce the permit price to increase the economical incentives of the permit buyer (non-point source). It is claimed that in this scenario, the permits can be sold about 99% cheaper than the first scenario and simultaneously all sellers may use the maximum benefits obtained. These results have similarly been achieved in Gharesoo River as well. Finally, it can be discussed that using the integrated reclaimed water and discharge permit market depends on the capabilities of wastewater treatment plants to supply permits enough in regard. In other words, a highly populated city is required in the study area to provide the secondary treated wastewater and its related permits for the integrated market. Therefore, some recent studies have introduced approaches in which they may find further flexibility and economical savings in the market. For example, using artificial aeration is recommended for small areas with permanent streams in which the dissolved oxygen and BOD concentration are the major quality problems of water. Here, the integrated market is able to fill the blanks for nitrogen control and reduce more abatement costs. The second approach is to identify the amounts of tradable permits through index like dissolved oxygen where multiple pollutants such as BOD and nitrogen have to be controlled simultaneously. For example, the dischargers who are not able to provide nitrogen limits should abate more BOD in their effluents to address DO limits instead. In TDP program, this approach can increase the flexibility for pollution abatement but has high uncertainty and complexity. This is recommended to be used only in small areas with limited non-point sources. Meanwhile, the integrated market can be associated with this approach and increase its outcomes. Third approach points to the fact that in trading between point-non point sources, the seasonal demands and supplies should be considered. Therefore, in large watersheds with high non point sources, using seasonal WLA may reduce the overall abatement costs and increase the equity. However, this depends on that wastewater treatment plants should be practically able to obey various WLA policies through different seasons. Consequently, designing operationally flexible tertiary treatment units is a key factor for successful seasonally integrated discharge permit and reclaimed water market. Therefore, it can be outlined that the integrated market can be combined with different technical or management based approaches but needs to be studied in advance. The selection of optimal alternative and also permit pricing mat require an analysis based on game theory approach. Conclusion: This study concluded that water quality trading strategy is not necessarily an efficient and promising practice to manage all surface waters.","Discharge permit market; Nitrogen; Sefidrud; Wastewater reuse; Water quality trading (WQT)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012255940

Thus, in order to keep profitability of vegetable production from greenhouse sector and survive the concurrence, Polish farmers have to be widely open for innovations and look for cost and energy-effective technologies. This concerns particularly the novelties in the most expensive parameters of production – energy consumption. In this situation, the main solutions to avoid of bankruptcy for Polish agricultural biogas plants were technological changes and replacement of typical agricultural products (mainly maize silage) by different kinds of biowaste materials. The concept of this work is to analyze the possibilities of biogas plant built and connected with type-scale modern greenhouse (8 ha of surface) producing tomatoes under strict control conditions. The main idea is to use for biogas production the vegetable waste from greenhouse, from the neighborhood farms (including 4 other greenhouses) and from the local food factory. The results show that amount of thermal energy produced from biogas plant co-generation unit is many times lower in order to cover the energetic demands of greenhouse. However, in summer time this heat production can cover almost the whole thermal energy needs of the greenhouse. The profit from electric energy sale was not very important in the whole economic balance of greenhouse. However, the main profit from biogas plant was use of CO2 from co-generation unit pumped to greenhouse for acceleration of plants growth and replacement of liquid carbon dioxide – actually bought from the market with price amounted approx. 8 eurocent/kg CO2. © SGEM2016.

Interviews were undertaken and observations made in 27 communities; because the custodians of traditional knowledge were targeted, most interviewees were 70-79 years old. The view that oral traditions, particularly those referring to environmental history and the observations/precursors of environmental change, were endangered was widespread and regretted. Interviewees’ personal experiences of extreme events (natural disasters) were commonplace but no narratives of historical (unwitnessed by interviewees) events were found. In contrast, experiences of previous village relocations attributable (mainly) to environmental change were recorded in five communities while awareness of environmentally driven migration was more common. Questions about climate change elicited views dominated by religious/fatalist beliefs but included some more pragmatic ones; the confusion of climate change with climate variability, which is part of traditional knowledge, was widespread. The erosion of traditional environmental knowledge in the survey communities over recent decades has been severe and is likely to continue apace, which will reduce community self-sufficiency and resilience. Ways of conserving such knowledge and incorporating it into adaptation planning for Pacific Island communities in rural/peripheral locations should be explored. © 2016 by the author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Community; Fiji; Oral traditions; Pacific Islands; Resilience; Rural","adaptive management; climate change; cultural influence; cultural tradition; environmental change; indigenous knowledge; rural society; strategic approach; traditional knowledge; Fiji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976577512

Recently, anti-TNFα therapy has shown considerable success and is now being routinely used. Here we present a novel approach of using perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsion containing hydrogels (nanoemulgels) as imaging supported delivery systems for anti-TNF alpha probiotic delivery in IBD. To further facilitate image-guided therapy a food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis capable of TNFα-binding was engineered to incorporate infrared fluorescent protein (IRFP). This modified bacteria was then incorporated into novel PFC nanoemulgels. The nanoemulgels presented here are designed to deliver locally anti-TNFα probiotic in the lower colon and rectum and provide dual imaging signature of gel delivery (MRI) across the rectum and lower colon and bacteria release (NIR). NIR imaging data in vitro demonstrates high IRFP expressing and TNFα-binding bacteria loading in the hydrogel and complete release in 3 hours. Stability tests indicate that gels remain stable for at least 14 days showing no significant change in droplet size, zeta potential and pH. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrate the NIRF expressing bacteria L. lactis binds TNFα in vitro upon release from the gels.

SO3 produced in the boiler limits the minimum operating temperature of the SCR reactor, which affects the ability to inject ammonia and control NOx emissions during reduced-load operation. In addition, SO3 produced in the boiler and by the SCR catalyst itself forces operation with low ammonia slip to avoid air heater fouling. Consequently, SCR reactors must be operated at a higher average reactor potential, which increases catalyst consumption and further elevates SO3 production. As a result of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), utilities are faced with the need to achieve further reductions in annual and ozone-season NOx emissions, which will require reductions in their NOx emission rates during higher-load operation and the ability to maintain the SCR system in operation during reduced-load operation. SO3 removal upstream of the air heater, and ideally upstream of the SCR reactor itself, is becoming an increasingly important tool for meeting these challenges. Several examples are provided here illustrating how utilities are evaluating the concept of reducing NOx emissions by removing SO3 upstream of the air heater, and then operating their SCR system at slightly elevated levels of ammonia slip. Duke Energy has used their ""pre-SCR"" SO3 mitigation systems at the Gibson station to allow ammonia injection during reduced-load operation for over seven years. Duke is performing extensive testing in the summer of 2016 to extend this capability to allow even lower-load operation at Gibson and at other Duke plants.

Deteriorating quality of Public Transport has forced many commuters to shift from Public Transport to Personal modes. This shift has translated into ever increasing traffic congestion, air and noise pollution, Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, reduction and deterioration of public spaces and urban form, social exclusion and many other negative externalities. In order to overcome all such negative externalities, one must concentrate on laying an appropriate platform for developing sustainable cities which can balance the environmental, social and economic objectives. Sustainable transport planning refers to transport policy analysis and planning practices that support sustainable development. A critical component of sustainable transport planning is the development of a comprehensive evaluation program that evaluates the transport system performance based on an appropriate set of environmental, economic, financial and social indicators. Current study aims at development of such indicator groups which are appropriate for evaluation of intra city urban bus transport system, keeping in view the broader objective of sustainable development. Currently a unique attempt is being made to develop such evaluation process, which is suitable and mature enough to carry out a tailor made evaluation of intra city urban bus transport system with sustainability as a key node, complementing which an attempt has been made in developing an Indicator based framework to understand and evaluate the public transportation system by developing 8 Performance Indicators with 30 evaluators following which a weight based ranking system is adapted to rank the Urban Bus System as a whole. © 2016 The Authors.","Benchmarking of Sustainability; Bus System; Performance Evaluation; Public Transportation; Sustainable Benchmarking",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027964584

During 1750 the concentrations for these gases were 280 ppm, 715 ppb, and 270 ppb, respectively which increased to 379 ppm, 1774 ppb, and 319 ppb, respectively in 2005. It showed an increase of 0.23, 0.96, and 0.12% annually. The same has further increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb, and 322 ppb, respectively in 2008 representing 1.6, 1.2, and 0.9% increase, respectively from 2005 levels at an annual increase of 0.53, 0.43, and 0.31%, annually. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations, and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soils, decrease fertilizer-use efficiency, and increase evapotranspiration. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of large sections of the urban and rural populations globally. The developing countries, particularly in South Asia and Latin America, with diverse agroclimatic regions, challenging geographies, growing economies, diverse agricultural production systems, and farm typologies are more vulnerable to the effect of climate change due to heavy dependence on agriculture for livelihood. These regions also are demonstrating poor coping mechanisms to adapt to these challenges, and as a result there is evidence of negative impacts on productivity of wheat, rice, and other crops to varying extent depending on agroecologies. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and climate smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water for agriculture through microirrigation and water saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crop cultivars and biotypes through biotechnological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration through alternate production technologies and land use, and conservation of biodiversity must be promoted at regional and country level to ensure durable food and nutritional security. Reliable early warning system of environmental changes, their spatial and temporal magnitude, coupled with policies to support the diffusion of this information, can help interpret these forecasts in terms of their agronomic and economic implications for the benefit of farmers and to provide agriculture-dependent industries and policymakers with more informed options to support farmers. These countries need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance, and protection of natural resources. There is an urgent need for capacity building through international collaboration in order to develop databases and analysis systems for efficient weather forecasting as well as preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the available information on adaptation strategies and the mitigation options for climate change to meet the food security in South Asia and Latin America. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Crop diversification; Crop simulation; Greenhouse gases; Mitigation; Mulching; Sequestering; Water management",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977635744

This potential has risen hope for a future with greater energy independence and lesser urban pollution within the two main sectors power generation and transportation. In this realm, this paper presents an ex-Ante evaluation of shifting transit vehicles fleet from the current practice of gasoline fuel into natural gas fuel. The evaluation is done through probabilistic cost benefit analysis (CBA). The various options and scenarios for this shift is established taking into consideration the type of natural gas fuel, type of deployment, and stages of deployment. Costs associated with each scenario are estimated and include costs of required infrastructure and refueling stations, capital cost for vehicles, NG converters, fuel costs, life cycle vehicle operating costs and emissions. Expected benefits include direct user savings, emissions reductions, and health benefits. Scenarios of the effects of fuel price fluctuations will be addressed within the CBA analysis using the probabilistic approach. A Monte Carlo simulation will be applied to capture the variability and sensitivity of each of the input parameters, in specific the economic parameters, the interest rate and inflation rate.

Pristine FeO·Fe2O3 and NTPI-FeO·Fe2O3 nanocomposite were characterised by XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, SAED, XPS, DLS, UV, PL, life time FT-IR and magnetic hysteresis. We have extensively studied the photoluminescence and photoconductivity of both pristine FeO·Fe2O3 and NTPI-FeO·Fe2O3 nanocomposite. An enhancement in photoluminescence (PL) emission and reduced photoconductivity is observed for NTPI-FeO·Fe2O3 nanocomposite when compared to bare FeO·Fe2O3. NTPI adsorption on FeO·Fe2O3 reduces the non-radiative trap levels at the interface, resulting enhancement of PL intensity of nanocomposite. For FeO·Fe2O3, exponential rise and decay in photocurrent is observed upon UV irradiation in the ON and OFF state, respectively and unusual behavior of photocurrent is observed for NTPI-FeO·Fe2O3 composite. The NTPI behave as AIEE-active chemosensor for the detection of ferric ions in aqueous solution.

In the current environment where strict emission regulations govern virtually every ship operation, shore power has become an essential service sought by ships at berth in emission controlled ports. At present, these ships in port can receive shore power only when they are at berth, usually during the transfer of cargo or passengers. However, there are many more ships anchored in and around the ports awaiting access to berths. Efficient supply of shore power to these anchored ships is a challenge and thus they rely on their on-board power generation systems to supply essential loads. As the waiting time can vary from a few hours to weeks, emissions from these ships are significant, especially as they are clustered together in close proximity to land. Therefore, if an efficient and effective way of powering anchored ships with clean or low emission power is available, it can significantly contribute towards reducing emission around busy ports as well as the operating cost of anchored ships. In an attempt to address this problem, authors propose a floating power platform for 'offshore coldironing'. The proposed system consists of a fuel cell, a battery bank, and a small LNG engine driven generator set installed on a floating platform such as a barge and moored in close proximity to the anchored ships to supply them with their required electrical power. Nowadays, with the advancements of the fuel cell technology, installation of a suitable fuel cell stack on a floating platform such as a barge has become feasible. Nevertheless, fuel cells response slowly and thus fast dynamic loads such as dynamic positioning load in adverse sea conditions can easily push the fuel cell beyond its safe operating range, possibly creating power system instabilities that can result in blackouts. In addition, the floating platform itself needs dynamic positioning or some form of control to maintain its position relative to supplied ships, further influencing the dynamic load. The battery bank can support the fuel cell to cope with such loads. However, in extreme situations, even the battery bank will discharge rapidly and the fuel cell may struggle to charge it. Therefore, when the state of charge of the battery bank drops below a defined lower threshold, the LNG engine-driven generator set starts and provides boost power to charge the batteries. As the generator is used only when the battery charge is low, and the emission from the LNG is relatively low in comparison to other fossil fuels used on-board, the proposed system can be considered as a low emission technology solution. The feasibility of the proposed concept of floating power platform, from the power system control perspective, is investigated in this paper through modelling and simulation, with the results clearly showing the efficacy of the proposed hybrid power system to supply the dynamic loads encountered on anchored ships. © 2016 The Vietnam Maritime University.","Battery; Cold ironing; Fuel cell; LNG engine; Power management; Shore power","Barges; Battery management systems; Buoyancy; Charging (batteries); Dynamic loads; Dynamic positioning; Electric batteries; Engines; Floating breakwaters; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Power management; Secondary batteries; Ships; System stability; Battery; Cold ironing; Fuel cell technologies; LNG engines; Modelling and simulations; Power generation systems; Power system controls; Shore power; Tankers (ships)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009119548

The researchers have selected specifically 1 school from the PAO and 2 schools from the OBEC schools within a certain province. Within these 2 OBEC schools, the team has drawn one school with similar number of students to its PAO counterpart, and the other school with similar Output Unit Cost (OUC) to its PAO counterpart. The total selection has comprised of 87 schools and the gathering information are consisted of administrative data which can be categorised into several aspects namely good governance, leadership, and organisation climate, for instance. Such collective data are accumulated through the use of questionaries giving out to 14 samples of officials working within each selected PAO school, and 7 samples of officials and personnels working for each particular OBEC schools. The total number of samples are amalgamated to 812 research subjects, these data are then run and analysed using average mean and t-test with statistic significance of 0 .05. Accordingly, the findings reveal that the OBEC and PAO schools, that is to say for those with relative number of students and OUC to their counterparts, contain and hold an overall administrative functioning, even when specifically categorised using different aspects, at high level. Nevertheless, when considering the comparison between the average means across the overall administrations, basing on different aspects analysis, between all 3 main study groups, it is discovered that the PAO schools contain higher level of good governance than those of OBEC schools with relatively similar OUC. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","Decentralisation; Good governance; Leadership; Organisation climate; Primary education administration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007393646

After this situation, Colombian government and river basin authorities started developing plans and preparing actions for adaptation to climate change. Together with Dutch institutes a demonstration study and capacity building program was executed in 2013–2014. A systematic analysis of future extreme discharges (as a proxy for the risks of flooding) for the upper and middle Magdalena river basin and water shortages for the Coello sub catchment was done using state of the art downscaling and hydrological modeling tools. In this analysis plausible future projections of climate (based on IPCC fifth assessment), land use and water demand (based on expert workshops and literature) were used to explore consequences of climate change. Recent maps, data and expertise of Colombian partners contributed for necessary input data and to validate the tools used. The study is presenting main results and is discussing its limitations and replicability. Climate scenarios show a persistent increase in the occurrence of extreme rainfall events and that, as a consequence, extreme discharges like during the recent floods in 2011 are likely to increase as well. The return period of the 2011 discharge is already quite high under current climate and might increase by a factor five under climate change. For water shortages the results are more ambiguous showing both the possibility of an increase and decrease of the unmet water demand depending on different future scenarios, the water use category and location within the catchment. The unmet demand is however also under the current climate substantial. The question whether this unmet demand is critical or not could not be answered. The modest length of the reference period in comparison with time period of the ENSO phenomenon, the relatively restricted modeling effort (only using hydrological and no hydrodynamic and damage-cost models) are limitations to keep in mind when interpreting these results. There are no principle barriers for replication the methodology in countries like Colombia that in addition is steadily increasing its data, modeling and knowledge capacities. For the adaptation tipping point analysis presented in this study the main challenge is to derive the necessary objectives, sufficiently supported by the relevant stakeholders and policies, as the starting point for a targeted adaptation process. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation tipping point analysis; Capacity building; Climate change adaptation; Colombia; Flood risks; Scenarios; Water shortages",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044041979

The PCDD/F loads significantly increase between furnace exit and the entrance of the air pollution control system (APCS), i.e., in the temperature range of 450 to 250°C. In addition, co-combustion of low-calorific municipal solid waste (MSW) with sulphur-containing coal provides pathways to reduce PCDD/F creation by improving combustion conditions, reducing precursors and unburned carbon, and suppressing PCDD/F formation by the SO2 liberated.

Most existing plantation products rely heavily on visual interpretation of satellite imagery, which results in both false positives and false negatives. In this paper we aim to design an automatic framework that map plantations in large regions. Conventional classification methods cannot be directly applied due to the lack of ground-truth data. To this end, we propose a novel method that learns from multiple imperfect annotators. Since each annotator's labeling accuracy varies across different land covers due to his expertise and reference imagery, we model the annotator's reliability level to be associated with different types of locations. On the other hand, the temporal variation of land covers also greatly impacts the performance of conventional learning model. Therefore we utilize the remote sensing data which are available at multiple periods of a year and extend our proposed method by incorporating multi-instance learning. Finally, we show the superiority of the proposed method over multiple baselines in both synthetic dataset and real-world dataset. In addition, through several case studies we demonstrate that our method can achieve a better balance of precision and recall than the existing plantation products. © 2016 IEEE.","Multi-instance Learning; Multiple Annotators; Remote Sensing","Climate change; Deforestation; Mapping; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Conventional classification methods; Labeling accuracies; Large-scale plantations; Multi-instance learning; Multiple Annotators; Precision and recall; Remote sensing data; Visual interpretation; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015233431

However, it is recalcitrant to hydrolysis, and the establishment of a complete anaerobic digestion system requires a specific repertoire of microbial functions. In this study, we maintained 2-year enrichment cultures of anaerobic digestion sludge amended with cellulose or xylan to investigate whether a cellulose- or xylan-digesting microbial system could be assembled from sludge previously used to treat neither of them. While efficient methane-producing communities developed under mesophilic (35°C) incubation, they did not under thermophilic (55°C) conditions. Illumina amplicon sequencing results of the archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed that the mature cultures were much lower in richness than the inocula and were dominated by single archaeal (genus Methanobacterium) and bacterial (order Clostridiales) groups, although at finer taxonomic levels the bacteria were differentiated by substrates. Methanogenesis was primarily via the hydrogenotrophic pathway under all conditions, although the identity and growth requirements of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria were unclear. Incubation conditions (substrate and temperature) had a much greater effect than inoculum source in shaping the mature microbial community, although analysis based on unweighted UniFrac distance found that the inoculum still determined the pool from which microbes could be enriched. Overall, this study confirmed that anaerobic digestion sludge treating nonlignocellulosic material is a potential source of microbial cellulose- and xylan-digesting functions given appropriate enrichment conditions. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

The investigation results show that the decoupling elasticity of the sixteen major countries and areas differs much. During 2005 to 2009, the carbon emissions decoupling state in most developed countries shows strong decoupling relation; the carbon emissions decoupling state in most developing countries shows weak decoupling state. During 2010 to 2014, the decoupling elasticity for some countries is increased because of global economic recession since 2009 caused by 2008 financial crisis. With the existing technical conditions, carbon emissions reduction will affect economic growth in a certain extent.

Among these Cu deposits, the Tongkuangyu and Hujiayu Cu deposits constitute approximately 80 % of the total reserves. The Tongkuangyu Cu deposit, the largest copper deposit in the Zhongtiaoshan region, is hosted in quartz-monzonite porphyry (~2.1 Ga) and its wall rocks of the meta-quartz crystal tuffs of the Jiangxian Group. In contrast, the Hujiayu Cu deposit is hosted within reduced marine sedimentary sequence of the mid-Paleoproterozoic Zhongtiao Group. For decades, as these ancient deposits underwent subsequent metamorphism, the metallogenesis models of the two deposits are highly controversial. More importantly, the nature and origins of the ore-forming fluids and the mechanism of multistage fluid mineralization are still unclear. Summarizing previous researches, we systematically investigate the ore geology, fluid inclusions, and stable isotopes of the typical Tongkuangyu and Hujiayu Cu deposits. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The oxygen fugacity of hydrothermal system of the Tongkuangyu Cu deposit fluctuates near the Magnetite–Hematite (MH) buffer line, corresponding to the redox state of typical oxidized porphyry copper deposits. The main ore-forming fluids of this deposit consist of magmatic–hydrothermal fluids with middle-high temperature and high salinity. Orebody spatial structure, mineralization types, and alteration features support a porphyry copper deposit model. The formation age of the quartz-monzonite porphyry is consistent with Cu mineralization. We propose that the Tongkuangyu Cu deposit is a porphyry copper deposit formed in an arc-related extension environment. (2) Fluid inclusion studies on the Hujiayu Cu deposit show that the ore-forming fluids of the early mineralization stage are mainly characterized by high salinity and moderate temperature basinal brines. The ore-forming fluids of the late mineralization stage are characterized by CO2-rich and high salinity and high temperature metamorphic hydrothermal solutions, which obviously experience phase separation. Early stage mineralization of the Hujiayu Cu deposit may occur via interaction of oxidized Cu-bearing brines from the underlying red beds [formed after the Great Oxidation Event (GOE)] with the upper reducing carbonaceous shales. In contrast, late stage mineralization at the Hujiayu deposit is likely related to CO2escaping from metamorphic hydrothermal solutions. The Hujiayu copper deposit is a typical sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposit. The “Hu-Bi” type copper deposits can be comparable with Central Africa Copper Belt. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.","Fluid inclusions; Genetic model; North China Craton; Paleoproterozoic copper system; Zhongtiaoshan",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032728610

Natural leaves were used as precursors to prepare carbon nanodots. By adjusting the feed mass ratio of AgNO3 to carbon nanodots, the average diameter of Ag/Ag2O can be modulated from 8 to 33 nm. The effects of Ag/Ag2O deposition on the optical and photocatalytic performance of AAC in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation were systematically investigated. It was found that the Ag/Ag2O content greatly influences the photocatalytic activity of AAC nanocomposites. A suitable amount of Ag/Ag2O in the AAC system could obtain the best photocatalytic activity. The experimental results indicated that all the AAC nanocomposites showed higher photocatalytic activities compared with that of pure g-C3N4. The remarkable visible-light photocatalytic activity of AAC heterostructures could be attributed to their absorption in the visible region and low recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs because of the heterojunction formed between Ag2O and g-C3N4. In addition, Ag nanoparticles are believed to play an essential role in affecting the photoreactivity because they are able to trap electrons, further separate the electron-hole pairs, and prolong the life of electron-hole pairs. In other words, it can be concluded that the increased photocatalytic activity of AAC was attributed to the synergic effect between g-C3N4, Ag2O and Ag. It is believed that the present work could render useful information for steering the design and application of noble nanoparticle loaded g-C3N4-based heterojunction composites with high photocatalytic activity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Electrons; Excitons; Heterojunctions; Hybrid materials; Light; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Photocatalysis; Photodegradation; Silver oxides; Design and application; High photocatalytic activities; Hydrothermal treatments; Photocatalytic activities; Photocatalytic performance; Visible light photocatalytic activity; Visible-light irradiation; Visible-light-driven; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954045875

We modify the bulk aerosol module in the Community Atmosphere Model to track distributions and fluxes of 200 black carbon-like tracers emitted from different locations, and we conduct idealized experiments with and without active aerosol deposition. Changing wind patterns, studied in isolation, cause the Arctic burdens of tracers emitted from East Asia and West Europe during winter to increase about 20% by the end of the century while decreasing the Arctic burdens of North American emissions by about 30%. These changes are caused by an altered winter polar dome structure that results from Arctic amplification and inhomogeneous sea ice loss and surface warming, both of which are enhanced in the Chukchi Sea region. The resulting geostrophic wind favors Arctic transport of East Asian emissions while inhibiting poleward transport of North American emissions. When active deposition is also considered, however, Arctic burdens of emissions from northern midlatitudes show near-universal decline. This is a consequence of increased precipitation and wet removal, particularly within the Arctic, leading to decreased Arctic residence time. Simulations with present-day emissions of black carbon indicate a 13.6% reduction in the Arctic annual mean burden by the end of the 21st century, due to warming-induced transport and deposition changes, while simulations with changing climate and emissions under RCP8.5 show a 61.0% reduction. © 2016.

This paper reports on the lessons learnt about this ""group energy management system"", where ten to 15 companies or production sites regularly exchange their experiences, set joint efficiency targets and perform a yearly monitoring of their efforts. Energy efficiency networks have been implemented with great success in different settings: (1) as centrally organized instruments with an operating standard set by government (Switzerland), or with an open standard set by the state utility (China), or (2) as an open standard with a minimum specification (Germany, Austria). In every case, participation is not obligatory, but encouraged by incentives offered by the national government. Initially designed as regional company networks where energy managers could meet locally, the concept is now evolving into (1) networks of industrial branches and (2) group-internal energy efficiency networks. Other changes include: • the initial energy audit has been expanded to include demand-side management analysis and the flexibility potentials of on-site electricity generators (co-generation, standby set); • information about organizational measures and financing options is added continuously; • process-oriented workshops on energy-eficient solutions in production processes are offered to the members of all 80 networks operating in Germany (examples: solid painting, drying); • participating companies have taken their own initiatives to improve their products' energy efficiency. Innovative energy managers have even asked their plant and machinery suppliers to improve the energy performance of their products, speeding up innovation in the efficiency field. An association of energy efficiency networks (AGEEN) was founded in Germany in 2014 to develop a quality standard for operating energy efficiency networks, to promote networks in Germany, and to share their experiences and ideas for further improvements and market transparency. The German federal government launched the Energy Eficiency Network Initiative together with 22 industrial and business associations in December 2014.

Our oceans-the largest underexplored component of the Earth system-are potentially home for a large number of new resources, which can directly impact upon food security and the wellbeing of humanity. However, the extraction of these resources has repercussions for biodiversity and the oceans ability to sequester green house gases and thereby climate. In the search for ""new resources"" to unlock the economic potential of the global oceans, recent observations have identified a large unexploited biomass of mesopelagic fish living in the deep ocean. This biomass has recently been estimated to be 10 billion metric tons, 10 times larger than previous estimates however the real biomass is still in question. If we are able to exploit this community at sustainable levels without impacting upon biodiversity and compromising the oceans' ability to sequester carbon, we can produce more food and potentially many new nutraceutical products. However, to meet the needs of present generations without compromising the needs of future generations, we need to guarantee a sustainable exploitation of these resources. To do so requires a holistic assessment of the community and an understanding of the mechanisms controlling this biomass, its role in the preservation of biodiversity and its influence on climate as well as management tools able to weigh the costs and benefits of exploitation of this community. © 2016 St. John, Borja, Chust, Heath, Grigorov, Mariani, Martin and Santos.","Benefits Risks; Biodiversity; Climate regulation; Food provision; Mesopelagic community",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008678070

We compare the changes in fuel mix for primary energy consumption and for electricity generation over the past decade between regions with large and small domestic fossil fuel resources. We conclude that for newly industrialized countries rich in domestic fossil fuels, there is only a moderate or no increase in primary energy from RES, coupled with significant increases in primary energy consumption from fossil fuels although recent but preliminary data show these trends to weaken. We use the notion of a “fossil fuel curse,” which implies that it is not obvious that countries with large domestic fossil fuel resources will allow these assets to remain unexploited. This obviously imposes a tremendous threat to climate change mitigation leaving only two choices for fossil-rich economies: leave the fossil fuels in the ground and apply carbon capture technologies, both options calling for a sufficiently high cost to emit CO2 or other policy intervention in order to take place. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore and Tsinghua University Press 2016.","Climate change; Domestic; Electricity; Fossil fuel curse; Fossil fuels; Renewable","Climate change; Coal; Electricity; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Domestic; Electricity generation; Industrialized countries; Primary energy consumption; Regional distribution; Renewable; Renewable energy source; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048479227

Central-northern Namibia has semi-arid climate conditions with clearly distinctive dry and wet seasons. Rain- and floodwater harvesting for irrigation purposes are intended to increase resilience in agricultural production by building buffers for interseasonal dry spells and to make irrigation farming possible during the dry season. This is intended to improve availability of vegetables in rural parts of Namibia and to derive income on local markets. Besides raising temperatures, climate change in sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to increase rainfall variability. Therefore, these adaptations also present a precondition for adapting to future climate change. Within the project, different organisational approaches such as harvesting of rainwater at the household as well as at the communal level were tested, as well as different locally available tank construction materials. All technologies were developed in cooperation with the local communities and framed by capacity development measures which yielded very good results and enabled a diffusion of the technology in the region. Based on 5 years of research the construction of ferrocement tanks on the household level and ponds covered with shade nets on the communal level can be recommended. Due to high evaporation rates all gardens irrigated with harvested rainwater were equipped with water saving drip irrigation systems. In combination with capacity development focusing on water management this enabled the users to irrigate their gardens throughout the dry season. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Central-northern Namibia; Climate change adaptation; Floodwater harvesting; Rainwater harvesting",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069296012

Identifying potential refugia and quantifying their importance is facilitated by analytical approaches that explicitly model associations between dynamic population processes and environmental conditions. We developed a population model to project future site occupancy dynamics in spotted owls Strix occidentalis under climate change and forest-management scenarios. The model was parameterized with statistical relationships derived from dynamic occupancy analyses applied to 20 years of spotted owl presence/nondetection data in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. This approach allowed us to link colonization and extinction processes with spatial and temporal variation in vegetation characteristics, microclimate and weather while accounting for imperfect detection. Occupancy analyses indicated that greater prevalence of closed-canopy forest in owl sites was associated with lower extinction and higher colonization rates. Both rates increased following consecutive warm summers, but warm summer temperatures had a greater effect on extinction than colonization. Following the warmest summers, extinction was most likely to occur in owl sites with cool microclimates and relatively little closed-canopy forest, but extinction became considerably less likely in cool microclimates when greater amounts of closed-canopy forest were present. By comparison, extinction probability was lower at owl sites with warmer microclimates and relatively invariant to the amount of closed-canopy forest present. Simulations of our population model suggested that managing for greater amounts of closed-canopy forest may ameliorate the potential negative effects of warm summer temperatures by the mid-century, especially at high elevations. The model also allowed us to identify sites where potential management efforts would be most effective. Synthesis and applications. By modelling environmental processes influencing site colonization and extinction dynamics, we were able to identify features of potential climate change refugia for a montane species of management interest that could be promoted by land managers to increase species persistence. We also provided a general, process-based population modelling approach for projecting changes in animal populations and developing habitat-based climate change adaptation strategies using presence/nondetection data. © 2016 The Authors.

Given that The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is the meteorological modeling community's supported system, this model's characteristics and its configuration within an air quality modeling project will become of greater import. The sources of uncertainty and inaccuracy in WRF modeling should be well understood and recognized by the air quality modeling community, with every practical attempt made to increase accuracy and performance. In the meteorological modeling community, ensemble systems have been employed with considerable success in order to improve long- Term (i.e., multi-season or multi-year) accuracy of a modeling system. Each air quality modeling project that makes use of WRF modeling data is at its core a multi-year modeling system, with projects routinely requiring up to Five years of WRF model data to be used as input to the air quality model. Simple and proven ensemble modeling techniques comprised of multiple initial conditions and multiple physics configurations could be readily developed to increase multi-year skill of WRF forecasts and improve meteorological data inputs to air quality modeling systems. The benefits of incorporating simple ensemble modeling concepts were explored in order to produce increased climatological accuracy of wind speed representation at multiple terrain regions. The ensemble modeling system was shown to have improved skill and dampened bias over typical meteorological model configurations.","Meteorological modeling; MMIF; WRF","Air quality; Meteorology; Waste management; Weather forecasting; Wind; Air quality modeling; Initial conditions; Meteorological data; Meteorological modeling; MMIF; Regulatory approvals; Sources of uncertainty; Weather research and forecasting models; Uncertainty analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983378578

These stringent conditions may however not always be necessary for specific cases of carbon capture and utilization (CCU). In this manuscript, we investigate how much the parasitic energy of an adsorbent-based carbon capture process may be lowered by utilizing CO2 at 1 bar and adapting the final purity requirement for CO2 from 99% to 70% or 50%. We compare different CO2 sources: the flue gases of coal-fired or natural gas-fired power plants and ambient air. We evaluate the carbon capture performance of over 60 nanoporous materials and determine the influence of the initial and final CO2 purity on the parasitic energy of the carbon capture process. Moreover, we demonstrate the underlying principles of the parasitic energy minimization in more detail using the commercially available NaX zeolite. Finally, the calculated utilization cost of CO2 is compared with the reported prices for CO2 and published costs for CCS. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994225747

The cold flow characteristics was studied experimentally using flow visualization, hot-wire anemometer and concentration measurement. The combustion characteristics was studied numerically. The cold flow study shows that jet pulsation improved the mixing characteristics and jet spreading significantly. It was shown that jet pulsation can be used to control mixing thereby manipulate the flame characteristics to control heat release and pollutant emission. When the jet pulsation was tuned to a certain Strouhal number, the cold flow study shows that mixing is significantly improvement near the nozzle exit. Such improvement in mixing enhances the combustion characteristics. The flame length become shorter, heat release was increased and pollutant emission was reduced. At certain pulsation conditions, high temperature region appears further downstream from the burner tip. As such, flame impingement on the burner tip is reduced, which improves equipment life and reduce maintenance needs. Cold flow study infers that when the jet was excited at large pulsation intensity and low Strouhal number, the large momentum flux may blow out the fire and it becomes difficult to sustain combustion. The results of the cold flow and combustion study show that by tuning the jet pulsation to some Strouhal numbers, the heat release, flame length and emission characteristics of a swirling co-axial jets combustion can be improved compared to naturally evolving flows. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.","Co-axial jet; Mixing; Non-premixed combustion; Pulsed jet; Swirling jet",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018770322

The existence of an adaptation strategy does not, however, equal implementation of adaptation and the fact that adaptation is taking place across multiple levels also poses new challenges to its efficient implementation. The literature on barriers of adaptation has been increasing rapidly, questioning whether there is a misconception that barriers to implementation can be solved at the local level. Design/methodology/approach – This paper analyses the implementation of adaptation strategies across multiple levels of governance by focusing on the land use planning in Finland. The case study examines the implementation of adaptation in the metropolitan region of Helsinki through a policy document analysis. Findings – The conclusions highlight that there are barriers at the local level that emerge from the existing governance structures and cannot be solved by the local level alone. There needs to be a further recognition that coordination across levels of governance is a factor in overcoming barriers. Originality/value – So far, there are very few studies that have analysed barriers in relation to the implementation of adaptation in a multi-level setting, and none in the land use sector, which is inherently hierarchical in nature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Climate change; Finland; Land use sector; Multi-level governance; Planning","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; environmental policy; governance approach; implementation process; land use planning; multicriteria analysis; policy analysis; vulnerability; Finland; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971524692

This solar energy can be utilized for air-conditioning by using solar-powered adsorption refrigeration cycle. Intermittent nature of the solar radiation leads to a challenge for continuous air-conditioning operation. In the present study, a combination of solar-powered adsorption refrigeration system and thermal storage is studied. Activated carbon-ammonia and activated carbon-methanol are the working pairs of the adsorption reaction. Analytical calculation results show that activated carbon-methanol pair indicates higher coefficient of performance (COP) than activated carbon-ammonia pair, while adsorption chiller system with hot water thermal storage has higher COP than the system with ice thermal storage. For the activated carbon-methanol case with hot water thermal storage, the COP is 0.79. Since this COP analysis is based on the ideal case with uniform temperature distribution within the reactor beds, which achieves equilibrium states at the end of the reactions. In more realistic situation, the reaction process will be terminated before reaching to the equilibrium states because of the non-uniform temperature distribution and the time required for the reaction. Transient simulation in which heat transfer and reaction equation are combined will be performed to model actual reactors. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

Moreover hailstorms are a major threat to e.g. agriculture and the automobile industry causing significant economical damages and losses. Despite these significant hail-related meteorological risks no comprehensive observation-based hail climatology for Germany exists. In this study we present a new approach to this task, combining radar data with different kinds of hail reports, such as ground observation and agricultural insurance data. Preprocessing ensures the applicability of the radar data for the presented climatological analysis. In this sense a number of detection methods are applied to filter artefacts, especially clutter pixels and spokes that disrupt radar measurements. To construct a reliable hail climatology for Germany we process all information into a 10-year based annual average number of hail days on a 1 km × 1 km grid using a two-path hail criterion. While the first path combines a threshold of 50 dBZ with a hail report, the second path is based on a 55 dBZ threshold only. By adding radar data we increase the spatial representativity of the ground based hail reports and gain additional information in regions which lack observational data. Overall, the results are mainly determined by events derived from the first path (68%). A validation of our dataset at 65 stations of Deutscher Wetterdienst shows that the method slightly underestimates the number of hail days, especially for mountainous regions. This results in a better adaption of the hail criterion to lowlands. The resulting hail frequency map shows an increase in the average number of hail days per year from north to south. In particular, hailstorms occur less frequently in the Central North German Plain and the Mecklenburg Coastal Lowland, whereas the highest number of hail days occurs mostly in the uplands of the Black Forest and the Swabian Jura, but also in the Rhenish Massif, the Alpine Foreland and the Lower Rhine Plain. Moreover, the Feldberg region in the Southern Black Forest shows the highest number of hail days per year. © 2016 The authors.","Climatology; Hail; Insurance; Weather radar","climatology; data set; hail; insurance system; radar; spatial data; upland region; Alps; Baden-Wurttemberg; Black Forest; Germany; Hesse; Kleiner Feldberg; Mecklenburg; Prealps; Rhenish Schiefergebirge; Swabian Alb; Taunus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988893979

They can thereby help to mitigate climate change-induced impacts and serve as proactive adaptation options for municipalities. We explore the various contexts in which nature-based solutions are relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban areas, identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and related knowledge gaps. In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning. © 2016 by the author(s).","Climate change; Cobenefits; Governance; Nature-based solutions; Urban areas","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; knowledge; sustainable development; urban area; urban planning; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976601114

In those regions, climate change projections suggest further reductions in freshwater supplies and increases of the recurrence, longevity and intensity of drought events. At present, one important question for policy debate is the identification of water policies that could address the mounting water scarcity problems. Suitable policies should improve economic efficiency, achieve environmental sustainability, and meet equity needs. This paper develops and applies an integrated hydro-economic model that links hydrological, economic and environmental elements to such issues. The model is used to conduct a direct comparison of water markets, water pricing and institutional cooperation, based on their economic, environmental and equity outcomes. The analysis is performed in the Jucar Basin of Spain, which is a good natural experiment for studying water scarcity and climate change policies. Results indicate that both institutional and water market policies are high performing instruments to limit the economic damage costs of droughts, achieving almost the same social benefits. However, the environmental effects of water markets are worrying. Another important finding is that water pricing is a poor policy option not only in terms of private and environmental benefits but also in terms of equity. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change; Economic and environmental benefits; Hydro-economic modeling; Water policies; Water scarcity","Arid regions; Commerce; Costs; Drought; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental protection; Sustainable development; Water management; Arid and semi-arid regions; Climate change policies; Climate change projections; Economic and environmental benefits; Economic modeling; Environmental sustainability; Water policies; Water scarcity; Climate change; climate change; cost analysis; drought; environmental effect; environmental issue; environmental policy; market system; numerical model; policy making; resource scarcity; semiarid region; sustainability; water management; water supply; Jucar Basin; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960093457

To this end, piston engines enable isochoric combustion and augment the conventional Joule/Brayton cycle, thereby producing a composite cycle. An engine concept is chosen based on idealized parametric studies of simplified representations of the cycle as well as qualitative measures embracing weight, size, efficiency, emissions, operational behavior, and the life cycle. The most beneficial mechanical representation of the composite cycle engine in this study features crankshaft-equipped piston engines driving separate piston compressors, a high-pressure turbine driving an axial intermediate pressure turbocompressor, and a low-pressure turbine driving the fan. The powerplant performance calculations show radical improvements in thrust-specific fuel consumption of 17.5% during cruise. Although engine weight increases correspondingly by 31%, a fuel burn reduction of 15.2% can be shown for regional operations at aircraft level relative to year-2025 engine technology. The concept is capable of meeting the emission reduction targets for carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides aspired to by the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda targets for carbon dioxide in 2035 and for nitrogen oxides in 2050.

Over the decades, the achievement of further significant improvements has become progressively challenging, and the increase of efficiency approaches physical limitations. In order to meet the ambitious long-Term emission reduction targets, the introduction of radical new propulsion system concepts is indispensable. Various cycles promising significant efficiency improvements over the conventional Joule-/Brayton-cycle are being examined by the engine community. However, as no clear favorite has emerged from these potential technical solutions, a transparent methodological approach for the consistent evaluation of the concepts is necessary. Consistent thermodynamic description and performance metrics for three engine cycles are presented in this paper: The turbofan as reference and two radical engine cycles, namely the composite cycle and the cycle-integrated parallel hybrid. Laws for the estimation of component performance for large parametric variations are introduced. A method for the estimation of power plant system mass for the investigated engine cycles is proposed to evaluate fuel burn reduction. The studies substantiated that the turbofan improvement potential is saturating. The composite cycle engine offers a tremendous potential for fuel burn improvement of 24.5% over state of the art turbofan engines, which allows meeting the emission reduction targets in 2035. The cycle-integrated parallel hybrid engine improves the turbofan moderately with year 2035 technology, but is not capable of meeting the corresponding emission reduction targets on a short-To-medium range aircraft platform. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Aircraft engines; Blowers; Efficiency; Emission control; Engines; Propulsion; Thermodynamic properties; Thermodynamics; Turbofan engines; Turbomachinery; Component performance; Efficiency improvement; Emission reduction targets; Methodological approach; Parametric variation; Physical limitations; Thermodynamic description; Thermodynamic evaluation; Marine engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991383393

Identification of technical, institutional and policy interventions as coping and adaptation strategies and exploring risks of their adoption for smallholder farms are the important areas to consider. The aim of the present study was to carry out an in-depth analysis of adaptation strategies followed and the associated risk premium in technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach: The study was carried out in the dryland systems of three Indian states – Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan – and was based on a survey of 1,019 households in 2013. The flexible moment-based approach was used for estimating the stochastic production function, which allowed estimation of the relative risk premium that farmers are willing to pay while adopting the technologies to avoid crop production risks. Findings: In all the three states, the risk premium (INR ha−1) was higher for farm mechanization compared to supplemental irrigation, except in the case of Andhra Pradesh. The higher the level of technology adoption, the higher the risk premium that households have to pay. This can be estimated by the higher investment needed to build infrastructure for farm mechanization and supplemental irrigation in the regions. The key determinants of technology adoption in the context of smallholder farmers were climatic shocks, investment in farm infrastructure, location of the farm, farm size, household health status, level of education, married years, expected profit and livestock ownership. Originality/value: Quantification of the risk premium in technology adoption and conducting associated awareness programs for farmers and decision-makers are important to strengthen evidence-based adoption decisions in the dryland systems of India. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Dryland system; Flexible moment-based approach; Risk premium; Technology adoption","climate change; crop production; decision making; education; farm size; health status; integrated approach; investment; policy analysis; risk assessment; smallholder; technology adoption; willingness to pay; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999788868

Design/methodology/approach: The authors start with a short overview of the visits made to City West (a shopping district), Bikini Berlin (a shopping centre), Visit Berlin (a destination management organisation), Leopoldplatz (a public square), Brunnenstrasse and Bayerischer Platz Quartier (both neighbourhoods), Markthalle IX (a covered market) and Prinzessinnengarten (an urban garden) before identifying some key lessons learnt. Findings: The eight visits made as part of the study trip offered a brief but diverse insight into how different areas and functions of the city were managed, maintained, developed and promoted. Key lessons learnt and identified in the paper are as follows. Place management, as a practice, consists of people with passion working in partnership within the context of a place “patch”. Place management is practiced somewhere, and that somewhere has its own political, legal, economic, technological and social environment. People learn more about places in places. Place management is more akin to gardening than architecture. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions drawn in this paper are based, predominantly, upon the observations of the study trip facilitators, along with some comments and feedback from the delegates. Practical implications: Place managers can and should learn from each other. Other places and people can be a source of inspiration – not necessarily providing a readily transferable solution (as the legal or political environments may not be conducive to carbon-copy interventions) – but offering alternative perspectives and approaches which can then be contextualised and adapted locally. Social implications: Enlarging the pool of information and evidence from which practitioners can draw from when solving place problems can ultimately lead to places that are more successful, liveable and equitable. Originality/value: Many place managers are volunteers or may not have access to a professional development budget. The authors hope that this paper can help to share the reflections of one study tour with a much wider audience. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Neighbourhoods; Place management; Place marketing; Shopping centres; Tourism; Urban commons",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992751270

Three different tools, i.e., GREET, MOVES2014, and Mixed-use-trip generation model, were used to determine the GHG emission trends. Diesel fuel run transit buses were the highest emitter of GHG all over the 20-yr span, with the highest being 420.911 thousand ton in the year 2025. On an average, the emissions from diesel oil combustion are 5-88% higher than the emissions resulting from all other pollution control strategies. Biodiesel fuel was the most efficient to reduce GHG emission followed by natural gas and its blends, land-use planning and inspection, and maintenance of transit buses. CO2 emissions of 80% can be achieved if the control strategies were to be used as in the best case scenario in Ohio over a 10-yr period starting in 2015.

The presentation for Greece will be carried out in conjunction with the analysis of the related trends for the European Union of 15 members (EU-15) and EU-28 given the fact that Greece constitutes one of the 28 members of European Union, as well as one of 15 members constituting the European Union before its enlargement in 2004. In general, waste sector is the fourth largest sector in Greece, contributing 4.3 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 (excluding Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry, LULUCF), while GHG emissions from waste decreased by 19.6 % in 2012 compared to 1990 levels, based on the latest official GHG inventory for the country. Similarly, the waste sector is the fourth largest sector in the EU-28 with approximately 3.1 % contribution on the total GHG emissions for 2012, while the total decrease over the period 1990–2012 is about 31.5 %. In a next step, the projection of the evolution of the emissions for the period 2012–2030 including the impact of the implemented, adopted and planned policies and measures for the mitigation of the emissions will be provided.

Through their functional traits and interactions with both abiotic and biotic environment, they also significantly affect the process of open land colonization by trees as well as vegetation succession coupled with soil and ecosystem development. Here we review the role of ECM fungi in the early primary and secondary succession following major anthropogenic disturbances. Based on the examples of mine spoils and post-agricultural lands, we demonstrate key ecosystem services provided by ECM fungi in the processes of forest restoration. We point out ecological mechanisms and adaptations which underpin ECM fungal community successional interactions, particularly life histories, dispersal, spatial structure, host preferences, and sensitivity to environmental filters. We emphasize the need of better understanding the role of ECM fungi in the forest restoration practice as it seems crucial for afforestation success and biodiversity rehabilitation. Thus, ectomycorrhizal traits should be a prime consideration in afforestation and carbon sequestration polices, sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation practices. © 2016 Polska Akademia Nauk.

On the other hand, the image of hibernoma on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) is different from that of other lipogenic tumors. However, fewer studies have investigated the typical features of hibernoma on PET scans. We present the case of a hibernoma that was incidentally detected on 18F-FDG-PET. Case Presentation: A 48-year-old Asian man underwent 18F-FDG-PET for routine follow-up of gastric cancer. The patient reported a painless soft mass on the upper arm that had persisted for several years. On 18F-FDG-PET, the mass showed a maximum standardized uptake value of 9.6. The mass showed high intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans, and showed focally enhanced septa after gadolinium administration. The mass was surgically resected. Histopathologically, the mass was composed of brown adipose cells characteristic of hibernoma. His postoperative course was uneventful, and there was no local recurrence at the final 24-month follow-up. Conclusion: Hibernoma showed strong uniform accumulation on 18F-FDG-PET, suggesting that 18F-FDG-PET would be a useful modality for the differential diagnosis of hibernoma versus other lipogenic tumors. © 2016 The Author(s).

Reducing methane emissions from ruminants is needed to ensure sustainable animal production in the future. Methane yield varies naturally in sheep and is a heritable trait that can be used to select animals that yield less methane per unit of feed eaten. We previously demonstrated elevated expression of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway genes of methanogenic archaea in the rumens of high methane yield (HMY) sheep compared to their low methane yield (LMY) counterparts. Methane production in the rumen is strongly connected to microbial hydrogen production through fermentation processes. In this study, we investigate the contribution that rumen bacteria make to methane yield phenotypes in sheep. Results: Using deep sequence metagenome and metatranscriptome datasets in combination with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from HMY and LMY sheep, we show enrichment of lactate-producing Sharpea spp. in LMY sheep bacterial communities. Increased gene and transcript abundances for sugar import and utilisation and production of lactate, propionate and butyrate were also observed in LMY animals. Sharpea azabuensis and Megasphaera spp. act as important drivers of lactate production and utilisation according to phylogenetic analysis and read mappings. Conclusions: Our findings show that the rumen microbiome in LMY animals supports a rapid heterofermentative growth, leading to lactate production. We postulate that lactate is subsequently metabolised mainly to butyrate in LMY animals, producing 2 mol of hydrogen and 0.5 mol of methane per mol hexose, which represents 24 % less than the 0.66 mol of methane formed from the 2.66 mol of hydrogen produced if hexose fermentation was directly to acetate and butyrate. These findings are consistent with the theory that a smaller rumen size with a higher turnover rate, where rapid heterofermentative growth would be an advantage, results in lower hydrogen production and lower methane formation. Together with previous methanogen gene expression data, this builds a strong concept of how animal traits and microbial communities shape the methane phenotype in sheep. © 2016 The Author(s).","Bacteria; Lactate production; Lactate utilisation; Metagenomics; Metatranscriptomics; Methane; Sheep rumen","acetic acid; acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase; butyric acid; lactate dehydrogenase; lactic acid; methane; propionic acid; RNA 16S; butyric acid derivative; fatty acid; hexose; lactic acid; methane; propionic acid derivative; amino acid synthesis; Article; Erysipelotrichaceae; fatty acid metabolism; gas evolution; gene cluster; gene expression; gene mapping; gene sequence; genetic transcription; Lachnospiraceae; Megasphaera; metagenome; microbial community; nonhuman; phenotype; Prevotellaceae; priority journal; rumen microorganism; Ruminococcaceae; sequence homology; sheep; animal; bacterium; classification; DNA sequence; fermentation; genetics; greenhouse effect; high throughput sequencing; Lactobacillaceae; metabolism; metagenome; microbiology; microflora; nucleotide sequence; physiology; rumen; Animals; Bacteria; Base Sequence; Butyrates; Fatty Acids; Fermentation; Global Warming; Hexoses; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Lactic Acid; Lactobacillaceae; Metagenome; Methane; Microbiota; Propionates; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rumen; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sheep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995791150

Since the energy moves in both directions, it is possible to connect new sources of energy any time, because the system circuit is already active.

This innovative system design facilitates a participatory environment where researchers with different expertise can work together efficiently. The utilization of the Web technologies avoids complex installations on the user's computer and makes maintenance and update of the system on the centralized server simple. MOSAICC is based on open-source technology and models thus it is transferrable to countries free-of-charge. The easy-to-use interface and data sharing/exchange through central database support interdisciplinary cooperation among local experts as the chain of simulations and data are transparent to users. Visualization and communication of the results in graphs and maps on the Web are integral parts of the system. The implementation strategy of MOSAICC in countries emphasizes stakeholder involvement in a technical working group throughout the study in order to produce information that is truly necessary in the country.

It is a huge challenge is to achieve these goals in northern countries where traditional energy saving measures - insulation, window performance, heat recovery from ventilation systems - balance on the border of cost optimality. New solutions have to be implemented in the field of energy saving and storing. The biomimicry approach imitates processes found in nature to solve human problems that can provide conceptually new solutions. The example of northern mammals can serve as inspiration - fatty tissue functions as thermal insulator of the body, but phase change properties of the lipids are also used to store and release heat. Phase change materials (PCM) have received much attention as an alternative for energy saving and storing. The energy demand for heating the building and thus CO2 emissions can be reduced by the amount of latent heat stored in PCMs. Lately different concepts on PCM integration in the building envelope are emerging - built-in walls, ceilings, floors, as a thin layer or large storage tanks. In order to create new PCM integrated building components - a solar thermal façade system appropriate PCM has to be chosen. This paper reviews the selection of PCM in melting temperature range 21-22C.","biomimicry; latent heat storage; phase change materials; solar thermal façade","Biomimetics; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Environmental technology; Heat storage; Latent heat; Solar buildings; Solar heating; Ventilation; Waste heat; Biomimicry; Energy performance of buildings; Energy-saving measures; Integrated buildings; Phase change property; Solar thermal; Ventilation systems; Zero energy building (ZEB); Phase change materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999287195

Manufacturers produce vehicles to maximize profit, given available public infrastructure and government incentives. EVpublic adoption depends not only on price and vehicle attributes, but also on EV market size and infrastructure available for refueling, such as charging station proximity and recharging length and cost. Earlier studies have shown that government investment can create EV market growth, and that manufacturers and charging station operators must cooperate to achieve overall profitability. This article describes a framework that connects decisions by the three stakeholders (government, EV manufacturer, charging station operator) with preferences of the driving public. The goal is to develop a framework that allows the effect of government investment on the EV market to be quantified. This is illustrated in three scenarios in which we compare optimal public investment for a city in USA (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and one in China (Beijing) to minimize emissions, accounting for customer preferences elicited from surveys conducted in the two countries. Under the modeling assumptions of the framework, we find that high customer sensitivity to prices, combined withmanufacturer and charging station operator profitmaximization strategies, can render government investment in EV subsidies ineffective, while a collaboration among stakeholders can achieve both emission reduction and profitability. When EV and station designs improve beyond a certain threshold, government investment influence on EV adoption is attenuated apparently due to diminishing customer willingness to buy. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that a diversified government investment portfolio could be especially effective for the Chinese market, with charging costs and price cuts on license plate fees being as important as EV subsidies. © The Author(s) 2016.","Design formarket systems; Energy policy design; Service design; Vehicle electrification","Automobile manufacture; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; License plates (automobile); Profitability; Sales; Customer preferences; Emission reduction; Government incentive; Government investment; Public infrastructures; Public investments; Service design; Vehicle electrifications; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994014561

They are one of the most productive environments and cradles for biological diversity. They are considered as wealth of carbon storage and provide a potential sink for global atmospheric carbon, but the role of the wetlands in carbon sequestration storage has been under estimated. The recent increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to growing concern among the public and scientific community to identify the potential of various ecosystem to sequester more carbon. There is growing interest among researchers to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol to stabilize the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and global warming through managing wetland restoration and conservation projects to exploit the carbon sequestration potential. The objective of the present study is to assess the soil organic carbon (SOC) in different sites of Loktak Lake to estimate the carbon stock and provide their potential of carbon sequestration capacity. The result from the analysis of SOC density ranges from 0.70kg/m2 to 6.57kg/m2 at a depth of 0... 10 cm and density varies during the season with maximum SOC of 5.18kg/m2 during post monsoon and 3.19kg/m2 during winter.

Exploiting it locally in machines would enable optimising their operation and, thus, yield competitive advantage and reduce environmental load due to reduced emissions. However, optimisation requires extensive knowledge about machine performance and characteristics in various conditions. As physical machines may be located geographically far from each other, the management of ever evolving knowledge is challenging. This study introduces a software concept to enable centralised management of data refinement performed locally in the machines of a geographically distributed fleet. It facilitates data utilisation in end user applications that provide useful information for operators in the field. Whatever the further data analysis requirements are, multiple preprocessing tasks are performed: it enables outlier limit configuration, the calculation of derived variables, data set categorisation and context recognition. A functional prototype has been implemented for the refinement of real operational data collected from forestry machines. The results show that the concept has considerable potential to bring added value for enterprises due to improved possibilities in managing data utilization.

The NIST REFPROP subroutines and tables were seamlessly integrated with the code to evaluate supercritical CO2 properties.

The Reactor Coolant System of the small modular reactor (SMR) is modeled after a scaled-down commercial Westinghouse PWR. Using classical control mechanisms applied in light water reactors, control strategies were developed to maintain the compressor inlet conditions away from the pseudo-critical region to avoid compressor surge instabilities. Off-design characteristic curves for turbomachinery were used for real gas machines, since the actual design curves for the SCO2 turbomachinery were not available. The SCO2 /PCS control systems were tuned and tested for a wide range of operational transients from 20% power changes up to 50% loss of load.

Energy can be a significant driver for the health and welfare of residents, and the growth and development of business, as well as energy stability for cities and communities of all sizes. The world is in a period of growing energy insecurity, and municipal and business leaders are focusing attention on improving the energy resiliency of their towns and cities. Worries over escalating carbon emissions are adding urgency and uncertainty for policy makers seeking to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change. These issues highlight the need to develop energy infrastructure at a local level, which maximizes resource efficiency and exploits indigenous opportunities. Such steps enhance the energy security and resilience of local communities and shield them from the negative impacts of rising and volatile global energy markets. The city of Tuzla recognized this issue 10 years ago. District heating has been recognized as key measure for ensuring long-term energy security, due its technological flexibility and the capability of networks to be switched to renewable and local resources. Energy efficiency improvement and optimal management of CHP district heating system of the city of Tuzla have showed the best result in the last three heating season. The difference in heating energy savings with regard to heating season 2012/2013 - 7,848 MWh is result of improving management strategy of district heating system. Total energy savings in season 2014/2015 were 90,533 MWh, difference in heating energy savings with regard to last heating season - 5,401 MWh. The outdoor temperature in season 2014/2015 was lower for 1.24°C. Total electricity savings in the seasons 2011/2012, 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 was 59,750 € - 19.92% concerning base season 2010/2011. The electricity bill for one day in the seasons 2011/2012, 201/2013 and 2013/2014 decreased for 23%. With the last season (2014/2015) electricity bill for one day decreased for 27%. We started with 1,538 €/day and now we have achieved 1,123 €/day. All these results have enabled extension of district heating network (system). City of Tuzla in the last 15 years financed connection 337 objects to district heating system (4000 dwellings) with 257,000 m2 of heated area. The total amount of connected heated area in the last 15 years is 700,000 m2 and new 8,747 users. District heating infrastructures have an important role to play in the task of increasing energy efficiency and thus making these scarce resources meet future demands. It already became clear that improving the efficiency of energy production, distribution and consumption is a key method of climate change mitigation. Preparing for such instability also increases economic competitiveness. Cities and communities that take steps to improve their energy security and resilience are more attractive to businesses, which provide employment for residents who will, in return, be attracted by a lower-cost, less polluting, and more secure energy supply. Sustainable development is the only way to achieve the vitally needed harmony between economic growth, social progress and environmental protection. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","Efficiency; Energy challenges; Local community; Strategy; Sustainable energy","Climate change; District heating; Economics; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Heating equipment; Network security; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; District heating networks; Economic competitiveness; Energy challenges; Energy efficiency improvements; Local community; Strategy; Sustainable energy; Energy management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084245391

Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around long-term average conditions. Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as global warming. Shifting temperatures are climbing and sea levels are rising. And meanwhile, our planet must still supply us and all living things with air, water, food and safe places to live. If we don't act now, climate change will rapidly alter the lands and waters we all depend upon for survival, leaving our children and grandchildren with a very different world. The most important task of all countries in the face of climate change is to make efforts to reduce climate change and spend more time to anticipate and prevent its risks. The efforts and actions can be done in the current situation are including natural resource conservation, development of green spaces, reduction of power consumption of fossil fuels, saving in consumption, recycling and reduction of waste, sewage treatment, use of renewable energy sources and implementation of appropriate educational programs. The remarkable thing is that these actions by the government alone cannot be done and, thus, all persons in any country should play their role. This requires environmental education in the field of climate change for people to deal with these issues correctly. Thus, in last decade in various countries, study has been done in the field of education to climate change. But reviews of these studies, particularly in Iran, shows that adequate studies have not yet been done to educate climate change in the educational system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is development of the climate change education plan in the formal education system. Materials and methods: Iran formal education system: educational system of Iran is comprised of three sections. These three sections include formal, informal and implicit. In this study, the third grade of the first period of high school is considered as a case study to develop a climate change education plan. Education in the educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard is in four steps; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation. In the Figure (1), the educational process management is represented according to ISO 10015 standard. (Figure Presented) Results and discussion: As mentioned above in this study, climate change education plan for third grade of the first period of high school is developed based on educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard. Education in this system in four steps includes; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation of results. Needs assessment The results show that, the most important educational needs, which are obtained with Fish Bowl technique, as follows are; introduction of basic concepts, current state of climate, climate change causes, effects and impacts, solutions and strategies for prevention, and mitigation and adaptation to climate change (Table 1). (Table Presented) Educational designing and planning Educational designing and planning was done in the five steps, which the goals are: Development thinking about the climate change, increase in student knowledge in this field, training of appropriate personnel to manage climate change. (Table Presented) In the implementation of education, teacher is operator training and the Ministry of Education is in the form of Education Office and schools can support teachers in monitoring the implementation. In the evaluation step, the teacher in addition to the evaluation of classroom sessions should do a final evaluation. Thus, the evaluation should be a combination of formative and final assessment, which recommended the use of goal oriented Tyler pattern. Conclusion: Accurate knowledge about the effects of climate change is essential as a key factor for conscious action and the formation of a person's determination to deal with the effects of climate change. Studies from around the world have observed an unfortunate chain of students not being given an adequate and accurate education on climate change, of teachers not knowing how or what to teach, and of the public that is misinformed about these issues. The structure proposed in this study to climate change education determined the contents that require students to do need assessments. This is based on educational designing and planning. Therefore, the teachers with use of educational designing and planning and on the job training increase their knowledge in this field and it will teach the students.","Climate change; Climate change education; Environmental education; Formal education system; ISO 10015 standard",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012283833

Failure strain predicted from the uniaxial tensile testing cannot be applied to the bi-axial or tri-axial stress state. ASME Sec VIII-Div-2, and -3 codes give methods to predict the failure strain for multi-axial stress state by considering the triaxiality factor, which is defined as the ratio of mean stress to the equivalent stress. Failure strain predicted by the ASME method (based on the Rice-Tracey ductile failure model) is an exponential curve that relates the failure strain to the triaxiality factor. The ASME VIII-3 method also gives procedures to calculate failure strain for various material types: ferritic, stainless steel, nickel alloy, aluminum, etc. Experimental results of failure strain at various stress states show that the failure strain is not only a function of the triaxiality factor, but also a function of the Lode angle. The Lode angle takes on the value of 1, 0, and -1 for tension, pure shear, and compression stress state, respectively. Experimental data shows that the failure strain is a 3D surface which has an exponential relation with triaxiality and a parabolic relation with the Lode angle. To validate the ASME failure strain prediction, this paper compares experimental failure strain test data from literature with the ASME predictions. The ASME predictions are non-conservative especially for moderately ductile materials such as aluminum and high strength carbon steel. A reduction factor on failure strain for low ductile material is presented using the relation between the R (yield/ultimate) and the stress ratio (shear/tensile stress).. The ASME method does not account for the environmental effects while calculating the failure strain. High pressure, high temperature (HPHT) subsea components designed using ASME VIII-3 code are subjected to various environments in subsea, such as seawater, seawater with cathodic protection (CP) and production fluid (crude oil). Experimental data shows that the Elongation (EL) and/or Reduction in Area (RA) from tensile testing decrease in these environments. Therefore, to account for any environment effect on the failure strain, reduced EL and RA can be used to predict the failure strain.

The soil properties were measured as gravel percent, particle size distribution, bulk density, OC and N. Results of analysis of variance showed no significant difference of soil OC among garden and rangelands but there was a significant difference for N and higher values were obtained in the garden site. The C/N ratios were similar in both rangelands and they were significantly higher than that for garden. Moreover, the values of OC, N stock and C/N ratio were lower in subsurface layer of soils. The correlation between traits indicated that the values of OC, N and C/N ratio had a significant correlation with soil particle size distribution. Both N and OC stock were positively correlated with clay, soil N content, soil OC and negatively correlated with sand%, silt%, gravel and bulk density.

Emission limits are allocated among subject utilities and other sources of emissions, and subject utilities can buy and sell those emission rights to each other. In 2006, California passed Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), which required the state to cut its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In 2012, California implemented GHG emission caps and an emission rights trading system to further this goal, with reductions in emissions beginning in 2013 Four states (California, New York, Oregon and Washington) have implemented CO2 emission performance standards that limit GHG emissions on new or expanded electric generation facilities.

Why are you in the decentralized wastewater industry? I joined the wastewater industry to interact directly with society and protect public health.I joined the decentralized wastewater industry because it is the most environmentally-sound, passive form of wastewater treatment and recycling. But what is truly saved by using decentralized wastewater treatment? And what can we do as an industry to help negate the growing environmental and fiscal problems facing society today? The environmental and economic benefits provided through the manufacture and construction of onsite (decentralized) wastewater systems versus centralized wastewater treatment plants were quantitativelyexamined through an analysis of embodied energy, embodied carbon, and the cost of each system type. The average decentralized system versus connecting to a sewer extension were found to reduce embodied energy, embodied carbon, and cost by 75%, 73%, and 68%, respectively. With the clear environmental and economic benefits associated with decentralized wastewater treatment systems, it is imperative that local, state, and national regulators shift the focus of wastewater treatment from centralized sewer systems to the more sustainable decentralized model. Doing so will greatly aid in the efforts to reduce the carbon footprint associated with development as well as reduce the cost of development for both government entities and end users. In addition, the environmental impacts of both a precast concrete septic tank and gravel/pipe drainfield (conventional) onsite systems and systems using recycled thermoplastics were evaluated. Water consumption, electricity consumption, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions were evaluated through raw material production, product manufacturing and transportation for both systems. It was determined that when transporting a recycled thermoplastic system 1,030 miand a conventional system only 30 mi, the recycled system reduced electricity consumption by 88%, fuel consumption by 67%, water consumption by 97%, and carbon emissions by 44%. Our everyday choices as members of the decentralized wastewater industry have an impact on the environment around us. What if we, as an industry, stood up through our local representatives and legislators to push for more funding of decentralized systems? What if we made daily choices that express our concern of the environment and chose to operate sustainably? We, as an industry, have the opportunity to lead-to build a sustainable and inspiring industry that gathers young, eager minds, ready to change the world. Let's grasp the opportunity.

The pore sizes in organic nanopores are small such that the mean free path of gas molecules become comparable to the characteristic length of the system. The objective of this work is to fulfill the need for the investigation of flow of different gases with unlike adsorption characteristics and examining the contribution of the adsorbed phase to total mass flux. In this study, adsorption and transport of three different gases, argon, methane, and neon, are investigated by performing the dual control volume grand canonical molecular dynamics (DCV-GCMD) simulation in identical setups of carbon nanocapillarys. The simulations are performed for two capillaries of of 2 and 4 nm in diameter for a wide range of pressures and pressure gradients. The velocity, density, and molecular fluxes of these gases are computed and compared with each other. Based on the MD simulation results, as the pressure of the system increases, the number of gas molecules adsorbing to the nanocapillary walls increases to reach a state of full single-layer coverage. Normalized velocity profiles with average gas velocities show that for all gases in both nanocapillary diameters, flow profiles are plug shaped. Furthermore, it is found that the Knudsen diffusion model underestimates the molecular fluxes in carbon nanocapillaries by one order of magnitude. This underestimation is shown to be a function of excess adsorption amount and it is not a strong function of the pore size or the pore pressure.

To facilitate increased use of such ""aggregate subgrade"" materials, IDOT has recently introduced new gradation bands. However, performance of such recycled aggregate subgrade materials within the bounds of current design framework is largely unknown. To this end, a full scale accelerated pavement test study was undertaken to study six different aggregate subgrade materials involving construction of twelve full scale flexible pavement sections over weak engineered subgrade. Results of accelerated pavement testing on six test sections and performance of three different aggregate subgrade materials are highlighted in this paper including data from quality control tests such as nuclear density gauge, GeoGauge for composite layer modulus, and lightweight and falling weight deflectometers. Current pavement design framework was adequate when designing with two out of three aggregate subgrade materials that constituted different proportions of recycled materials.

Estimates of financing requirements are provided for multiple sectors, including sustainable energy, infrastructure (including for environmental protection), environmental remediation, industrial pollution control, energy and water efficiency, and green products. The context to China's green financing is discussed, covering urbanization, climate change, interactions between infrastructure sectors, and the transformation of industry. Much of the infrastructure financing will occur in cities, with a focus on equity, environmental protection, and quality of life under the National New-Type Urbanization Plan (2014–2020). China has implemented many successful policies in the building sector, but there is still considerable scope for improvement in the energy efficiency of Chinese buildings. China is currently pursuing low-carbon growth strategies that are consistent with its overall environmental and quality-of-life objectives. Beyond 2020, China's future as an ecologically balanced civilization will rest on the implementation of a central infrastructure policy: China 2050 High Renewable Energy Penetration Scenario and Roadmap Study. As exemplified by the Circular Economy Development Strategy and Near-Term Action Plan, an essential part of China's green industrial transformation involves engineering systems that conserve materials, thereby reducing or even eliminating wastes. To better understand changes to China's economy under its green transformation and to unlock large potential sources of finance, it is necessary to undertake a fuller examination of all of China's infrastructure sectors, particularly freight rail infrastructure and ports. Large investments are required to clean up a legacy of environmental contamination of soil and groundwater and to reduce industrial pollution. Transformation of the power sector away from coal will avoid some industrial treatment costs. The contribution of engineers in planning, designing, and constructing China's new green infrastructure will be furthered by understanding the broad policy context and the interactions between land use, infrastructure, and environmental performance. © 2016 THE AUTHORS","Green finance; Green growth; Industrial ecology; Low-carbon development; Sustainable engineering","Climate change; Data communication systems; Economics; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Finance; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Industrial economics; Land use; Planning; Pollution; Pollution control; Remediation; Soil pollution; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Environmental contamination; Environmental performance; Green growths; Industrial ecology; Industrial transformations; Low-carbon development; Renewable energy penetrations; Sustainable engineering; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020553530

To construct efficient industry specific policies it is important to make careful estimations of the potentials for energy and GHG savings and the associated costs of mitigation that take into account the individual characteristics of the sector. However, many energy models are lacking on technological detail with many of them assessing the industry as a whole with only limited sub-sector division. In this analysis, the main parameters in modeling the cement industry, such as cement demand drivers, production technology representation and retrofitting options, were identified and a number of simple methodological modeling improvements were composed to assist the less detailed models incorporate more bottom-up sectoral information. Some of the improvements were implemented by two IAMs, POLES and IMAGE. Initial results obtained after the implementation of a number of suggested improvements showed the importance of using recent data that take into account recent industrial developments to construct the baseline and data that take into account regional differences. © 2018 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

In a case study, it is shown that the current national regulations on emission rates are not guarantor of local ambient air standards and precise local emission limits are needed. The back calculation of standard situations to assess the total emission level studied in our case shows a need for emission reduction of 65% to ensure tolerable health criteria in the worst probable situations. Also, environmental gains of some system modifications were examined. Findings of the process of local emission standard estimation could then provide appropriate information for identifying the permissible level of pollution from each emission source in further studies. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","Air pollution; Emission; Energy conversion; Local Standard; PM10","Air pollution; Emission control; Energy conversion; Neutron emission; Risk assessment; Emission reduction; Energy production chain; Environmental consequences; Environmental issues; Environmental risk assessment; PM10; Pollution dispersion; System modifications; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084245213

Bangladesh is one of the most disaster vulnerable countries in the world due to its deltaic morphology and frequent climate-induced hazards (storm surge, annual flooding, salinity intrusion, frequent cyclones, etc.). Southwestern coastal settlements are especially vulnerable because people considered among the poorest in the world inhabit them. To cope with climate extremes under severe resource limitations, grassroots technologies evolve over generations from autonomous decision-making processes and creative experimentation. However, communities often fail to recognize the value of these technologies and may have little trust in their innate capacity for climate change adaptation. A conceptual framework will be presented that identifies the interactions among grassroots technology, local knowledge, community trust and climate change adaptation. The framework will be validated in case studies of specific grassroots technologies identified through field observations, and explored through qualitative methods to understand the importance of indigenous knowledge to the development of community-based climate coping strategies.

Ionic liquids (IL) recently revealed as novel hydrate inhibitors due to their unique properties like electrostatic charges together with ability to form hydrogen bonding with water molecule lead them viable research area in the field of gas hydrate mitigation. This paper highlighted the experimental evaluation of thermodynamic measurements of tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) for Methane (CH4) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) gas hydrates. TMAOH belongs to ammonium based ionic liquids (AILs) which is comparatively economical ILs among the other ILs families. Traditional T-cycle technique with isochoric step heating method was adopted for determining thermodynamic inhibition in this work. Results reveal that TMAOH effectively shift the hydrate equilibrium curve to upper pressure and lesser temperature regions for CH4 + TMAOH + water system and CO2 + TMAOH + water system. The average reduced temperature obtained for CH4 + TMAOH + water system is around 1.06 oC while for CO2 + TMAOH + water system, the inhibition effect found to be around 2.09 oC. Therefore, this study provides roadmap for superior alternative for the development of novel thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor, which can efficiently control the gas hydrate formation. © 2016 The Authors.

Traditionally the scheme of environmental monitoring of geological environment includes generalized data sampling about the composition and quantitative characteristics of hydrocarbons, analyses of information and forecasting of the situation development. We offer the scheme of sampling for the control of the pollution and justify the most effective technologies for preparation and analyses of samples as well as models for the forecast of the development of the state of geological environment taking into account the kinetics of chemical processes in the polluted environment. The specific of the suggested scheme is an accent on the marker compounds (PAH). Their ratios indicate the pollution source and the stage of degradation of pollution. Also shown the approaches to the control of secondary pollution (distribution of hydrocarbons into the neighboring environments). The age of contamination can be determined using the data about the hydrocarbon concentrations in samples of soil, water and grounds. Among the main results of the study are the following principles of monitoring. - Monitoring of the geological environment after the pollution with oil and petroleum products should be based on the data about kinetics of redox reactions and consideration of the multi-phase character of this type of pollutant. - Except the dissolved petroleum products monitoring has to cover the latent forms of hydrocarbon pollutants which are created due to phase transitions, change of speeds of the movement mixing-up and immiscible liquids, fluctuations of levels of shallow waters, pollution of a pore space of saturated and nonsaturated zones as a source of secondary pollution etc. - The optimal scheme of the subsurface monitoring should take into account the data of the marker compounds (PAH). - The subsurface quality must be monitored on the basis of specific standards (critical concentration values). Application of the existing soil quality standards for the assessment of grounds (rocks) is very conditional because of the significant difference in biogeochemical processes in these environments. © 2016 Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Chemical analysis; Forecasting; Gasoline; Geology; Monitoring; Pollution detection; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Redox reactions; Soil pollution; Water pollution; Water treatment; Biogeochemical process; Critical concentration; Environmental Monitoring; Geological environment; Hydrocarbon pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Quantitative characteristics; Situation development; Pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088066094

It is necessary to maintain a type of balance between surface water exploitation through the Wadi and at the same time allow a sufficient amount of flow to the Dead Sea to ensure its sustainability. In this study, we choose one of the large tributaries in the western side of the Dead Sea basin. The stream was modelled for runoff response to different rainfall amounts and climate conditions. The model data show that normal average events contribute about 18-22 MCM annually to the Dead Sea. The reoccurrence of dry season such as 2005/2006 shows an adverse effect on the Dead Sea. In the rainy season 1991/1992, there was a higher amount of rainfall over the study area that reached around 155 MCM. Despite the presence of this high amount, most of the recharge was lost to the ground as groundwater recharge. The total loss (rather than surface runoff) was much higher (77%).

By 2050, the GHG emissions are expected to increase by at least 50% over the 2007 levels. The currently practiced GHG emission mitigation measures include adoption of appropriate energy sources including conventional, renewable, and alternative energy sources or their blends; development and application of cleaner technological and operational mechanisms; adoption of intermodal shifting and demand management-based approaches; and development of sustainable shipping governance system. Each mitigation measure is related to certain implementation challenges. This study investigated different estimations of GHG emissions, the relevant mitigation options, and associated challenges, and analysed a possible international mitigation governance system, and proposed approaches to overcome barriers of mitigation options. It is concluded that the pertinent global community should take initiatives to improve the understanding of respective merits of different mitigation options, establish reduction potential and effectiveness of each viable measure, and assess the potential impacts of mitigation measures with particular reference to the global trade and market distortions. The persuasive cooperation with strong commitment among decision makers and stakeholders will best ensure development and implementation of sustainable mitigation measures.

ECLs are typically associated with gale force winds, large seas, storm surges, heavy rainfall and flooding. While ECL impacts are typically seen as negative the rainfall associated with ECLs is also very important for urban water security within the heavily populated eastern seaboard of Australia (ESA). This study investigates historical ECLs to gain insights into the timing, frequency, intensity and location of ECL occurrence as well as the magnitude and spatial extent of ECL impacts on rainfall. The different characteristics and impacts associated with different ECL sub-types are highlighted and it is proposed that this spatial and temporal variability in ECL behaviour at least partially explains why the ESA is hydroclimatically different to the rest of Australia and why different locations within the ESA have such different rainfall patterns-and therefore different levels of flood and drought risk. These insights are critical to the objectives of the New South Wales government funded Eastern Seaboard Climate Change Initiative (ESCCI), in particular Project 5 which focuses on the water security impacts of ECLs. The results of this work will be used to produce climate-informed stochastic daily rainfall simulations that are more realistic than existing stochastic rainfall simulation methods at preserving the statistics important for catchment-scale hydrology (e.g. clustering of extreme events, long-term persistence, frequency/duration/magnitude of wet and dry spells). These simulated rainfall sequences, that incorporate the spatial and temporal hydroclimatic variability caused by ECLs and other climate phenomena, are important inputs into the hydrological models used to determine current and future urban water security within the ESA.

Design/methodology/approach-Out of 66 PLCs, the researchers interviewed 10 companies, and therefore obtained a 15% sample. The methodology was utilization of both primary and secondary data and by use of a combination of the structured and unstructured interviews. Findings-The findings indicated that, although climate change issues are mentioned or implied in strategic plans and core values, they rarely however, translate to normal or day-to-day conversation or operation of the businesses. PESTEL factors are cited as having a very positive impact on businesses that are technological and economic, contrary to environmental/climate change factors which have a more negative than positive effect on the business. Electricity outages/shortages will have serious impact, while agricultural, tourism, insurance, and aviation sectors are likely to be most severely affected by climate change. The hypothesis that climate change is affecting all businesses was accepted while that stating that climate change is significantly impacting businesses negatively rather than positively by increasing operating costs which may result to closure if not mitigated by 2030 was rejected. Practical implications-Companies should not adopt a ""business as usual"" attitude but invest in training on effects and strategies for mitigation as well as adaptation and translate climate issues into action as well as create synergy in tackling climate change issues.

Such studies will provide information that will enrich our knowledge about the contribution of each European Union country to the emissions of greenhouse gases. This article uses a taxonomic method - cluster analysis, namely the agglomerative algorithm, which enables the extraction of objects that are similar to each other from the data and then to merge them into groups. In this way, a number of homogeneous subsets can be obtained from one heterogeneous set of objects. European Union countries make up the objects of segmentation. Each of them are described by their level of greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxides. Groups of homogeneous countries are distinguished due to total emissions and due to the level of their emissions per capita.

In this study, we applied this model into the future energy-system design in regional and national boundaries of Japan. The combinations of technologies on both energy supply and demand sides can be addressed considering not only the societal scenarios such as resource prices, economic growth and population change but also the technical scenarios including the development and penetration of energy-related technologies such as decentralized solid oxide fuel cells in residential sectors and new-generation vehicles, and the replacement of current technologies such as heat pumps for air conditioning and centralized power generation. Through case studies on national and regional energy systems, it was demonstrated that the contribution of technologies to, e.g., the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, should be carefully examined by quantitative analyses of interdependencies of the technology options for actual decision-making on energy systems.

In this context, «effective management of transport demands and efficient use of the existing transport infrastructure » has been established as a strategy that envisages a change of understanding and approach to sort out Istanbul's transport problem. The rapidly growing rate of private car ownership is one of the main reasons for the transportation problems in our city. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, around 25% of all cars in the country are registered in Istanbul. In addition, data from Energy Market Regulatory Authority of Turkey (EPDK) suggest that around 18% of total fuel consumption in our country takes place in Istanbul. Such high prevalence of vehicle ownership has major social and economic implications while elevated levels of fuel consumption and the associated emissions make dire impacts on the environment. The foregoing study examines the practices that could be introduced to remedy the problem of intensive traffic which has enormous implications not only worldwide but particularly in Istanbul -our largest metropolis- by using urban solutions, congestion charges applied in most European countries as a means for effective management of traffic, and the practice of low emission zones which prioritizes environmental consciousness. In this context, it presents a number of comparative analyses on the practices in various countries. After reviewing these analyses in terms of the specific needs of Istanbul, the study provides a recommendation for a hybrid model involving ""Low Emission Based Congestion Charging"" which brings together congestion charges and environmental restrictions of the traffic demand management system planned to be implemented. What's more, traffic congestion in Istanbul is most severely experienced on the bridges which function as intercontinental connections. The main reason for that is -once again- the high rate of private vehicle ownership and inefficient use of vehicles. As a solution to this problem, introduction of a ""high occupancy vehicle"" practice is recommended to ensure transportation of more people rather than more vehicles in the traffic. In this framework, the study presents a recommendation for new tariff system for traffic density management based on the results of a density analysis over bridge crossings, and it provides and innovative and hybrid method for demand management with ""high occupancy vehicles practice to be implemented along with alternative fares charged for bridge crossings"". Introduction of these practices would ensure effective traffic management, and provide for a reduction on emission levels by supporting the elevation of occupancy rates of private vehicles, which is expected to eventually decrease the number of vehicles in traffic. Furthermore, it is anticipated that public transport would be encouraged by ensuring public transport prioritization in the fares; and enhanced punctuality of public transport vehicles would make a major contribution for sustainable transport. The study also explores the political and legal implications associated with the implementation of the recommended practices. Last but not least, introduction of such practices in cities must be promoted through ""Basic Principles of the European Union's Environmental Policy"" and ""Air Quality Framework Directive"". All these practices would provide for an environmentalist outlook on behalf of our country, and as the prerequisites of a livable city, these practices would facilitate the harmonization of our country with the relevant standards as part of the process of joining the European Union. © 2016 The Authors.

Despite differences in time since fire and dominant post-fire vegetation, forest floor and mineral soil organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations and pools were not significantly different between burned and unburned pairs or across sites. However, mineral soil carbon:nitrogen ratio was significantly higher in the burned area of B9-UB (0-10cm) and B5-UB (10-20cm), indicating small losses of nitrogen relative to carbon, likely from plant uptake or possibly leaching of nitrogen post fire.

A detailed soot model was used to resolve the physical soot process that consists of polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbon (PAH) formation and soot particle dynamics. The primary propagating flame in partially-premixed field was described by G-equation model, and the concentrations of burned species as well as PAH behind of the flame front were determined from the laminar flamelet library that incorporates the PAH chemical mechanism. The particle dynamics in post-flame region include nucleation, surface growth, coagulation, and oxidation were modeled by method of moments. To improve the model predictability, a gasoline surrogate model was proposed to match the real fuel properties, and the input of droplet size distribution of fuel spray was obtained from Phase-Doppler Particle Analyzer. The model was validated with the experimental data from single cylinder research engine equipped with side-mounted injector. Also the model sensitivity was examined by varying the air-fuel ratio.

Rhubarb root powder was tested at different concentrations (0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1.33 g/L) in vitro, and all incubations were carried out in triplicate two runs on separate days. Concentrations of 0.67 and 1.33 g/L rhubarb significantly (P < 0.05) reduced methane production and the acetate:propionate ratio compared with those of the Control, without adverse effects on total volatile fatty acids and total gas production. In the second in vivo trial, four Hanwoo (Korean native) steers (live bodyweight, 556 ± 46 kg) with a ruminal cannula were housed individually in metabolic stalls and fed a basal diet twice daily in equal amounts at 0900 hours and 2100 hours. The before rhubarb treatment (before treatment) duration was 24 days for all steers; 14 days were used for diet adaptation and 10 days were used for gas samples collected 1, 2, and 3 h after the morning feeding on Days 3, 5, 7, and 9. We used three syringe needles passed through the ruminal cannula stopper at different time points as a simple and rapid method to sample rumen gas. Thereafter, three mesh bags containing 30 g of sliced rhubarb root each were placed at different depths in the rumen of each steer for 14 days (after treatment), and gas samples were collected on Days 4, 7, 10, 12, and 13. The results showed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in methane concentration from the rhubarb-treated steers and provide the evidence that this method would be useful for in vivo screening of anti-methanogenic feed additives or plant material. Furthermore, 16s RNA sequencing after treatment showed increases in the numbers of Prevotella, and Lactobacillus, but decreases in Methanobrevibacter. In conclusion, rhubarb had an anti-methanogenic effect in vitro and in vivo, and the increase in the number of Prevotella shifted ruminal fermentation towards propionate production. © CSIRO 2016.","bacterial community; beef cattle; rhubarb; ruminal methane.","community composition; concentration (composition); diet; fatty acid; feeding; fermentation; metabolism; methane; microbial community; microbial ecology; perennial plant; RNA; root system; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bos; Lactobacillus; Methanobrevibacter; Prevotella; Rheum; Rheum x hybridum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958170706

Wood decay fungi use various enzymatic pathways to digest dead or living wood in order to obtain carbon and other nutrients and these enzymatic systems have been exploited for both industrial and medical applications. Over 600 wood decay fungi species have been described in Korea; however, the recent application of molecular markers has dramatically altered the taxonomy of many of these wood decay fungi at both the genus and species levels. By combining molecular methods, specifically sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region, with traditional morphological characters, this study identified five new species records for Korea in five genera: Aurantiporus, Favolus, Neofavolus, Loweomyces, and Hymenochaetopsis. Three of these genera (Aurantiporus, Favolus, and Loweomyces) were previously unknown in Korea. The relatively simple morphology of the wood decay fungi often leads to ambiguous taxonomic assignment. Therefore, molecular markers are a necessary component of any taxonomic or evolutionary study of wood decay fungi. Our study highlights the need for a more robust and multifaceted approach in investigating new wood decay fungi in Korea. © The Korean Society of Mycology.","Hymenochaetales; ITS; New record; Polyporales; Wood decay fungi",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994121844

An overview of METEL is discussed including its unique capabilities in the fabrication, characterization and engine testing of emulsion fuels. The engine emissions test facilities and protocols are discussed including state of the art emissions measurement techniques used to analyze stationary high speed diesel engines, on board vessel emissions and in METELs medium speed heavy fuel testing facility. In this paper we describe the emissions of glycerol/diesel and glycerol/biodiesel emulsion blends on marine diesel engines. In addition, fuel physicochemical characteristics and handling issues for these fuels are discussed. Glycerol is an attractive fuel blending material as it is a waste product of biodiesel production with desirable combustion and fuel properties when emulsified into diesel and biodiesel fuels. The cost and carbon reduction benefits of glycerol also make it economically attractive as a fuel component. It is shown that glycerol emulsion fuels exhibit long term shelf stability and when burned can reduce the unwanted pollutants NOX and THC. Particulate matter emissions are nearly equivalent by mass, but particulate number counts are significantly increased trending towards smaller particles sizes. CO emissions are shown to increase slightly with increasing emulsion concentrations. Data on the performance of emulsion fuels from both laboratory stationary diesels and on board the research vessel Quickwater are presented and the operational aspect of using these fuels on vessels is discussed. © 2016 The Vietnam Maritime University.","Alternative fuels; Emissions; Emulsion fuel; Glycerine; Glycerol; Glycerol/Diesel fuel; Marine diesel engines; Renewable fuel","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Blending; Carbon; Emulsification; Engines; Fuels; Glycerol; Marine engines; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Ships; Test facilities; Waste incineration; Diesel engine emissions; Emulsion fuels; Glycerine; High-speed diesel engines; Marine Diesel Engines; Particulate matter emissions; Physicochemical characteristics; Renewable fuels; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009080288

Reduction of the amount of clinker directly decreases carbon dioxide emission. Partial replacement of Portland cement with an admixture is an effective method in decreasing the amount of clinker and carbon dioxide. Use of ground granulated blast furnace slag effectively reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emission derived from the binder of concrete. However, there are few steel plants in the western US. Therefore, ground granulated blast furnace slag powder for use in this area should be imported from East Asia, including Japan. Because ground granulated blast furnace slag powder produced in Japan contains larger amount of alumina than that produced in the United States, the concrete properties may differ from the conventional results obtained in the United States. This study investigated properties of concrete produced with ground granulated blast furnace slag powder contains high amounts of alumina. As a result, the resistance to sulfate attack and length change were equal to those of non-slag concrete. However, the resistance to carbonation was slightly low. Also, replacement with the ground granulated blast furnace slag improved the chloride ion permeability. These results suggest that ground granulated blast furnace slag powder produced in Japan could be used as an admixture of concrete for United States. © 2016 International Committee of the SCMT conferences.

This paper aims to examine the roles of planners in reducing hazard risk through settlement design, land-use plans and legislation, and identify shortcomings and constraints towards achieving Disaster Risk Reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses community-based research from Australia, Thailand and Indonesia to discuss land-use planning in local governance frameworks following major disasters, including cyclone, flood and tsunami. Findings: This paper shows that land-use planning systems are still primarily geared toward promoting and facilitating development and have not evolved sufficiently to take account of DRR and climate change. Social implications: Land-use planning frameworks for hazard-resilient communities remain disconnected from the emergency management and disaster risk reduction systems. The goal to create disaster-resilient communities through the land-use planning systems requires a fundamental change to the way in which planning is conceptualised and practised. Social equity is also a huge issue where investment focuses on urban development.

The University of Wisconsin Probabilistic Downscaling (UWPD) dataset applies a ""probabilistic"" approach to downscaling that may be advantageous in a number of situations, including realistic representation of extreme events. The probabilistic approach to downscaling, however, presents some unique challenges for verification, especially when comparing a full probability density function with a single observed value for each day. Furthermore, because of the wide range of specific climatic information needed in climate impacts assessment, any single verification metric will be useful to only a limited set of practitioners. The intent of this study, then, is (i) to identify verification metrics appropriate for probabilistic downscaling of climate data; (ii) to apply, within the UWPD, those metrics to a suite of extreme event statistics that may be of use in climate impacts assessments; and (iii) in applying these metrics, to demonstrate the utility of a probabilistic approach to downscaling climate data, especially for representing extreme events. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Extreme events; Forecast verification/skill; Statistical techniques","Earth atmosphere; Meteorology; Climatic informations; Extreme events; Forecast verification/skill; Observed values; Probabilistic approaches; Regional climate; Statistical techniques; University of Wisconsin; Probability density function; climate prediction; downscaling; extreme event; probability; probability density function; statistical analysis; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998962658

The stacking distance of the nanosheets is increased linearly with the increase of the carbon number contained in the bridging chain, and controlled within the nanometer order by changing the carbon number generated by the thiol-ene click reaction. Different behaviors observed in the absorption spectra of the two combinations are discussed in terms of the electronic interaction between the neighboring nanosheets. The absorption peak attributed to the bandgap transition of tungstate in the absorption spectrum of the alternate layered nanostructure of niobate and tungstate is blue-shifted with the decrease of the stacking distance. This observation leads us to conclude that the density of states of the tungstate nanosheets is changed by formation of a p-n junction in the alternate layered structure. On the other hand, when the stacking distance of the alternate layered nanostructure of tantalate and tungstate is varied, there are no shifts of the absorption peak attributed to the bandgap transition of tungstate. This result indicates that the electronic structure of the tantalate nanosheets and the tungstate nanosheets in the alternate layered structure are independent. It is discovered that the electronic structures of the alternate stacking structures constructed by thiol-ene click reaction can be modified by changing the stacking distance of the alternate layered nanostructures, controlled by changing the carbon number. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Nanostructures; Niobium compounds; Semiconductor junctions; Tungsten compounds; Bandgap transition; Electronic absorption; Electronic interactions; Layered nanostructure; Layered Structures; Stacking distances; Stacking structures; Thiol-ene click reactions; Nanosheets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981495609

Globally, annual greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions from solid waste disposal sites is estimated to be approximately a quarter of total anthropogenic methane emission. Integrated solid waste management, therefore, provides significant opportunities to control environmental pollution and minimize the negative impacts of global climate change. This chapter illustrates the current status of global GHGs emission in relationship with population growth and solid waste generation. Mathematic models used to quantify GHGs generated from the waste sector as the zero-order model (i.e., SWANA, German EPER and IPCC Default Method) and the first-order model (i.e., TNO, LandGEM, IPCC First-Order Decay; FOD) are explained including application to certain inventory in selected countries. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which involves the cradle-to-grave concept, environmental burden from global warming and selected case studies are described and applied to assess GHGs emissions from various solid waste management options such as recycling, composting, sanitary landfilling, anaerobic digestion, incineration, mechanical biological treatment (MBT), source reduction, and utilization and application of biochar. Existing solid waste management practices and innovative options to achieve GHGs mitigation and community adaptation including resiliency are presented. Lessons learned and best practices in solid waste management from Thailand (i.e., Bangkok Kamphaeng Sean West: Landfill Gas to Electricity Project) and from other countries (i.e., GHGs mitigation project: MBT plant in Gaobeidian, Hebei province, People’s Republic of China; municipal solid waste composting project in Ikorodu, Lagos State, Federal Republic of Nigeria; and gasification, landfill gas and anaerobic digestion in Bali, Indonesia) are further discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","Climate change; Emission; Greenhouse gases (GHGs); Integrated solid waste management; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Sustainability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047732656

Located in the south-western part of Germany, Stuttgart Region expects a higher risk of flooding and heat stress. Due to the topographic situation, the most significant impacts are predicted within the core area of the region, with a population of approx. 2Â m. people and some 100,000 jobs. This paper presents from a practitioner perspective the adaptation strategy pursued by the Verband Region Stuttgartâ€”the regional planning and development authority of one of Germanyâ€™s most prospering areas. The implementation of this strategy is based on close cooperation between different administrative tiers, optimized use of all available instruments, the joint development of new instruments and best practices.

It is concluded that the region could double its production capacity of solid biomass to 2030, from 6 to 12 TWh. Modelling of the electricity sector in the region indicates that biobased electricity generation in combined heat and power plants could almost triple by 2050 while at the same time replace fossil based generation in district heating. Biomass can also contribute to fuel shift in the transport sector. Yet, the transport sector requires a series of actions to significantly reduce demand in combination with use of electricity and biofuels and its transformation is obviously strongly linked to an overall transformation of the European transport sector. The total need for biomass could potentially increase from 14 TWh in 2010 to 48 TWh already from 2040, considering the electricity and transport sectors and under the assumption that large energy savings can be achieved in the building sector and that all fossil based heat generation can be replaced by biomass heating. Assuming that biomass also replace the fossil based raw materials used by the industry, including three refineries, requires 170 TWh biomass to be compared to the 130 TWh currently used for the entire Sweden.","Biomass; CO2-emission reduction targets; Fossil fuels; System perspective; West Sweden",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991585726

As state and local governments as well as electricity users attempt to improve the efficiency of their buildings, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and realize the promises of improved demand side management of energy resources, the need for electricity and other energy-related data becomes even more pressing. But the current law that balances making energy consumption data available against any privacy or confidentiality interests in the data is underdeveloped. Thus, this Article draws on the more sophisticated legal frameworks governing health care, education, and environmental emissions data that balance the public policy needs for data evaluation with countervailing interests. A review of the law in these fields shows that the privacy and confidentiality interests in energy consumption data may be overstated and, in any event, can be adequately addressed in most instances through aggregating the data, using historic rather than current data, or through contracts and other agreements to ensure security where access to individualized data is needed.

The burning of low sulfur fuels, addition of lime-based sorbents for HCl control, and the reduction in SO3 for Hg control, can all tax the performance of the aging fleet of electrostatic precipitators (ESP). This paper discusses three projects in which low ripple three-phase power supplies (TPPS) were used as part of the solution in reducing the ESP PM emissions. TPPS have been used on coal-fired boiler ESPs in Europe for many years, and in the past three years, Babcock &amp; Wilcox (B&amp;W) has more than 800 installations in China on cement kiln ESPs. Previous to this writing, there had been no installations of the TPPS in the United States (U.S.). The first case study involves a U.S. utility that switched fuels for MATS compliance to a low sulfur, low chlorine, and low mercury western bituminous coal. Dry sorbent injection (DS1) utilizing hydrated lime was continuously used for acid gas trim. Prior to this project, the ESP could only achieve opacity compliance, while injecting hydrated lime, at 70% boiler load. In the second case study, a utility plant needed to eliminate their reliance on an ESP SO3 conditioning system to reduce the use of activated carbon injection (ACI) for Hg control. Prior to the ESP upgrade, the unit could only achieve full load while utilizing SO3 to help the ESP's performance. In both the first and second projects, numerous improvements were made to the ESP, including the addition of TPPS, to address MATS compliance. The third case study describes the simple addition of TPPS to a cement kiln ESP and the resultant increase in ESP power and reduction in PM emissions. This project demonstrates the important role that ESP power supplies play in improving PM collection efficiency.

In the first part of the paper, we argue that the ensuing drop in the price of natural gas has an ambiguous effect on global carbon emissions because of three countervailing effects: coal-to-gas switching in the US electric power sector, an increase in the relative cost of US renewable energy sources, and an increase in US coal exports. Our position is that without a meaningful cap, the shale gas boom is likely to increase global emissions and the period during which natural gas is used as a bridge fuel to clean energy should be limited. In the second part of the paper, we review recent environmental policies for the US electric power sector that have contributed to reducing carbon emissions, and discuss the complex economics of the newly introduced Clean Power Plan. Although the availability of cheap natural gas has been factored in US environmental policy and has helped electricity generators to achieve compliance with various rules and regulations, it should not derail policy from its long-run objective, which is the transition to a less fossil-fuel dependent economy. © The Authors 2016.

PTFE blended gaskets which have recently been developed and come onto the market have a superior sealing performance as well as the chemical and temperature resistances and can contribute to reduce fugitive emissions. This paper deals with the sealing behaviors of the PTFE blended gasket and the tightness of a bolted flanged connection in which the gasket is used. The gasket is mainly composed of PTFE and graphite and has a high tightness and heat resistance up to 300 degree C. The creep characteristic is improved by the graphite filler. In this paper, the estimation method of the tightness of bolted flanged connections based on the sealing behavior of gasket is demonstrated. The estimated results are validated by experiments using a flange connection. It is shown that the leak rate below the tightness class 4 defined in the Room Temperature Tightness Test (ROTT, Pressure Vessel Research Council) can be obtained using the PTFE blended gasket.

The impurities absorb the incoming solar radiation thereby accelerating snow aging and melting. This further accelerates the processes of snow albedo reduction and melting. A recently-conducted ice core study in Mera Peak shows that annual dust mass fluxes (10.4+/-2.8 g m-2 yr-1) are a few orders of magnitude higher than black carbon (7.9+/-2.8 g m-2 yr-1). A similar study conducted in the Tibetan Plateau showed a decrease in the amount of mineral dust deposition since 1940s indicating that the increased glacier melt can be attributed to increased black carbon emission than dust. The concentrations of black carbon and dust peak during the pre-monsoon season. Spectral reflectance curves derived from satellite imagery for the Himalayan Tibetan Plateau showed domination of dust-induced solar absorption during the premonsoon season. Spatial distribution of reflectance also depends on the transport pathway of impurities, with the south western Hindu Kush and Himalaya experiencing greater dust influx, deposition and snow albedo reduction than northern regions of Karakoram. In this study, we characterize the light absorbing impurities deposited in Himalayan regions using multi spectral data from MODIS and LANDSAT.

A challenging question in this area is how do you explain the selectivity of one chemosensor to anions that are usually difficult to distinguish. To this end, the sensing mechanisms of two chemosensors (COUMC &amp; HCHI) with similar structures are theoretically investigated by means of quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations. The selectivity of each chemosensor to three common anions that can possibly influence the detection of each other, namely CN-, HS- and F-, is thereby explained. The result of the quantum mechanics calculation reveals that COUMC-HS-, COUMC-CN- and HCHI-CN-, are favored both kinetically and thermodynamically. A further analysis based on molecular dynamics simulations reveals that the affinity of anions to the reaction sites of COUMC follow the order of CN- &gt; HS- &gt; F-. On the other side, F- and HS- anions are unable to approach the reaction sites of HCHI. These different affinities are explained subsequently by the different strengths of water-anion complexes and different surface electric potentials between COUMC and HCHI. The photochemistry properties indicate excitation and emission on large conjugated planar structures for a single COUMC/HCHI. For the anion-bonded chemosensors, only localized excitation is observed and no obvious differences on absorption and emission spectra are found when adding different anions. Based on our results, we conclude that the reaction selectivity is determined from both the reaction energy and the affinity of anions to the reaction sites. The different selectivity between COUMC and HCHI is attributed to spatial effects and surface electrostatic potential changes caused by the benzyl substituent in COUMC. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Electric potential; Emission spectroscopy; Ions; Mechanics; Molecular dynamics; Negative ions; Physiology; Quantum theory; Reaction kinetics; Absorption and emission spectra; Localized excitations; Molecular dynamics simulations; Planar structure; Reaction selectivity; Sensing mechanism; Surface electric potentials; Surface electrostatic potential; Hydraulic structures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978159553

Since, for cost efficiency, PHEVs have a limited battery capacity, they must be recharged often and especially after trips. Thus, efficient battery charging plays an important role on the success of PHEVs commercial adoption. This paper surveys the state-ofthe- art of existing PHEV battery charging schemes. We classify these schemes into four classes, namely uncontrolled, indirectlycontrolled, smart and bidirectional charging, and review various existing techniques within each class. For uncontrolled charging, existing studies focus on evaluating the impact of adding variable charging load on the smart grid. Various indirectly-controlled charging schemes have been proposed to control energy prices, in order to indirectly influence the charging operations. Smart charging schemes can directly control a rich set of charging parameters to achieve various performance objectives, such as minimizing power loss, maximizing operator's profit, ensuring fairness, etc. Finally, bidirectional charging allows a PHEV to discharge energy into smart grid, such that the vehicle can act as a mobile energy source to further stabilize the grid, which is partially supplied by intermittent renewable energy sources. This survey provides a comprehensive one-stop introductory reference to quickly learn about the key features and technical challenges, addressed by existing PHEV battery charging schemes in smart grid. © 2016 IEEE.","bidirectional charging; indirectly-controlled charging; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; smart charging; smart grid; uncontrolled charging","Charging (batteries); Crashworthiness; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Smart power grids; Surveys; Vehicles; Controlled charging; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Smart charging; Smart grid; Uncontrolled charging; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027021429

Following the highest concentration found at the start of the measurements, the amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides, such as dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethanes (DDTs) (dichloro-diphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and DDT), β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) declined to about 1.46.4% of their peak levels in the mid-1970s and continued to decrease to low-level equilibrium states. This decline was greatly variable, depending on the compound in question. In the case of chlordanes (trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, and oxychlordane), termite insecticides monitored from 1986, more than 20 years have passed since their use was prohibited in Japan. Nevertheless, they continue to be found in breast milk, although at a low level. Dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs)) possess typical characteristics of organochlorine compounds, are difficult to decompose, and are readily soluble in fat. We monitored the dioxin content of breast milk from 1973 to 2008, finding that their levels constantly decreased during this period. This was probably due to the greatly decreased amount of dioxins from agricultural chemicals and the curtailed use of PCBs. To reduce dioxin emissions from combustion and industrial processes, the Ministry of the Environment has enforced a Dioxins special-measures law in 1999, which successfully reduced the emission of dioxins by over 90% by 2003, compared to that of 1997. However, the levels of combustion-origin dioxins in breast milk showed a small decline rate. The PCB contamination of the Japanese population is estimated to be largely caused by seafood intake, but the proportions of PCB congeners in fish commodities are different from those in breast milk. The absorption, metabolism, and therefore, the accumulation of PCBs in the human body differed greatly for various congeners. The time course of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) concentrations in breast milk samples appeared to be related to the technical HBCD annual demand levels in Japan. In recent years, the level of HBCDs in breast milk remained roughly constant, attributed to the recent flat trend of HBCD consumption in Japan. The time point of total HBCD concentration rise appeared to be later than that of the total polybrominated diphenyl ether concentration rise in breast milk samples collected in Osaka, Japan. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, it is well documented that the complex Copper–Ceria interactions (either geometric or electronic) have a key role on the catalytic performance. Hence, considerable efforts have been devoted on the understanding and the fine-tuning of metal–oxide interactions. Despite the growing progress in the field, several crucial issues related to the influence of: i) particle's shape and size, ii) active site's chemical state, iii) charge transfer between interfacial sites, and iv) intrinsic defects (e.g., surface oxygen vacancies) on the interfacial activity are still under investigation. This survey summarizes the recent advances in the last 10 years on the fundamental origin of Copper–Ceria interactions and their implications on the catalytic activity. The insights lately obtained by means of: i) ex situ advanced characterization techniques, ii) in situ sophisticated studies (e.g., operando techniques), iii) theoretical analysis (e.g., DFT calculations), and iv) innovative probing approaches (such as the inverse CeO2/CuO model system) are provided. The state-of-the-art catalytic applications of CuO/CeO2binary oxides (water gas shift (WGS) reaction, preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO, CO2hydrogenation, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), N2O decomposition, etc.) in relation to the aforementioned aspects are discussed.

Because of subarctic climate with long and severely cold winters and specialization of regional economy the YANAO is a substantial emitter of GHGs. The energy sector is responsible for the major part of this emission. Fuel combustion for energy needs is the key source of CO2 emission. The second important sours of GHGs emission are methane releases from gas production and transmission facilities. CO2, CH4 and NO2 emissions related to combustion of the majority of fossil fuels for energy needs, from natural gas activities, waste management and agriculture were calculated. The work is performed in accordance with the recommendations and classification of the Revised Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

Exploration of forest degradation is still insufficient in the tropical region. In this paper, the logged-over Tangkulap and Deramakot Forest Reserves in Sabah, Malaysia-Borneo were thoroughly studied. Using the IKONOS-2 image, forest was segmented based on multi-resolution algorithm in eCognition and classified into forest degradation types. AGB was used to guide the classification into three levels of forest degradation i.e. very-degraded (VDF), degraded (DF) and intact forests (IF). The accuracy was assessed at 0.65 of Kappa coefficient (79% of overall accuracy). Under each forest degradation class, the distribution patterns of tree densities and AGBs at the respective strata of understory, canopy and emergent were examined. Statistical mean and standard deviation were used to describe the variation patterns. Tree density of understory strata is saturating at DF and IFs. Tree density of emergent strata at IF is about twice higher than at DF. AGB at IF is 3.6 and 1.8 times higher than at VDF and DF, respectively. Standard deviation of AGB tends to increase nonlinearly from VDF to IF. This study has examined the patterns of tree density and AGB in order to understand the recovery processes of the degraded forest.","Forest strata; IKONOS-2; Mean; Standard deviation","Climate change; Deforestation; Remote sensing; Statistics; Above ground biomass; Distribution patterns; Forest strata; IKONOS-2; Mean; Multi-resolution algorithms; Overall accuracies; Standard deviation; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018409238

The samples were analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IR-MS) to determine the stable carbon isotope compositions of organic carbon (δ13COC) and elemental carbon (δ13CEC). The daily PM10 concentrations ranged from 15 to 99 μg m−3with an average value of 50 ± 24 μg m−3. The analysed δ13COC values ranged from −25.1 to −19.9‰ with an average value of −23.1 ± 1.9‰, and the values of δ13CEC ranged from −25.6 to −24.1‰ with an average value of −25.0 ± 0.5‰. Additionally, the average δ13CTC value of lignite from the open-pit mine reached −25.8‰, and calculated δ13COC of lignite using an isotopic mass balance (IMB) value reaches −25.7 ± 0.1‰, whereas lignite δ13CEC value reaches −25.9 ± 0.2‰. The calculated major possible sources indicated that organic carbon (OC) in PM10 are represented probably by primary OC originated from the local lignite open-pit mine, whereas elemental carbon (EC) in PM10are probably derived from local coal/lignite combustion products. If a data base of δ13COC and δ13CEC values from other possible “pure” sources (coal/gasoline/diesel/biomass/etc) is created, it will be possible to calculate individual isotopic mass balances for OC and for EC, which would yield more information than was obtained for total carbon (TC). The method could be a new and very helpful tool for calculating the percentage input of possible sources of OC and EC in atmospheric particles, and it can be applied to data from locations throughout the whole world. © 2015 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control.

Its function is to prevent undesirable corrosion rates, in case the coating protection fails. Objective was to predict a state in terms of passivity or activity in which a carbon steel is in. And to do so, there is a monitoring of pH values by amphoteric metals, which would track pH changes of cathodically protected material in a soil. For pH detection, Al and Zn, were used. Main aim was to track corrosion rate of these amphoteric metals as a most reliable way to predict pH changes. Cathodic protection led to higher pH values of model soil located closely to surface of protected material. In case of carbon steel, alkalisation led to passive state and in the same time amphoteric metals could exist in active state.

In addition to noise mitigation by erection of the expensive noise barriers, tire/pavement noise can be reduced ""in source"" by construction of special asphalt pavements. While that solution is commonly known in regions with moderate maritime climate (e.g. The Netherlands), in places with more harsh climate it is not popular. High number (>100/year) of freeze and thaw (F&T) cycles in Poland is a significant limitation for porous asphalt technology. This paper presents results of the research work conducted within research project called ""Innovative pavement technology with reduced noise emission"" with acronym CiDRO. The project was conducted by a consortium composed of Mostostal Warszawa (leader of the consortium), Warsaw University of Technology - Faculty of Civil Engineering and Road and Bridge Research Institute - Department of Pavement Technology (members of the consortium). This project was supported by Polish National Centre for Research and Development. Within the scope of the CiDRO project presented in this paper, various noise reducing asphalt technologies were tested in both laboratory and field sections. Those sections included the following types of wearing course: asphalt concrete AC 11 (reference), stone mastic (matrix) asphalt SMA 5 and SMA 8, open graded friction course OGFC 8 and OGFC 11, porous asphalt PA8 and PA11. The range of laboratory research program consists of typical quality control and evaluation studies of functional characteristics such as resistance to water and frost, low temperature cracking resistance, aging resistance, rheological properties and fatigue life. In addition, field tests such as noise emissions by CPX and SPB methods, texture depth, friction coefficient and in-situ water permeability were performed. Field tests were repeated following winter period. Moreover, to simulate clogging, dirt (previously collected road debris) was spread on the surface and cleaning treatment was performed using specialized equipment. Selected properties of the pavement surface were tested to determine the effectiveness of cleaning process. Finally, two most promising sections were proposed for construction as real traffic exposed roads and subjected for observation during their exploitation. An initial conclusions and recommendations were drawn regarding the mixture maximum aggregate size and air void content. © 2016 The Authors.","environment; noise; pavement; porous asphalt; quiet pavement",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991325321

The most common indicators used in the HIA methodology are: premature mortality, morbidity, life-expectancy, and Disability Adjusted Life-Year (DALY). The term Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) indicates months/years lost due to a premature death or disability. The aim of the study was to present health benefits, expressed in terms of lower total mortality and cardio-respiratory hospitalization rates, due to a decreased particulate matter (PM) concentration in ambient air, in Silesian voivodeship. Material and Methods: In this paper, results obtained from the APHEKOM (Improving Knowledge and Communication for Decision Making on Air Pollution and Health in Europe) project, which provided specialized HIA tools, useful for assessing health benefits resulting from reducing air pollution, were used. Both short-term and long-term exposure HIA tools were applied with regard to the appropriate data for Silesian voivodeship. Exposure data were obtained from the Regional Environmental Inspectorate in Katowice, while population and health data were obtained from the Central Statistical Office of Poland or from the Silesian Voivodeship Office, respectively. Results: Health benefits that are related to an improvement of ambient air quality in Silesia region are similar to previous estimates obtained for Kraków city. The reduction of short-term exposure to PM10 by 5 μg/m3 results in a lower number of yearly non-external deaths (2.6–2.75 per 100 000 inhabitants). This effect was also shown to be similar in the city of Zabrze, as well as in the whole Silesia region. Conclusions: The Health Impact Assessments tools developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) can help public health experts make decisions in order to improve the health of populations living in particular regions of Europe. © 2016, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.

This is mainly done by analysing the treatment of three different types of uncertainty (in a broad sense), explained in Sect. 9.1. Section 9.2 discusses technical and methodological uncertainties in IAM-based economic studies. Next, the fundamental methodology underlying IAM-based economic studies is critically discussed from an epistemological perspective, and some refinements are proposed from a Deweyan perspective (Sect. 9.3). The conclusion (Sect. 9.4) regarding the overall reliability of IAM-based results is neither that IAM-based studies provide us with absolutely true knowledge, nor that we, from an epistemological perspective, should completely disregard such economic results in policy-making. Instead, a more enlightened use of uncertainty-laden economic models including IAMs is the goal, based on a revision of economic methodology in light of Deweyan-Putnamian pragmatism. A critical reflection on the predominant viewpoints in economic methodology is indispensable because it is in a worrisome state; economists often cannot compellingly explain what their results mean from a philosophical-epistemological perspective. Pragmatism (Sect. 6.2 ) might help overcome the disorientation of current economic methodology in several regards, without returning to the dogmatism of positivist methodology. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate Policy; Economic Methodology; Epistemological Perspective; Logical Empiricism; Methodological Uncertainty",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101638703

A short check list for integrated economic assessments summarises the key recommendations (Sect. 11.1). Section 11.2 addresses the question of what information we want the IPCC to provide in its next assessments. The IPCC should map alternative policy pathways and their implications even more comprehensively and specifically. More specific proposals for the appropriate treatment of disputed value judgements and uncertainties in IPCC assessments are given next (Sect. 11.3). It is also argued that the multi-scenario analyses should more explicitly explore disputed ethical viewpoints. Then, potential improvements of the IPCC’s processes, formats and public participation are discussed (Sect. 11.4).

Appropriately informing decision-makers about longer-term, wicked policy issues remains a considerable challenge for the scientific community. Typically, these vital policy issues are highly uncertain, value-laden and disputed, and affect multiple temporal and spatial scales, governance levels, policy fields, and socioeconomic contexts simultaneously. In light of this, science-policy interfaces should help facilitate learning processes and open deliberation among all actors involved about potentially acceptable policy pathways. For this purpose, science-policy interfaces must strive to foster some enabling conditions: (1) “representation” in terms of engaging with diverse stakeholders (including experts) and acknowledging divergent viewpoints; (2) “empowerment” of underrepresented societal groups by co-developing and integrating policy scenarios that reflect their specific knowledge systems and worldviews; (3) “capacity building” regarding methods and skills for integration and synthesis, as well as through the provision of knowledge synthesis about the policy solution space; and (4) “spaces for deliberation”, facilitating direct interaction between different stakeholders, including governments and scientists. We argue that integrated, multi-stakeholder, scientific assessment processes—particularly the collaborative assessments of policy alternatives and their various implications—offer potential advantages in this regard, compared with alternatives for bridging scientific expertise and public policy.

Such changes impact not only the urban mobility at big cities but also the urban life quality, which is directly affected by pollutant emissions and noise. In order to limit emission impacts on sensitive population (children, elderly people, for example), city managers can enforce bounds on emissions and noise pollution generated by the city traffic in specific regions defined by geographical boundaries. This paper aims to contribute to the challenge of managing urban noise by exploring and analyzing the data with a geofencing approach.

Drop-in biofuels can contribute to that goal. The newly developed biofuel Diesel R33 enables sustainable mobility and fulfills the European diesel fuel specification. Diesel R33 is made of seven percent used cooking oil methyl ester, 26 percent hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and 67 percent high quality diesel fuel. HVO was mainly produced from rapeseed and palm oil. Additionally, HVO from algae and yeast oil were tested. Diesel R33 was tested in a fleet of 280 vehicles (passenger cars, light duty vehicles, buses and mobile machines) covering all emission classes. The impact of the new fuel on the vehicle performance and their emissions as well as on the engine oil was investigated. Intense exhaust gas analyses of regulated and non-regulated components were performed using five passenger cars (emission standards Euro 3, Euro 5 and Euro 6). These vehicles were tested for regulated exhaust gas emissions. Three of those vehicles were additionally tested for environmental and health relevant non-regulated exhaust gas components. All vehicles fulfilled the exhaust gas regulations running on CEC reference diesel fuel as well as on Diesel R33. Hydrogen carbons (HC), carbon monoxides (CO) and carbonyl emissions were reduced by Diesel R33, but nitrogen oxides were slightly increased. Diesel R33 reduced the mutagenicity of the exhaust gas and the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of the Euro 3 vehicle, while the newer vehicles showed no enhanced emissions of mutagenic exhaust gas components. The GHG emission of Diesel R33 is approximately 17 % lower compared to fossil diesel fuel. In all, 1,900,000 liter Diesel R33 were used without any problems. This indicates fundamentally the possibility to develop sustainable drop-in biofuels with high biogenic content fulfilling state of the art fuel specifications without inducing any technical problems in any engine generation. Moreover, Diesel R33 has to be considered as a fuel platform, because vegetable oils of algae and yeast can deliver fuel components without violating the diesel fuel specification. © 2016, FISITA.

Polystyrene insulation is an increasingly important component of green construction. The benefits of insulation in residential and commercial buildings include lower energy consumptions, improved thermal comfort, reductions in the first costs of the heating and cooling equipment and reductions in CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels across the United States. As with all foam insulations, polystyrene foam insulation is combustible and must comply with stringent building and fire codes, which have been in place since 1976. The basic requirement in codes is a flame spread index of 75 or less and a smoke developed index of 450 or less when tested in accordance with ASTM E84, in addition to separation of the foam insulation from building occupants through use of a thermal barrier, typically "" gypsum board. Additional requirements are in place depending upon the particular application. Like many other building products - from electrical wires to structural and decorative wood products to paint - foam insulation uses flame retardants to protect people and property from the hazards of fire. Flame retardants used in foam insulation meet current regulations and their history of safe use is supported by scientific research.1 Manufacturers are committed to product safety and the effectiveness of flame retardants, and support research and development efforts to continually advance and improve these materials. A recent announcement by the Design for the Environment program of the U.S. EPA detailed a suitable polymeric flame retardant for use in polystyrene foam insulation. The chemistry is a brominated polymeric flame retardant to replace Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)2. HBCD has recently been listed as a persistent organic pollutant (POP) under the UNEP Stockholm convention and is on the Authorisation List (Annex XIV) under the European Union REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) Regulation and will be phased out. Response to these actions has led to phase out schedules in various geographies. While earlier conference papers have given an overview of the environmental, health and safety performance of this new polymeric flame retardant, this paper will focus more on the transition process required for an industry sector to incorporate a new additive. Thus it will give an indication of the degree of complexity involved in implementing such developed solutions through the approval of raw materials, plant qualification, product certification in different geographies and markets while throughout seeking to maintain the quality of the final product in terms of technical and environmental performance and meeting critical regulatory milestones, such as building and fire code requirements. If we use the Polymeric FR as an example, assuming that all goes to plan from conception, registration to implementation with full certification for 1 country, an estimate for the development and introduction of PS foam insulation containing the new flame retardant additive is in the range of 7-11 years. An update on the status of the transition to the new polymeric flame retardant alternative by the polystyrene foam insulation industry will also be provided as HBCD is phased out globally.",,"Accident prevention; Building codes; Buildings; Codes (symbols); Commerce; Elastomers; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental Protection Agency; Fossil fuels; Insulation; Office buildings; Organic chemicals; Organic pollutants; Plastic products; Pollution; Polymers; Polystyrenes; Sustainable development; Thermal insulation; Design for the environment; Environmental , health and safeties; Environmental performance; Flame-retardant additives; Hexabromocyclododecanes; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polystyrene foam insulation; Research and development; Flame retardants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010634328

Therefore, this technology could be a promising route for a Polygeneration concept which aims the production of valuable gases (for example H2), electricity, and heat. In this paper, a lab-scale process chain, based on state of the art unit operations, which processed a tar-rich product gas from a commercial dual fluidized bed biomass steam gasification plant, is investigated regarding H2 production within a Polygeneration concept. The lab-scale process chain employed a water gas shift unit, two gas scrubbing units, and a pressure swing adsorption unit using activated carbon as adsorbent in order to separate H2 from the other gas components.

With this growing use of wood energy, there is increased scrutiny of the associated environmental impacts and concern over possible unintended consequences (e.g., nonrenewable energy inputs) that may detract from the carbon savings provided by such renewable energy sources. The focus of this article is to present an accounting system for the embodied fossil fuels in wood energy systems. This system is based on life-cycle assessment methodology and could accommodate fairly the variability in fossil fuel inputs for various bioenergy systems. Such a system could be incorporated into biofuel subsidies or carbon taxation policies. We use three scenarios as examples to illustrate (1) that wood-to-energy systems entail the use of fossil fuels and that the amount of this ""embodied fossil carbon"" varies with the processing inputs and transportation required and (2) that carbon tax/biofuel subsidies can be adjusted to accommodate variations in embodied fossil carbon.

Three different complex classes are considered, namely with [Ru(N^N)2(N^C)]+, [Ru(N^N^N)(N^C^N)]+ and [Ru(N^N^N)(N^N^C)]+ coordination modes. Excited state deactivation in these complex types proceeds via five distinct decay channels. Vibronic coupling of the 3MLCT state to high-energy oscillators of the singlet ground state (1GS) allows tunneling to the ground state followed by vibrational relaxation (path A). A ligand field excited state (3MC) is thermally accessible via a 3MLCT → 3MC transition state with the 3MC state being strongly coupled to the 1GS surface via a low-energy minimum energy crossing point (path B). Furthermore, a 3MLCT → 1GS surface crossing point directly couples the triplet and singlet potential energy surfaces (path C). Charge transfer states either with higher singlet character or with different orbital parentage and intrinsic symmetry restrictions are thermally populated which promote non-radiative decay via tunneling to the 1GS state (path D). Finally, the excited state can decay via phosphorescence (path E). The dominant deactivation pathways differ for the three individual complex classes. The implications of these findings for isoelectronic iridium(iii) or iron(ii) complexes are discussed. Ultimately, strategies for optimizing the emission efficiencies of cyclometalated polypyridine complexes of d6-metal ions, especially RuII, are suggested. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Charge transfer; Complexation; Coordination reactions; Density functional theory; Ground state; Iridium compounds; Ligands; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Ruthenium; Ruthenium compounds; Charge transfer state; Deactivation pathways; Emission efficiencies; Intrinsic symmetries; Metal to ligand charge transfers; Ruthenium complexes; Singlet ground state; Vibrational relaxation; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984808127

Thermocouples give locally very accurate measurements of these temperatures, but there is a practical limit to the amount of measurement points. Thermal paints are another established measurement technique, but are toxic and at the same time require dedicated, short-duration tests. Thermal History Paints (THPs) provide an innovative alternative to the aforementioned techniques, but so far only a limited number of tests has been conducted under real engine conditions. THPs are similar in their chemical and physical make-up to conventional thermographic phosphors which have been successfully used in gas turbine applications for on-line temperature detection before. A typical THP comprises of oxide ceramic pigments and a water based binder. The ceramic is synthesized to be amorphous and when heated it crystallizes, permanently changing the microstructure. The ceramic is doped with lanthanide ions to make it phosphorescent. The lanthanide ions act as atomic level sensors and as the structure of the material changes, so do the phosphorescent properties of the material. By measuring the phosphorescence the maximum temperature of exposure can be determined through calibration, enabling post operation measurements at ambient conditions. This paper describes a test in which THP was applied to an impingement-cooled front panel from a combustor of an industrial gas turbine. Since this component sees a wide range of temperatures, it is ideally suited for the testing of the measurement techniques under real engine conditions. The panel was instrumented with a thermocouple and thermal paint was applied to the cold side of the impingement plate. THP was applied to the hot-gas side of this plate for validation against the other measurement techniques and to evaluate its resilience against the reacting hot gas environment. The durability and temperature results of the three different measurement techniques are discussed. The results demonstrate the benefits of THPs as a new temperature profiling technique. It is shown that the THP exhibited greater durability compared to the conventional thermal paint. Furthermore, the new technology provided detailed measurements down to millimeters indicating local temperature variations and global variations over the complete component.

Turbulence improves mixture formation and accelerates after burning reducing smoke. A present study employing turbulence assistance approach aims at improving fuel economy and lowering the smoke level. Findings: While highpressure secondary air is the turbulence provider, timing is achieved through microprocessor programming and related hardware. Timed turbulence closer to TDC helps in combustion and hence improved thermal efficiencies at all loads. Timed turbulence away from TDC during expansion accelerates ' After burning' and reduces 'smoke emission'. Encouraging results of the experiments with single and twin injections per cycle are reported. Also, the timing of turbulence has been optimized.

This is especially true of semi-arid ecosystems, where the high variability in precipitation and disturbance regimes can have dramatic impacts on the global carbon budget by rapidly transitioning AGB between live and dead pools. Measuring regional AGB requires scaling ground-based measurements using remote sensing, an inherently challenging task in the sparsely-vegetated, spatially-heterogeneous landscapes characteristic of semi-arid regions. Here, we test the ability of canopy segmentation and statistic generation based on aerial LiDAR (light detection and ranging)-derived 3D point clouds to derive AGB in clumps of vegetation in a juniper savanna in central New Mexico. We show that single crown segmentation, often an error-prone and challenging task, is not required to produce accurate estimates of AGB. We leveraged the relationship between the volume of the segmented vegetation clumps and the equivalent stem diameter of the corresponding trees (R2 = 0.83, p &lt; 0.001) to drive the allometry for J. monosperma on a per segment basis. Further, we showed that making use of the full 3D point cloud from LiDAR for the generation of canopy object statistics improved that relationship by including canopy segment point density as a covariate (R2 = 0.91). This work suggests the potential for LiDAR-derived estimates of AGB in spatially-heterogeneous and highly-clumped ecosystems.","Biomass; Canopy delineation; Juniper; LiDAR; Segmentation; Semi-arid; Woodland","Antennas; Biomass; Budget control; Climate models; Ecosystems; Forestry; Image segmentation; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Canopy delineation; Ground based measurement; Heterogeneous landscapes; Juniper; Land management practices; Process-based models; Semi arid; Woodland; Optical radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974822941

This process, known as the marine biological carbon pump, removes carbon from exchange with the atmosphere, thus regulating global climate. Recent evidence suggests that microbial chemical communication systems (e.g., quorum sensing) amongst heterotrophic bacteria associated with sinking POC, significantly influence their hydrolytic enzyme activity and, as such, may affect the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. Here, we present data showing that a class of quorum sensing molecules, acylated homeserine lactones (AHLs) substantially impact hydrolytic phosphatase, aminopeptidase, and lipase activity in samples of sinking particles collected from the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Incubations of sinking particles amended with exogenous AHLs showed both stimulated and inhibited rates of activity after 24 h of incubation, suggesting a critical link between bacterial AHL signaling mechanisms and the rate of POC degradation. Further experiments reveal that hydrolytic pathways could be affected within a few hours of amendment with AHLs, suggesting that microbial communities are able to dynamically modify their metabolic pathways in response to perceived quorum sensing. Finally, the concentration of the AHL amendment also affected hydrolytic activity. AHL-based quorum sensing may be thought of as a global language among marine bacteria, but it is highly complex. © 2016 Krupke, Hmelo, Ossolinski, Mincer and Van Mooy.","Acylated homoserine lactones; Infochemical signaling; Marine carbon cycle; Particle-associated bacteria; Sinking particles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008957036

Applying a variety of research methods, this chapter presents empirical findings on the advantages and disadvantages of online communication compared to face-to-face communication in six consultation processes and seven collaborative citizen panels. To control for contextual differences, one of the consultation processes has been set up paralleling online and face-to-face meetings. In this case, organizers showed a preference for face-to-face meetings as regards the content of contributions and the style of discussion. For the citizen panels, collaborating with local governments to achieve climate targets, impacts in terms of carbon equivalents (CO2e) savings, and dropout rates have been compared for parallel processes online and via telephone. These comparisons do not, however, deliver clear performance profiles of the communication channels or a generalizable assessment of their appropriateness for particular objectives. The factors influencing the choice of communication channels are complex, and the analysis shows that assessments depend on the type of participation and the role of an actor in the process as well as on time frames and contexts in which the assessments are made.

It is necessary to protect existing greenery in the cities and to introduce new planting. However plants in a warmer climate can produce larger amounts of pollen and are more readily able to initiate an allergic reaction among those prone to them. That means-not every greenery is advantageous for humans in the cities. In the research two housing estates built at different times and differ in type, density and age of buildings, as well as in the composition and the percentage of biologically vital area and the species planted were examined. Detailed inventory of tall greenery entailed the trees and shrubs and next their assumed allergenic potential was made. Cooling effect likely is derived from the difference in greenery, but the other factors such as differences in the density of buildings and spatial organization of the estate could also influence it. The older estate with the ratio of biologically vital areas of 54.3% is characterised by more favourable local climate than the newer estate, with the ratio of biologically vital areas equals 40.7% and young vegetation. On the newer one the perceptible thermal conditions did not differ significantly compared with the city centre. Unfortunately, on Koło Estate trees creating mild thermal conditions are also the trees promoting allergies most severely: birches, poplars and limes. And they are planted usually around playgrounds and kindergarten. The trees of high allergenicity should be partially removed, even risking small worsening thermal conditions. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.","Allergenicity; Biologically vital areas; Urban climate; Urban planning","allergy; climate change; cooling; greenspace; heat island; temperature effect; urban climate; urban planning; vegetation structure; woody plant; Mazowieckie; Poland [Central Europe]; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]; Betula; Citrus aurantiifolia; Populus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959498792

Indeed, it is a preoccupation for the countries (mostly vulnerable) that will suffer those damages, but also for the States that emitted greenhouse gases which fear to have to repair them. That's why the international negotiation related to the climate regime use the ambiguous term “loss and damage” to design the impacts related to climate change. The purpose of this article is to know if the term “loss and damage” is a useful one in view of reparation under international law or if it is necessary to conceptualize the “climate change damage” notion employed by the doctrine. More precisely, the central question is the following: why is it necessary to conceptualize the “climate change damage” notion? Even though “loss and damage” could formally be a legal concept, it is substantially useless with regard to reparation under international law because it is too ambiguous. Therefore, we judged necessary to clarify the concept of “climate change damage” used by the doctrine but that unfortunately defines it insufficiently. Indeed, it could be useful for the doctrine but also for the lawyers of vulnerable countries and the judges to dispose of a legal notion in order to consider the reparation of the damages related to climate change under international law. Consequently, we propose in this article a definition of climate change damage that could be useful with regard to reparation under international law. © 2016","Climate change; Climate change damage; International law; Loss and damage; Reparation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979669536

Members of microbial consortia all depend on marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) and in turn, affect the molecules present in this heterogeneous pool. Our understanding of DOM produced by marine microbes is biased toward single species laboratory cultures or simplified field incubations, which exclude large phototrophs and protozoan grazers. Here we explore the interdependence of DOM composition and bacterial diversity in two mixed microbial consortia from coastal seawater: a whole water community and a < 1.0-μm community dominated by heterotrophic bacteria. Each consortium was incubated with isotopically-labeled glucose for 9 days. Using stable-isotope probing techniques and electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, we show that the presence of organisms larger than 1.0-μm is the dominant factor affecting bacterial diversity and low-molecular-weight (<1000 Da) DOM composition during this experiment. In the < 1.0-μm community, DOM composition was dominated by compounds with lipid and peptide character at all time points, confirmed by fragmentation spectra with peptide-containing neutral losses. In contrast, DOM composition in the whole water community was nearly identical to that in the initial coastal seawater. These differences in DOM composition persisted throughout the experiment despite shifts in bacterial diversity, underscoring an unappreciated role for larger microorganisms in constraining DOM composition in the marine environment. © 2016 Kujawinski, Longnecker, Barott, Weber and Kido Soule.","Bacteria; DOM; Microbial ecology; Peptides; Protozoa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008627032

Among various options, biofuel development has historically been a preferred option in various countries and Canada (including Saskatchewan) is no exception to it. One of the major motivations of this development is to help the rural communities grow. Results of this study suggest that smaller rural economies in Saskatchewan do not grow under such an initiative, since they have a large degree of leakages. Thus, biofuel development helps more to larger nearby communities than smaller communities. Another aspect of rural development is increased farm level incomes. Both ethanol and biodiesel production activities indicate a favorable impact on farm net income in Saskatchewan. However, in order to develop sustainable biofuel program, some attention needs to be paid to other aspects. Included here are implications of such a development on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use changes, water use, subsidization and further stress on international food security. On the water use issue, examination needs to be made both for the feedstock used and production of biofuel. If the feedstock is through irrigated production, biofuel's desirability on this count is reduced. Estimated GHG emissions from biofuel production studied in a life cycle assessment format, suggest a major reduction is possible, although they are slightly lower if the production of feedstock affects land use changes. Although the issue of food security in the context of Saskatchewan or Canada has not been raised, internationally such concerns could arise depending on the scale of expansion of such production in various countries. © 2016 WIT Press.","Biofuel; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Saskatchewan; Sustainable; Water Use.","Biofuels; Economics; Feedstocks; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Regional planning; Rural areas; Water conservation; Biodiesel production; Biofuel production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Saskatchewan; Saskatchewan , Canada; Sustainability considerations; Sustainable; Water use; Life cycle; biofuel; emission; ethanol; food security; greenhouse gas; income; land use change; life cycle analysis; rural development; rural economy; sustainability; water use; Canada; Saskatchewan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991490036

Majority of the economies are being benefited by the FDI especially during last three decades. FDI contributes to economic growth mainly through technological and managerial up gradation, increasing returns to production via positive externalities, creation of competitive investment climate and productive spillover effects etc. A large amount of literature is available to measure the impact of FDI on the economic growth but the present study is an attempt to investigate in to the fact that how much time FDI requires to contribute in the economic growth with full effusion. At present, this fact seems to the most important aspect of the issue to be studied. It is in this background that the present study is an attempt to examine and analyse the time lag required for the FDI to make its utmost contribution to the economic growth in SAARC (South Asian Association of for Regional Cooperation) economies. The present study has used the data of gross domestic product as the proxy of economic growth and FDI for all the member economies of SAARC region for the period during 2001-02 to 2014-15 and examined with the help of lagged regression model with seven lags. The finding of the study confirms that different time lag is required for each country of SAARC region to tap the utmost return of FDI in economic growth. For the contribution in utmost favourable manner in economic growth, FDI takes a time period of four years in India. For Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, Bangladesh and Bhutan, the time period requires seven, one, two, zero, zero and four years respectively. In case of Afghanistan, the findings were not significant and positively auto correlated also. This could have been due to differences in policies, governance, investment climate and the nature of FDI etc. Thus the findings suggest that attracting the FDI is not sufficient enough, the techniques must be developed to tap the benefits of FDI with minimum time lag to economic growth.","Economic growth; FDI; Lagged regression model; SAARC",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006265993

However, the applications are limited to onshore and offshore application for EOR activities have not yet been implemented. This paper presents the subsurface evaluation using laboratory experiments (PVT and corefloods) and compositional modeling, the design and surveillance program of a CO2 pilot project planned in a carbonate reservoir located offshore Abu Dhabi. PVT and coreflood experiments demonstrate the local displacement efficiency of CO2 in tertiary mode due to gas-oil miscibility, swelling of oil and reduction in oil viscosity. The screening study performed using a tuned equation of state (EOS) predicts significant additional recovery in a previously waterflooded area. A pilot is planned in one of the reservoirs of the field, which has 40 years of peripheral seawater injection history. The pilot design is influenced by existing peripheral pressure gradient, and is located down-dip in the field that covers approximately 80 acres. The pilot location is selected based on geology, reservoir quality, maturity to waterflood and surface facility constraints. A comprehensive reservoir surveillance plan, including one to two observers well, is developed to monitor pilot performance. The planned pilot will reduce uncertainties and risk associated with CO2 injection and address bottleneck uncertainties in an offshore environment before large-scale application. The first offshore CO2 injection pilot is designed for implementation in a tertiary mode in a giant carbonate field, which is still under secondary recovery production, to minimize interaction with current production and impact on surface facility. The paper also presents the possible mitigation for various challenges identified like asphaltene, scaling, corrosion, impact on existing carbon steel well completion, etc. associated with CO2 injection. The methodology and technical analysis used to evaluate and design the CO2 pilot are applicable to other potential fields in the region.

Household air pollution is harmful to human health, climate, and environment. Sustained uptake and use of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels are proposed as solutions to this problem. In this paper, we present our study protocol aimed at understanding multiple interacting feedback mechanisms involved in the dynamic behavior between social, ecological, and technological systems driving sustained use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies among the rural poor in India. Methods/Design: This study uses a comparative case study design to understand the dynamics of sustained use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in four rural communities of Rajasthan, India. The study adopts a community based system dynamics modeling approach. We describe our approach of using community based system dynamics with rural communities to delineate the feedback mechanisms involved in the uptake and sustainment of clean cooking technologies. We develop a reference mode with communities showing the trend over time of use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in these communities. Subsequently, the study develops a system dynamics model with communities to understand the complex sub-systems driving the behavior in these communities as reflected in the reference mode. We use group model building techniques to facilitate participation of relevant stakeholders in the four communities and elicit a narrative describing the feedback mechanisms underlying sustained adoption or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies. Discussion: In understanding the dynamics of feedback mechanisms in the uptake and exclusive use of cleaner cooking systems, we increase the likelihood of dissemination and implementation of efficacious interventions into everyday settings to improve the health and wellbeing of women and children most affected by household air pollution. The challenge is not confined to developing robust technical solutions to reduce household air pollution and exposure to improve respiratory health, and prevent associated diseases.

Soil acidification in a managed agricultural production system is caused by the transformation of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S), which releases protons (H+) to soil solution. Soil acidification decreases soil pH, causing adverse effects on plants and soil microorganisms. Acidification, coupled with aluminum, manganese, and iron toxicities, and phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and potassium deficiencies, can lead to low soil fertility. Soil acidity influences soil C and N cycles by controlling activities of microorganisms involved in the transformations of these two elements. Traditionally, lime materials are added to neutralize acidic soils and to overcome the problems associated with soil acidification, but they also influence C and N cycles, thereby affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) flux in soils. For example, liming has been shown to decrease nitrification-induced nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from many agricultural lands. However, there are concerns that liming increases the availability of soil nitrate (NO3−), which is a substrate for N2O emission through denitrification. The dissolution of liming materials can act as either a net source or sink for carbon dioxide (CO2). Lime-derived CO2 reacts with microbial respiration-derived carbonic acid in soils to yield carbonate material, serving as a sink of CO2 in soil. In calcareous soils with high pH, agricultural lime (CaCO3) serves as a net sink for CO2 whereas in acid soils it serves as a net source of CO2. In acid soils, increased availability of aluminum (Al3+) ions inhibits activity of methane (CH4) oxidizers. Adding lime to soils has shown to increase CH4 oxidation and reduce GHG emission. The present review brings together basic concepts of soil acidification and recent developments on the implications of liming in relation to C and N transformations and cycling, particularly GHG emissions from soils. Given the major influence of lime addition on soil microorganisms relating to C and N cycles, future research should focus on the role of liming on soil microbial communities to provide insight into combined mitigation of N2O, CO2, and CH4 gases from agricultural soils. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","carbon dioxide; consumption; emission; flux; greenhouse gases; lime; methane; nitrous oxide",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994131539

In particular, the development of adequate transmission infrastructures and grid-impacting technologies plays more and more a crucial role to foster the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and to realize the European Energy Union, set as strategic target by the European Commission. In this framework, the main objective of the GridTech project has been to conduct an integrated assessment of new grid-impacting technologies and their implementation into the European power system, comparing different technological options towards full RES exploitation, with the lowest possible total electricity cost. For the purpose of GridTech project, the focus is on the innovative technologies that may (directly or indirectly) impact on the transmission grid development and operation and support the integration of variable RES. These elements are grouped in Transmission Grid Technologies (TGT), Energy Storage Technologies (EST), Electricity Demand Technologies (EDT). The approach of the project entails the analysis of the 2020, 2030 and 2050 time horizons, to assess which innovative technologies and where, when, and to which extent they could effectively contribute to the further development of the European transmission grid, also towards potential supergrid architectures. For each target year and scenario, the methodology is based on the evaluation of the different benefits to the European power system provided by the innovative technologies comparing the case implementing the assessed technology with respect to a base case without it. The techno-economic assessment of the different options is completed by technology cost calculation and is carried out at two correlated levels by a pan-European approach analysis (top-down) and by regional case studies (bottom-up). The present paper, after investigating the approach adopted within GridTech, focuses on main results of the pan-European study as well as of the Irish and Italian regional analyses, with particular attention on 2030 and 2050 scenarios developments. © 2016 CIGRE.

Advocates of unconventionals point out the unprecendented effects eg on the energy supply with largely reduced imports of natural gas, the economy and also significant CO2 reduction since the shale boom took off some ten years ago in the US. Opponents, on the contrary, emphasize the environmental impacts and unpredictable risks, especially of hydraulic fracturing. This includes induced seismicity and waste waster disposal. Meanwhile, the German government has drafted ammendments of the mining and water acts, in order to address the environmental risks. In light of this controversial debate the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) conducted a comprehensive resource assessment of shale gas and (light) tight oil in Germany and also studied the environmental impacts of shale gas development and hydraulic fracturing from a geoscientific perspective (BGR, 2016). Here the basic findings of this study are given. Shale gas and tight oil potential was identified in seven of the investigated shale formations. In-Place and technically recoverable resources for these formations have been assessed using Monte-Carlo-Simulations and incorporating laboratory analysis of petrophysical, mineralogical and geochemical parameters of the investigated shales. The largest potential is expected in the North German Basin - and in particular in the Posidonia Shale at depths beyond 1000 metres. In total, shale gas technical recoverable resources are estimated between 320 and 2030 billion cubic metres, slightly smaller than the first preliminary estimate issued by BGR in 2012. However, the magnitude of these resources is still considerably larger than Germany's conventional gas reserves and resources of 90 and 110 billion m3 (including tight gas), respectively. The technical recoverable shale oil resource potential in Germany is estimated between 13 to 164 million tonnes, corresponding to around the same magnitude as its conventional oil reserves (31 million tonnes) and resources (20 million tonnes). Thus, in particular domestic shale gas is considered as a potentially significant resource, which could facilitate to compensate for the general decline in natural gas production in Germany. Concerning environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, numerical modelling of frac fluid migration in the subsurface has been conducted, as well as stress modelling to estimate frac dimensions, magnitudes and frequency of induced seismicity during hydraulic stimulation. These models are based on a common generic lithostratigraphy of a potential shale oil or shale gas play the North-German basin. The employed models demonstrate that a sufficient safety margin from the injection point to shallow aquifers can be maintained, provided suitable locations are selected in compliance with legal regulations and when using state-of-the-art technology. © 2016, Deutsche Wissens.

EDF is seeking to extend the lifetime of the power plants beyond 40 years. In this respect, a first retrofit program in collaboration with the GIS manufacturer Siemens was carried out in 2013 on the 225kV substation of Le Havre, fossil-fuel power plant located in north-west France. The 225 kV and 400 kV Gas Insulated Substations connecting powerful nuclear, fossil-fuel, and hydroelectric power plants to the grid, are of high strategic significance. In France, most of these GIS have been in operation for more than 25 years, and are therefore now facing ageing and wear issues. The replacement of a whole GIS is not a conceivable solution given the significant revenue shortfall caused by the extended unavailability of the substation connecting the power plant to the grid. Focusing maintenance efforts on the circuit breakers, which are the key components of such substations, maximizes the availability of the GIS and becomes a cost-effective option. Retrofitting involves replacing old generation equipment by new equipment, while maintaining the original function. Retrofitted circuit breakers have both economic and technical benefits. Some 20 years after the end of the GIS commercialization period, the availability of spare-parts is no longer guaranteed. Therefore, refurbishing a GIS with old generation spare-parts is now more expensive than buying and installing new-generation circuit breakers. Moreover, new technology circuit breakers improve the performance, availability and reliability of the substation. Ongoing maintenance is easier for both technical and regulatory aspects, notably thanks to the spring drive mechanism, as opposed to the hydraulic drive mechanism. Finally, from an environmental point of view, the introduction of new design methods made it possible to reduce GIS dimensions. The reduction of the installed SF6 mass complies with the international and local regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. For all of these reasons, the old generation circuit breaker Siemens DHB2 (H9) with hydraulic drive mechanism have been entirely replaced by new generation DB9 (8DN9) with spring drive mechanism.

Waiting time perceptions are highly subjective and vary according to mode, availability of schedule information, and stop amenities. The research on pedestrian design finds that high-quality and natural environments reduce stress and encourage walking and bicycling. It seems reasonable that similar effects would apply for transit users on the basis of the environments around transit stops, but little research directly explores the issue. This paper responds to this knowledge gap by examining how perceptions of waiting time vary in relation to stop environments. The research compared transit users' actual and estimated wait time at 36 stops and stations in a mix of environmental situations in the region of the Twin Cities, Minnesota. Regression analysis explained the variation in riders' self-reported waiting time as a function of their externally observed waiting times as well as characteristics of the environment surrounding the stop and station. For waits longer than 5 min, perceptible pollution and exposure to traffic led to significant overestimates of waiting time. Riders waiting at stops with dense, mature tree cover, however, significantly underestimated their waiting times. The effect of dense, mature tree cover is strong enough to compensate for the effects of both air pollution and traffic awareness. Policy implications and further research needs are discussed. © 2016, National Research Council.

Departing from a global and national framework, the state's trends and characteristics of electricity consumption, generation and policies and factors modeling these are depicted. The trends of parameters such as energy intensity of GDP, GHG emissions by energy unit produced, and share of renewables are first analyzed. Then, a test for detecting a decoupling of electricity consumption from weather is carried on, using correlation in subsets of time series together with statistical trend detection, for assessing an overall state-level change, instead of punctual savings or estimations, which is attributable to building and appliance efficiency standards. The work focuses on the residential and tourism sectors, which demand above 70% of the electricity in the State, intending to develop an approach to regional scale change assessments, instead of estimations or punctual saving calculation in warm regions, with a comprehensive data input requirement for developing countries. The findings show that GDP has grown slightly more energy intensive, the share of renewables in the mix has diminished, and, in spite of punctual savings from demand side management measures, due to an overall increase in air conditioning and other devices penetration, there is no significant decoupling in energy consumption from temperature, a main driver of consumption in BCS, where total summer demand is about 50% greater than that of winter and the state which ranks second in non industrial GHG emissions per capita in Mexico.

In the last decade, its fleet has been renewed by 142 new low-floor trams. Shortly after their introduction, it was observed that they have a negative impact on the exploitation behavior of tram infrastructure, primarily on the durability of rail fastening systems. Because of that, it was decided to modify existing rail fastening systems to the new track exploitation conditions. When the (re)construction of tram infrastructure is carried out by applying new systems and technologies, it is necessary to take into account their impact on the future propagation of noise and vibration in the environment. This paper gives a short overview of the characteristics of the two newly developed rail fastening systems for Zagreb tram tracks, their application in construction of experimental track section, and performance and comparison of noise and vibration measurements results. Measured data on track vibrations and noise occurring during passage of the tram vehicles is analyzed in terms of track decay rates and equivalent noise levels of passing referent vehicle. Vibroacoustic performance of new fastening systems is evaluated and compared to referent fastening system, in order to investigate their ability to absorb vibration energy induced by tram operation and to reduce noise emission. © 2016 Stjepan Lakušić et al.",,"Crashworthiness; Decay (organic); Noise pollution; Railroad rolling stock; Vibration analysis; Vibrations (mechanical); City of Zagreb; Noise and vibration; Noise emissions; Public transportation; System modifications; Track vibration; Traffic noise; Vibration energies; Trolley cars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966309387

In fact, these circumstances are outcomes of deficits accumulated for years in the production of an urban space that neglected environmental factors in their management, construction and planning. As a coping strategy the municipality of São Paulo promulgated in 2009 the Municipal Policy on Climate Change (MPCC), whose original main objective was to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases. This chapter aims to analyze São Paulo’s MPCC until 2012 in terms of the Health Sector’s convergence and intersectoral actions, considering a necessary dialectic between global and local towards adaptive measures in the urban scale concerning to climatic variability. The content analysis model as a qualitative approach was applied on documentary data and interviews with public managers. It showed that the primary research hypothesis, which considered that the Health Sector would have its attributions restricted to perform the monitoring of air quality, was refutable. Instead, there was a redirection of health actions, in which a dialectical intersectoral positive relationship was established, with actions that could interact breaking through the traditional model of sectoral policies which are generally reductionist. The MPCC in the perspective of interaction with the Health Sector encountered cooperation among sectors of the government promoting and strengthening adaptive capacities under public health concerns. All of these advances could be possible even with the prevalence of an initial orientation for mitigation in this public policy. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation; Environmental health; Public policy for climate change; Urban sustainability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071394377

These concepts have great potential in the study area, the mountain region of Rio de Janeiro state, where a disaster in 2011 showed once more that landslides, mudslides and floods are recurrent. Although degradation of the natural ecosystems is one of the main reasons for the high vulnerability of the local population, ecosystem-based measures to reduce disaster risks and to adapt to climate change are still uncommon. Valuing the benefits of nature through community-based adaptation measures is one promising approach to reduce landscape and ecosystem degradation and vulnerability, but a high level of community awareness is needed to generate their active participation in protecting and restoring ecosystems. To analyze the degree of awareness and the reasons for the barriers to participation, a perception analysis was conducted based on collected quantitative and qualitative data. Results show that people (a) have a high perception of their vulnerability, but (b) have poor knowledge about the relation between risks and ecosystem services, (c) do not feel responsible for participating, and (d) do not see possibilities for a better engagement in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. We conclude that these three gaps (b, c and d) need to be addressed as a main component of a sensitization concept for Eco-DRR and EbA in the region. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Adaptation; Brazil; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Extreme weather event; Perception; Risk; Sensitization; Vulnerability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014057630

We show that free allowances allocated to price-regulated firms effectively act as a subsidy to output, distort consumer choices, and generally induce higher output and emissions by price-regulated firms. This provides a cost-effectiveness argument for an auction-based allocation of allowances (or equivalently an emissions tax). For real-world economies such as the Unites States, in which about 20 percent of total carbon dioxide emissions are generated by price-regulated electricity producers, our quantitative analysis suggests that free allowances increase economy-wide welfare costs of the policy by 40-80 percent relative to an auction. Given large disparities in regional welfare impacts, we show that the inefficiencies are mainly driven by the emissions intensity of electricity producers in regions with a high degree of price regulation.

The paper also identifies how tourist development and climate change adaptation can be combined to transform space and place, especially in coastal tourism areas. Design/methodology/approach: Using a theoretical approach based on the concept of production of space, the study focuses on relational space, relationships expressed through representations of space and social practices. A case study method is used to analyze the socio-geographic processes at work in the adaptation to climate change in a coastal tourism community in Quebec, Canada. The analysis of the study utilized Nvivo with thematic textual queries. Findings: The results reveal an adaptation process at work, based on a “hold the line” strategy, where private stakeholders choose to invest in defensive structures to mitigate the impact of rising sea levels and erosion. This strategy reflects coordinated action in the face of the risk and to protect high-value land property. Research limitations/implications: This research illustrates how tourism and climate change adaptation discourses intersect. It also reveals how tourism development promotes the values and image of coastal space and how this can conflict with an efficient climate change adaptation strategy. Originality/value: This research provides guidelines for coastal tourism communities, enabling them to design their own climate change adaptation strategy, taking into account how the different social discourses and tourism practices interact with climate change adaptation. It also provides some insights into the criteria that influence an effective climate change adaptation strategy. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Coastal community; Coastal tourism space; Production of space",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994652695

The methodology of the research is based on the system approach to estimating the state of gas and oil resources of the Russian North and comprehensive analysis of aligning economic interests of Russia and a number of foreign countries. A complex of general scientific and special methods of research was used, including abstract-logical, balance, statistical analysis and others. The article shows that the Russian North is extremely rich in gas and oil resources that are both currently exploited and promising for reclaiming especially on the shelf of Arctic seas. It analyzes reasons of the decrease in the gas and oil production in the country that has occurred over recent years. It is caused by the fall of the demand for hydrocarbons in the world, sectoral sanctions, and the decrease in the production of the mineral resources base. Gas and oil resources of Russia fall within the interests of a number of foreign countries, mainly West European countries for which stable provision of the economy with raw hydrocarbons becomes one of the most important strategic tasks. Long-term economic interests of Russia coincide with the interests of the European Union (EU), however, not fully. The authors come to the conclusion that in case of supplying hydrocarbons economic interests of Russia and EU countries must be aligned not only in terms of searching for mutually profitable forms of cooperation but also solving basic inconsistencies that lie in the basis of opinions discrepancies. © 2016, Econjournals.

Allison Larr and Matthew Neidell focus on two atmospheric pollutants—ozone and particulate matter—that can harm children’s health in many ways. Ozone irritates the lungs, causing various respiratory symptoms; it can also damage the lung lining or aggravate lung diseases such as asthma. Particulate matter affects both the lungs and the heart; like ozone, it can cause respiratory symptoms and aggravate asthma, but it can also induce heart attacks or irregular heartbeat. Beyond those immediate effects, childhood exposure to ozone and particulate matter can do long-term damage to children’s health and reduce their ability to accumulate human capital. For example, frequent asthma attacks can cut into school attendance and academic performance, ultimately detracting from children’s ability to earn a good living as adults. Fossil fuel-burning power plants, which are a major source of carbon emissions that cause climate change, also emit high levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, which play a role in forming ozone and particulate matter. We might assume, then, that policies to reduce climate change by cutting back on carbon emissions from power plants would automatically cut back on these other types of pollution. But it’s not quite that simple—atmospheric concentrations of ozone and particulate matter are linked to heat and other climatic variables through complex, nonlinear relationships. Taking those complex relationships into account and examining a variety of ways to model future air quality, Larr and Neidell project that policies to mitigate the emissions that produce climate change would indeed significantly reduce atmospheric ozone and particulate matter—at least in the United States, which has the most-complete data available to make such calculations. The drop in pollution would in turn produce significant improvements in child wellbeing. Children would be more likely to survive into adulthood, experience healthier childhoods, have more human capital, and be more productive as adults. © 2016, Center for the Future of Children.

The large iron-induced blooms were dominated by small diatom species belonging to the genera Chaetoceros (Hyalochaete) and Thalassiosira, which rapidly responded to the onset of favorable light-conditions in the meander of the Polar Front. In comparison, the iron-limited HNLC area was typically characterized by autotrophic nanoeukaryote-dominated communities and by larger and more heavily silicified diatom species (e.g. Fragilariopsis spp.). Our results support the hypothesis that diatoms are valuable vectors of carbon export to depth in naturally iron-fertilized systems of the Southern Ocean. Furthermore, our results corroborate observations of the exported diatom assemblage from a sediment trap deployed in the iron-fertilized area, whereby the dominant Chaetoceros (Hyalochaete) cells were less efficiently exported than the less abundant, yet heavily silicified, cells of Thalassionema nitzschioides and Fragilariopsis kerguelensis. Our observations emphasize the strong influence of species-specific diatom cell properties combined with trophic interactions on matter export efficiency, and illustrate the tight link between the specific composition of phytoplankton communities and the biogeochemical properties characterizing the study area.","Carbon biomass; Diatoms; Natural iron fertilization; Plankton community structure; Southern Ocean","biomass; community composition; diatom; eukaryote; iron; phytoplankton; polar front; sediment trap; surface water; trophic interaction; Indian Ocean; Kerguelen Plateau; Southern Ocean; Bacillariophyta; Chaetoceros; Fragilariopsis; Fragilariopsis kerguelensis; Hyalochaete; Thalassionema nitzschioides; Thalassiosira; carbon; chlorophyll; iron; archaeon; bacterium; biodiversity; biomass; classification; diatom; Indian Ocean; isolation and purification; metabolism; phytoplankton; sea; season; Archaea; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Chlorophyll; Diatoms; Indian Ocean; Iron; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992708597

Investigating the response of plant communities to climate change is needed to gain insight into the potentially detrimental effects on ecosystem processes. While many studies have used satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) as a proxy for air temperature, few studies have attempted to create and validate models of forest understory temperature (Tust), as it is obscured from these space-borne observations. This study worked to predict instantaneous values of Tust using daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data over a 99,000 km2 study area located in the Rocky Mountains of western Alberta, Canada. Specifically, we aimed to identify the forest characteristics that improve estimates of Tust over using LST alone. Our top model predicted Tust to within a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.4 °C with an overall model fit of R2 = 0.89 over two growing seasons. Canopy closure and the LiDAR-derived standard deviation of canopy height metric were found to significantly improve estimations of Tust over MODIS LST alone. These findings demonstrate that canopy structure and forest stand-type function to differentiate understory air temperatures from ambient canopy temperature as seen by the sensor overhead. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change; Land surface temperature; LiDAR; MODIS; Phenology; Understory air temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Biology; Estimation; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Optical radar; Plant shutdowns; Plants (botany); Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Air temperature; Instantaneous value; Land surface temperature; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Phenology; Satellite remote sensing; Vegetation phenology; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983738649

As concrete is the second most used material in the world after water, its environmental impact is significant, especially because of the production of cement. Clinker substitution is according to the International Energy Agency and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development one of the four main reductions levers for the cement industry. Unlike Carbon Capture and Storage technology, replacing clinker with by-products such as fly ash and blast-furnace slag is technically feasible and applicable today. The use of blended cements is nowadays more and more commonly widespread. Ternary cements is particularly advantageous to benefit the synergetic action of two substitutes such as fly ash and limestone filler. Cement standard EN 197-1 is evolving towards more ternary binders but their impact on concrete properties are not thoroughly investigated yet. This paper presents some effects of newly developed ternary cements on concrete. The use of composite cements is a compelling solution to reduce the environmental impact of concrete but it is necessary to always assess their suitability in concrete. © The Author(s) 2016.

There is much political activism noticeable for translating the international idea of CCA to the local realities of The Gambia.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the level of stakeholder participation in the Ghana National Climate Change Policy. It examines the actors in the policy space and the negotiations and tradeoffs made during the policymaking process. Finally, it outlines the steps undertaken to make the process participatory and consultative. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative method has been used for this paper. The research design involves a review of relevant literature on Ghana’s climate change regime, meeting reports and key informant interviews. Findings – The findings indicate that the processes the policy underwent had extensive stakeholder participation. An uptake of evidence was from existing impact and vulnerability assessments, the first and second communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), scientific and research documents and expert knowledge. Key actors were identified and involved right from the beginning of the policymaking process. Although stakeholder participation was time-consuming, expensive and elongated, the policy process was vital for buy-in and ownership. The results also identified the need to include more stakeholders at the sub-regional levels in policymaking. Originality/value – The study is the first of its kind detailing stakeholder participation in the climate change policy process in Ghana. It forms a good basis for comparative studies with similar policies in other countries. Thus, this paper fills an identified gap of the need to document climate change policymaking processes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Actors; Climate change policy; Ghana; Impacts; Participation; Stakeholders’ trade-offs","climate change; climate effect; environmental policy; expert system; participatory approach; policy making; qualitative analysis; stakeholder; trade-off; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971500275

Initial screening of a B. pseudomallei signature-tagged mutagenesis library identified an attenuated mutant with a transposon insertion in a gene encoding the sensor component of an uncharacterised two-component signal transduction system (TCSTS), which we designated BprRS. Results: Single gene inactivation of either the response regulator gene (bprR) or the sensor histidine kinase gene (bprS) resulted in mutants with reduced swarming motility and reduced virulence in mice. However, a bprRS double mutant was not attenuated for virulence and displayed wild-type levels of motility. The transcriptomes of the bprS, bprR and bprRS mutants were compared with the transcriptome of the parent strain K96243. Inactivation of the entire BprRS TCSTS (bprRS double mutant) resulted in altered expression of only nine genes, including both bprR and bprS, five phage-related genes and bpss0686, encoding a putative 5, 10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductase involved in one carbon metabolism. In contrast, the transcriptomes of each of the bprR and bprS single gene mutants revealed more than 70 differentially expressed genes common to both mutants, including regulatory genes and those required for flagella assembly and for the biosynthesis of the cytotoxic polyketide, malleilactone. Conclusions: Inactivation of the entire BprRS TCSTS did not alter virulence or motility and very few genes were differentially expressed indicating that the definitive BprRS regulon is relatively small. However, loss of a single component, either the sensor histidine kinase BprS or its cognate response regulator BprR, resulted in significant transcriptomic and phenotypic differences from the wild-type strain. We hypothesize that the dramatically altered phenotypes of these single mutants are the result of cross-regulation with one or more other TCSTSs and concomitant dysregulation of other key regulatory genes. © 2016 Lazar Adler et al.","Burkholderia pseudomallei; Flagella; Transcriptomics; Two-component signal transduction; Virulence","protein histidine kinase; bacterial protein; virulence factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; biosynthesis; bprR gene; bprS gene; Burkholderia pseudomallei; carbon metabolism; controlled study; gene expression regulation; gene mutation; mouse; nonhuman; promoter region; regulator gene; RNA sequence; sequence homology; signal transduction; site directed mutagenesis; transcription regulation; transcriptomics; transposon; Burkholderia pseudomallei; gene expression profiling; gene regulatory network; genetics; mutation; pathogenicity; procedures; virulence; Bacterial Proteins; Burkholderia pseudomallei; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Gene Regulatory Networks; Mutation; Virulence; Virulence Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007560327

The production of plants offers many benefits in the social and environmental spheres: it generates employment, improves the landscape and gives a contribution to carbon dioxide accumulation. On the other hand, nurseries are considered intensive agricultural systems, responsible for soil erosion, waste production, and soil, air and water pollution. The research presented in this paper aimed to quantify the environmental impact, in terms of GHG (Green House Gases) emissions of different nursery typologies (in-pot and in-field grown plants) and productions (small, medium and large size plants). For this reason, a LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) approach was carried out in seven different nurseries on eleven production lines. GWP (Global Warming Potential) was the impact category chosen for this analysis, and the square meter was used as functional unit to represent the differences between nursery and plant typologies, although data for ""product"" unit are shown as well. Results show that in-pot systems, with an emissions range of 7.444-26.489 kg of CO2-e are much more impacting than in-field grown production processes (0.607-1.013 kg of CO2-e). Such great differences are mainly due to the peat used in substrate mixes and the plastic used for pots, indeed these are the most important sources of GHG emissions, and are widely used in in-pot production, while they are not present in in-field processes.

In the context of Ho Chi Minh City, the biggest city located in Southern in Vietnam, millions of student and employee annually immigrate there to live, work and study; therefore, encouraging them to use bus service to reduce pressure on urban environment and traffic and transport is significant. The goal of this study was to recognize the behaviour of mode choice among student and employee using disaggregate model. To achieve this goal, binary logit model was used under disaggregate choice method. The findings indicated that, for student, 'Gender', 'Motorcycle ownership', 'Travel time', 'Travel distance', 'Migrant status', 'Convenience', 'Safety', and 'Awareness' affected their mode choices; for employee, 'Married', 'Income', 'Children', 'House ownership', 'Motorcycle ownership', 'Migrant status', 'Travel cost', 'Travel distance', 'Convenience', 'Safety', 'Awareness', and 'Social norms' played vital roles in their choices of means of transport. Besides, although motorcycle was the premier transport mode for both employee and student every day, they showed their perceptions of the negative sides of motorcycle to environment and community, and also expressed their willingness to switch to travel by bus if public transportation infrastructure and quality were upgraded. © 2016 The Authors.

The climate system feedbacks responsible for introducing this nonlinear ice sheet response to orbital variations in insolation remain uncertain. Here we present benthic foraminiferal stable isotope (δ18O, δ13C) and trace metal records (Cd/Ca, B/Ca, U/Ca) from Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 607 in the North Atlantic. During the onset of the MPT, glacial-interglacial changes in δ13C values are associated with changes in nutrient content and carbonate saturation state, consistent with a change in water mass at our site from a nutrient-poor northern source during interglacial intervals to a nutrient-rich, corrosive southern source during glacial intervals. The respired carbon content of glacial Atlantic deep water increased across the MPT. Increased dominance of corrosive bottom waters during glacial intervals would have raised mean ocean alkalinity and lowered atmospheric pCO2. The amplitude of glacial-interglacial changes in δ13C increased across the MPT, but this was not mirrored by changes in nutrient content. We interpret this in terms of air-sea CO2 exchange effects, which changed the δ13C signature of dissolved inorganic carbon in the deep water mass source regions. Increased sea ice cover or ocean stratification during glacial times may have reduced CO2 outgassing in the Southern Ocean, providing an additional mechanism for reducing glacial atmospheric pCO2. Conversely, following the establishment of the ~100 k.y. glacial cycles, δ13C of interglacial northern-sourced waters increased, perhaps reflecting reduced invasion of CO2 into the North Atlantic following the MPT. © 2016 The Authors.",,"Atmospheric corrosion; Carbon dioxide; Deepwater drilling; Forestry; Glaciers; Nutrients; Oceanography; Sea ice; Seawater corrosion; Trace elements; Atmospheric pCO2; Carbonate saturations; Deep sea drilling; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Mid-pleistocene climate transition; Nutrient contents; Ocean stratification; Orbital variations; Glacial geology; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; climate feedback; climate variation; glacial-interglacial cycle; ice sheet; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; stable isotope; water mass; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003033431

Land surface and atmospheric conditions for summer heat waves were analyzed during spring (March-April-May, MAM) and summer (June-July-August, JJA) based on the Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability, and Change maximum temperature definition for heat wave frequency (HWF). The spatial-temporal pattern of HWF was determined using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and the corresponding principle component time series of the first EOF of HWF. Statistically significant analyses of observed conditions indicated that sensible heat increased and latent heat fluxes decreased with high HWF in the South Central U.S. The largest positive correlations of sensible heat flux to HWF and the largest negative correlations of latent heat flux to HWF were specifically observed over the CN. This is a significantly different energy transfer regime due to less available soil moisture during the antecedent MAM and JJA. The higher sensible heat from dry soil could cause significant warming from the near surface (>2.0°C) to the lower troposphere (>1.5°C), and accumulated boundary layer heat could induce the significant patterns of higher geopotential height and enhance anticyclonic circulations (negative vorticity anomaly) at the midtroposphere. Results suggested a positive land-atmosphere feedback associated with heat waves and called attention to the need for region-specific climate adaptation planning. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

Since S-CO2 Brayton cycle has advantages in economics due to high efficiency and compactness of system, various industries have been trying to develop technologies on the design and analysis of S-CO2 Brayton cycle components. Among various technical issues on the S-CO2 Brayton cycle technology development, treatment of thermodynamic property near the critical point of S-CO2 is very important since the property shows non-linear variation which causes large error on design and analysis results for ideal gas based methodologies. Due to the special behavior of thermodynamic property of CO2 near the critical point, KAIST research team has been trying to develop a S-CO2 compressor design and analysis tool to reflect real gas effect accurately for better design and performance prediction results. The main motivation for developing an in-house code is to establish turbomachinery design methodology based on general equations to improve accuracy of design and analysis results for various working fluids including S-CO2. One of the key improvements of KAIST-TMD which is an in-house tool for S-CO2 turbomachinery design and analysis is the conversion process between stagnation condition and static condition. Since fluid is moving with high flow velocity in a compressor, the conversion process between stagnation and static condition is important and it can have an impact on the design and analysis results significantly. A common process for the conversion is based on the specific heat ratio which is typically a constant from ideal gas assumption. However, specific heat ratio cannot be assumed as a constant for the case of S-CO2 compressor design and analysis because it varies dramatically near the critical point. Thus, in this paper, sensitivity study results on the state condition conversion between stagnation and static conditions with different approaches will be presented and further analysis on impact of the selected approaches on the final impeller design results will be discussed.

Similar to other industrialized countries the main potential for reductions lies in the building stock. A key issue is here the energy refurbishment rate as refurbishing of existing buiLdings down to low and ultra-low energy buildings is possible and often even profitable. Whereas the current energy refurbishment rate is about 1% per year, the German government aims at doubling the rate to achieve their ambitious climate protection targets. A variety of barriers exist which hinder past efforts to increase the rate. The motivation of the house owners is empirically studied in order to develop tailored instruments and strategies to foster refurbishment of residential buildings in Germany. The studies are realized in six municipalities in Germany showing a variety of dilircnt dynamics (migration, elderly people, shrinkage, growth) likely influencing the motivation of the owners. The municipalities are thought as key players as they arc close to the owners and have the chance to overcome some of the barriers by combining a variety of municipal policy instruments from social, urban development and environmental policy. The contribution will present the general approach and first year's results of the three years research project Sandy.","Building owner; Decision maker; Energy refurbishment; Motivation; Tailored instruments","Decision making; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Motivation; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Building owners; Climate protection; Decision makers; Energy refurbishment; Environmental policy; Industrialized countries; Residential building; Total energy consumption; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986877603

PM concentrations are significantly enhanced by primary particle emissions from traffic sources. Recently, in order to reduce CO2 and increase fuel economy, gasoline direct injected (GDI) engine technology is increasingly used in vehicle manufactures. The popularization of GDI technique has resulted in increasing of concerns on environmental protection. In order to better understand variations in chemical composition of particulate matter from emissions of GDI vehicle versus a port fuel injected (PFI) vehicle, a high time resolution chemical composition of PM emissions from GDI and PFI vehicles was measured at facility of Transport Pollution Research Center (TPRC), National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), Korea. Continuous measurements of inorganic and organic species in PM were conducted using an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToFAMS). The HR-ToF-AMS provides insight into nonrefractory PM composition, including concentrations of nitrate, sulfate, hydrocarbon-like and oxygenated organic aerosol, and organic mass with 20 sec time resolution.

Since the building sector accounts for a high proportion of carbon emissions, the construction is regarded as one of the most potential industry to reduce carbon emissions. However, there is no standardized indicator to measure carbon performance in the construction industry. As a result, the choice of various indicators may result in significantly different carbon performances which determine whether an industry is considered truly ""low carbon"". In this paper, the current indicators for assessing carbon performance in the construction industry are reviewed. The pros and cons of the current indicators are also highlighted. The problems of using the current indicators are discussed, and these problems are often related to accuracy of indicator, data availability and definitions of specific terms. Suggestions are made to focus on carbon emissions at building operation stage first as it accounts for a significant amount of carbon emissions during the whole building life-cycle. It should be highlighted that embodied emissions of buildings are also important during the whole building life-cycle. However, due to the challenges in data acquisition for calculating embodied emissions, attention should be paid more to the operational stage first as smart meters can be used to facilitate data collection processes. The findings provide clues for industry practitioners to develop an indicator which is more practical in use to assess carbon performance in the construction industry. © 2016 The Authors.

In the present paper, 3 additional considerations, pilot burned gas mixing before the main injection; major NO formation area; concentration correction, were applied to the previously developed real-time NO estimation model based on in-cylinder pressure and data available from ECU. The model improvement was verified on a 1.6 liter EURO5 diesel engine in both steady and transient operation. These considerations expand the predictable NO concentration range from 15 ppm up to 1461 ppm in the steady state conditions with an R2-value of near 0.98, although EGR rate, main injection timing, boost pressure and rail pressure varied. In addition, the NOx prediction results during the WLTP cycle matched the portable NOx sensor and HORIBA MEXA 7100. This virtual NOx sensor concept might be useful as an engine emission calibration tool, for real-time control of exhaust NOx emission levels, and as an alerting system for the on-board NOx sensor malfunction.

DME can be produced from natural gas (NG) or from renewable feedstocks such as landfill gas (LFG) or renewable natural gas from manure waste streams (MANR) or any other biomass. This study investigates the well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use and emissions of five DME production pathways as compared with those of petroleum gasoline and diesel using the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET®) model developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The five DME pathways include 1) fossil NG with large-scale DME plants, 2) methanol from fossil NG with large-scale plants for both methanol and DME (separately), 3) LFG with small-scale DME plants, 4) manure-based biogas with small-scale DME plants, and 5) methanol from black liquor gasification with small-scale DME plants. This study analyzes DME production and use in the U.S. and Europe, and in two vehicle classes (light and heavy duty vehicles [LDVs and HDVs]). The WTW results show significant reductions in fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by DME compared to gasoline and diesel if DME is produced from LFG and manure-based biogas. When methanol from black liquor is used for DME production, there are reductions in GHG emissions, though smaller than DME produced from LFG and MANR. Meanwhile, fossil NG-based DME produced in large-scale DME plants or from NG-based methanol shows GHG emissions at the similar level as petroleum diesel does.

However, the NOx reduction efficiency after the NOx passes through the after-treatment device changes with different NOx/NO ratios in engine-out emissions. For this reason, a precise NO/NOx ratio engine-out estimation is critical for maximizing NOx reductions. In this paper, a NOx prediction method based on an empirical relationship was established and validated during steady-state experimental conditions and the WLTC homologation cycle. The prediction model was verified on a 1.6-L EURO5 light-duty diesel engine. The engine was equipped with a single-stage turbocharger and a common rail direct injection system with solenoid injectors. The representative steady-state operating points were selected not only to cover the entire WLTC but also to test the swept conditions, such as the EGR, main injection timing, rail pressure and boost pressure, to determine the model’s robustness. Various NOx estimation models, such as the 1-D table model, exponential model and polynomial model, have been considered and applied to previous real-time NO prediction model by the authors. The real-time predictions for both NO and NOx were conducted in the ES1000 with the software ASCET. In this paper, the accuracies of the results from the NOx prediction models are presented. The prediction models were verified through steady-state experiments, where the predicted and measured values during WLTC were found to be highly consistent. © 2016, FISITA.

This site is located south and west of the seasonal Atlantic cold tongue and is affected by its propagation from June to September. Using an alkalinity-salinity relationship determined for the eastern tropical Atlantic and the observed fCO2, pH and the inorganic carbon concentration are calculated. The time series is investigated to explore the intraseasonal, seasonal and interannual timescales for these parameters, and to detect any long-term trends. At intraseasonal timescales, fCO2 and pH are strongly correlated. On seasonal timescales, the correlation still holds between fCO2 and pH and their variations are in agreement with those of sea surface salinity. At interannual timescales, some important differences appear in 2011-2012: lower fCO2 and fluxes are observed from September to December 2011 and are explained by higher advection of salty waters at the mooring, in agreement with the wind. In early 2012, the anomaly is still present and associated with lower sea surface temperatures. Nosignificant long-term trend is detected over the period 2006-2013 onCO2 and any other physical parameter. However, as atmospheric fCO2 is increasing over time, the outgassing of CO2 is reduced over the period 2006-2013 as the flux is mainly controlled by the difference of fCO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere. A longer time series is required to determine if any significant trend exists in this region. © 2016 N.

In the analysis, temporal and regional differences in feed types, feeding systems, cattle categories, average daily gains and carcass weights were considered. Emissions were estimated using life-cycle assessment (cradle to farm gate), based primarily on Holos, a Canadian whole-farm emissions model. In 2011, beef production in Canada required only 71% of the breeding herd (i.e. cows, bulls, calves and replacement heifers) and 76% of the land needed to produce the same amount of liveweight for slaughter as in 1981. Compared with 1981, in 2011 the same amount of slaughter weight was produced, with a 14% decline in CH4 emissions, 15% decline in N2O emissions and a 12% decline in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use. Enteric CH4 production accounted for 73% of total GHG emissions in both years. The estimated intensity of GHG emissions per kilogram of liveweight that left the farm was 14.0 kg CO2 equivalents for 1981 and 12.0 kg CO2 equivalents for 2011, a decline of 14%. A significant reduction in GHG intensity over the past three decades occurred as a result of increased average daily gain and slaughter weight, improved reproductive efficiency, reduced time to slaughter, increased crop yields and a shift towards high-grain diets that enabled cattle to be marketed at an earlier age. Future studies are necessary to examine the impact of beef production on other sustainability metrics, including water use, air quality, biodiversity and provision of ecosystems services. © CSIRO 2016.","beef cattle; environmental footprint; greenhouse gases.","agricultural production; breeding population; carbon footprint; cattle; comparative study; emission; environmental impact; feeding; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; livestock farming; Canada; Bos",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958175834

The largest grain harvest was collected that year. Nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) fertilizers are an essential factor that determines the quantity and quality of the crops harvested. However, over-fertilization can lead to negative economic and environmental consequences such as high production costs, depletion of energy resources and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Emissions from agricultural soils contributed to the major share of the total emissions from the sector - 53.7 %. N (pure nitrogen content) fertilizer application management is essential in improving the mentioned indicators. Traditionally, N fertilizers have been applied uniformly across the entire field while ignoring inherent spatial variation in the crop N needs within the crop fields. This results in either too little or too much application of N in various parts of the fields. Too little N reduces the yields, while too much N reduces the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The aim of the research study is to examine the opportunities to reduce direct N2O emissions from N (nitrogen content) fertiliser application in crop farming using the constant and variable N fertiliser spreading technologies. In the present research study, the authors have carried out an N fertilizer efficiency assessment to understand the evolution of cereal production in Latvia by using precision farming experimental data. Suitable qualitative and quantitative research methods were applied in the research. The research found that the use of the variable N fertiliser spreading technology led to a decrease in the consumption of N (pure nitrogen) fertilisers, as the average fertiliser application rate in the case of variable fertiliser spreading decreased by 10 kg·ha-1, which, in its turn, reduced CO2 emissions by 46.8 kg·ha-1.","Emissions; Fertilisers; Latvia; Precision farming","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Energy resources; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Grain growth; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Nitrogen; Particulate emissions; Regional planning; Agricultural sector; Environmental consequences; Fertilizer applications; Latvia; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Precision farming; Quantitative research methods; Spatial variations; Nitrogen fertilizers; agricultural emission; agricultural land; carbon emission; cereal; cost analysis; crop yield; experimental study; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; growth rate; nitrogen; precision agriculture; research work; Latvia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976530643

On the one hand, they face intense political, social and environmental pressures to move toward adopting energy systems that incorporate the use of renewable energy resources. By making this transition, they would contribute to carbon reduction and mitigate climate change. On the other hand, they need to coordinate their resources and become efficient when investing in new plants or upgrading existing production systems. This paper seeks to address the gains that utility companies can make when replacing older fossil-fuel-based plants with efficient combined heat and power (CHP) plants. We discuss the system effects from the changes in production of other units when new plants are constructed. Using one of the largest energy utility companies in Sweden, Fortum, as empirical point of departure, we analyzed the company's transition from using coal and hydrocarbons to an increased use of renewables and waste incineration CHP. Our analysis was based on comprehensive production data on CO2, SOx and NOx emissions. Our findings suggest that primary energy consumption drops when older, less efficient fossil plants are substituted for new efficient CHP plants; this drop includes the effect on remaining production. The benefits in terms of primary energy savings might even be greater than what is achieved in meeting the goal of climate change abatement through reduced CO2 emissions; NOx and SOx emissions are decreased with new biomass CHPs. Waste incineration CHP increases NOx and SOx emissions, when there is less fossil fuel to replace after the use of biomass is extended. In both cases, economic efficiency increase as costs are reduced. © 2016 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.","Climate change abatement; District heating; Environmental impact; Primary energy conservation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031848137

Environmental benefits, however, have not been quantified previously. The objective of this study was to estimate the environmental impact of sensor-based N fertilization of corn using model-based environmental Life Cycle Assessment. Nitrogen rate and corn grain yield were measured during a sensor-based, variable N-rate experiment in Lincoln County, MO. Spatially explicit soil properties were derived using a predictive modeling technique based on in-field soil sampling. Soil N2O emissions, volatilized NH3 loss, and soil NO3 - leaching were predicted at 60 discrete field locations using the DeNitrification- DeComposition (DNDC) model. Life cycle cumulative energy consumption, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, and eutrophication potential were estimated using model predictions, experimental data, and life cycle data. In this experiment, variable-rate N management reduced total N fertilizer use by 11% without decreasing grain yield. Precision application of N is predicted to have reduced soil N2O emissions by 10%, volatilized NH3 loss by 23%, and NO3 - leaching by 16%, which in turn reduced life cycle nonrenewable energy consumption, GWP, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential by 7, 10, 22, and 16%, respectively. Although mean N losses were reduced, the variations in N losses were increased compared with conventional, uniform N application. Crop canopy sensor-based, variable-rate N fertilization was predicted to increase corn grain N use efficiency while simultaneously reducing total life-cycle energy use, GWP, acidification, and eutrophication. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"Acidification; Crops; Energy utilization; Eutrophication; Global warming; Grain (agricultural product); Leaching; Life cycle; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soils; Crop canopy reflectance; Cumulative energy consumption; Denitrification decompositions (DNDC); Environmental benefits; Environmental life cycle assessment; Eutrophication potentials; Global warming potential; Precision applications; Environmental impact; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; fertilizer; nitrogen; accuracy; acidification; agricultural management; Article; canopy; case study; crop; decomposition; denitrification; energy consumption; environmental impact; eutrophication; fertilization; grain yield; greenhouse effect; leaching; life cycle assessment; maize; prediction; sampling; sensor; soil property; volatilization; agriculture; Colorado; maize; soil; Agriculture; Colorado; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960459013

This IO dipole (IOD)-like warming pattern, regarded as robust based on consistency among models by the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, results in a large increase in the frequency of extreme positive IOD (pIOD) events, elevating the risk of climate and weather disasters in the future over IO rim countries. These projections, however, do not consider large model biases in both the mean state and interannual IOD variance. In particular, a ""present-future relationship"" is identified between the historical simulations and representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 experiments from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble: models with an excessive IOD amplitude bias tend to project a strong IOD-like warming pattern in the mean and a large increase in extreme pIOD occurrences under increased GHG forcing. This relationship links the present simulation errors to future climate projections, and is also consistent with our understanding of Bjerknes ocean-atmosphere feedback. This study calibrates regional climate projections by using this present-future relationship and observed IOD amplitude. The results show that the projected IOD-like pattern of mean changes and frequency increase of extreme pIOD events are largely artifacts of model errors and unlikely to emerge in the future. These results illustrate that a robust projection may still be biased and it is important to consider the model bias effect. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Circulation/Dynamics; Climate change; Climate models; Geographic location/entity; Indian Ocean; Model evaluation/performance; Models and modeling; Physical Meteorology and Climatology","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Eastern equatorial Indian ocean; Geographic location; Indian ocean; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Model evaluation/performance; Regional climate projections; Climate change; air-sea interaction; atmospheric circulation; circulation; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; disaster management; extreme event; warming; weather forecasting; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017156021

A 4-year rotational experiment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-canola (Brassica napus L.)-grain legumes-wheat in sequence was established at Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia, in a semiarid Mediterranean-type environment where long-term average annual rainfall is 541mm and the incidence of summer rainfall is episodic and unreliable. The objectives of the experiment were to investigate whether (i) tillage increases N2O emissions and (ii) nitrogen (N) application can improve productivity without increasing N2O emissions. The base experimental design for each crop phase was a split-plot design with tillage treatment (tilled versus no-till) as the whole plot, and N fertiliser rate (0, 25, 50 and 100kgN/ha) as the subplot, replicated three times. This paper reports high resolution N2O emission data under a canola crop. The daily N2O emission rate averaged 0.55g N2O-N/ha.day, ranging between -0.81 and 6.71g N2O-N/ha.day. The annual cumulative N2O-N emitted was 175.6 and 224.3g N2O-N/ha under 0 and 100kgN/ha treatments respectively. There was no evidence to support the first hypothesis that tillage increases N2O emissions, a result which may give farmers more confidence to use tillage strategically to manage weeds and diseases where necessary. However, increasing N fertiliser rate tended to increase N2O emissions, but did not increase crop production at this site. © CSIRO 2016.","conservation tillage; greenhouse gases; nitrogen fertiliser; trace gas emission","Agricultural machinery; Crops; Cultivation; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Plants (botany); Productivity; Rain; Soil conservation; Conservation tillage; Nitrous oxide emissions; Semi-arid environments; South-eastern Australia; Split plot designs; Tillage treatment; Trace gas emissions; Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Agriculture; agricultural emission; canola; conservation tillage; crop production; crop rotation; dryland farming; emission; experimental design; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; legume; Mediterranean environment; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; semiarid region; trace gas; wheat; Australia; New South Wales; Wagga Wagga; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981501539

The influence of synthesis conditions such as NaOH/SiO2 ratio on the final products was investigated. The mesopore distribution can be facilely controlled by adjusting the size of primary particles via modulating the alkalinity of the synthesis gel. The ZSM-5 aggregates obtained by varying Na2O/SiO2 molar ratios from 0.05 to 0.13 are denoted as NA-X (X = 1-4). The NA-X samples are characterized by techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption-desorption, NH3-TPD and Py-IR. SEM revealed that the obtained NA-X were ellipsoidal spheres that consisted of nano-sized crystallites with 20-70 nm. It is found that NA-2 exhibits a mesopore distribution around 12 nm and possesses the largest amount of external acid sites, which lead to the remarkably improved catalytic performance in methanol to propylene (MTP) reaction. A possible growth mechanism of self-assembled NA-X zeolites directed by tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) is proposed. The crystallization process indicated that the size of raw materials gradually decreased, formed nano-sized particles and the stacking of the resulting small zeolite crystals will form NA-X zeolites with prolonged time. Compared with the conventional hydrothermal route, the solid-like state and steam-assisted conversion not only significantly shortened the crystallization time, but also greatly reduced the emissions of waste liquids. In addition, for the MTP reaction, the NA-X zeolites obtained by this method showed much better catalytic performance, propylene selectivity and longer lifetime to endure coke deposition than the sample obtained by the hydrothermal route. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Particle size; Propylene; Silica; Zeolites; Adsorption desorption; Catalytic performance; Crystallization process; Methanol to propylene (MTP); Nano-sized crystallites; Propylene selectivity; Steam assisted conversions; Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992388909

We presented a systematic study of the adsorption behaviors of gas molecules, CO2, N2, H2O, CO, NH3, NO, O2, H2 and NO2, on monolayer MoS2 with single SV by first-principles calculations. It was found that CO2, N2 and H2O molecules physisorbed at the proximity of single SV. Our adsorption energy calculations and charge transfer analysis showed that the interactions between CO2, N2 and H2O molecules and defective MoS2 are stronger than the cases of CO2, N2 and H2O molecules adsorbed on pristine MoS2, respectively. The defective MoS2 based gas sensors may be more sensitive to CO2, N2 and H2O molecules than pristine MoS2 based ones. CO, NO, O2 and NH3 molecules were found to chemisorb at the S vacancy site and thus modify the electronic properties of defective monolayer MoS2. Magnetism was induced upon adsorption of NO molecules and the defective states induced by S vacancy can be completely removed upon adsorption of O2 molecules, which may provide some helpful information for designing new MoS2 based nanoelectronic devices in future. The H2 and NO2 molecules were found to dissociate at S vacancy. The dissociation of NO2 molecules resulted in O atoms located at the S vacancy site and NO molecules physisorbed on O-doped MoS2.
