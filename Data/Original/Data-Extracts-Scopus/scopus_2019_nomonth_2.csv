Air pollution is estimated to contribute to at least 5 million premature deaths each year across the world. No one remains unaffected by dirty air, but the adverse impacts of air pollution fall most heavily upon vulnerable populations, such as children, women, and people living in poverty — groups to whom States have special obligations under international human rights law. The National Academies of Sciences and Medicine of South Africa, Brazil, Germany and the United States of America are calling upon government leaders, business and citizens to take urgent action on reducing air pollution throughout the world — to the benefit of human health and well-being, to the benefit of the environment and as a condition towards sustainable development. Air pollution is a cross-cutting aspect of many UN Sustainable Development Goals. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"air pollution; article; Brazil; child; controlled study; female; Germany; government; human; human rights; leadership; poverty; South Africa; sustainable development; vulnerable population; wellbeing; adverse event; air pollution; biomass; cooking; electric power plant; health care policy; heating; industry; mining; prevention and control; public policy; sustainable development; traffic and transport; United States; waste management; fossil fuel; Air Pollution; Biomass; Brazil; Cooking; Fossil Fuels; Germany; Health Policy; Heating; Humans; Manufacturing and Industrial Facilities; Mining; Power Plants; Public Policy; South Africa; Sustainable Development; Transportation; United States; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077204594

A Smart Beta strategy does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified cap-weighted index and as such may underperform such an index. The factors to which a Smart Beta strategy seeks to deliver exposure may themselves undergo cyclical performance. As such, a Smart Beta 36 strategy may underperform the market or other Smart Beta strategies exposed to similar or other targeted factors. In fact, we believe that factor premia accrue over the long term (5–10 years), and investors must keep that long time horizon in mind when investing. While diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss, investors in Smart Beta may diversify across a mix of factors to address cyclical changes in factor performance.

There is a robust scientific consensus that human-induced climate change is occurring not only in the Western Cape but around the world. The objective of this research was to assess the impact of climate change on primary agriculture and food security. The paper is based on a literature review. A variety of literature reviews, for example, 11 government reports and 21 journal articles including experience outside Western Cape, were consulted to enrich the local experience regarding the impact of climate change on agriculture. The results indicated that many dams had low water levels (40%) during 2016/2017, which reduced crop yields including grapes. Droughts, which affected both smallholder and commercial farmers, are now a common phenomenon. Livestock production has declined over time, with small stock, the beef and dairy industry being the most affected. The paper concludes by highlighting climate adaptation and mitigation interventions and strategies for both crops and livestock production in the Western Cape. The major recommendations included scaling up on the use of organic matter to avoid burning and creating gas emissions to the atmosphere, the effective use of livestock manure and the use of appropriate and adaptable seed varieties, managing the manure of the livestock to assist in mulching to reduce water loss through evaporation and using adaptable seeds. © 2019.

The results indicate that generally there are two emission layers for an individual frequency in plasmas with non-Thermal electrons, and they are separately attributed to the thermal electrons and non-Thermal electrons. The emission layer due to the thermal electrons is nearly identical to that for the case with Maxwellian distribution. The emission layer due to non-Thermal electrons is well localized in the location of the non-Thermal electrons. Even though the non-Thermal emission layer is broader, the emission intensity is smaller than that from the thermal emission layer for the cases studied in this work. Localized electron temperature fluctuations can still be distinguished by ECE measurement as long as it does not coexist with the non-Thermal electrons. Sawtooth inversion radii and tearing mode island location determined respectively by the ECE measurement and the soft x-ray measurement for a LHW-heated plasma show a good agreement, and this indicates that the ECE measurement in the plasma core region is not seriously polluted. © 2019 Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing","EAST; ECE; LHW; non-Thermal electrons; spatial localization","Cyclotrons; Electron cyclotron resonance; Electron emission; Electron temperature; Electrons; Plasma heating; X rays; EAST; Electron cyclotron emission; Maxwellian distribution; Nonthermal; Nonthermal emission; Plasma core regions; Soft X-ray measurements; Spatial localization; Thermionic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070889761

A new approach to estimating the annual energy output ESC of liquid-based solar thermal collectors is presented in this paper. The main parameters of the surrounding environment that affect the energy yield from solar water heating (SWH) systems are total solar radiation ES and outdoor air temperature θO. Here, two functions are developed that allow the specification of the ESC value based on these two previously determined factors. The article presents the subsequent stages that led to the development of this method. In the first step, the computer model of a solar domestic hot water (SDHW) system was built in the EnergyPlus environment. An object of the modeling procedure was the real solar installation located at Bialystok University of Technology. The database containing the annual energy output of the solar collectors, total solar radiation, and outdoor air temperature was developed based on the results of simulations made for 24 Polish cities. Then, the multiple regression method (implemented in Statistica v.13.1) was used to correlate these variables. Two contour graphs were also developed to determine the energy yield from solar collectors. © 2019 MDPI AG.

The leaf carbon isotope (δ13C) value is related to plant water-use efficiency (WUE) and is of great significance in revealing the WUE characteristics of species in karst areas. Measurements of the δ13C value in plant leaves and the nutrient and water contents of lithologic soils were obtained for six woody species (cypress, Cupressus funebris Endl.; mansur shrub, Coriaria nepalensisWall.; camphor, Cinnamomum bodinieri Levl.; birch, Betula luminifera H.Winkl.; alder, Alnus cremastogyne Burk. and dyetree, Platycarya longipesWu.) planted in three different lithologic soil types (dolomite, dolomite sandstone, limestone) in the karst area of Guizhou Province. The results showed that C. funebris in the dolomite sandstone soil had the highest δ13C value (-27.19%), whereas C. bodinieri in the limestone soil had the lowest δ13C value (-31.50%). In terms of lithology, the average leaf δ13C values were -28.66% (dolomitic sandstone), -28.83% (dolomite), and -29.46% (limestone). The δ13C values of C. funebris and A. cremastogyne were significantly lower in the limestone soil than in the dolomite and dolomite sandstone soil, indicating that the WUE of some tree species is affected by soil conditions under different lithological development processes. Moreover, the relationship between the δ13C value in the leaves and the comprehensive soil conditions varied among the species, and the δ13C value was negatively correlated with the soil water content in all three soil types. Our study provides basic data on the composition characteristics of the δ13C value of tree species, which is beneficial for the selection of tree species for vegetation restoration and afforestation in karst areas. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon isotope; Forest planting; Integrated fertility index; Karst area; Lithology","Carbon; Isotopes; Lime; Limestone; Lithology; Reforestation; Sandstone; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Carbon isotopes; Composition characteristics; Fertility indices; Forest planting; Karst areas; Leaf carbon isotopes; Vegetation recovery; Vegetation restoration; Landforms; carbon isotope; coniferous forest; dolomite; fertility; habitat quality; karst; leaf area; lithology; tree planting; Carbon; Dolomite; Isotopes; Lime; Plants; Reforestation; Trees; China; Guizhou; Alnus; Alnus cremastogyne; Betula luminifera; Cinnamomum; Coriaria; Cupressus; Cupressus funebris; Dryobalanops; Platycarya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065891275

These harsh conditions incited local peasants to adopt simple but ingenious agricultural practices that fit the prevailing rigours and ensure their livelihood survival: Terraced Agroforestry System (TAS). TAS, one of the most ancestral agricultural practices, becomes a dominant feature of the Anti-Atlas landscape. This study aims to explore the Anti-Atlas TAS as a resilient approach to counter climate change impacts and ensure a sustainable development of this region. To this end, a prospective study was conducted to survey the indigenous peasants, to assess the status of TAS, to describe its biodiversity trends, and ultimately to ensure its sustainable development. The primary results revealed that the Anti-Atlas TAS are based essentially on the Argan tree (Argania spinosa L.) as the predominant vegetation crown layer. Accordingly, goats represented the main integrated livestock. The related annual crops are mainly represented by local varieties of cereals and legumes. Other dryland fruit trees, such as almond, fig, olive, and date palm are also sparsely planted. Beyond their purely aesthetic and economic role, this agro-cultural heritage contributes greatly to the conservation of several local varieties and their associated fauna. Furthermore, the results allows us to identify some serious climatic and social challenges faced by the persisting TAS in the Anti-Atlas region. In this regards, the regional climate change scenarios predict warmer and dryer conditions over the studied region, meanwhile the new generation of local peasants increasingly lacks interest to maintain TAS and prefers to seek new opportunities in the Souss-Massa plain valley. Consequently, this paper investigates major issues threatened social, economic, and ecological balances and provides a combination of adaptation solutions to help revive the agro-cultural heritage of TAS from the process of extinction. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anti-Atlas; Climate change; Morocco; Sustainable development; Terraced agroforestry systems",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071356001

This is followed by a demonstration of a design solution for a new cycle with two enhanced energy-converting devices, namely a wet combustion chamber and a spray-ejector condenser. The proposed gas and steam cycle unit is contained within a single turbine, whose benefits combine those offered by gas turbines (high inlet temperatures) and steam turbines (full expansion into a vacuum). The efficiency of the oxy-fuel combustion system with carbon dioxide capture was determined based on thermodynamic analyses carried out using in-house codes (COM-GAS). The motivation behind this research paper was provided by calls for diversification in the power generation industry in Poland as well as the need for new solutions in power plants, including compact ones. Compactness can be achieved when the plant is rid of its largest components such as the heat recovery steam generator and the conventional steam condenser. For this, it would be necessary to design non-standard cutting-edge devices, but the counterbalancing pay-off would be in their size, reduced to the point where power plants, in which they are installed, will be able to adequately address the needs of urban users and cater for heat production demand. The concept under consideration is based on the use of shale gas deposits in the place of extraction in a compact, zero-emission gas-steam turbine power system. In our case power plant compactness is achieved by using two new devices, namely: 1) a wet combustion chamber (with oxy-combustion and combustion chamber walls cooling by thermal transpiration); 2) a condenser spray-ejector (using a bulk condensation of vapor-gas). The main aim of the spray-ejector condenser is simultaneously condensing steam and compressing CO2 from the condensation pressure to about 1 bar. Hence, the most important innovation of this steam-gas cycle emerges as the enhanced condensation, which is based on the nano-injection of cold water and a jet-powered compression of CO2 performed in the spray-ejector condenser. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

The fiddler crabs, Uca annulipes were collected from Muttukadu Estuary located on the Kanchipuram District, Tamil Nadu, India, 35 K.M away from Chennai, on the East Coast Road route to Kovalam. Materials and Methods: Fiddler crabs were collected by hand picking method. From the muscle mass of the Crab the bioactive compound was isolated by GC-MS analysis. Molecular docking was performed to identify the protein ligand responsible for the affinity with lung cancer causing tumour cells. Results and Discussion: Hence betuline is the potential lead molecule for the inhibition of lung cancer protein and the most important residues for potential drug target as carbon hydrogen bond, conventional hydrogen bond and Vander Waals interaction. In vitro studies of antimicrobial activities clearly indicated that the different concentrations of betuline bioactive compound have the potential to control the bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro studies of anticancer activities also evidently showed the different concentrations of bioactive compound betuline have the potential to control the proliferation of lung cancer cells.

We report here the use of 19F pseudocontact shift (PCS) NMR as a method to determine fluorine positions of high affinity ligands bound within the drug target human carbonic anhydrase II with high accuracy. Three different ligands were localized within the protein by analysis of the obtained PCS from simple one-dimensional 19F spectra with an accuracy of up to 0.8 Å. In order to validate the PCS, four to five independent magnetic susceptibility tensors induced by lanthanide chelating tags bound site-specifically to single cysteine mutants were refined. Least-squares minimization and a Monte-Carlo approach allowed the assessment of experimental errors on the intersection of the corresponding four to five PCS isosurfaces. By defining an angle score that reflects the relative isosurface orientation for different tensor combinations, it was established that the ligand can be localized accurately using only three tensors, if the isosurfaces are close to orthogonal. For two out of three ligands, the determined position closely matched the X-ray coordinates. Our results for the third ligand suggest, in accordance with previously reported ab initio calculations, a rotated position for the difluorophenyl substituent, enabling a favorable interaction with Phe-131. The lanthanide-fluorine distance varied between 22 and 38 Å and induced 19F PCS ranged from 0.078 to 0.409 ppm, averaging to 0.213 ppm. Accordingly, even longer metal-fluorine distances will lead to meaningful PCS, rendering the investigation of protein-ligand complexes significantly larger than 30 kDa feasible. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Amino acids; Calculations; Carbonic anhydrase; Complexation; Fluorine; Magnetic susceptibility; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Rare earth elements; Tensors; Ab initio calculations; Favorable interactions; High affinity ligands; Human carbonic anhydrase II; Least squares minimization; Magnetic susceptibility tensors; Protein-ligand complexes; Rational drug designs; Ligands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066090089

In this paper, levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and soil water scarcity have been studied in order to forecast how their changes could affect agricultural production in the future. For this purpose, meteorological data were generated according to the general circulation model ARPEGE, while water balance measures in the Northern Carpathians (Slovakia) were evaluated by using agroecological model DAISY. Two emission scenarios were evaluated: RCP 8.5 (equiv. SRES A2) and RCP 6.0 (equiv. SRES B2). According to both, consequent increase of potential evapotranspiration and crop water requirements will gradually increase by 2071–2100. In addition, the availability of soil water will decline and the number of days with available water capacity below 50% AWC will increase during the growing season of field crops and evoke an increase of irrigation requirements. The results of this study predicted that the irrigation season will start earlier and will persist for a longer period in the future. Therefore, irrigation can be, in case of insufficient water sources, limiting factor for sustainable field crop production. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptations; Climate change; Field crops; Northern carpathians; Water use efficiency",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071474227

The most important institutions, which are involved in investment processes, including national and local government, give very high priority to this subject. The energy efficiency issue is also strongly related to the Polish and UE regulations and directives whose main goals are reduction of primary fuels use and, at the same time, reduction of greenhouse gases emission, primarily including CO2. The needs related to cold generation for air conditioning purposes have become very important these days, and because of that scientific research in this area is strongly needed. The production of chilled water for air conditioning purposes, based on a low-temperature medium of district heating systems, gives the possibility of reducing electricity consumption in buildings. It is very important, especially in hot periods of the year. It also allows an increase of electricity generation in cogeneration power plants in summer time because of the enhancement of the amount of heat produced in these facilities. Such chilled water production also reduces an environmental impact of energy generation and improves security of the district energy systems. The paper presents the possibility of using an adsorption chiller for chilled water production for air conditioning systems in buildings, using heat produced and distributed in the district heating system. In the article, a method for a rational determination of the cooling power for a given building, using computer simulations, is discussed and a heating and cooling substation, which was implemented during a research project, is described. The results of operation of this substation are also given. © 2016 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

In urban areas, diminishing air quality poses a large threat to human health. In order to investigate the relationship between land use/cover change (LUCC) and air pollutants of Wuyishan City between 2014–2017, an integrated approach was used by combining remote sensing techniques with a landscape ecology methods. Annual, seasonal, and weekly mean values of air pollutant (SO2, NO2, CO, PM10, O3, PM2.5, black carbon) concentration and atmospheric visibility were calculated to develop a Pearson correlation between LUCC and air pollutants concentration. Results showed an increase in forested areas (1.79%) and water areas (15.89%), with a simultaneous reduction in cultivated land (6.47%), bare land (72.61%), and built-up land (16.03%) from 2014 to 2017. The transition matrix of land use types revealed that (i) forest expansion took place mainly at the expense of cultivated land (13.94%) and bare land (27.48%); and (ii) water area expansion took place mainly at the expense of cultivated land (1.29%) and forests (0.21%). In 2017, the proportion of days with AQI level I (94.52%) was higher than that in 2014 (88.77%). Additionally, the annual average visibility in 2017 (37.42 km) was higher than 2014 (27.46 km). The concentration of SO2, CO, O3, and black carbon was positively correlated with the cultivated land. The concentration of SO2, CO, and black carbon negatively correlated with the increase of forests. PM10, and PM2.5 is negatively correlated with the water area. Visibility was found to be positively correlated with forested area, and negatively correlated with cultivated land. The findings from this study represent a valuable gain in understanding of policies aimed at improving, safeguarding, and monitoring air quality. These results can be used to inform land-use planning decisions in a comprehensive way and could be a valuable tool for LUCC rational management strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution; Correlation; Land use/cover change (LUCC); Wuyishan City","Air pollution; Air quality; Carbon; Correlation methods; Forestry; Health risks; Remote sensing; Urban planning; Visibility; Atmospheric visibility; Correlation analysis; Land use/cover change; Management strategies; Natural environments; Remote sensing techniques; Simultaneous reduction; Wuyishan City; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068775625

Implementations of nutrient limitation in land models are diverse, varying from applying simple empirical down-regulation of potential gross primary productivity under nutrient deficit conditions to more mechanistic treatments. In this study, we introduce a new approach to model multinutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) limitations in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model version 1 (ELMv1-ECA). The development is grounded on (1) advances in representing multiple-consumer, multiple-nutrient competition; (2) a generic dynamic allocation scheme based on water, N, P, and light availability; (3) flexible plant CNP stoichiometry; (4) prognostic treatment of N and P constraints on several carbon cycle processes; and (5) global data sets of plant physiological traits. Through benchmarking the model against best knowledge of global plant and soil carbon pools and fluxes, we show that our implementation of nutrient constraints on the present-day carbon cycle is robust at the global scale. Compared with predecessor versions, ELMv1-ECA better predicts global-scale gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, leaf area index, vegetation biomass, soil carbon stocks, evapotranspiration, N2O emissions, and NO3 - leaching. Factorial experiments indicate that representing the phosphorus cycle improves modeled carbon fluxes, while considering dynamic allocation improves modeled carbon stock density. We also highlight the value of using the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) package to evaluate and document performance during model development. © 2019.

The single crystal X-ray diffraction results indicated that the immediate geometry around each central Cu(i) in the above complexes is a distorted tetrahedron with the central metal atom being coordinated by the two phosphorus atoms of the phosphine ligands and two nitrogen atoms of the bidentate N-containing heterocyclic ligand moieties. It is found that complexes 1a-5a and 5b show photoluminescence in the solid state at room temperature with the highest quantum yield up to 0.5519, and the increased conjugation in the diimine ligands leads to emission reduction along with a red-shift in the emission maxima. Detailed photo-physical studies and density functional theory calculations (DFT) of these complexes have revealed that their lowest energy absorptions and emissions are ascribed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states. The above results indicate that conjugation effects of N-heteroaromatic ligands play a significant role in the emission properties of mononuclear/binuclear Cu(i) complexes. For the first time, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy is applied for qualitatively understanding the photophysical properties of complexes, revealing that terahertz time-domain spectra are sensitive to the weak interaction between the ligands, especially the diimine ligands, and terahertz spectra are strongly correlated with photoluminescence quantum yields of the complexes. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Atoms; Charge transfer; Complexation; Density functional theory; Emission control; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Ligands; Phosphorus compounds; Photoluminescence; Quantum theory; Quantum yield; Red Shift; Single crystals; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectrum analysis; Synthesis (chemical); Terahertz spectroscopy; Time domain analysis; Time series analysis; X ray crystallography; X ray powder diffraction; Heteroaromatic ligands; Metal to ligand charge transfers; Photoluminescence properties; Photoluminescence quantum yields; Photophysical properties; Single crystal x-ray diffraction; Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis; Terahertz time domain spectroscopy; Copper compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069481657

Here, we identify entirely planar pentacoordinate carbon (ppC) transition-metal carbide (α-TMC, TM = Co, Ni, and Cu) monolayers in their ground states through the swarm-intelligence structure search method and first-principles calculations. In these TMC monolayers, each carbon atom is bound with four transition-metal atoms and one neighboring carbon atom, forming a hexagonal C2@TM6 subunit in a novel topology. Their excellent structural stability is confirmed by the superior cohesive energy and the positive phonon modes. The lower cohesive energy and thermal stability of the CuC monolayers than those of the CoC and NiC monolayers is interpreted by higher electron transfer and lower electron donation/back-donation between TM and C atoms, which is also confirmed by the SSAdNDP analysis. Their magnetic character is distinct at the spin-polarized hybrid HSE06 level. The CoC monolayers are antiferromagnetic, the NiC monolayers are ferromagnetic and the CuC monolayers are non-magnetic. More interestingly, the unusual C2@TM6 subunit determines the excellent mechanical stabilities of TMC monolayers. Therefore, these three TMC monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties are anticipated to be synthesized and applied in spintronics, electronics and mechanics. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atoms; Calculations; Carbides; Carbon; Copper compounds; Ground state; Magnetism; Nickel compounds; Stability; Thermodynamic stability; Transition metals; Antiferromagnetics; Electronic and magnetic properties; First-principles calculation; Functional applications; Structural stabilities; Transition metal atoms; Transition metal carbide; Two Dimensional (2 D); Monolayers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066428219

The target of this study is to investigate the impact of economic growth and foreign direct investment on carbon emissions in order to provide environmental improvement suggestions. This study tests the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, including G7 countries (Canada, United State, United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Italy) and BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) for the period of 1992–2014. We adopt a panel quantile regression model that takes unobserved individual heterogeneity and distributional heterogeneity into consideration. Moreover, to avoid an omitted variable bias, certain related control variables are included in our model. Firstly, our empirical results show that the effect of the independent variables on carbon emissions is heterogeneous across quantiles. Secondly, regarding the impact of FDI on carbon emissions, we find that these results support the pollution halo theory in G7 countries and support the pollution haven hypothesis in BRICS countries. Thirdly, the empirical findings are in support of inverted U-shaped curve of EKC in G7 countries. Finally, the results of the study also provide policymakers with important policy recommendations. In addition, our findings suggest carbon emissions control measures should be tailored differently across low-emissions and high-emissions nations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Carbon emissions; Economic growth; EKC; Panel quantile regression","Carbon; Decision making; Pollution; Regression analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon emissions; Economic growths; Environmental improvements; Environmental Kuznets curves; Foreign direct investments; Policy recommendations; Pollution haven hypothesis; Quantile regression; Economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064196501

It can also reduce the pollutant emissions when using vehicles through the uptake of relatively clean energy, which can promote the replacement of traditional fossil fuels by green energy, and improve the life quality. In order to better promote the use of electric vehicles, and gradually move toward various industry sectors, such as civilian cars, family cars, and small cars, it is imperative to study their regional adaptability and economy. Therefore, this paper firstly introduces the relevant policies for promoting the application of electric vehicles in the community, including the electricity tariff policies, etc. Then, taking into account the existing load level of the community, the capacity of distribution lines, the number of charging piles, the charging power, the factors affecting the promotion of electric vehicles and their adaptability are analyzed. Furthermore, the economic evaluation index system of electric vehicles is established, and the feasibility is verified by an example. Finally, the case studies are presented to validate the proposed regional adaptability and economic evaluation methods. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

In the mean-while, there exists a large demand on energy in central and eastern areas. The energy storage capability of hydrogen makes it a significant medium for emerging energy storage systems. But the formidable challenge of hydrogen storage and long-distance transportation restricts its development. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scheme for an ammonia-based energy storage system in which ammonia, an environmentally benign hydrogen carrier, is expected to compromise the conflicts of renewable energy supply and consumption in China. By utilizing abandoned wind power and solar power, we get electrolyze water to generate hydrogen and get air to generate nitrogen. Compositing ammonia with hydrogen and nitrogen using Hubert's method also need much electricity. And the power stored in ammonia can be released in form of thermal energy or electricity when needed. This paper then presents some typical applications of ammonia that can meet people's needs of fuel, power, electricity, and zero-carbon fertilizer. The proposed scheme is particularly useful for storing discarded power in western and northern China in ammonia which can be transported and used in eastern regions without regional and seasonal restrictions. As an extra advantage, oxygen as a side product associated with the production of ammonia may play a significant role in oxygen-riched combustion plants. © 2019 The Authors.

Fine particle pollution has been studied in-depth, but there is less research on long-term troposphere ozone (O3) variation. This study focuses on the summer interannual tropospheric O3 variation on the NCP and its influential factors. Our analysis relies on satellite observations (O3, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and formaldehyde (HCHO), determined as vertical column density of the troposphere) and dynamical processes (El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), potential vorticity (PV), the quasibiennial oscillation (QBO), and East Asian summer monsoon index (EASMI)). Our results show the vertical column density of tropospheric O3 has a transition from the increasing trend to decreasing trend during the summer of 2005-2016. The summer series of tropospheric O3 show two distinct phases: the first phase (2005-2011), with an average growth rate of 0.55 ± 0.20 DU/yr, and a second phase (2012-2016), with an average reduction rate of 0.16 ± 0.23 DU/yr. The tropospheric NO2 column in the NCP also has a transition from the increasing trend to decreasing trend during the summer of 2005-2016. Tropospheric NO2 and CO column concentrations obtained from satellite observations indicate that emission reductions might be the main cause of the tropospheric O3 decrease. Particularly, the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is more significant, and NO2 decreased by (0.45 ± 0.11) × 1015 molec·cm-2 per year in summer since 2012. However, tropospheric column HCHO shows an increase of 0.05 × 1015 molec·cm-2 per year during the whole period of 2005 to 2016. An O3-NOx-VOC sensitivity experiment in the NCP showed that the O3 is still in a NOx-saturated state in some heavily polluted cities, although the NOx emissions are decreasing overall. In addition to the chemical reactions, atmospheric dynamic processes also have an effect on tropospheric O3. Finally, we built a model to analyze the contributions of chemical processes and dynamic processes to the tropospheric O3 column in the NCP. For the chemical process variables, 69.73% of the observed trend of tropospheric O3 could be explained by the NO2 tropospheric column. Therefore, the reduction of tropospheric O3 since 2012 is associated with the reduction of NOx. For the dynamical process variables, ENSO, PV, and EASMI can explain 60.64% of the observed trend of tropospheric O3. This result indicates that the atmospheric circulation of the western Pacific Ocean in summer has a significant impact on the interannual trends of tropospheric O3 in the NCP. It is also found that chemical processes had a more important impact on interannual tropospheric O3 than dynamic processes, although the dynamic processes cannot be neglected. © 2019 Lihua Zhou et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078055026

We found that extending native stipe cell walls of Coprinopsis cinerea were associated with the release of N-acetylglucosamine and chitinbiose and with chitinase activity. Two chitinases among all detected chitinases from C. cinerea, ChiE1 and ChiIII, reconstituted heatinactivated stipe wall extension and released N-acetylglucosamine and chitinbiose. Interestingly, both ChiE1 and ChiIII hydrolyze insoluble crystalline chitin powder, while other C. cinerea chitinases do not, suggesting that crystalline chitin components of the stipe cell wall are the target of action for ChiE1 and ChiIII. ChiE1- or ChiIII-reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe walls showed maximal extension activity at pH 4.5, consistent with the optimal pH for native stipe wall extension in vitro; ChiE1- or ChiIII-reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe wall extension activities were associated with stipe elongation growth regions; and the combination of ChiE1 and ChiIII showed a synergism to reconstitute heat-inactivated stipe wall extension at a low action concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images showed that the inner surface of acid-induced extended native stipe cell walls and ChiE1- or ChiIII-reconstituted extended heat-inactivated stipe cell walls exhibited a partially broken parallel microfibril architecture; however, these broken transversely arranged microfibrils were not observed in the unextended stipe cell walls that were induced by neutral pH buffer or heat inactivation. Double knockdown of ChiE1 and ChiIII resulted in the reduction of stipe elongation, mycelium growth, and heatsensitive cell wall extension of native stipes. These results indicate a chitinasehydrolyzing mechanism for stipe cell wall extension. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.","Chitin; Chitinases; Coprinopsis cinerea; Stipe elongation; Wall extension","Chitin; Crystalline materials; Cytology; Elongation; Field emission microscopes; Fungi; Scanning electron microscopy; Chitinase activities; Chitinases; Coprinopsis cinerea; Crystalline chitins; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Morphogenetic events; N-Acetylglucosamine; Wall extension; Cells; cell component; enzyme; enzyme activity; growth; hydrolysis; induced response; morphogenesis; mushroom; pH; Basidiomycota; Coprinopsis cinerea; chitin; chitinase; fungal protein; n acetylglucosamine; Agaricales; cell wall; genetics; hydrolysis; metabolism; Acetylglucosamine; Agaricales; Cell Wall; Chitin; Chitinases; Fungal Proteins; Hydrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070118822

Relative problem and practical applications of freight transport based on public transit were studied and four operating modes of freight transport by rail were summarized in this paper. Additionally, parcel transport capacity of a single subway line in different modes and parcels demand in main urban areas were estimated. For freight transport through subway network, the appropriate operating modes of freight transport under three different demand scenarios were analyzed as well, and corresponding environmental benefits under these three modes were evaluated separately. The result shows that using the subway to transport goods can efficiently reduce carbon emissions by 20-50%.

Of those, sequestering the CO2 into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs with associated enhanced oil recovery is the most achievable approach under current economic constraints since it increases recovery of existing oil reserves, and bridges the gap between regional-scale CO2 capture and geologic sequestration. The Upper Devonian fluvial sandstone reservoirs in Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field in West Virginia, which have produced over 22 million barrels of oil since 1895, is an ideal candidate for CO2 sequestration coupled with EOR. This work illustrates an example of CCUS, in which CO2 is simultaneously sequestered and oil recovery enhanced in a depleted oil reservoir by water alternating gas (WAG) method. Three mechanisms for CO2 storage including structural/stratigraphic trapping, dissolution trapping and residual trapping are considered. This model is based on a highly detailed geological model constructed based on existing legacy geological data from the field. A composition model of 0.4 PVI of water injected before WAG process is considered as a benchmark for this study. The results of numerical simulation show that over 26 years of WAG injection, oil recovery increased from 0.16% to 1.9% due to various injection strategies. WAG injection rate, injection time ratio and cycle period play important roles in the storage CO2. As a conclusion, this research constructs and validates a basic workflow for CO2 storage and CO2-EOR that can be applied to other super-mature oil fields, which have abundant conventional legacy data and limited high-quality data. © 2019 The Authors.

As a consequence, China is currently in the midst of a severe environmental and ecological crisis. Smog control can be realized by adjusting the industrial structure, which involves abandoning the traditional industrialization mode and pursuing the development mode of a circular economy characterized by low energy consumption and low pollution. To examine the causes of smog from the perspective of economic structure, the interactive relationship between smog control and the evolution of regional economic structure was analysed by using panel data of 13 prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province, China from 2005 to 2016. Results demonstrate that the relationship between industrial structure and degree of smog pollution shows a U-shaped curve. As such, the scale effect of economic development can reduce the emission of air pollutants. Foreign direct investment does not have a significant role in improving environmental pollution. Construction dust similarly aggravates smog pollution. These conclusions can deepen the understanding of the internal relationship between frequent smog occurrence and industrialization, as well as provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference to effectively control smog by upgrading the regional economic structure. © 2019 Technoscience Publications.

China, as the largest developing country in the world, has experienced a large amount of NO2 emissions in recent decades due to the rapid economic growth. Compared with the traditional air pollution monitoring technology, the rapid development of the remote sensing monitoring method of atmospheric satellite has gradually become the critical technical means of global atmospheric environmental monitoring. To reveal the NO2 pollution situation in China, based on the latest NO2 products from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, the spatial-temporal characteristics and impact factors of troposphere NO2 column concentration of mainland China in the past year (February 2018 to January 2019) were analyzed on two administrative levels for the first time. Results show that the monthly fluctuation of tropospheric NO2 column concentration has obvious characteristics of ""high in winter and low in summer"", while the spatial distribution forms a ""high in East and low in west"" pattern, bounded by Hu Line. The comparison of Coefficient of Variation (CV) and spatial autocorrelation models at two kinds of administrative scales indicates that although the spatial heterogeneity of NO2 column concentration is less affected by the observed scale, there is a ""delayed effect"" of about one month in the process of NO2 column concentration fluctuation. Besides, the impact factors analysis based on Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and GeographicWeighted Regression (GWR) reveals that there is a positive correlation between nighttime light intensity, the secondary and tertiary industries proportion and NO2 column concentration. Furthermore, for regions with serious NO2 pollution in North China Plain, the whole society electricity consumption and vehicle ownership also play a positive role in increasing the NO2 column concentration. This study will enlighten the government and policy makers to formulate policies tailored to local conditions, to more effectively implement NO2 emission reduction and air pollution prevention. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution; China; Impact factor; NO2; Sentinel-5P; Spatial autocorrelation","Air pollution; Autocorrelation; Developing countries; Emission control; Environmental technology; Light modulators; Pollution detection; Remote sensing; Spatial variables measurement; Troposphere; Air pollution monitoring; China; Coefficient of variation; Concentration fluctuation; Impact factor; Remote sensing monitoring; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial-temporal characteristics; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071583401

To reduce the carbon emissions and use energy more efficiently in the building sector, home energy management system (HEMS) is proposed and used. In the HEMS, the prediction of electricity consumption in the short-term future is used to support the decision makings in the HEMS. Although there existed a number of studies in the prediction of electricity consumption in buildings, there lacks a spatial analysis in the prediction performance, especially on the appliance or sub-meter level and household level. The authors made an assumption that by the performance of household energy consumption prediction can be significantly improved if the prediction is aggregated from the prediction data at the appliance or sub-meter level. Next, two typical datasets are used to validate the assumption by comparing the prediction performance of aggregating the prediction data at appliance level and the one of making direct prediction at the household level. The models used for the prediction are standard stateful long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which have been proofed to be promising in load prediction by previous studies. The results from the comparison validated the assumption, showing that the prediction performance can be significantly improved if prediction is made at the appliance-level first and then aggregated to get the household-level prediction. Therefore, the authors conclude that prediction at the finer appliance granularity level can significantly improve the performance of household-level electricity prediction. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the forward-looking adaptation process remains poorly understood. In this paper we introduce choice experiment as a useful approach to investigate how households prefer to adapt livelihoods ex ante to the economic impact of climate and policy changes. This allows us to frame adaptation decisions within the random utility theory and explicitly quantify the likelihoods of particular adaptation choices given varied attributes of contextual changes and households. We collected data from 162 rural households in three Chinese mountain villages. Overall, households chose primarily to increase efforts in agriculture activities or stick to current livelihood portfolios. The results of a Mixed Logit model indicated that households' choice of agriculture was certain while their adoption of non-agriculture liveliho ods to safeguard the households from future changes. Moreover, several possibilities were evaluated for policy interventions to build adaptive capacity of households and facilitate adaptation. Such measures could, for instance, focus on supporting agricultural inputs, providing access to credit as well as practical skills training. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Adaptive capacity; choice experiment; climate change; rural development; Yunnan",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064502695

Comprehensively considering the water–energy–food nexus as well as the external environment, this study adopts a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) modelling evaluation method to assess the agricultural production efficiency (APE) of seven provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR) during 1996–2015. The results show that the three-stage DEA modelling evaluation method reveals real APE and is considered to be a better quantitative method than conventional approaches. A gradually widening range of APE is an important challenge for this region. Significantly, this region generates huge demands for agricultural resources. Moreover, regional emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) decreased from 34.20 million tons standard coal in 1996 to 32.11 million tons standard coal in 2015, though APE has continued to decrease by 2.56% in the past two decades. In general, the management and technology levels should be improved simultaneously, even though specific opportunities for APE improvement vary across provinces in MLYR. However, understanding the temporal and spatial variation of APE along with the WEF nexus from a production-based insight is a vital step toward appropriately targeted policy making for nationwide resources savings and emissions reduction. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Agricultural production efficiency (APE); Malmquist index; Middle and Lower Yangtze River (MLYR); Resources saving and emissions reduction; Three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) modelling evaluation method; Water–energy–food (WEF) nexus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062656544

We report on an application of China’s new Ecological Development Strategy, now being formally tested and refined for subsequent scaling nationwide, which aims to mitigate and even eliminate these trade-offs. Our focus is the Ecosystem Function Conservation Area of Hainan Island, a rural, tropical region where expansion of rubber plantations has driven extensive loss of natural forest and its vital benefits to people. We explored both the biophysical and the socioeconomic options for achieving simultaneous improvements in product provision, regulating services, biodiversity, and livelihoods. We quantified historic trade-offs between rubber production and vital regulating services, finding that, over the past 20 y (1998–2017), there was a 72.2% increase in rubber plantation area, leading to decreases in soil retention (17.8%), water purification [reduced retention of nitrogen (56.3%) and phosphorus (27.4%)], flood mitigation (21.9%), carbon sequestration (1.7%), and habitat for biodiversity (6.9%). Using scenario analyses, we identified a two-pronged strategy that would significantly reduce these trade-offs, enhancing regulating services and biodiversity, while simultaneously diversifying and increasing product provision and improving livelihoods. This general approach to analyzing product provision, regulating services, biodiversity, and livelihoods has applicability in rural landscapes across China, South and Southeast Asia, and beyond. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

We applied AMOVA, neutrality test and mismatch distribution analysis to estimate genetic differentiation and demographic characteristics. The divergence times of the seven cpDNA haplotypes were estimated using BEAST. Our results revealed high levels of genetic diversity (cpDNA: Hcp = 0.6691, H T = 0.673; nrDNA: Hnr = 0.5668, H T = 0.577). High level of genetic differentiation (G ST = 0.950) among populations was observed in the cpDNA sequences, while the genetic differentiation values (G ST = 0.348) were low in nuclear sequences. AMOVA results revealed major genetic variation among the three groups: northern, central, and eastern group. However, the genetic differentiation in ITS data was not found. The species distribution modeling and demographic analysis indicated that P. lanata had not experienced recent range expansion. The occurrence of divergence between seven cpDNA haplotypes, probably during Pleistocene, coincides with aridification and expansion of the desert across northwest China that resulted in species diversification and habitat fragmentation. In addition, we discovered that the deserts and the Helan Mountains acted as effective geographic barriers that promoting the intraspecific diversity of P. lanata. © 2019 PeerJ Inc..

However, it is challenging in synthesis of tubular structure by pyrolysis because the structure is dynamical non-steady state and always collapses in carbonization process. Herein, carbon microtubes were synthesized by a simple carbonization method-based kapok. The tubular structure with the diameter ranges from 5 to 20 μm was obtained from the final carbon samples, which shows the similar structure with kapok precursors, while the weight was lost about 90%. We demonstrated that the carbon microtubes have excellent performance in oil adsorption with the adsorption capacity of ~ 190 g g −1 , which is 1.5 times larger than that of raw kapok. We found that it is reusable for more than ten times in oil adsorption application, and the adsorption capacities of carbon microtubes significantly enhanced when the temperature increased in carbonization. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Adsorption; Carbonization; Computer software reusability; Histology; Pyrolysis; Adsorption capacities; Carbon microtubes; Carbon nano-materials; Carbonization methods; Carbonization process; Facile synthesis; Non steady-state; Tubular structures; Tissue",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064181430

A valid way for achieving such USMMDs is the substitution of a carbon atom in a planar pentacoordinate environment with the isoelectronic Be2 moiety. In the present work, we report our recent findings that a similar substitution can be applied to the carbon atom in a planar hexacoordinate environment. Using species CN3Be3+ and CO3Li3+ and related analogues as the templates, the Be2N3M3+ (M = Be, Mg, Ca) and Be2O3M3+ (M = Li, Na, K) species with axial ultrashort Be-Be distances of 1.627-1.870 Å were designed computationally. The ultrashort Be-Be distances in these species represent a balance between the lengthening effect of axial Be-Be electrostatic interactions and the shortening effects of the strong X-Be bonding and repulsive X-X-X electrostatic interactions. In addition, the shorter axial Be-Be distances were determined firstly by the smaller size of the bridging electronegative X atoms and secondly by the lower electronegativity of the peripheral M atoms, while the stabilities of the newly designed species were closely related to the types of valence electron pairs, whereby the localized two-center two-electron bonds were better for stabilization than the non-bonding valence lone pairs. Among the newly designed species, Be2N3Be3+ and Be2N3Mg3+ were characterized to be the kinetically stable global minima, thereby providing promising targets for the experimental realization of species with USMMDs between main group metals. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Atoms; Binary alloys; Carbon; Chemical bonds; Electronegativity; Electrostatics; Metals; Sodium alloys; Computational design; Current projects; Experimental realizations; Hexacoordinate carbons; Main group metals; Metal-metal bonding; Metal-metal distances; Valence electron; Beryllium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065863438

To this end, this paper evaluates the energy and environmental efficiency (EEE) of 30 administrative regions in China from 2011 to 2015 and puts forward relevant policy suggestions to improve China's EEE by using the DEA window analysis model under the Variable Returns to Scale (VRS) framework. EEE consists of two parts named energy efficiency and environmental efficiency, which are related to energy conservation and emission reduction, respectively. Results show that the EEE of central south China is relatively strong, while that of northwest China is the worst. However, the efficiency of the six regions in China has a similar trend. In general, China's regional EEE is relatively high during the study period, but the internal development of some regions is very imbalance. Based on these findings, we put forward suggestions on regional competition and cooperation, encouraging energy technological innovation, optimizing industrial structure and so forth. It has certain practical and theoretical significance. © 2019, Computers and Industrial Engineering.

Most provinces are assigned differentiated reduction tasks due to different natural resources endowment, energy consumption structure, and economic developments. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) supplies cost information on regional pollutant reduction processes and should be an important evaluation indicator of policies. In this study, we build a quadratic parametric directional distance function (DDF) to estimate provincial MAC of CO2 emissions in China during 2000-2015. Linear programming is used to solve the parameter estimation problem. Results are as follows: 1) LP method supplies efficient parameter estimation results and obtains 98.33% reliable MACs during the research period. 2) MAC keeps a growing trend for most provinces in 2000-2015. Especially when China enters the New Normal stage in 2012, this growing trend has been accelerated. These trends reveal that MAC gradually becomes a more important indicator to evaluate emission reduction measurements. 3) From a spatial distribution aspect, positive cluster feature has experienced such fluctuations as “apparent rise→significant decline→close to zero.” In this stage, their spatial cluster is close to random distribution state. Spatial heterogeneity turns to being enlarged, especially among provinces at higher MAC range. These evolutionary trends will have important influence on their carbon reduction measure implementing process. Eastern regions should turn more focus on low-carbon technology innovation to push their lowcarbon transformation. For middle and western regions, they should promote their production efficiency and obtain more technology spillovers from eastern provinces in the future to stimulate their economic growth and low-carbon transformation. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

The existing research has focused on the characteristics of PM 2.5 and PM 10 , respectively, or analyzed the correlation between the two pollutants, while the ratio of PM 2.5 to PM 10 has been taken less consideration. In this study, daily mean PM 2.5 and PM 10 mass concentrations in 31 provincial capitals from 2014 to 2016 were used to present the temporal variations and spatial distribution of PM 2.5 /PM 10 ratios among eight economic regions. And then, statistical method and correlation analysis were adopted to investigate the relationship between the ratios and AQI, the rate of change on the ratios, and the impact of meteorological parameters on the ratios. The results indicated that PM 2.5 /PM 10 ratios showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast due to different economic development and industrial types. The highest values were observed in winter among all regions, and the ratios on weekends were higher than that of on weekdays in most of the regions. Besides, domestic heating in northern China had a significant contribution to the ratios. Moreover, ratios had less changes, and the rate of change was stable in summer. As for air quality, the higher the ratio, the larger the possibility of high AQI so that the air pollution will be more severe. In terms of meteorological factors, the results demonstrated that relative humidity, precipitation, and pressure were the most important factors and had significantly positive impacts, while sunshine duration, temperature, and wind speed had negative effects on the ratios. The findings could identify the pollution sources among PM 10 and be helpful for making regulation locally to reduce emission which considers anthropogenic sources and meteorological diffusion simultaneously. © 2019 Danting Zhao et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062371340

The municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash (FA-1) exhibited the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 0.57 mmol CO2/g. The modified Avrami fractional kinetic model could well describe the CO2 adsorption kinetic behaviors. To further improve its CO2 adsorption performance, the desired FA-1 was modified with different amines. The effects of amine species, amine content, and reaction temperature on CO2 adsorption performance of the amine-modified fly ash adsorbents were demonstrated. It was found that FA-1 modified with 20%TEPA exhibited the excellent CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.17 mmol CO2/g under 40oC, 15%CO2 and 15%H2O.

In this paper, extensive experiments with different injection modes were conducted to study their effect on production performance. Experimentally, based on the geological characteristics and development conditions of the target carbonate reservoir, a laboratory physical model was established to study the migration characteristics and occurrence state of the injected gas and water. The effect of different injection modes, including continuous gas flooding, water-alternating-gas (WAG) flooding and water flooding, on water and gas production and oil-displacement efficiency was investigated. Experimental results indicated that the rising of water cut of WAG flooding was much lower than that of water flooding, presenting a good effect on delaying water production. WAG injection showed a relatively plateau period of gas-oil ratio, indicating injected water delayed gas channeling. WAG flooding achieved the highest oil recovery, followed by continuous gas flooding and water flooding. This study provided an improved understanding of gas and water channeling behavior, and proposed schemes for delaying gas channeling and improving gas flooding. © 2019 Carbon Management Technology Conference 2019, CMTC 2019.

In order to prevent the pollution of water resources, policymakers should have reliable emission reduction strategies. This paper aims to contribute new knowledge by analyzing the spatial-temporal characteristics and driving forces of point source emission. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) emission variations in 31 provinces and municipalities of mainland China during the years 2004–2017 are analyzed. The results obtained using the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method indicate that: (1) the COD and NH4-N emission effects have similar temporal characteristics. Technology improvement and pollutant emission intensity are the main factors inhibiting the incremental COD and NH4-N emission effects, while economic development is the main driving factor of COD and NH4-N emission effects. Population increases play a relatively less important role in COD and NH4-N emission effects. (2) The spatial features of COD and NH4-N emission effects show differences among provinces and municipalities. The reduction of COD emission effects in each province and municipality is obviously better than that of NH4-N emissions. (3) In the eastern, central, and the western regions of China, the total COD emission effect shows a downward trend, while apart from the central region, the NH4-N emission effect appears to be rising in the east and west of China. Therefore, increasing investment into pollution treatment, promoting awareness of water conservation, strengthening technological and financial support from the more developed eastern to the less developed central and western regions, can help to reduce the COD and NH4-N emissions in China. © 2019 by the authors.

The seepage of methane-rich fluid (i.e., cold hydrocarbon seeps) fuels the chemosynthetic biota-inhabited surface sediments and represents the major pathway to transfer carbon from sediments to the water column. Generally, the major biogeochemical reactions related to carbon cycling in the anoxic marine sediments include organic matter degradation via sulfate reduction (OSR), anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), methanogenesis (ME), and carbonate precipitation (CP). In order to better understand the carbon turnover in the cold seeps and gas hydrate-bearing areas of the northern South China Sea (SCS), we collected geochemical data of 358 cores from published literatures and retrieved 37 cores and corresponding pore water samples from three areas of interest (i.e., Xisha, Dongsha, and Shenhu areas). Reaction-transport simulations indicate that the rates of organic matter degradation and carbonate precipitation are comparable in the three areas, while the rates of AOM vary over several orders of magnitude (AOM: 8.3-37.5 mmol·m-2·yr-1 in Dongsha, AOM: 12.4-170.6 mmol·m-2·yr-1 in Xisha, and AOM: 9.4-30.5 mmol·m-2·yr-1 in Shenhu). Both the arithmetical mean and interpolation mean of the biogeochemical processes were calculated in each area. Averaging these two mean values suggested that the rates of organic matter degradation in Dongsha (25.7 mmol·m-2·yr-1) and Xisha (25.1 mmol·m-2·yr-1) are higher than that in Shenhu (12 mmol·m-2·yr-1) and the AOM rate in Xisha (135.2 mmol·m-2·yr-1) is greater than those in Dongsha (27.8 mmol·m-2·yr-1) and Shenhu (17.5 mmol·m-2·yr-1). In addition, the rate of carbonate precipitation (32.3 mmol·m-2·yr-1) in Xisha is far higher than those of the other two regions (5.3 mmol·m-2·yr-1 in Dongsha, 5.8 mmol·m-2·yr-1 in Shenhu) due to intense AOM sustained by gas dissolution. In comparison with other cold seeps around the world, the biogeochemical rates in the northern SCS are generally lower than those in active continental margins and special environments (e.g., the Black sea) but are comparable with those in passive continental margins. Collectively, 2.8 Gmol organic matter was buried and at least 0.82 Gmol dissolved organic and inorganic carbon was diffused out of sediments annually. This may, to some extent, have an impact on the long-term deep ocean carbon cycle in the northern SCS. © 2019 Yanping Zhang et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082336375

However, studies of long-term source apportionment of vertical NH3 are relatively limited. On the basis of the one-year measurements of weekly vertical profiles of δ15N-NH3 at 5 heights (2, 15, 102, 180, and 320 m) on a 325-m meteorological tower in urban Beijing, we found that vertical profiles of NH3 concentrations generally remained stable with height. δ15N-NH3 increased obviously as a function of height in cold seasons (with heating) and decreased in warm seasons (with fertilization), indicating a stronger human-induced seasonal variation via regional transport at higher altitudes. Relatively stable δ15N-NH3 near the ground surface suggested the strong local emission. The results of isotopic mixing model (SIAR) indicate that source apportionment using measured δ15N-NH3 only would overestimate the contribution of agricultural emissions to NH3. By using an estimation of initial δ15N-NH3, we found that nonagricultural sources contributed ∼72% of NH3 on average. Our study suggests that (i) both persistent nonagricultural and periodic agricultural emissions drive atmospheric NH3 concentration and its vertical distribution in urban Beijing; and (ii) source apportionment based on measured δ15N-NH3 only likely underestimates fossil fuel source contribution, if the combined NHx isotope effects are not considered. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Agriculture; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Isotopes; Meteorological instruments; Agricultural emissions; Emission reduction; Fossil fuel sources; Meteorological tower; Non-agricultural sources; Seasonal variation; Source apportionment; Vertical distributions; Ammonia; ammonia; isotope; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; human; season; Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Isotopes; Seasons",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077144838

The vast functional gene repertoire of soil microbial communities is composed of both core and accessory genes, which may be governed by distinct drivers. This intuitive hypothesis, however, remains largely unexplored. We conducted a 5-year nitrogen and water addition experiment in the Eurasian steppe and quantified microbial gene diversity via shotgun metagenomics. Nitrogen addition led to an 11-fold increase in the abundance (based on quantitative PCR [qPCR]) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, which have mainly core community genes and few accessory community genes. Thus, nitrogen addition substantially increased the relative abundance of many core genes at the whole-community level. Water addition stimulated both plant diversity and microbial respiration; however, increased carbon/energy resources from plants did not counteract increased respiration, so soil carbon/energy resources became more limited. Thus, water addition selected for microorganisms with genes responsible for degrading recalcitrant soil organic matter. Accordingly, many other microorganisms without these genes (but likely with other accessory community genes due to relatively stable average microbial genome size) were selected against, leading to the decrease in the diversity of accessory community genes. In summary, nitrogen addition primarily affected core community genes through nitrogen-cycling processes, and water addition primarily regulated accessory community genes through carbon-cycling processes. Although both gene components may significantly respond as the intensity of nitrogen/water addition increases, our results demonstrated how these common global change factors distinctly impact each component. IMPORTANCE Our results demonstrated increased ecosystem nitrogen and water content as the primary drivers of the core and accessory components of soil microbial community functional diversity, respectively. Our findings suggested that more attention should be paid to certain components of community functional diversity under specific global change conditions. Our findings also indicated that microbial communities have adapted to nitrogen addition by strengthening the function of ammonia oxidization to deplete the excess nitrogen, thus maintaining ecosystem homeostasis. Because community gene richness is primarily determined by the presence/ absence of accessory community genes, our findings further implied that strategies such as maintaining the amount of soil organic matter could be adopted to effectively improve the functional gene diversity of soil microbial communities subject to global change factors. © 2019 Zhang et al.","Accessory community gene; Core community gene; Grassland; Increased precipitation; Microbial diversity; Nitrogen deposition","1 phosphofructokinase; 3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; aldehyde reductase; amino acid; ammonia; beta alanine pyruvate aminotransferase; beta fructofuranosidase; carbon; enoyl coenzyme A hydratase; fucose; gluconolactonase; isomerase; isovaleryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; mannose 1 phosphate; methylcrotonoyl coenzyme A carboxylase; nitrogen; phosphomannomutase; rhamnose; RNA 16S; soil organic matter; water; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; Article; Ascomycetes; carbon cycling; Chloroflexi; controlled study; energy resource; environmental change; Firmicutes; gene sequence; gene structure; global change; metagenome; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial gene; microbial genome; microbial respiration; nitrogen cycling; Nitrospirae; nonhuman; Planctomycetes; plant; Proteobacteria; real time polymerase chain reaction; soil microflora; soil water content; Zygomycetes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072827830

The flue gas of natural gas boilers contains a lot of vapor carrying considerable latent heat. However, the conventional condensing boiler can hardly recover the latent heat as the dew point of the flue gas is only marginally higher than the temperature of the r heating networks. Therefore, a liquid-desiccant-based total heat recovery system combined with direct contact condenser is introduced in t increase the dew point by humidifying the oxidizing air. The system mainly consists of three packed tower, where the flue gas or air contacts the liquid desiccant or the cooling water. The liquid desiccant in the system serves as a medium to transfer water vapor from the flue gas to t air. The cooling water sprayed into the condenser, on the other hand, recovers sensible heat and latent heat from the flue gas and then transfar return water. A mathematical model for the system is established and a simulation is conducted. The simulation results show that the therm the novel system is 101.4%, compared with an efficiency of 97.5% of the condensing boiler. Besides, the flue gas is discharged to the atmosphere with a relative humidity of 56% rather than 100%. Moreover, the cooling water mixed with alkali liquor can dilute the condensate and absorb NOx, which contributes to the reduction of water and air pollution. The novel heat recovery system is promising in practical application since it is energy-effective and environmentally friendly. © 2019 ASHRAE",,"Coal fired boilers; Computer system recovery; Cooling; Cooling water; District heating; Driers (materials); Flue gases; Flues; Latent heat; Liquids; Natural gas; Waste heat; Water pollution; Condensing boilers; Direct contact; District heating networks; Heat recovery systems; Heating network; Liquid desiccant; Return water; Sensible heat; Gas fired boilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071934667

We provide a systematic overview of the practice, performance, and problems of China’s ETS pilots during the first stage, which lasted from 2013 to 2016, and highlight some proposals for the forthcoming national system. We depict the features of the pilots by focusing on the core elements of the ETS: scope, cap setting, allocation, MRV, and compliance. The performance of China’s ETS pilots is characterized by low carbon prices with severe temporal fluctuation, and low levels of liquidity with high compliance rates. The problems include over-allocation of emission allowances, inadequate legal and regulatory infrastructure, underdevelopment of the carbon financial market, and poor market transparency. Accordingly, we propose recommendations from the perspective of legislation, cap setting, transparency, price management, and policy coordination. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

Compared with a physical mixture of MnO 2 and carbon materials, the growth of MnO 2 on the surface of carbon can greatly improve the electrochemical performance of MnO 2 /C, and is usually performed at a temperature higher than 100 °C. From the viewpoint of sustainable development, the room-temperature growth of MnO 2 on carbon would greatly reduce the cost and thermal pollution. Herein, at room temperature, we successfully planted MnO 2 nanosheets over carbon particles, achieving MnO 2 /C composites through a redox reaction between MnO 4 - ions and carbonized zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) crystals (C ZIF-67 ). Room-temperature growth of MnO 2 may be attributed to the catalytic effect of Co II ions of Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles formed during ZIF-67 carbonization. The resulting MnO 2 /C ZIF-67 composites exhibit excellent catalytic performance towards the oxygen reduction reaction: the onset potential, the half-wave potential, and the electron transfer number are ∼0.88 V, ∼0.79 V and 3.6, respectively, which are close to the corresponding values of the state-of-the-art Pt/C. Also, the resulting MnO 2 /C ZIF-67 shows better long-term durability and methanol tolerance than Pt/C, indicative of its potential applications in fuel cells and metal-air batteries. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbonization; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Metal-air batteries; Oxygen; Redox reactions; Secondary batteries; Thermal pollution; Catalytic performance; Cathode active material; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical power sources; Long term durability; Oxygen reduction reaction; Room temperature growth; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Manganese oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062263103

Historically, before clean air regulations were implemented to control NOx and VOCs, ozone concentrations were high enough to exert acute effects such as eye and nose irritation, respiratory disease emergencies, and lung function impairment. At or above current regulatory standards, day-to-day variations in ozone concentrations have been positively associated with asthma incidence and daily non-accidental mortality rate. Emerging evidence has shown that both short-term and long-term exposures to ozone, at concentrations below the current regulatory standards, were associated with increased mortality due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The pathophysiology to support the epidemiologic associations between mortality and morbidity and ozone centers at the chemical and toxicological property of ozone as a strong oxidant, being able to induce oxidative damages to cells and the lining fluids of the airways, and immune-inflammatory responses within and beyond the lung. These new findings add substantially to the existing challenges in controlling ozone pollution. For example, in the United States in 2016, 90% of non-compliance to the national ambient air quality standards was due to ozone whereas only 10% was due to particulate matter and other regulated pollutants. Climate change, through creating atmospheric conditions favoring ozone formation, has been and will continue to increase ozone concentrations in many parts of world. Worldwide, ozone is responsible for several hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and tens of millions of asthma-related emergency room visits annually. To combat ozone pollution globally, more aggressive reductions in fossil fuel consumption are needed to cut NOx and VOCs as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, preventive and therapeutic strategies are needed to alleviate the detrimental effects of ozone especially in more susceptible individuals. Interventional trials in humans are needed to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidants and ozone-scavenging compounds that have shown promising results in animal studies. © 2019 Zhang, Wei and Fang.","Air quality standards; Cardiovascular health effects; Climate change; Mitigation strategies; Ozone; Respiratory health effects","interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; myeloperoxidase; ozone; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; tumor necrosis factor; volatile organic compound; ozone; air pollution; air quality standard; ambient air; asthma; brain ischemia; carbon footprint; climate change; concentration (parameter); consultation; disability-adjusted life year; emergency ward; health hazard; human; lung alveolus macrophage; lymphoid cell; neutrophil; nonhuman; particulate matter; respiratory tract inflammation; Review; air pollutant; animal; asthma; global health; immunology; pathology; toxicity; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animals; Asthma; Global Health; Humans; Ozone; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074572246

This study presents a bottom-up assessment of the scale at which BECCS plants-biomass pulverised combustion plants (""BECCS"" in this study) and bioenergy combustion in combined heat and power plants (BE-CHP-CCS)-can be sustainably deployed to meet national carbon dioxide removal (CDR) targets, considering the use of both primary and secondary (waste-derived) biomass. This paper also presents a comprehensive, harmonised data set, which enables others to build upon this work. Land availability for biomass cultivation, processing, and conversion is quantified based on a land-use analysis, avoiding all competition with land used for food production, human habitation, and other protected areas. We find that secondary biomass sources provide a valuable supplement to primary biomass, augmenting indigenous biomass supplies. In initial phases of deployment, we observe that infrastructure is initially clustered near cities, and other sources of low cost, secondary biomass, but as CDR targets are increased and indigenous secondary biomass supplies are exhausted, infrastructure begins to move closer to potential biomass planting areas with higher yield. In minimising the cost of CDR on a cost per net tonne CO2 removed basis, we find that the availability of secondary biomass, land availability, and yield are key factors that drive the cost of CDR. Importantly biomass conversion efficiency of a BECCS plant has an inverse effect on CDR costs, with less efficient plants resulting in lower costs compared to their more efficient counterparts. By consuming secondary biomass in BECCS and BE-CHP-CCS plants, the UK is able to be self-sufficient in biomass supply by utilising available indigenous biomass to remove up to 50 MtCO2 per year, though for cost reasons, it may be preferable to import some biomass. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bioconversion; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Cogeneration plants; Conservation; Costs; Digital storage; Food storage; Land use; Power generation; Waste incineration; Carbon dioxide removal; Combustion plants; Efficient plants; Human habitation; Land availability; Land-use analysis; Protected areas; Secondary biomass; Biomass; bioenergy; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combined heat and power; combustion; food production; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077000926

To achieve this target, one critical step is to calculate and evaluate the carbon emissions of machining processes. However, this step is a little difficult for discrete manufacturing processes, because they are always complex and the data sources are diverse. Considering the complexity of discrete manufacturing workshops, a Big Data analysis approach for real-time carbon efficiency evaluation of discrete manufacturing workshops is proposed in an internet of things-enabled ubiquitous environment. Firstly, the deployment of data acquisition devices is introduced to create a ubiquitous manufacturing workshop, and data modeling of production state and carbon emission is described to realize data acquisition and storage. Then, a data-driven multi-level carbon efficiency evaluation of manufacturing workshop is established based on Big Data analysis approaches. Finally, an auto parts manufacturing workshop is studied to verify the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods. This method realizes the combination of manufacturing Big Data and low-carbon production. Meanwhile, the evaluation method can be used in other production information systems and then assist the production decision-making. © 2013 IEEE.","Big data analysis; carbon efficiency evaluation; carbon emission; data acquisition network; discrete manufacturing workshops","Big data; Carbon; Complex networks; Data acquisition; Data handling; Decision making; Digital storage; Information analysis; Machining; Machining centers; Carbon efficiency; Carbon emissions; Data acquisition and storage; Data acquisition networks; Data-acquisition devices; Discrete manufacturing; Environmental burdens; Ubiquitous environments; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071264387

Urban trees are considered to play an important role in fixing carbon, improving air quality, reducing noise and providing other ecosystem services. However, data on the response of urban trees to climate change, particularly to drought, as well as the relationship between their below- and above-ground processes in this context, are still limited, which prevents a comprehensive understanding of the role of urban trees in ameliorating some of the adverse effects of climate change and their ability to cope with it. To investigate whole-plant responses to water shortages, we studied the growth of Tilia cordata Greenspire, a commonly planted urban tree, including development of its roots and stem diameter, leaf parameters and the harvested biomass. Our results showed that this cultivar was susceptible to drought and had reduced biomass in all three compartments: branch (30.7%), stem (16.7%) and coarse roots (45.2%). The decrease in the root:shoot ratio under drought suggested that more carbon was invested in the above-ground biomass. The development of fine roots and the loss of coarse root biomass showed that T. cordata Greenspire prioritised the growth of fine roots within the root system. The CityTree model's simulation showed that the ability of this cultivar to provide ecosystem services, including cooling and CO2 fixation, was severely reduced. For use in harsh and dry urban environments, we recommend that urban managers take into account the capacity of trees to adapt to drought stress and provide sufficient rooting space, especially vertically, to help trees cope with drought. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass allocation; Drought; Ecosystem services; Root:shoot ratio; Urban trees","Air quality; Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Trees (mathematics); Above ground biomass; Biomass allocation; Ecosystem services; Leaf Parameters; Root: shoot ratios; Urban environments; Urban trees; Water shortages; Urban growth; aboveground biomass; biomass allocation; climate change; climate effect; deciduous tree; drought stress; ecosystem service; environmental factor; root-shoot ratio; Air Quality; Biomass; Carbon; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Tilia cordata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070543129

However, the synthesis of low-cost and high-efficiency photothermal materials remains a challenge for both industrial and academic research. Here, hierarchically porous carbon having an irregular, inter-connected nanoparticle morphology is facilely synthesized through ""controlled carbonization"" of low-cost waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using ZnCl2/NaCl eutectic salts at 550 °C. We prove that ZnCl2 catalyzes the dehydration and decarboxylation of PET to form vinyl-terminated chain fragments and aromatic rings, which subsequently construct a carbon material frame through further cyclization and crosslinking. Meanwhile ZnCl2/NaCl eutectic salts act as porogens to produce mesopores and macropores. The resultant hierarchically porous carbon shows high specific surface area, fast water transportation, high solar absorption efficiency, and low thermal conductivity. Such combined features endow it with a high evaporation rate of 1.68 kg m-2 h-1 under 1 sun irradiation, an energy conversion efficiency of 97%, and a metallic ion removal efficiency of ca. 99.9% for seawater. More importantly, it outperforms the state-of-the-art carbon-based photothermal materials.

More specifically, techniques for managing the increasingly stringent emissions regulations and efficiency demands have often given rise to thermo-acoustic instabilities, particularly for annular combustors operating in a lean premixed mode. In this paper, we combine experimental and computational methods to examine unsteady gas turbine combustion in a full annular model gas turbine combustor installed at NTNU, operating both methane- and ethylene-air blends. The experimental data consists of flame images, high-speed OH∗ chemiluminescence images, as well as pressure and heat-release time-series at discrete locations for the ethylene-air case. The computational set-up consists of the 18 inlet tubes and swirlers, and the full annular combustor placed in a large external domain. The computational model consists of a compressible finite rate chemistry LES model using skeletal methane-air and ethylene-air combustion chemistry. The combustor is simulated in its self-excited state, without external forcing. From the experiments and simulations the methane and ethylene cases are found to behave differently: The ethylene-air flames are much smaller than the methane-air flames, resulting in different interaction between adjacent flames. The LES predictions show good qualitative agreement with the measurements in terms of instantaneous and time-averaged flame structure. Comparing measured and predicted time-series of pressure and heat-release also shows good quantitative agreement with respect to the dynamics and structure for the ethylene-air case. Investigating the predicted combustion dynamics using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) confirms the importance of the self-excited azimuthal mode on the behavior of the flame: the presence of nodes and anti-nodes of pressure induced fluctuations of the swirler mass-flow, which then, in turn, influence the heat-release. These events occur shifted in time.","Academic annular combustor; Finite-rate chemistry LES; Gas turbine combustion; Skeletal chemistry; Thermoacoustics","Chemiluminescence; Combustion; Combustors; Computational chemistry; Computational methods; Ethylene; Excited states; Gases; Large eddy simulation; Methane; Principal component analysis; Thermoacoustics; Time series; Annular combustor; Combustion instabilities; Emissions regulations; Finite-rate chemistry; Gas-turbine combustion; Proper orthogonal decompositions; Quantitative agreement; Thermoacoustic instability; Gas turbines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052479784

Despite the profound benefits obtained, anthropogenic disturbances are hindering its development. On the other hand, to ensure the livability of urban areas, communities and governments have been putting efforts in managing urban forests. Although, a huge amount of labor is invested in enhancing the urban vegetation cover of Endayesus area, it is not clear to what extent it succeeded or failed over years. Based on that, this paper aimed to detect forest cover change and contribution of forestry practices in enhancing forest cover of Endayesus urban forest area. Aerial photos were obtained from Ethiopian mapping agency and planning office of Mekele city. Other data were collected from randomly selected 196 sample households and purposively selected 20 officials using questionnaire and interview checklists. SPSS and GIS software were used for analysis and generating figurative and spatial outputs. Analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics. The study confirmed forest cover in Endayesus increased by 1387.43% from 1965 to 2009. However, the existence of bare and bushland use types exist substantially. Enclosing the catchment, plantations, public education and tree management activities contributed in improving forest cover of the area. There should have to be a land cover/use plan prepared in a way to maximize the benefits of urban forests within the area based on established multiple criteria. In addition, further research is needed in modeling the possible damage to Mekele city under vegetated and non-vegetated scenarios of Endayesus area in different climatic conditions. © 2019 The Author(s).

These perennial springs in Expedition Fiord, Queen Elizabeth Islands, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, had previously been explained as a recent, periglacial process. However, the discovery near White Glacier (79°26.66′N; 90°42.20′W; 350 m.a.s.l.) of a network of veins of hydrothermal origin with a similar mineralogy to travertine precipitates formed by the springs suggests that their fluids have much deeper circulation and are related to evaporite structures (salt diapirs) that underlie the area. The relatively high minimum trapping temperature of the fluid inclusions (avg. 200 ± 45°C, 1σ) in carbonate and quartz in the vein array, and in quartz veins west of the site, explains a local thermal anomaly detected through low-temperature thermochronology. This paper reviews and updates descriptive features of the perennial springs in Expedition Fiord and compares their mineralogy, geochemistry, and geology to the vein array by White Glacier, which is interpreted as a hydrothermal predecessor of the springs. The perennial springs in Axel Heiberg Island are known for half a century and have been extensively described in the literature. Discharging spring waters are hypersaline (1-4 molal NaCl; 5 to 19 wt% NaCl) and precipitate Fe-sulfides, sulfates, carbonates, and halides with acicular and banded textures representing discharge pulsations. At several sites, waters and sediments by spring outlets host microbial communities that are supported by carbon- and energy-rich reduced substrates including sulfur and methane. They have been studied as possible analogs for life-supporting environments in Mars. The vein array at White Glacier consists of steep to subhorizontal veins, mineralized fractures, and breccias within a gossan area of ca. 350 × 50 m. The host rock is altered diabase and a chaotic matrix-supported breccia composed of limestone, sandstone, and anhydrite-gypsum. Mineralization consists of brown calcite (pseudomorph after aragonite) in radial aggregates as linings of fractures and cavities, with transparent, sparry calcite and quartz at the centre of larger cavities. Abundant sulfides pyrite and marcasite and minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena occur in masses and veins, much like in base metal deposits known as Mississippi Valley Type; their weathering is responsible for brown Fe oxides forming a gossan. Epidote and chlorite rim veins where the host rock is Fe- and Mg-rich diabase. The banded carbonate textures with organic matter and sulfides are reminiscent of textures observed in mineral precipitates forming in the active springs at Colour Peak Diapir. Very small fluid inclusions (5-10 μm) in two generations of vein calcite (hexagonal, early brown calcite we denominate ""cal1"" lining vein walls; white-orange sparry calcite ""cal2"" infilling veins) have bulk salinities that transition between an early, high-salinity end-member brine (up to 20 wt% NaCl equivalent) to a later, low-salinity end-member fluid (nearly pure water) and show large fluctuations in salinity with time. Inclusions that occupy secondary planes and also growth zones in the later calcite infilling (deemed primary) have Th ranging from 100°C to 300°C (n=120, average200°C; independent of salinity), 2 orders of magnitude higher than average discharging water temperatures of 6°C at Colour Peak Diapir. Carbon isotope composition (δ13CVPDB) of the White Glacier vein array carbonates ranges from approximately -20 to -30‰, like carbonates formed by the degradation of petroleum, whereas carbonates at Colour Peak Diapir springs have a value of -10‰. Oxygen isotope composition (δ18OVSMOW) of vein carbonates ranges from -0.3‰ to +3.5‰, compatible with a coeval fluid at 250°C with a composition from -3.5‰ to -7.0‰. These data are consistent with carbonates having precipitated from mixtures of heated formational waters and high-latitude meteoric waters. In contrast, the δ18OVSMOW value for carbonates at Colour Peak Diapir springs is +10‰, derived from high-latitude meteoric waters at 6°C. The sulfur isotope (δ34SVCDT) composition of Fe-sulfides at the perennial springs is +19.2‰, similar to the δ34SVCDT of Carboniferous-age sulfate of the diapirs and consistent with low-temperature microbial reduction of finite (closed-system) sulfate. The δ34SVCDT values of Fe-sulfides in the vein array range from -2.7‰ to +16.4‰, possibly reflecting higher formation temperatures involving reduction of sulfate by organics. We suggest that the similar setting, mineralogical compositions, and textures between the hydrothermal vein array and the active Colour Peak Diapir springs imply a kinship. We suggest that overpressured basinal fluids expelled from the sedimentary package and deforming salt bodies at depth during regional compressional tectonic deformation ca. 50 million years ago (Eocene) during what is known as the Eurekan Orogeny created (by hydrofracturing) the vein array at White Glacier (and probably other similar ones), and the network of conduits created continued to be a pathway around salt bodies for deeply circulating fluids to this day. Fluid inclusion data suggest that the ancient conduit system was at one point too hot to support life but may have been since colonized by microorganisms as the system cooled. Thermochronology data suggest that the hydrologic system cooled to temperatures possibly sustaining life about 10 million years ago, making it since then a viable analogue environment for the establishment of microbial life in similar situations on other planets. © 2019 Marcos Zentilli et al.",,"carbonate sediment; fluid inclusion; Mars; mineralization; Mississippi Valley-type deposit; periglacial process; permafrost; quartz; spring (hydrology); thermochronology; Arctic; Axel Heiberg Island; Canada; Canadian Arctic; North Pole; Nunavut; Queen Elizabeth Islands; White Glacier",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069506092

The aim of the research is to test the assumption that urban metabolism perspectives and approaches strengthen accountability in urban environmental strategic planning. Applying a four-pillar accountability analysis to the strategic climate and resource plans of New York and Zurich, two cities which put environmental sustainability high on their political agenda, the study traces the role of urban metabolism perspectives and approaches and discusses the benefits these may have for accountable strategic planning with a focus on carbon and material flows. The interim results show on the one hand that implicit urban metabolism approaches are vital for both cities’ strategic planning and that they contribute to strengthened accountability in all four pillars of the analysis: responsibility, transparency, assessment and participation. On the other hand, the analysis highlights further potential benefits of urban metabolism perspectives and approaches in urban strategic climate and resource planning. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Accountability; Carbon flows; Material flows; Strategic planning; Sustainable cities; Urban governance; Urban metabolism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064673142

The characteristics for a 15 kW heat release rate flame, such as the radiant-power distribution and the line-of-sight spectral emission, were measured. A reduction of the overall radiant fraction in reduced-oxygen conditions was observed compared to flames burning in normal air. This reduction could generally be attributed to lower soot emission. To better understand this effect, simultaneous measurements of local soot volume fraction and temperature were conducted using the two-color pyrometry technique. The soot volume fraction and the temperature statistics on the flame axis are reported for both 21% O2 and 17% O2 co-flow conditions. The soot volume fractions for 21% O2 are generally found to be higher than those at the 17% O2 condition. But the soot temperature is relatively similar, showing the soot formation reactions occur at the similar temperature range, and the lower temperature environment of 17 % O2 attributes to smaller soot concentration. As a result, these factors cause a lower local soot emission intensity. A negative correlation between the fluctuating components of soot volume fraction and temperature is found to occur, with the correlation weakening at higher elevations. Overall, the measurements provide new understanding into spatiotemporal soot-radiation characteristics of buoyant, turbulent flames burning in different co-flow oxygen conditions. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.","Buoyant turbulent diffusion flames; Soot; Spectral radiation; Two-color pyrometry","Atmospheric turbulence; Buoyancy; Diffusion; Ethylene; Gas burners; Oxygen; Pyrometers; Pyrometry; Soot; Volume fraction; Ethylene diffusion flames; Fluctuating components; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Radiative characteristics; Simultaneous measurement; Spectral radiation; Turbulent diffusion flame; Two color pyrometry; Dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048968384

In this case, traditional well placement techniques of horizontal wells using a reactive or semi-proactive approach result in repeated exits of the reservoir target into the cap rock or potentially dip out of the target zone. This environment may result in losing reservoir footage, a lower net-to-gross, prolonged drilling time and wellbore challenges. All these items increase wellbore delivery time and cost. Existing logging-while-drilling (LWD) technology for well placement and formation evaluation has been extensively used in different environments. For example, borehole resistivity image logs to acquire real-time formation dips and provide at-bit resistivity measurements to help identify local features that may correlate with the structural dip. However, in many cases, especially for wells drilled close to the flank, carbonate layers are not as ""flat"" as seen in the seismic sections. Conventional deep-azimuthal resistivity technology was designed and introduced mainly for a clastics environment, where a clear resistivity contrast between shale and sand zones exists. The technology can help in mapping the target sand beyond the well trajectory. This is not the case with carbonate reservoirs, where the contrast is not obvious and the signal saturates due to proximity to anhydrite layers, masking the different reservoir layer boundaries. To overcome this challenge and enable bed boundary mapping tools to focus on a shallow depth of investigation, a new resistivity inversion called multi-component while drilling (MCWD) is introduced. The MCWD inversion technique utilizes the deep-azimuthal resistivity data to map the thickness and boundaries of different resistivity layers focused within the required depth of investigation. Consequently, conventional deep-azimuthal resistivity technology is adapted for proactive geosteering in relatively conductive medium by mapping the high-resistivity layer boundary (anhydrite) and the low-resistivity contrast base layer to maintain the wellbore optimally in the target zone. Results of this new inversion are demonstrated to show the combination of deep-azimuthal resistivity technology along with MCWD inversion to successfully place horizontal laterals within carbonate sublayer. Another added value is the mapped structural features that can help to improve the structure model and assist with real-time geosteering decisions. In addition, qualitative petrophysical evaluation could help to map the water front and the oil/water contact in some cases. The deployment of this technology has helped to improve drastically the Net-to-Gross (N/G) in these challenging environments, and more applications are currently being studied to develop further the use of the real-time azimuthal directional resistivity logging data. © 2019, International Petroleum Technology Conference",,"Boreholes; Carbonation; Electric logging; Gasoline; Horizontal wells; Infill drilling; Mapping; Oil field equipment; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Well drilling; Depth of investigation; Formation evaluation; Inversion techniques; Logging while drilling technologies; Petrophysical evaluations; Pro-active approach; Real-time geosteering; Resistivity measurement; Oil well logging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064109726

Due to its high durability and non-corrosive properties concrete cover can be significantly reduced, and thus thinner and lighter elements can be designed and produced. In our investigation we considered the possibility of prestressing such thin panels with carbon textile reinforcement in order to reduce cracking and allow for larger dimensions. 12 panels with dimensions of 1.30 × 0.15 × 0.03 meters and three prestress levels (3 panels in each series and control series of non-prestressed specimens) were tested in four point bending test. Specimens were reinforced with symmetric textile grids with axial distance between single strands equal to 38 mm in both directions and tensile strength of 2500 MPa. Cracking moment and cracking pattern were observed, as well as ultimate load-bearing capacity and load-deflection relationship. It was observed that due to prestressing cracking moment could be increased by up to 48%. Furthermore, the ductility was improved as deflections corresponding to cracking load increased more than two times. This research programme shown that not only carbon tendons or strips can be prestressed. Prestressing of carbon textile reinforcement is also possible and it can positively influence the ultimate and serviceability limit states. © 2019 by the fib.

During the millennia of biocenosis and soil, nature and life have been maintained in nature. All living organisms are directly or partially interconnected. On this basis, we can conclude that soil is a sustainable living ecosystem. After the emergence in 1840 of Liebig's scientific work entitled ""Chemistry for use in agriculture"" the theory of mineral nutrient regime of the soil emerged. It belongs to inorganic chemistry. The followers of this theory have also proved that plant nutrition is due to the complete decomposition (mineralization) of organic matter. It is known that the nutrient regime of the soil is formed due to the decomposition of organic mass. Of great importance is the particle size distribution, agrochemical and physical and other soil characteristics. According to scientists, the main chemical elements in plant nutrition are: carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, silicon, calcium, chlorine, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron and others. Some types of plants absorb more: iodine, aluminum, manganese. © 2019 Monitoring 2019 Conference - Monitoring of Geological Processes and Ecological Condition of the Environment.",,"Agricultural robots; Chemical elements; Condition monitoring; Decomposition; Ecology; Fertilizers; Geology; Inorganic compounds; Minerals; Nutrients; Nutrition; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Climatic conditions; Environmental Monitoring; Inorganic chemistry; Living organisms; Mineral nutrients; Organic fertilizers; Plant nutrition; Soil characteristics; Soils",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089601017

This phenomenon is one of the most important challenges of the contemporary age. In fact, the negative effects of climate change and its harmful effects to the human health and environment itself, conducted international community to accept some international treaties such as the Convention on Climate Change 1992, the Kyoto Protocol 1997 and the Paris Conference 2015. The Paris agreements on the climate change is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which dealing with greenhouse gas and oblige the parties to take account of the magnitude and consequences of global warming Reducing GHG emissions for the first time. The goal of this agreement is to change the economy based on global fossil fuels over the next few decades and decrease the global warming track. The Islamic Republic of Iran also declared its agreement at the time of the initial approval of the Paris Agreement, but the process of formal accession to this agreement entails ratification by the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the general of which was passed by the Islamic Consultative Assembly and then presented to the Council. The Guardian is currently being re-examined in the Islamic Consultative Assembly to resolve the ambiguities and defects of the Guardian Council. This has led to disagreement between the proponents and the opponents of Iran's accession to the Paris Agreement. In this paper, while reviewing the legal process for the formation of the Paris Agreement, the views of the advocates and opponents of Iran's accession to the agreement were examined from the perspective of Iranian fundamental rules and regulations.

However, Smart City projects involving the refurbishment of existing buildings carry key barriers to implementation. The most prominent ones are: (i) a wide time discrepancy between appreciable environmental and economic benefits and immediate costs of action and (ii) economic benefits that might not accrue to who bears the cost of the intervention. This research provides a clue to solving this impasse based on the concept of multiple-benefits evaluation stemming from a shift in perspective from mitigation costs to development opportunities. We considered the costs of interventions on the European building stock under the Smart City projects to assess the multiple-benefits delivered to society. Starting from the monetary aspects of single projects, we identified multipliers to assess three different types of multiple-benefits: (i) Energy savings; (ii) Health and well-being; and iii.) Employment. Our findings indicate that in a time span of 14 years (2005–2018), an amount of about 260 million Euros invested in such projects lead to: (i) an accumulated saving potential of approximately 40 kilotons of oil equivalent, corresponding to 465 GWh; (ii) a reduction in air pollution corresponding to a value of 3 million Euros in avoided costs; and (iii) the creation of around 1,000 jobs with an average duration of 5 years.

The paper presents a methodology to model and size generic hybrid electric propulsion system at the conceptual level allowing for a rapid exploration of the vast design space. The generalization of the propulsive system using a basic propulsive power unit object is discussed highlighting the control parameters needed to fully define the propulsive system architecture. Three case studies for a 2035 turbo-prop regional aircraft using parallel, series/parallel and distributed series configurations show that improvements to the fuel and energy consumption are affected by the system morphology, its control strategy and the maturity level assumed for its components. Using conservative estimations for the battery and electric components performances indicate that the best configurations can only provide a fuel reduction of around 5% while weighting 25% more than the reference design. Using more optimistic assumptions leads to a larger feasible design space where the best performing configuration, the series/parallel one, realizes more substantial fuel and energy reductions of 28% and 14% with a 24% higher take-off mass. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Aging assets experience declining lifting efficiencies due to depleting reservoir pressure and increase in water cut. This impact PETRONAS’ capability to deliver national hydrocarbon production targets. New developments and further improvements to gas lift facilities are likely to erode the economic value of assets without even considering the potential time impact due to the complexity in delivering gas compression upgrades or gas import projects. PETRONAS’ primary goal within Malaysia is to sustain production and maximize the remaining recoverable reserves. To realize this target it is widely acknowledged that the company must think differently. Alternatives to gas lift have been considered for rejuvenation of brownfield assets and development of marginal assets using a ‘fit for purpose’ approach resulting in some relatively low Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)/Operating Expenditure (OPEX) solutions. One such method identified was Through Tubing Electrical Submersible Pumps – Cable Deployed (TTESP-CD). TTESP-CD technology is a game changer that can challenge the boundaries of traditional engineering with a truly rig-less deployment of an ESP system with full compliance to API/ISO requirements and demonstrating up to 70% cost savings over conventional offshore ESP installation methods. The TTESP-CD innovation helps in improving the asset value through gas prioritization, gas lift reallocation, flaring reduction and increase in lifting efficiency. TTESP-CD is also in line with the company digitalization concept due to the baseline data available from surface and downhole equipment. This technology has been declared a success through pilot deployment in an offshore field within the Sarawak Basin with an incremental gain of 250BOPD, 0.3MMSTB in reserves acceleration and 22 months run life as of Feb 2019. This has been a key step for building confidence in the wider application of the technology. Lessons learnt and best practices from the pilot implementation have been applied to ongoing and future projects and serve as a good foundation for further development of the technology. To date, approximately 20 candidates for the TTESP-CD application have been identified for replication in Malaysia within the next 2 years across 3 regions. There are various challenges faced when implementing this technology on aging offshore assets that was never designed for ESPs which include; space availability for deployment equipment and surface electrical equipment, power availability and distribution, instrumentation, data transmission, structural integrity and operational mind set. PETRONAS sees a bright future for TTESP-CD application and technology which includes layer to layer matrix dump flood, interim production and well unloading/DST well unloading.

The objective of the present study was to explore the impact of the changes in climatic parameters on water resources management and to assess the efficiency of changing water uses as a strategy to mitigate the impacts of water shortage in Southeastern Iran. To assess the variations of temperature and precipitation parameters an ensemble of fifteen GCM models was used, and the emission scenarios A1 and B1 with emphasis on uncertainty and water resources management were simulated by the Water Evaluation And Planning System (WEAP) model using data derived from climate change and local station data. The calibration was done by the WEAP model algorithm. Climate change results showed a increase in temperature and precipitation. Due to the increase in temperature relative to precipitation, the region's water demand will increase. The slight increase in rainfall does not mean supplying the region's water demand, especially the agricultural demand. Therefore, the impact of climate change is having a greater impact on farmers because their livelihoods depend on water. These conditions will lead to further problems, including migration. These conditions require effective solutions. One of the best solutions is to gradually eliminate agriculture and replace it with industry. The results showed that with this scenario, the water demand of different sectors will be met, the local environment will not be destroyed, and low-income, non-permanent, and illicit jobs like fuel smuggling will be eliminated. © 2019, Common Ground Research Networks, Yasin Zamani, Arman Hashemi Monfared, Mohsen Hamidian Pour, Mehdi Azhdary Moghadam.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Environmental; Industry; Water management; Water stress",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081206130

The emissions associated with the built environment, amounting to more that 39% of the total emissions in the United States, continue to rise with a “business as usual” design mentality with no regard to the consequences. Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions will continue to influence the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and consequently, climate change adaptation strategies will become even more decisive in the overall design resiliency of a building. This climate change impetus requires that building energy codes adopt more stringent performance-based requirements to ensure that emissions associated with the built-environment are restrained and stabilized over time despite uncertainty. Thus, this endeavor seeks to isolate and evaluate the performance and resiliency of the building enclosure with various forcing climate projections and normalized weather files. The predicted envelope performance factor (EPF), a Building Envelope Trade-off Option procedure which only considers building envelope components per Normative Appendix C, ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1, is first utilized to appraise prescriptive building envelope requirements, resulting EPF, for current and prior versions of Standard 90.1 (2007 thru 2016) specifically for a prototype building model in response to normalized historical weather patterns using an industry standard reference EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) weather file for Chicago, IL, ASHRAE Climate Zone 5A.

Specific to the distribution climate model projections and emissions scenario considered, the experimental simulated results indicate targeted envelope performance factors that can be used as performance metrics earlier in the integrated design processes to reinforce or plan for building resiliency. © 2019 ASHRAE.",,"Architectural design; Climate change; Climate models; Earth atmosphere; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Solar buildings; Adaptation strategies; Building energy code; Building envelope performance; Climate change adaptation; Greenhouse gases emissions; Integrated design process; Performance based requirement; Performance factors; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103040257

Biomass is the oldest source of energy that man has used, and represents a collective term for various, most diverse products from agriculture. Renewable energy sources are one of the crucial components of the sustainable development, giving rational economic, ecological and social effects. Due to favorable climatic conditions, Republic of Macedonia has significant potential to use biomass byproducts from agriculture. According to the energy balance for 2000, the biomass contributed with 7.6 percent of the gross national consumption and covers about 12.7 percent of the total national energy consumption. Using alternative sources of energy has important role because of increasingly demanding environmental standards, as well as the obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. From the legal and institutional aspect, the basic elements for renewable energy sources are provided in the Law on Energy (Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia No. 63/2006, 36/2007, 106/2008), which, among other things, promotes the utilization of renewable energy sources About 76% of households in the Republic of Macedonia use biomass for heating and 80% of biomass used in the country is fire wood. Crop residues are underutilized, and grape pruning residues are used rarely and in certain regions. Orchard pruning residues are concentrated in few regions and can be used for production of energy. Republic of Macedonia theoretically could have available a very large amount of agricultural biomass for energy production. Expected ecological, economic and social benefits of biomass byproducts from agriculture are investigated. © 2019, Consulting and Training Center - KEY.

This paper presents iCON first principal process simulation software, used to perform tank emission calculations by leveraging on its existing extensive database of all process simulation models and chemical components physical property. Hence, a lot of operation cost is saved by eliminating the need for inventory sampling activity for each tank. This paper also will discuss online tank emission work processes to make it sustainable. iCON Tank Emission complies to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42) Fifth Edition Chapter 7 Liquid Storage Tanks that covers fixed roof tanks (vertical and horizontal) and floating roof tanks (internal, external and domed) with respective combination of roof, shell, rim seal, fittings and breather vent settings. It is also linked to monthly Malaysian Climate Condition that covers domestic municipals temperature (minimum and maximum), Solar Irradiance Factor and wind speed that improves the tank emission calculation accuracy. iCON Tank Emission lets users calculate thousands of tank emission simultaneously by using iCON communication (COM) interface feature and displays the results in monthly and yearly summary for report standardization among multiple business units. The average simulation convergence time is 100 tanks simultaneous calculation per minute making it time efficient for HSE engineers to perform strict monthly calculation and reporting. Case studies and what if scenarios could also be run in effort to reduce tank emission via introduction of vapor recovery and optimizing tank mechanical parameters i.e. type of rim seal, color and fittings selection. iCON Online Tank Emission is working through linking iCON model with real time plant information data for real time tank emission calculation which is transparent to management and regulators.

The results indicated that the implementation of green tax scenario along with technological progress causes reduction by −0.19% in temporal value of pollution money in coal sector and the effect of monetary value of energy carriers on oil was also found reduced by −0.67% and the percentage reduction is about −0.1 in contrast to the other countries. At first, the direct and indirect coefficients (Leontief inverse) and the multiplying coefficients of bioenvironmental pollutants were computed using input-output matrix table technique.

As it is obvious from every-day practices, in most cases industrial enterprises with emissions containing a substantial fraction of solid dusts include suspended particles (TSP) in their control programs. A risk caused by an enterprise for population living on nearby territories is often assessed as per a sum of suspended particles contained in emissions; these data are also applied to work out administrative actions and to substantiate the necessity to implement activities aimed at environmental protection. But still, experience accumulated due to research accomplished in the sphere proves that solid dust emissions from industrial enterprises are a poly-disperse and a multi-component mixture with complicated chemical structure; this mixture contains both organic and non-organic admixtures, including highly and extremely hazardous ones. In such cases control over ambient air contamination performed as per TSP contents sometimes leads to specific toxic components being concealed when such components are emitted into the air, and it will eventually result in underestimating health risks; sometimes, it can result in overestimating hazardous impacts exerted by an enterprise when it is next to impossible to separate dusts emitted from an industrial object under control and emissions discharged by other sources. An industrial enterprise dealing with mining was chosen as a research object. Emission samples and air samples were taken via active sampling at dust emission sources and at reference points in a zone influenced by the chosen enterprise. Dust concentration in samples was determined with a gravimetric technique and a laser analyzer. Particles morphology and component structure was determined via electronic microscopy performed on high-resolution scanning microscope (with magnification from 5 to 300,000) with S3400N «HITACHI» x-ray fluorescent device. A chemical structure was identified via x-ray phase analysis of samples performed with XRD-700 «Shimadzu» x-ray diffractometer. The accomplished research allowed to determine a component structure of dusts emissions and dust contamination structure at a boundary of the reference territory. It was detected that chemical structure of dust contamination at the reference territory boundary was substantially different from emissions discharged from the examined sources. It may be assumed that dust contamination at the reference points doesn't occur due to activities performed by the chosen enterprise but is determined by other sources (for example, other industrial enterprises, dust being blown off open soil spots, motorways, etc.). Therefore, control over TSP at the reference territory boundary doesn't describe impacts exerted by stationary sources belonging to the examined enterprise. Basing on the research results, the authors made some recommendations on approaches to creating relevant programs for control and monitoring over dust emissions from industrial enterprises. © SGEM2019.","Components structure; Dust emissions; Emissions dust profile; Industrial control; Monitoring","Chemical analysis; Contamination; Dust; Hazards; Health risks; Industrial research; Laws and legislation; Mixtures; Monitoring; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Structure (composition); X rays; Control and monitoring; Dust emission; Electronic microscopy; Gravimetric technique; High resolution scanning; Industrial controls; Multicomponent mixture; X ray diffractometers; Industrial emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073377616

The analysis includes the dynamic start-up and cooling phases of the system, and then compares its performance with a hybrid photovoltaic-diesel-battery system. The first system consists of a 5.45 kW solar array, a 6 kW Stirling engine, a 6.92 kW bidirectional inverter and a 71.28 kWh VRLA gel lead-acid battery bank. The second one is comprised of 3.95 kW PV panels, a 7.1 kW diesel genset, a 4.46 kW bi-directional inverter and a 50.16 kWh VRLA gel lead-acid battery bank. The initial sizing of both systems was based on the demand estimated for a hypothetical case study of electrification for a 102-household rural village in Bolivia called “Tacuaral de Mattos”. Both systems were initially optimized in size using the well-known energy optimization software tool, HOMER. However, since the characteristics of the proposed system required a detailed analysis of its dynamics, a dynamic model that complements the HOMER analysis was developed using MATLAB Simulink TM 8.9. Furthermore, due to fluctuations of photovoltaic energy as well as the importance of the battery life cycle, a smart power management was implemented through combined dispatch algorithms. These control algorithms were composed of typical “Cycle charging”, “Load Following”, “Frugal” and “SOC set point” strategies. Additionally, a supervisory controller was designed in order to compensate the energy difference during the warmup, stand-by and cool-down modes of the Stirling engine and diesel generator. The results showed that PV-diesel-battery system represented a higher-performance option to implement in a rural electrification project compared to a PV-Stirling-battery system. However, the last one showed a better environmental sustainability as it was able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions during its operation (Around 10% savings in CO2 emissions). © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

Liquid fuel injection is critical to the combustion process in both compression ignition (CI) diesel engines and gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines. Much effort has been focused on modeling of spray atomization, droplet dynamics, and vaporization using a Lagrangian-drop Eulerian-fluid (LDEF) framework, which has been applied in engine computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations with success. However, recent experiments have shown the mixing-controlled characteristics of high-pressure fuel injection under vaporization conditions that are relevant to both gasoline and diesel engines. Under such conditions, instead of being dominated by droplet dynamics, the vaporization process of a liquid spray is limited by the entrainment rate of hot ambient gas and a saturated equilibrium phase is reached within the two-phase region. This suggests that an alternative approach of fuel spray modeling might be applicable. An equilibrium phase (EP) spray model was recently proposed for application to engine combustion simulation, based on this mixing-controlled jet theory and assumption of local phase equilibrium. This model has been applied to simulate both diesel fuel injection and GDI sprays, and has shown excellent predictions for transient vapor/liquid penetrations, spatial distribution of mixture fraction, as well as combustion characteristics in terms of flame lift-off length and soot emission. It has also shown better computational efficiency than the classical LDEF spray modeling approach since the dynamic process of droplet breakup, collision, coalescence, and vaporization is not modeled. The model and results relevant to engine simulation are reviewed in this chapter. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Fuel Injection; High Fuel Injection Pressure; Mixture Fraction; Solve Phase Equilibrium; Spray Model",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103853258

Here, we designed a novel and facile strategy for optimizing nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) for efficient CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) by in situ encapsulation of nickel nanoparticles (NPs) into N-doped carbon nano-hybrid substrates (Ni/N-CHSs). Strikingly, the as-prepared Ni/N-CHS catalyst exhibits excellent performances towards catalyzing CO2 into CO with a high faradaic efficiency of 93.1% at -0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and remarkable long-term durability, which is even comparable to those of state-of-the-art CO2RR catalysts. Theoretical calculations indicated that the inclusion of Ni NPs could enhance the activity of N-C for the CO2RR by deeply reducing the activation barriers. This work thus provided an ideal route to rational in situ encapsulation of metal NPs into N-C materials, further tuning the electronic structure and significantly enhancing the CO2RR performance of low-cost carbon materials. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Costs; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic structure; Nanoparticles; Nickel; Substrates; Tuning; Electroreduction of CO2; Environmental problems; Faradaic efficiencies; Long term durability; Nickel nanoparticles; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Theoretical calculations; Doping (additives)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063155699

We then describe the recent evidence on non-random assembly of bacterial communities that utilize carbon from methane, based on stable isotope probing experiments as well as on results from natural community manipulations followed by metagenomic analysis. We follow up by highlighting results from synthetic methano-trophic community manipulations identifying the importance of a lanthanide switch that regulates alternative methanol dehydrogenase enzymes in these communities.

Understanding the changes in soil microbial communities owing to soil erosion is of vital importance as soil microbial communities are sensitive indicators of soil condition and are essential in soil nutrient cycling. This study used the reconstructed facility with 10, 20 and 30 cm topsoil thickness under no-till soya bean-corn rotation in black soil region of Northeast China. Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting 16S rRNA, qPCR and soil respiration measurement were performed to assess the changes in soya bean and corn rhizosphere bacterial communities, as well as their abundance and activities due to the topsoil thickness. The results showed that soil bacterial communities from both soya bean and corn were more sensitive to topsoil removal than to soil biogeochemical characteristics. Topsoil depths significantly influenced both soya bean and corn bacterial communities, while they only significantly influenced the bacterial abundance and respiration in corn. We also found that the topsoil depths significantly induced the changes in phyla and genera from both soya bean and corn rhizosphere bacterial community, which aid further understandings on how topsoil layer influences the global nutrient cycling of Mollisols by influencing the change in microbial communities. © 2019 The Authors.","16S rRNA gene sequencing; Bacterial community; Mollisol; Soil erosion; Topsoil thickness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071180634

Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) coupled with Genetic Algorithms (GA), which facilitates the learning algorithms to figure out the local minimum deviation, is employed to map the highly nonlinear relationships between elements such as C, H and O in fuels and final CO2 emission. A total of 15,000 training and testing data come from the recordings of a grate boiler within six months. And the predicted CO2 emissions based on fuel nature structure matched the measured data with fairly good agreement. Finally, the Box-Behnken experimental design methodology was used to extract the mathematical expression between elements in fuels and CO2 emission. Consequently, by knowing the C, H and O composition in fuels, the CO2 emission can be well forecasted, in such way, it is sensible to optimize the future fuel nature structure in order to achieve clean carbon footprint and control the CO2 emissions. © 2019 The Authors.

Interim measures reduced SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10 by 6.63%, 12.96%, 8.72% and 10.30%, while comprehensive measures further reduced pollutants by 12.19%, 8.89%, 25.05% and 30.86%.

Based on the decoupling analysis, the Trend Index is established to judge the development direction of the relationship. This study focuses on solving two questions: on the one hand, the strict classification provides an accurate approach for calculating the carbon emission carried by construction land; on the other hand, the paper re-analyses the decoupling states of the two research objects that have same expected development direction, which is falling at the same time. The results show that the ideal decoupling relationship between carbon emission and construction land expansion is in the order of strong decoupling<weak decoupling<expansive negative decoupling<strong negative decoupling<recessive decoupling<weak negative decoupling.

With the rapid development of renewable electricity industries, this set of policies brought about a heavy fiscal burden for the government. The exploration of whether current support policy provided excessive subsidies for renewable electricity is of great practical significance. We hold an idea that the internalization of positive externality is the only criterion for the government to support the development of a renewable electricity industry. The problem of whether the current policy provides excessive subsidies for renewable electricity industry can be solved by assessing whether its positive externality is internalized, as renewable electricity industry has a characteristic of externality. Our study object is an assumed biomass power plant in Jingning County, Gansu Province. A system dynamics model was built. Applying the environmental cost accounting method and net present value analysis method, we connected the techno-economic analysis of the biomass power plant with the measurement of positive externality of biomass power generation together. In this system dynamics model, we developed an indicator to reveal whether the subsidies provided by governmental policies can compensate the positive externality generated by the assumed biomass power plant. This study mainly draws the following conclusions: Firstly, China's current support policy does provide excessive subsidies for the renewable power industry. The subsidies received by biomass power plants from the government are higher than the positive externality generated by them; secondly, the positive externality measurement of the biomass power industry is influenced by many regional factors; thirdly, without governmental policy support, biomass power plants cannot compete with traditional power companies; fourthly, as biomass power generation is concerned, the current price subsidy intensity is about US$0.0132 higher per kWh than a reasonable level. Furthermore, the parameters frequently applied in the calculation of the prices of pollutant emission reduction in Chinese research papers are relatively small, which is only half of their actual values. Jingning County, situated in inland west-northern China, lacks typicality. There is a limitation in judging whether the government's support policy for renewable electricity is reasonable through a feasibility analysis of investment in a biomass power generation project. This may be the main drawback of this study. © 2019 by the authors.","Apple branches; Biomass power generation; Jingning; Positive externalities; Support policy","biomass power; electricity industry; electricity supply; emission control; energy planning; investment incentive; power generation; power plant; price determination; state role; China; Gansu; Jingning; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069760168

However, when the exhaust gas is not sufficiently burned, black smoke will be produced in the flare system and endanger air quality and human health. So, as a crucial task, reducing the emission of flare black smoke is attracting a growing amount of research attention. In a typical flare smoke reduction system, a high-resolution smoke image is greatly beneficial to smoke recognition and analysis. But the smoke image usually encounters the low-resolution problem. Accordingly, in this paper we propose a super-resolution method specific for smoke images, which is called smoke images upsampling method (SIUM). Considering the texture and edge characteristics of the smoke images, the proposed SIUM learns a mapping between the low-resolution images and the associated high-resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SIUM is prominently superior to relevant state-of-the-art technologies when applied to upsample low-resolution smoke images. © 2013 IEEE.","air pollution; deep convolutional network; Smoke images; upsampling","Air pollution; Air quality; Convolution; Deep learning; Gas plants; Petrochemical plants; Signal sampling; Textures; Convolutional networks; High resolution; High resolution image; Low resolution images; Petrochemical enterprise; State-of-the-art technology; Superresolution methods; Up sampling; Smoke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078272325

Recent advances in wearable sensing technologies and their generated streaming data are providing a unique opportunity to understand the user's behaviour and to predict future needs. Estimation of thermal comfort is a challenging task given the subjectivity of human perception; this subjectivity is reflected in the statistical nature of comfort models, as well as the plethora of comfort models available. Additionally, such models are using not-easily or invasively measured variables (e.g., core temperatures and metabolic rate), which are often not practical and undesirable measurements. The main goal of this paper was to develop dynamic model-based monitoring system of the occupant's thermal state and their thermoregulation responses under two different activity levels. In total, 25 participants were subjected to three different environmental temperatures at two different activity levels. The results have shown that a reduced-ordered (second-order) multiinputs- single-output discrete-time transfer function (MISO-DTF), including three input variables (wearables), namely, aural temperature, heart rate, and average skin heat-flux, is best to estimate the individual's metabolic rate (non-wearable) with a mean absolute percentage error of 8.7%. A general classification model based on a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) technique is developed to predict the individual's thermal sensation. For a seven-class classification problem, the results have shown that the overall model accuracy of the developed classifier is 76% with an F1-score value of 84%. The developed LS-SVM classification model for prediction of occupant's thermal sensation can be integrated in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to provide an occupant thermal state-based climate controller. In this paper, we introduced an adaptive occupant-based HVAC predictive controller using the developed LS-SVM predictive classification model. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptive controlling; Machine-learning; Prediction; Thermal comfort; Thermal sensation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074221750

Faustmann land expectation value (LEV) is a widely used criterion in forestry to evaluate a diversity of decision parameters, such as rotation age and thinning regimes. Most of the predictions and, consequently, expectations are based on emperical knowledge, assuming a steady state in climate and a deterministic forest growth approach. However, the climate may change to potentially different degrees in the coming decades, causing a dynamic and uncertain forest growth and carbon budget. Moreover, carbon economy in forestry, defined as opportunity cost of in situ carbon sequestration, can hardly be analysed using empirical models and calls for process-based forest biomass production models. Process-based models include numerous parameters and processes that embody some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty of these parameters and climate state propagates over time to the final decision about carbon economy and optimal management solutions. Here we quantify this uncertainty using Bayesian inference and apply twelve different climate change scenarios to evaluate the forecasts of the process-based forest model 3-PG, to predict the growth of European beech (Fagus Sylvatica) in central european conditions as an example. The results show a strong influence of the model's parameters uncertainty on the final decisions about timber based and carbon economy. The uncertainty triples if different climate change scenarios are applied as a source of deep uncertainty where no probability can be assigned to any scenario. To deal with deep uncertainty, a robust decision-making approach has been applied to find solutions with minimum regret or maximum value at risk regarding all scenarios. We conclude that communicating uncertainty is a fundamental issue for forestry economics under changing climate conditions, especially if carbon sequestration is an asset. The key message for designing global forest governance policy in the uncertain times of climate change will be the necessity to take into account both the uncertainty on the demand side, that is, socio-economic developments and regional population needs for forest ecosystem services such as wood, but also the uncertainty of the supply side and the inherent ecological uncertainties in predicting the forests' growth, resources, and climatic conditions. © 2019 R.

The SAVs can serve a number of market niches including first-mile/last-mile shuttle services. There are many potential benefits to travelers and society such as reducing the need to own a vehicle, increasing accessibility through on-demand service, or reducing emissions and maintenance with electric vehicles. `There are challenges associated with electrification, including the need for battery charging and development of battery charging infrastructure. The shuttle system will operate over several road types, including bus-only transitways, major arterials, collectors, and local roads. This system serves as an example of a first / last-mile service connecting The Hospital to the future Light Rail Transit (LRT) station at Hurdman. This paper covers the planning and design of a SAV shuttle system that will link the Smyth Road Medical Campus with the Hurdman LRT station in Ottawa (a distance of about 5 km). The paper consists of five parts. The first part serves as a background to the technology and service characteristics of SAVs. The second part defines the current system in place, and the problems associated with it. The third part describes the design of a new shuttle system using SAVs, including stations and battery charging facility.

To alleviate this issue, herein, all-inorganic orthorhombic CsPbBr3 was combined with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and the resultant composite (CsPbBr3@g-C3N4) showed enhanced activity in CO2 photoreduction. Under the irradiation of AM1.5 filter for 12 h, CO2 was converted into CH4 and CO with high selectivity to methane (91%) and the total amount of gaseous products up to ∼300 μmol g-1. This reactivity is 6-fold and 4-fold higher than that of pure g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3, respectively. CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 also shows excellent catalytic activity at low concentrations of CO2. Studies of energy band level and steady-state and transient photoluminescence spectroscopy indicated that the incorporation of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 increases charge separation, which may result in sharply enhanced catalytic efficiency.

There are extensive areas of sandy soils under cultivation, but the soil fertility is often low and dependent on the levels of soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we review SOC levels of sandy soils across the world using pedon databases, data from literature, and three detailed case studies. Pedons were selected from five major databases and the pedons had a minimum of 850 g sand kg− 1 in the top 30 cm. Sandy soils occur in all climates and several soil orders (mainly Alfisols, Entisols, Inceptisols, Spodosols, Ultisols). Soil organic carbon was highest in sandy soils of the temperate and cold zones (mean 19 g kg− 1), and lowest in soils of the arid zone (&lt; 5 g kg− 1). The SOC concentrations was highest when mean annual precipitation was between 700 and 1300 mm, and SOC was lower when annual temperatures were higher. Sandy soils under forest had on average 23 g SOC kg− 1 whereas the soils under prairie had on average 7 g SOC kg− 1. Spodosols had the highest SOC concentrations, and SOC was lowest in Aridisols. The average A-horizon thickness of sandy soils was 17 cm, and it was thickest in Mollisols, and thinnest in Inceptisols. The thickness of the A-horizon is important since most of the SOC of sandy soils is found in the A-horizon. Over 32,000 papers have been published on sandy soils since 1914, and in the past 10 years, some 1000–1800 papers are annually published on sandy soils. We extracted papers since the early 1990s, and grouped them by continent, land cover, soil order, and focus of the research. Three soil-forming processes have been extensively studied in relation to SOC and sandy soils: podzolization, humification, and melanization. Several studies found that SOC increases when sandy soils were fertilized, but sandy soils become more water repellent with an increase in SOC and a decrease in pH. From published literature, it was found that SOC was high in sandy soils under forest (≤ 90 g kg− 1) and grassland (≤ 187 g kg− 1), and low in sandy soils under agriculture (≤ 38 g kg− 1) or under shrub (≤ 36 g kg− 1). Lastly, we present case studies from Southern Africa, Western Europe, and North America. Sandy soils cover about 273 million ha in Africa, and SOC rarely exceeds 10 g SOC kg− 1 in the top 30 cm. The plaggen soils of Western Europe have high SOC (up to 66 g kg− 1) due to the long-term additions of sod, litter, manure, and sea sand to increase the soil fertility. In the Wisconsin Central Sand Plains, SOC stocks in soils under agriculture were high (60 Mg ha− 1) compared to the soils under forest (15 Mg ha− 1) and grassland (25 Mg ha− 1). Available water capacity increased with an increase in SOC. From this review, we conclude that sandy soils are found throughout the world, and the sandy soils in the temperate and cold zones have the highest SOC levels. In sandy soils, soil organic carbon increased the cation exchange capacity and lowered the bulk density. Soil organic carbon levels can be significantly increased in sandy soils under agriculture when amendments are made in combination with irrigation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Arenosols; Carbon sequestration; Climate zone; Land cover; Plaggen; Psamments; Soil management; Soil organic carbon",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070538894

When operating at high population inversion, such devices are often affected by undesired energy-transfer processes and thermal effects. In this work, we study a 32-μm-thick epitaxial layer of potassium gadolinium ytterbium double tungstate with a high Yb content of 57at.%, representing an Yb3+ concentration of ∼3.8 × 1021 per cubic centimeter, grown onto an un-doped KY(WO4)2 substrate. The pump absorption, luminescence decay, and small-signal gain are investigated under intense pumping conditions. Spectroscopic signatures of an energy-transfer process and of quenched ions, as well as thermal effects are observed. We present a gain model which takes into account excessive heat generated due to the abovementioned experimental observations. Based on finite-element calculations, we find that the net gain is significantly reduced due to, firstly, a fraction of Yb3+ ions not contributing to stimulated emission, secondly, a reduction of population inversion owing to a parasitic energy-transfer process and, thirdly, degradation of the effective transition cross-sections owing to device heating. Nevertheless, a signal enhancement of 8.1 dB was measured from the sample at 981 nm wavelength when pumping at 932 nm. The corresponding signal net gain of ∼800 dB/cm, which was achieved without thermal management, is promising for waveguide amplifier operating without active cooling. © 2019 SPIE.","Integrated optics materials; Optical amplifiers; Rare-earth-doped materials; Ytterbium lasers","Energy transfer; Light; Light amplifiers; Potassium; Rare earths; Tungsten compounds; Waveguides; Ytterbium; Energy transfer process; Integrated optics materials; Population inversions; Rare earth concentration; Rare earth doped materials; Spectroscopic signatures; Waveguide amplifiers; Ytterbium lasers; Solid state lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068315265

Beijing has adopted measures, such as 'coal to gas' and 'coal to electricity', to reduce environmental pollution caused by central heating. Given a peak-to-valley difference in the electricity supply of power plant, which is uneven day and night, this study proposes to store the night-time off-peak electricity in the form of heat energy and drive the ammonia absorption system in the form of steam or hot water during peak or flat electricity. Simulation results of ammonia absorption cooling and heating dual-supply system show that heat source temperature increases, evaporation temperature increases, and cooling water temperature decreases are all beneficial to improve the refrigeration coefficient in the summer cooling condition. In the meantime, heat source temperature increases, evaporation temperature increases, and cooling water temperature decreases are beneficial for increasing the heating coefficient in the winter heating condition. The heating and cooling coefficients of the system are 1.38 and 0.65 in the optimal working condition in winter and summer. Benefit analysis shows that, compared with central heating and cold storage air conditioning, the system can save 576,000 tons of standard coal and 1.417 million tons of carbon dioxide if used in 12% of the cooling and heat supply areas in Beijing.

The morphological and metallurgical changes in the CO2 laser treated layer are assessed, and microhardness and fracture toughness of the resulting surface are analysed. The influence of mud formed from the environmental dust particles in humid ambient air on the CO2 laser treated surface is investigated and the tangential force required for removing the dried mud from the cemented carbide cutting tool surface is measured. It is found that the CO2 laser treatment slightly increases the microhardness and lowers the fracture toughness of the cemented carbide cutting tool surface. The CO2 laser treated surface has texture characteristic consisting of hierarchically distributed micro/nanopillars. The CO2 laser treatment reduces the surface free energy, in which case the wetting state of the cemented carbide cutting tool surface changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after the laser treatment process. The water condensation on to the dust particles gives rise to mud formation on the substrate surface in humid air ambient, which enhances the dust particles adhesion onto the surface upon drying. The tangential force required to remove the dried mud from the untreated cemented carbide cutting tool surface is almost twice of the CO2 laser treated surface; consequently, the laser treatment significantly lowers the dried mud adhesion on the surface. © 2019 Old City Publishing, Inc.","Cemented carbide cutting tool; CO2 laser; Environmental dust; Fracture toughness; Laser surface treatment; Microhardness; Micropillars; Mud; Nanopillars; Wettability","Adhesion; Carbide cutting tools; Carbide tools; Carbides; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide lasers; Dust; Fracture toughness; Free energy; Microhardness; Nanopillars; Surface treatment; Textures; Water treatment; Wetting; Cemented carbide cutting tools; CO2-laser; Laser surface treatment; Metallurgical changes; Micro-pillars; Surface free energy; Texture characteristics; Water condensation; Cutting tools",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073167042

This study has mainly employed qualitative research approach in which the data were collected from secondary sources and the research method is descriptive because the study has attempted to describe and explore the main contributing factors of internal displacement and its socio-economic, and psychological impacts on the community and internally displaced persons (IDPs). In order to assure the relevance and importance of the collected data, the researchers reviewed related literature on the causes and impacts of internal displacement in Ethiopia, Africa and other parts of the continents. As the method of data analysis, content analysis was applied for this study. This study highlighted that the internal displacement of people in Ethiopia is a severe human tragedy that results in huge numbers of people being displaced every year. The study showed that conflict (i.e., inter-communal violence, regional political instability, ethnic tensions and localized conflicts), climatic induced factors (landslides, flooding, famine and drought) and the country’s policy of resettlement and relocation (development-driven causes), and poor governing capacity of the country were major contributing factors which aggravated the internal displacement in the country. The conflict took the primary percentage and followed by the climate-driven causes and policy of resettlement and relocation. Finally, this study revealed that internal displacement disrupted the social intimacy, economically affected the IDPs and the host communities, led the IDPs into homelessness, brought economic hardship, made them to be more vulnerable to psychological violence and led IDPs into death. © National Association of Social Workers-Zimbabwe/Author(s)","Climate; Conflict; Ethiopia; IDPs; Impacts; Internal displacement; KEY TERMS: Causes; Relocation; Resettlement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093530490

However, although this is crucial, it is not sufficient for optimizing the emitter's molecular and electronic structure for OLED use. Here, we present a design strategy that leads us not only to a new type of emitter but also to a new exciton harvesting mechanism. This concept is realized (i) by drastically reducing the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet energy states, (ii) by rigidifying the molecular structure to reduce inhomogeneity effects that usually induce long emission decay tails lying even in the millisecond time range, (iii) by maximizing the Franck-Condon factors that govern intersystem crossing (ISC), (iv) by shifting the charge transfer states, 1CT and 3CT, to become the lowest energy states applying polarity tuning, and (v) by providing energetically nearby lying states for spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and configuration interaction (CI) paths to speed up ISC. Using this concept, we design an ""almost zero-gap"" compound showing ΔE(1CT-3CT) ≈ 16 cm-1 (2 meV). Thus, thermal activation is no longer a time delaying key problem at T = 300 K. Moreover, if the emitter is applied in an OLED, fast ISC will allow us to harvest all singlet and triplet excitons through emission from the lowest excited CT singlet state. This benchmark mechanism, the direct singlet harvesting (DSH) mechanism, offers the great advantage of a significant reduction of the overall emission decay time to the submicrosecond range. This is a shorter decay than found for TADF emission so far. Accordingly, this mechanism leads us to beyond TADF toward a new era in the design of OLED emitters and opens the way for reducing stability problems and roll-off effects. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Charge transfer; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Excited states; Excitons; Fluorescence; Harvesting; Spin orbit coupling; Charge transfer state; Configuration interactions; Franck-Condon factors; Intersystem crossing; Lowest energy state; Singlet and triplet excitons; Singlet and triplet state; Thermally activated delayed fluorescences; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070863750

During that time, salinity intrusion and drought significantly affected agricultural production in the area. Furthermore, flooding is another recurring event in the area that is increasing in frequency. An assessment conducted by CGIAR Centers showed that even as warnings were provided by the government for the 2016 ENSO, these were not translated into appropriate preparations and responsive actions for agriculture. To address this critical issue, the Department of Crop Production (DCP) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) of Vietnam, and CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security in Southeast Asia (CCAFS-SEA) collaborated to develop and test an participatory approach for mapping climate risks and adaptive interventions (CS-MAP) to recognize climate-related risks, identify potentially affected areas and develop regional and provincial adaptation plans for rice production. The CS-MAP is a participatory approach involving experts from various local and national offices for: (1) identifying climate-related risks; (2) delineating affected areas and risk levels; (3) proposing corresponding adaptive plans; (4) fine tuning and verifying proposed measures; and (5) developing integrated provincial and regional adaptation plans. Risks and adaptive interventions maps were developed for normal and ENSO years by using technical data (i.e. topography and hydrology), infrastructures (i.e. dikes, road and canals), and local observations.

To quantify the effect of climate on the building energy demand and to adequately size the HVAC equipment, the use of design condition (design day) is necessary. The current design day files available for the United States are updated to 2013 and few descriptions regarding the use of future scenarios for design day files are available. In this article, future design day files are developed using weather generators applying the IPCC emissions scenarios. Challenges associated with building current and future design day files and their discrepancies are identified, and a process for addressing the uncertainties is described. The future design day files are implemented into a practice study of DOE large office buildings in Philadelphia to assess the impact of the changing climate on the energy consumption and equipment sizing. The results are compared with outcomes obtained using the ASHRAE 2013 climatic design conditions as the base. Buildings in the city of Philadelphia, on average, are more than 60 years old and most were built before standard building regulations existed and are highly vulnerable to the changing climate. Using the most conservative design day strategy, results show very small reduction in the mean value of boiler capacity and high increase (up to 15 percent) in the mean value of chiller capacity by the end of the century for the cases under examination. This study aims to guide the development of design day files for future climate scenarios and to address a gap in the literature for assessing building energy performance while considering equipment updates in the future using climate design conditions. This is intended to promote improved mitigation strategies towards climate change for buildings. © 2019 ASHRAE.",,"Building codes; Climate change; Energy management; Energy utilization; Office buildings; Building energy demands; Building energy performance; Building regulations; Climatic design conditions; Conservative designs; Future climate scenarios; Ipcc emissions scenarios; Mitigation strategy; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068834274

Considering the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the use of renewable energy sources, the primary source of energy in an autonomous power system can be a wood gas generator. The fuel for such a generator is biomass. The wood gas enters the internal combustion engine, which drives a synchronous generator. The resulting electrical energy is supplied to the consumer. The article presents an experimental plant for generating electric energy on the basis of wood gas, and provides the results of studies in the effect of the used power of the synchronous generator on the gasifier fuel consumption and the amount of gas produced by it. The experimental plant contained a downdraft gasifier, the feature of which is that the combustion and recovery zones have the same diameter. The gasifier was equipped with gas purification filters and a gas cooler. The resulting gas was supplied to the internal combustion engine through a special mixer equipped with the air supply control valve. A synchronous generator was used to convert the mechanical energy of the engine into electrical energy. As the engine and electric generator petrol-electric AC set AB-4-T/400-M1 was taken. The petrol-electric set has a rated power of 4 kW and produces a three-phase current with a voltage of 220 V. During operation of an experimental gas-operated plant, the growth of the consumed electric power by 12 times causes the linear growth of gasoline consumption by 1.59 times and air consumption by 1.63 times. During the operation of the wood gas-operated experimental plant, an increase in electrical power consumption by 9.5 times causes a linear increase in gas consumption by 2.14 times and air consumption by 1.38 times. The cost of the generated electricity when using wood gas is 2.4 times less than when using gasoline. © 2019 Latvia University of Agriculture.

As a new type of clean energy, coalbed methane is mainly in the coal bed in the adsorption state. Therefore, it is very important to study the interaction between methane molecules and coal macromolecules for the exploitation of coalbed methane. Using equipment such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), combined with the results of elemental analysis and industrial analysis, the macromolecular structure model of the Buertai coal sample from Shenmu coal mine area was constructed. The interaction mechanism between coal macromolecules and methane was studied by Materials studio 8.0 (MS). The results show that temperature and pressure have a great influence on the adsorption of methane by coal molecules. With the increase of temperature, the adsorption amount of methane is smaller, while with the increase of pressure, the adsorption amount of methane increases, and finally approaches a critical value. © 2019 36th Annual International Pittsburgh Coal Conference: Clean Coal-Based Energy/Fuels and the Environment, PCC 2019.

A new promising technology in aircraft design is hybrid electric propulsion (HEP) technology, which integrates fuel engines and batteries to improve the energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. The CFJ technology intrinsically employs distributed electric propulsion and is a desirable option for HEP. This paper investigates the potential benefits of Co-Flow jet (CFJ) hybrid electric propulsion (HEP) aircraft through a conceptual design of a regional airliner. The ATR72-500 regional airliner is chosen as a reference. The ATR72-500 aircraft has a range of 890 nm, a payload of 72 passengers and cruise Mach number of 0.46. The mission of the current CFJ hybrid electric regional airliner (CFJ-HERA) is to extend the range of ATR72-500. The CFJ-HERA uses an optimized CFJ wing configuration based on the CFJ6421-SST150-INJ117-SUC247 airfoil. Two different aspect ratios of 12 and 20 are studied for comparison. Both achieve substantially higher productivity efficiency than the baseline ATR72-500 airliner. With the same wing area as that of ATR72-500, the CFJ-HERA-AR12 design achieves a substantially longer range of 1960 nm and CFJ-HERA-AR20 further exceeds the range to 2850 nm. Due to the high lift cruise coefficient of CFJ wing, the CFJ-HERA has a wing loading of 660 kg/m2 and 746 kg/m2 for AR of 12 and 20 respectively. The significantly higher wing loading allows the airliners to carry much more fuel and batteries without increasing the wing size and weight, which results in the substantially longer range.

In the study, the SOC fractions were measured including soil easily oxidizable carbon (SEOC), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), soil water soluble carbon (SWSC), and soil mi-neralizable carbon (SMC) at the Loess Plateau of China by using four biocrusts. The results show that SOC fractions in the biocrust layer were consistently higher than that in the subsoil layers. The average SOC content of moss crust was approximately 1.3–2.0 fold that of three other biocrusts. Moss crusts contain the lowest ratio of SEOC to SOC compared with other biocrusts. The ratio of SMC to SOC was the highest in light cyanobacteria biocrust and the lowest in moss crust, but no difference was observed in SMBC to SOC and SWSC to SOC in biocrust layers among four studied biocrusts. The results show that the moss crusts increase the accumulation of organic carbon into soil and reduce the ratio of SEOC to SOC and SMC to SOC. Together, these findings indicate that moss crusts increase the SOC stability and have important implications that SOC fractions and mineralization amount are good indicators for assessing the SOC stability. © 2019, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The water-saving irrigation is the primary method of local agricultural production. Since chemical fertilizer is the primary emission source of nitrous oxide (N2O), it is appropriate to verify the general influence of water-saving irrigation on N2O. Results of the study, conducted in a potato field as the experimental site for two consecutive years, using two different irrigation systems - namely, furrow (FI) and sprinkling-irrigation (SI) with a mineral N fertilizer (NF) and a control without any fertilizer (Control) are reported. The N2O emission fluxes with NF were higher than those of the control in each irrigation system. On plots where the NF was applied, mean emissions fluxes of N2O was 152.02 µg/(m2 hr) in FI, 36.53µg/(m2 hr) in SI from 2016 to 2017. The reduction of N2O emissions from SI was due to the lower amount of water applied every time and the lower NO3--N and NH4+-N of soil associated with SI. This work showed that SI is a method that helps save water and mitigates emissions of the atmospheric N2O pollutants compared to FI. © 2019, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Emission factor; Fertilization; Greenhouse gas; Moisture; Potato field",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073729829

However, a number of DBSPs have experienced financial crises since 2018. This means that research on DBSPs must be considered not only in terms of the environment and technology, but also in the operation of the program. In this paper, we modeled the DBSP operations in a certain area using a system dynamics simulation approach. The main purpose was to explore the dynamics of the program's operation process and evaluate possible improvement strategies for maximizing the revenue of the overall DBSP. Specifically, the analysis focused on the economic profits of DBSPs in an environment of competition and government regulation. The research findings revealed that the dockless bike-sharing industry has great economic profits, but in the current environment, the market needs to be regulated by the local government. If a DBSP does not introduce new technologies or find new profit channels, it will be difficult to develop sustainably by only relying on riding profits. In addition, we provide a case study of Mobike's operations in Beijing to support these findings and validate the developed model. Finally, we discuss Mobike's possible improvement strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Impact factor; Land classification system; Land Use Functions (LUFs); Production-Living-Ecological Land (PLEL); Sichuan Province","carbon emission; classification; competition (economics); crisis management; environmental technology; factor analysis; local government; model validation; numerical model; operations technology; regulatory approach; traffic congestion; travel behavior; Beijing [China]; China; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063419398

This paper analyzes spatial correlation, influencing factors and regulatory tools of air pollution in 30 provinces on the Chinese mainland from 2006-2015. The results of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) show that SO2 emissions have obvious positive spatial correlations, and atmospheric pollution in China shows obvious spatial overflow effects and spatial agglomeration characteristics. On this basis, the present study analyzes the impact of seven socioeconomical (SE) factors and seven policy tools on air pollution by constructing a STIRPAT model and a spatial econometric model. We found that population pressure, affluence, energy consumption (EC), industrial development level (ID), urbanization level (UL) and the degree of marketization can significantly promote the increase of SO2 emissions, but technology and governmental supervision of the environment have significant inhibitory effects. The reason why China's air pollution is curbed at present is because the government has adopted a large number of powerful command-controlled supervision measures, to a large extent. Air pollution treatment is like a government-led ""political movement"". The effect of the market is relatively weak and public force has not been effectively exerted. In the future, a comprehensive use of a variety of regulation tools is needed, as well as encouraging the public to participate, strengthening the supervision of third parties and building a diversified and all-encompassing supervision mechanism. © 2019 by the authors.","Atmospheric pollution; Influence factors; Regulatory mechanism; Spatial correlation","atmospheric pollution; correlation; development level; emission; empirical analysis; industrial development; pollution policy; spatial data; sulfur dioxide; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063486495

The present study is focused on the concentrations and characteristics of different SOC fractions (e.g., Labile organic carbon, LOC; Recalcitrant organic carbon, ROC; Calcium-bound organic carbon, Ca-SOC; Iron/aluminium-bound organic carbon, Fe/Al-SOC) in forest soils associated with different bedrock lithology under similar climate conditions in the centre of the ‘Classical Karst’, and evaluates influence of the geological environment on SOC. SOC and SOC fraction concentrations decreased with an increase in depth in all profiles, indicating stabilized soil profiles. SOC values (9.7–45.5 g∙kg-1) were consistent with the findings of other studies on soils in the region. ROC and Fe/Al-SOC (51.5–65.8 % and 68.0–73.3 %, respectively) were the major SOC fractions, while Ca-SOC accounted for a considerably lower proportion (6.4–7.4 %) of the SOC contents. Key factors influencing SOC contents were calcite (expressed as calcium oxide) and clay contents, which represent mineral complexes stabilizing SOC. Overall Fe2 O3 and Al2 O3 concentration did not explain differences in SOC nor its fractions, potentially due to the importance of chemical/mineral forms of Fe-and Al-related minerals (reactivity). Soils on carbonate rocks, which are richer in clay and CaO, had 6.35 g∙kg-1 (28 percentage points) higher concentrations of SOC average when compared with soils on siliciclastic rock, due to higher concentrations of stabilized SOC fractions. The results demonstrate that bedrock lithology and pedogenesis are key factors influencing SOM stabilization. © 2019, ZRC SAZU, Zalozba ZRC.

This paper investigates the ethno-ecological knowledge of indigenous people in Taxkorgan regarding the use of ecological cues to conduct seasonal activities that harmonize with climatic variations. Meteorological data from the nearest station was used to understand climatic variations and develop indices. The results revealed that indigenous elders still adopt traditional methods to decide the time of various annual activities observing and using seasonal cues, such as the height and color of grass, the arriving of migratory birds and phenological observations. Moreover, same or diverse indicators were used at settlements located in different elevations. The analysis revealed that the region was recently getting warmer and wetter compared to previous decades, and local perceptions were matched with climatic recordings. Local inhabitants already practiced earlier plantation of crops (e.g., wheat) in recent years. Climatic indices calculated revealed and validated recent weather condition can support earlier plantation of crops. Hence, the strong forecasting system using meteorological evidence to support existing local knowledge on ecological indicators and adjust seasonal calendars can improve indigenous people's abilities to cope with climate risks. Furthermore, this can support in developing adaptation schemes that respond to community needs. The approaches and findings can be used to facilitate the management of these natural resource based on the adaptive framework and to create data that can be tested in subsequent studies. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Farming-decision; Indigenous people; Seasonal variation; Taxkorgan; Traditional ecological knowledge; Transhumance-decision","adaptation; bird; climate change; environmental indicator; environmental risk; grass; indigenous population; migratory species; natural resource; phenology; seasonal variation; traditional knowledge; China; Taxkorgan; Xinjiang Uygur; Aves; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069804040

Spatially-explicit operation conditions, such as travel demand and ambient temperature, can heavily affect the operation process of EVs and further influence the energy consumption and GHG emissions from EVs. However, the battery degradation of EVs, which are highly sensitive to operation conditions, is usually ignored in existing spatially-explicit EV analyses. Therefore, in order to investigate the impacts of battery degradation on the energy consumption and GHG emissions from EVs in the United States, this analysis applies the state-level operation condition to the EV energy operation model by considering the battery degradation effect on mid-size EVs with a 24 kWh lithium ion manganese oxide (LMO) battery pack. We found that the unit energy consumption and GHG emission growth, owing to a 10-year battery degradation, range from 29.2 Wh/km in Alaska to 127.4 Wh/km in Mississippi, and 0.2 g CO2/km in Vermont to 56.9 g CO2/km in Indiana, respectively. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the processes of litter C mineralization and storage in different aggregates-size classes are poorly understood, especially in the highly alkaline soils of north China. Here, we ask how four different aggregate sizes influence rates of C release (Cr) and SOC storage (Cs) in response to three types of plant litter added to an un-grazed natural grassland. Methods: Highly alkaline soil samples were separated into four dry aggregate classes of different sizes (2-4, 1-2, 0.25-1, and &lt;0.25 mm). Three types of dry dead plant litter (leaf, stem, and all standing dead aboveground litter) of Leymus chinensis were added to each of the four aggregate class samples. Litter mass loss rate, Cr, and Cs were measured periodically during the 56-day incubation. Results: The results showed that the mass loss in 1-2 mm aggregates was significantly greater than that in other size classes of soil aggregates on both day 28 and day 56. Macro-aggregates (1-2 mm) had the highest Cr of all treatments, whereas 0.25-1 mm aggregates had the lowest. In addition, a significant negative relationship was found between Cs/Cr and soil pH. After incubation for 28 and 56 days, the Cs was also highest in the 1-2 mm aggregates, which implied that the macro-aggregates had not only a higher CO2 release capacity, but also a greater litter C storage capacity than the micro-aggregates in the highly alkaline soils of north China. © Copyright 2019 Yang et al.","Litter decomposition; Litter quality; Soil aggregate-size classes; Soil pH","distilled water; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; unclassified drug; air temperature; Article; carbon storage; chemical composition; controlled study; correlation analysis; grassland; growing season; litter decomposition; litter size; microbial community; microcosm; soil acidity; soil aggregation; soil respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074284668

Combined with the characteristics of surface natural environment in the Fuling shale gas field and the features of shale gas development engineering, the main environmental issues encountered in the development of the Fuling shale gas field were analyzed. Studies on intensive land use, water conservation and protection, harmless use and disposal of oil-based drill cuttings, recycling of wastewater from drilling and fracturing, and green environment management mode for shale gas development were conducted, and the green development technology system suitable for the Fuling shale gas field was established. Field applications showed that, after applying the green development technology, the land occupation was reduced by 62.l%, the recycling rate of drilling and fracturing wastewater was up to 100%, the oil content of treated oil-based drill cuttings was less than 0.3%, and carbon dioxide emission was reduced by 64.47 · 104 t (1.41 · 109 lb). Thus, the goal of zero contamination was realized during shale gas field development.

The increasing demand for food production has resulted in the use of large quantities of chemical fertilizers. This has created major environmental problems, such as increased ammonia volatilization, N2O emission, and nitrogen (N) leaching from agricultural soil. In particular, the utilization rate of N fertilizer is low in subtropical southern parts of China due to high rainfall. This causes not only large financial losses in agriculture, but also serious environmental pollution. Methods. In this study, 16S rDNA-based analysis and static-chamber gas chromatog- raphy were used to elucidate the effects of continuous straw biochar application on the N pool and bacteria environment in two typical soil types, purple and paddy soils, in southern China. Results. Straw biochar application (1) improved the soilNpool in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils; (2) significantly reduced the emission ofN2O, with no difference in emission between 1 and 2 years of application; (3) increased the abundance of N- processing bacteria in the soil and altered the bacterial community structure; and (4) improved the tobacco yield and N use efficiency in paddy soil.

By analyzing the chemical reactions in an autothermal gasifier, it is revealed that in oxidation area almost all biomass is converted to Cl gas (CO, CO2 and CH4), in reduction area the composition of the producer gas becomes equilibrated and the efficiency of the gasification reaches 87%. By examining an allothermal downdraft gasifier using a Pt/AhO3 catalyst, it is indicated that the apparent activation energy can be evaluated by measuring the conversion rate of biomass to Cl gas, instead of measuring its thermogravity. From the analysis, the activation energy of gasification using Pt catalyst supplied by air and steam varies from 11 to 36 kJ-mol'1. The reaction processes involved in the decomposition and reformation of tar are found to be rate-limiting, and in steam gasification, activation loss of adsorption and dehydrogenation of H2O on the catalyst surface is large. Above 750°C, the compositions of the producer gases are close to equilibrium state in all conditions. From the sequential study of the allothermal gasifier and an SOFC, we demonstrate that the maximum power output supplied by the producer gas can be controlled to 40-75% of that using hydrogen. In addition, the current-voltage characteristics can be modeled based on electrochemical kinetics by assuming CO to be H2 in the producer gas. © 2019, American Ceramic Society.

For that purpose, walkability is one of the key performance indicators expressing the environmental quality of a district. As the first step for creating a low-carbon smart community, this study attempts to evaluate the influence of walkability on traffic behavior of people by using mobile GPS data. Specifically, we statistically analyze the relationship between various walkability indices (centrality, betweenness, angularity, etc.) evaluated by road network data, and pedestrian movement estimated by mobile GPS data in the six main wards in Tokyo, Japan. The result suggests the usefulness of our approach for low-carbon smart community design rousing people's walking activity. The walkability results and data are then compared to the results of a macrosimulation traffic model for the Sumida Ward of Tokyo to understand the impact that walkability may have on emissions if built environment conditions are improved in favor of a lesser automobile mode share. © 2019 The Authors.

However, due to the sprawl of urbanization, many residential areas have been developed around the landfill areas. Therefore, the environmental and hazardous issues such as landfill gas, leachate and foul odour have risen up. As the greenspaces have recently decreased, Malaysia government in 2010 suggested that the ex-landfill areas which are part of the brownfields should be turned into valuable urban greenspaces. This study thus reviews the management practices of closed landfill to become a sustainable greenspace. A case study was carried out at the Worldwide Landfills Park Air Hitam Puchong, Selangor Malaysia. It is the first ex-landfill in Klang Valley Malaysia developed as a park. Two research methods were adopted for this study, namely key informant approach and secondary data analysis. The result indicated that the safe closure and post-closure management including leachate management and landfill gas management using the gas collection system have successfully rehabilitated the site into a park. A reduction of CO2e using landfill gas collector and natural absorber i.e. vegetation is also discussed in this review. © 2019, Alam Cipta.","Ex-landfill; Landscape management; Sustainable planning; Urban greenspace",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068798377

It was also committed that the parties would continue with all-out endeavor to limit warming to 1.5 °C. For a country like India with a primarily agrarian economy this leads to two key questions. Firstly, what does the global rise of mean annual temperature (1.5 °C and 2.0 °C) mean at the regional scale? Secondly, what are the implications of keeping warming at or below 1.5 °C for different sectors and in particular on agriculture and water resources? To address these questions we have examined the annual and seasonal impacts of 1.5 °C and 2 °C global temperature rise (GTR) on temperature and rainfall change over all the states of India under two Representative concentration pathways, RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, using all Coupled Model Inter Comparison Project CMIP5 Models. Rainfall is projected to increase over all the states with very low change in the western part of the country and highest change in the North eastern and southern region of the country under RCP 8.5. 35% of the country is projected to witness a temperature change equal to or lesser than global mean temperature of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C whereas 65% is expected to show a greater rise in temperature. The most severe temperature change is expected to be witnessed by the presently colder Northern most states of India such as Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal (2.0 °C to 2.2 °C at 1.5 °C and 2.5 °C to 2.8 °C at 2.0 °C) in both RCPs. There are opportunities and threats due to climate change and it is imperative for researchers and policy makers to recognize these in the context of the scenarios of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C global temperature changes. It is essential for the current national and state action plan on climate change and adaptation to be more sensitive in strategizing an efficient response to the different scenarios at the global level (3 °C, 2 °C and 1.5 °C) in order to take more informed policy decisions at global level in synergy with the regional analysis to be able to develop strategies that benefit the local populace. © 2019 The Author(s).

At a minimum, three steps are involved: phloem loading in source organs, transport along the phloem path, and phloem unloading in sink organs. Each of these can have variable rates contingent on the physiological state of the plant, and thereby influence the overall transport rate. In addition to these phloem transport steps, rates of photosynthesis and photosynthate movement in the pre-phloem path, as well as photosynthate utilization in post phloem tissues of sink organs also contribute to phloem transport. The protocol described here estimates carbon allocation along the entire path from initial carbon fixation to delivery to sink organs after a labeling pulse: [14C]CO2 is photoassimilated in source leaves and loading and transport of the 14C label to heterotrophic sink organs (roots) is quantified by scintillation counting.

This study applies the parameterized quadratic directional output distance function to estimate the technical inefficiency, abatement potential and shadow price of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in China's secondary industry during 2001-2015. The CO2 emissions performances in 3 major regions show significant differences and regional characteristics. The developed eastern region has the highest CO2 emissions and abatement potential but the lowest values in terms of CO2 intensity, technical efficiency and shadow price. The indicators of the developing central region are in the mid-level position, and in the undeveloped western region, CO2 emissions reduction via efficiency improvement is limited, and abatement will incur huge economic costs. Emissions reduction targets and control policies designed at regional levels are necessary. The provinces with relatively low shadow prices should be assigned higher CO2 emissions reduction targets, while those with high shadow prices should have lower reduction targets. Meanwhile, the differentiated shadow prices make it feasible for China to establish a crossregional unified emissions trading market to further the cooperation between provinces. © Inter-Research 2019.","CO2 emissions reduction; Directional distance function; Secondary industry; Shadow price; Technical inefficiency","abatement cost; carbon emission; coal combustion; emission control; emissions trading; industrial emission; pollution policy; secondary sector industry; shadow pricing; technical efficiency; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075516607

In this paper, we report a new aspect of PEO in assisting the energy funneling in formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) thin films, leading to a very high photoluminescence quantum yield of ∼62.1%. By mixing PEO with FAPbBr3 at a desired ratio, self-assembled 3D polycrystals with sizes from ∼20 to ∼1500 nm were formed. The polycrystals contain inhomogeneous domains with a range of energetic excited states. Through fluorescence lifetime image microscopy, the in situ fluorescence emissions and the lifetimes of the domains were measured simultaneously, indicating energy funneling from the wide-bandgap domains (with small-size grains) into the narrow-bandgap domains (with large-size grains). PL spectroscopy on the nano-second scale was used to study the dynamics of charge transfer, which shows a reduced short-wavelength emission and narrowed full width at half maximum with increasing time.

It is commonly doubted whether the evaporative cooling technology is suitable for the humid climate as well as the public's care about the water consumption for cooling. This paper provids a feasibility study for the use of a DPC (dew point air cooler) in Beijing, a representative city in warm and humid climate. The overall analyses include an hourly cooling performance analysis in a typical cooling day, annual energy performance prediction and economic analysis based on an experimentally validated simulation tool. With detailed analyses of the real weather data all year round, it is found the outdoor air must be dehumidified to meet the humidity requirement in most of the cooling hours for any air conditioning means. Thus, the superiority of evaporative cooling would be prominent comparing to the conventional mechanical cooling. The water consumption is little especially considering the fact that the conventional power generation consumes large quantity of water and the DPC saves large sales of power. The results proved the feasibility for the DPC applied in Beijing. The success in application of the proposed DPC in the warm and humid region promises more opportunities of the dew point cooling technology. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Even though reduced NOx emission is reported in pulverized coal MILD combustion, its performance is not as comparable as that of gaseous and liquid fuels. In order to investigate the possibility of further reducing NOx emission in a MILD coal combustion furnace, horizontal fuel-rich/lean burner as another promising technology aiming to regulate NOx emission is employed in this study. Results have shown that fuel-rich/lean burner is able to further reduce NOx emission by about 4% when applied to a MILD coal combustion furnace. This is due to the combined effect of the reduction of thermal- and fuel-NO formation. Particles entrained in the fuel-rich stream is heated in a reducing atmosphere, so that the oxidation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH3) released by volatile is hindered. Moreover, the NO released by char is reduced to molecular nitrogen. Thermal-NO is reduced because of the low local peak temperature in both streams. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The existing researches lack the analysis based on the actual PHEV driving data, which leads to inaccurate calculation results. This paper aims to accurately assess the carbon emission levels of PHEVs in typical mega cities in China and to analyze the potential for carbon reduction under different driving patterns. This study investigated the carbon emission levels of PHEV vehicles with different driving range and charging frequency from the perspective of the automotive energy production and use processes. Study is based on the characteristics of Shanghai’s 50 PHEV70 and cumulative mileage of 130,000Â km, and the carbon emission levels of PHEV, HEV and ICE are compared. As for the method, distribution of driving range and battery state of charge (SOC) was achieved by cleaning and cutting the PHEV monitoring big data. Based on this, electric drive ratio was calculated. Combining the carbon emission levels of electricity and gasoline in the energy production to the use, the carbon emission levels of different driving frequency and electric vehicle driven mileage and oil-driven mileage at different charging frequencies can be calculated during the energy production of PHEV vehicles of different driving ranges. Carbon emissions of PHEV vehicles with different driving ranges at different charging frequencies can be derived combining the carbon emissions of electricity and gasoline from energy production to use. The result shows that the average carbon emissions of PHEV70 vehicles in Shanghai are 155Â g/km, including 71Â g/km for electric distance and 84Â g/km fuel distance, which is 5% and 16% lower than those of HEV and ICE respectively. PHEV carbon emissions decreases with the increase of charging frequency and driving range, the carbon emission of charging more than once a day can be improved by 4.0% over the average charging frequency. Considering carbon emission and marginal revenue comprehensively, the optimal driving range of PHEV is 100Â km, which is 4% lower than that of PHEV50. Therefore, increasing the PHEV driving range to 100Â km is possible to achieve emission reduction level similar to that provided by the carbon effect of increasing the charging frequency. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon emission; PHEV; Travel pattern","Battery management systems; Carbon; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Gasoline; Intelligent systems; Modal analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery state of charge; Calculation results; Carbon emissions; Driving frequencies; Emission reduction; Energy productions; PHEV; Travel patterns; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064566318

Limited information is available on the spatiotemporal variation, sources, and health risks of VOCs in the coastal areas of Canada. In this study, we investigated ambient VOCs levels and associated health risks in two cities (i.e., Port Moody &amp; Burnaby) of Metro Vancouver for the period 2012-2016. Levels of total measured VOCs were relatively higher at Port Moody (5-year average: 56.66 µg/m3) than Burnaby south (38.04 µg/m3). A clear seasonality was observed for VOCs species with significantly higher levels in winter than in summer except for isoprene. Alkanes were the most dominant compounds at both sites accounting for 42.8%-59.4% of total measured VOCs, followed by halocarbons (18.1%-37.2%) and aromatics (11.5%-13.2%). The non-cancer and cancer risks of toxic VOCs were evaluated using a point-estimate approach. Non-cancer risk of ambient VOCs exposure was of less concern, while the excess lifetime cancer risk of toxic VOCs exposure was of the most concern for residents living in these two cities. The integrated cancer risks were estimated to be 1.4×10-4 in Port Moody and 1.1×10-4 in Burnaby south, which largely exceeded British Columbia's provincial acceptable cancer risk level (1.0×10-5). The integrated cancer risks at both sites were even greater than the tolerable cancer risk level (1×10-4). Carbon tetrachloride exhibited the largest cancer risk of 4.8×10-5 and 4.9×10-5 in Port Moody and Burnaby south, respectively. From a risk management perspective, greater emphasis on the reduction of emissions of carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene is recommended in both cities in Metro Vancouver. © 2019 Cornerstone","Cancer risk; Metro Vancouver; VOCs",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076014057

Accordingly, in this article, a nested combination experiment for the photosynthetic rate of cucumbers is presented. In order to obtain a continuous carbon dioxide response curve, the photosynthetic rate prediction model is established using the cucumber experimental data based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The network of the support vector machine photosynthetic rate prediction model is used as an optimal objective function and the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm (IAFSA) is employed to search for the saturation of CO2 in a multidimensional nesting condition. Further, the optimal CO2 regulation model based on multifactor coupling is established using the results of the above-mentioned experiments. Moreover, XOR verification of the proposed model showed that the maximal relative error of the proposed optimal CO2 regulation model is 3.898%. Consequently, using a wireless sensor network platform, a multi-sensor fusion-based CO2 control system is realized and verified. The verification showed that the average relative error between the target CO2 value and the actual CO2 value is 2.88%. At the same time, the average photosynthetic rate (Pn) of the crop increased by 26.94% compared to the contrasting region, which proves that the proposed system can achieve a stable and reliable operation, greatly improving the efficiency of the environment of the facility. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","CO2 control system; Optimal CO2 regulation model; Photosynthetic rate; Verification","Artificial photosynthesis; Control systems; Couplings; Support vector machines; Verification; Wireless sensor networks; Average relative error; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Co2 regulations; Environmental factors; Improved artificial fish swarm algorithms; Objective functions; Photosynthetic rate; Support vector machine algorithm; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071846063

In addition, a reduction allocation plan of PM2.5 concentration by 2020 in 13 cities was determined according to a minimized model of Gini coefficient model. The results showed that: (1) Gini coefficients of industrial development and technological level were greater than 0.4, implying that the PM2.5 pollution emissions in the region were significantly unfair from the perspective of industry and technology, especially in the aspect of technological level. (2) The spatial distribution of industrial and technological contribution coefficients presented a downward trend from Beijing and Tianjin to the periphery, and cities in Hebei Province were central to the unfairness of PM2.5 pollution emissions across the whole region. (3) The reduction values of PM2.5 concentration were between 16.7 1μg/m3 and 57.49 μg/m3, and a reduction allocation plan of PM2.5 concentration could improve the overall fairness of PM2.5 pollution emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin- Hebei region, but the unfairness of PM2.5 pollution emissions would not change dramatically. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

Here, three novel orange-yellow to near-infrared (NIR) emitters based on 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTDF) namely BTDF-TPA, BTDF-TTPA, and BTDF-TtTPA were designed and synthesized. Density functional theory analysis and photophysical characterization reveal that these three materials possess hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) state feature and a feasible reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from the high-lying triplet state to the singlet state may conduce to an exciton utilization exceeding the limit of 25% of traditional fluorescence materials under electrical excitation. The insertion of thiophene with small steric hindrance as π-bridge between the electron-donating (D) moiety triphenylamine (TPA) and the electron-accepting (A) moiety BTDF not only results in a remarkable 67 nm red-shift of the emission peak but also brings about a large overlap of frontier molecular orbitals to guarantee high radiative transition rate that is of great significance to obtain high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the ""energy-gap law"" dominated long-wavelength emission region. Consequently, an attractive high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.75% was achieved for the doped devices based on these thiophene π-bridged emitters, giving a deep-red emission with small efficiency roll-off. Remarkably, NIR emission could be obtained for the non-doped devices, achieving an excellent maximum EQE of 1.44% and Commission Internationale de l'éclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.71, 0.29). These results are among the highest efficiencies in the reported deep-red to NIR fluorescent OLEDs and offer a new π-bridge design strategy in D-π-A and D-π-A-π-D red emitter design. © 2019 Xie, Li, Cai, Li, Qiao, Tang, Liu, Gu, Ma and Su.","Deep-red to near-infrared (NIR) emission; Donor-acceptor chromophores; Hot-exciton; Hybridized local and charge-transfer state (HLCT); Organic light-emitting diodes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064596976

It has a strong negative impact on human health. Since the costs of damage to health are not born by the pollution producers, these costs translate to social externality. Policies have an important role in optimizing resource allocation, such as penalizing the pollutant producers and incentivizing clean energy development. Among others, replacing coal with natural gas for heating represents an important example of air quality improvement measures. This paper presents a study that evaluates the health impacts from air pollution and the external cost of the ""Coal-To-Gas"" policy in district heating using Changping District (Beijing, China) as an example. Four scenarios were considered based on the historical and standard PM2.5 concentration. Results show that PM2.5 is responsible for causing an increase of 40% premature deaths in 2015 and that the monetary value of damage to health is higher than 1.2 billion CNY. In 2016 and 2017, the reported air quality was better than that in 2015. As a result, 13.3% and 26% premature deaths caused by air pollution were avoided in 2016 and 2017 compared to 2015 respectively. If the PM2.5 concentration level were to be reduced to national standard, the number of premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 could further decrease to 47.7% compared to 2015. Overall, the Coal-To-Gas policy in district heating reduces 0.017%~0.45% of premature death caused by air pollution each year. Air pollution reduction policies, which are expected to improve air quality together in the future, and the specific policy of Coal-To-Gas in district heating, could make great contribution to reducing the premature death caused by environmental problem and need more attention from the government and the public. © 2019 The Authors.

However, cities present different development stages and characteristics. Different from previous studies on dividing development stages by a single economic-index, this study develops an economic development stage framework by incorporating carbon emission characteristics with associating to Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), and analyze the performance of characteristics impact on carbon emission in different stages. The Kaya Identity is adopted to decompose emission characteristics into energy structure (ES), energy intensity (EI), economic output (EO), industrial structure (IS) and population scale (P). Results show that these five emission characteristics have different performances in different development stages, simply imitating or copying existing experience of low-carbon city (LCC) will not be effective. The findings not only provide decision-makers with scientific basis for taking effective measures to reduce carbon emission, but also provide cities internationally a new approach for establishing LCC through focusing on different development stages. © Advancement of Construction Management and Real Estate, CRIOCM 2017.All right reserved.","Development stage; Emission characteristics; Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC); Kaya Identity; Low carbon city","Decision making; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental management; Project management; Development stages; Emission characteristics; Environmental Kuznets curves; Kaya Identity; Low-carbon cities; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069851452

The fireplace is an important vehicle in the traditional living and communication space of the Wa people. However, an untreated traditional fireplace will bring about serious indoor air pollution. Most newly built dwellings adopted the design of a separate kitchen or do not have a fireplace installed in the room, creating many new problems such as high indoor humidity in the summer living space and a cold climate during the winter. Based on natural ventilation supplemented by thermal pressure ventilation, this study analyzed the indoor thermal environmental characteristics when a fireplace is installed at different heights in different areas of a house.

Soil microbial communities and their associated enzyme activities play key roles in carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil microbial communities are sensitive to resource availability, but the mechanisms of microbial regulation have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we tested the mechanistic relationships between microbial responses and multiple interacting resources. Methods. We examined soil carbon properties, soil microbial community structure and carbon-related functions under nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal (litter removal (NL), root trench and litter removal (NRL)) in a pure Larix principisrupprechtii plantation in northern China. Results. We found that nitrogen addition affected the soil microbial community structure, and that microbial biomass increased significantly once 100 kg ha-1 a-1 of nitrogen was added. The interactions between nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal significantly affected soil bacteria and their enzymatic activities (oxidases). The NL treatment enhanced soil microbial biomass under nitrogen addition. We also found that the biomass of gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi directly affected the soil microbial functions related to carbon turnover. The biomass of gram-negative bacteria and peroxidase activity were key factors controlling soil carbon dynamics. The interactions between nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal strengthened the correlation between the hydrolases and soil carbon. Conclusions. This study showed that nitrogen addition and plant inputs removal could alter soil enzyme activities and further affect soil carbon turnover via microbial regulation. The increase in soil microbial biomass and the microbial regulation of soil carbon both need to be considered when developing effective sustainable forest management practices for northern China. Moreover, further studies are also needed to exactly understand how the complex interaction between the plant and below-ground processes affects the soil microbial community structure. © 2019 Wu et al.","Nitrogen addition; Plant inputs removal; Regulation; Soil carbon properties; Soil enzyme; Soil microorganisms","carbon; hydrolase; nitrogen; oxidoreductase; peroxidase; Article; carbon dynamics; China; community structure; controlled study; enzyme activity; fungus; Gram negative bacterium; Larix; Larix principisrupprechtii; microbial biomass; nonhuman; plant litter; plant root; plantation; saprotroph; soil microflora; soil property; turnover rate; waste component removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074151308

Forest thinning is likely to change the soil properties and feedbacks on the structure and function of microbial communities, consequently affecting microbial regulation on the soil carbon process. However, few studies have focused on the mechanism of how thinning affects the quantity and stability of soil carbon. To reveal the influence of thinning on soil carbon and to explore the regulated key factors, this study was conducted in a pure Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr plantation with different thinning intensity (light, medium, and high) in Shanxi province, China. Soil properties (soil pH, soil water content, soil organic carbon, and soil microbial biomass carbon) were measured. Meanwhile, soil microbial communities were examined with the method of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and soil enzyme activities were measured as indicators of soil microbial functions. The results showed that medium and high thinning has positive effects on soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial abundance, and soil enzyme activities. Actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria were the major factors to affect soil microbial community function relating to carbon decomposition. Soil pH contributed to actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria through direct influences on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Moreover, there were strong correlations between soil pH and microbial community to control soil carbon turnover. The increasing of soil microbial abundance and the microbial regulation on soil carbon in forest thinning need to be considered for sustainable forest management practices in northern China. © 2019 by the authors.","PLFA; Soil carbon properties; Soil enzyme activities; Soil microorganisms; Structural equation modeling","Bacteria; Enzymes; Fatty acids; Forestry; Fungi; Phospholipids; Soil moisture; PLFA; Soil carbon; Soil enzyme activity; Soil micro-organisms; Structural equation modeling; Organic carbon; community structure; enzyme activity; equation; fatty acid; forest management; forest soil; management practice; microbial community; numerical model; pH; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil property; thinning; Bacteria; Enzymes; Fatty Acids; Forestry; Fungi; Lipids; China; Actinobacteria (class); Fungi; Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii; Negibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065884145

To help to address this literature gap, we conducted a study to explore the associations in Chinese children. Between 2012 and 2013, we recruited 9354 children, aged 5 to 17 years, from 62 schools in 7 northeastern Chinese cities. We measured their BP with a mercury sphygmomanometer. We used a spatiotemporal model to estimate daily ambient PM1 and PM2.5 exposures, which we assigned to participants’ home addresses. Associations between particulate matter exposure and BP were evaluated with generalized linear mixed regression models. The findings indicated that exposure to each 10 mg/m3 greater PM1 was significantly associated with 2.56 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.47–3.65) higher systolic BP and 61% greater odds for hypertension (odds ratio=1.61 [95% CI, 1.18–2.18]). PM1 appears to play an important role in associations reported between PM2.5 exposure and BP, and we found that the ambient PM1/PM2.5 ratio (range, 0.80–0.96) was associated with BP and with hypertension. Age and body weight modified associations between air pollutants and BP (P&lt;0.01), with stronger associations among younger (aged ≤11 years) and overweight/obese children. This study provides the first evidence that long-term exposure to PM1 is associated with hypertension in children, and that PM1 might be a leading contributor to the hypertensive effect of PM2.5.

Large uncertainties exist in observations from L15, Y15, and CALIPSO level 3 products and have significant impacts on the model evaluation of dust spatial distributions. We also assess dust surface concentrations and 10-m wind speed with meteorological records from weather stations in the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts during dust events.

Nevertheless, it is still unclear how to develop a refined semantic segmentation model in an efficient and elegant way. In this paper, we propose attention dilation-LinkNet (AD-LinkNet) neural network that adopts encoder-decoder structure, serial-parallel combination dilated convolution, channel-wise attention mechanism, and pretrained encoder for semantic segmentation. Serial-parallel combination dilated convolution enlarges receptive field as well as assemble multi-scale features for multi-scale objects, such as long-span road and small pool.

Four treatments were established: Urea (U); pig manure (PM); PM and urea (PM + U); PM and stabilized nitrogen fertilizer (urea plus 1% NBPT (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide), 1% PPD (phenylphosphorodiamidate) and 2% DMPP (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate)) (PM + U + I). In this study, compared with PM, PM + U significantly increased cumulative N2O emission, but PM +U + I showed no significant difference from PM on N2O cumulative emission, indicating that stabilized nitrogen fertilizer combined with PM is effective at reducing N2O emissions. The cumulative emission of CH4 from PM + U + I treatment was significantly lower than that from PM and PM + U, indicating that stabilized nitrogen fertilizer combined with PM can effectively reduce CH4 emissions as well. The yields of PM + U and PM + U + I were not significantly different from those of U and PM, indicating that local conventional nitrogen application and returns of PM can provide sufficient nitrogen for rice growth. For yield-scaled emissions (YSE), PM was the highest, while PM + U + I significantly decreased YSE. Concomitant application of stabilized nitrogen fertilizer can achieve the goal of reducing YSE when PM is returned to the field. © 2019, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

We report that increasing and extending expression of a maize MADS-box transcription factor gene, zmm28, under the control of a moderate-constitutive maize promoter, results in maize plants with increased plant growth, photosynthesis capacity, and nitrogen utilization. Molecular and biochemical characterization of zmm28 transgenic plants demonstrated that their enhanced agronomic traits are associated with elevated plant carbon assimilation, nitrogen utilization, and plant growth. Overall, these positive attributes are associated with a significant increase in grain yield relative to wild-type controls that is consistent across years, environments, and elite germplasm backgrounds.ment, formation of dehiscence zones, and fruit ripening, as well as embryo, leaf, and root development (14–20). Plant MADS-box genes also play important roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (21–23). In addition, some root-expressed MADS-box genes regulate genes involved in lateral root growth and development in response to nitrogen and other nutrient deficiencies (24, 25). Since MADS-box transcription factors can regulate the pathways involved in plant growth and development, they represent an important class of candidates for improving crop yield. However, there has not been a published example of field yield increase in any cereal crop through increased expression of a MADS-box transcription factor. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Results show that such atmospheric thermal adaptation depends critically on the vertical distribution of diabatic heating. Data diagnosis shows that in summer over the Tibetan Plateau, although the column-integrated convective condensation heating overwhelms diffusive sensible heating, it is the sensible heating that determines the vertical profile of the total diabatic heating over the Tibetan Plateau and forces the prominent and unique atmospheric circulation patterns over the plateau and the surrounding area. The strong near-surface diabatic heating over the Tibetan Plateau increases the lower layer convergence and the concavity of isentropic surfaces that intersect the plateau. Such heating, in combination with surface friction, makes the Tibetan Plateau region a strong source of negative vorticity in the atmosphere. The sensible heating-induced ascent along the lateral boundaries of the Tibetan Plateau draws in the surrounding air in the lower troposphere and pumps the air out of the region into the upper troposphere. Results obtained from numerical experiments reveal the effectiveness of such a sensible heat-driven air pump (SHAP). The SHAP not only regulates the climate in the surrounding area but also affects the circulation anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere in the form of the Rossby wave rays. © 2004 World Scientific Publishing Co.

Specifically investigated are mission range, fuel burn, and carbon dioxide emissions from fuel and battery sources. Accompanying the results from the hybrid-electric aircraft simulation is an investigation into the national aviation market, aimed at understanding the viability of missions with short ranges, those being most likely for hybrid-electric aircraft. Within the hybrid-electric simulation, a wide variety of current, near-future, and far-future battery technologies were tested, for a range of hybrid-electric configurations with increasing motor size and power. While the hybrid case with the lowest level of hybridization showed the greatest promise in terms of range capability, this configuration had drawbacks associated with fuel burn and emissions. Increases in BSED predicted for 2030-2040 would allow for the implementation of hybrid-electric regional jet transports that could meet up to 75% of the market demand. Increases in battery technology up to and exceeding the 2030 timeframe also demonstrated the capacity to reduce emissions compared to the conventional aircraft counterparts. © 2019 by American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The first, of course, is to cause less harm by reducing our carbon footprint and ceasing to do destructive things like polluting, dredging, severing sediment supply, withdrawing groundwater, overdeveloping etc. Much has been written and spoken about this even though we have said relatively little about it in this book. The second category of actions, which has received minimal attention from the popular media but has been the motivating theme of this book, involves promoting deep enough understanding of the myriad complex interconnections of coastal processes to allow long-term predictions of what may lie ahead. Such predictions are essential to evolving effective strategies for adapting and remaining resilient. The third action is to ensure that to the extent possible we embed coastal science, including matters related to future impacts of climate change, into state and federal policies and law.

Using data from three case studies, we highlight the ways that industrial development and CCMA initiatives are intertwined in both policy and project creation, and how this confluence is creating potentials for maladaptive outcomes. Each case study involves partnerships between international institutions and the national government, each deploys CCMA as either a primary or supporting legitimation, and each failed to adhere to institutional and/or internationally recognized standards of justice. In Cambodia, mismanaged projects are typically blamed on the kleptocratic and patrimonial governance system. We show how such blame obscures the collusion of international partners, who also sidestep their own safeguards, and ignores the potential for maladaptation at the project level and the adverse social and environmental impacts of the policies themselves. Key policy insights Initiatives to mitigate or adapt to climate change look very much like the development projects that caused climate change: Extreme caution must be exercised to ensure policies and projects do not exacerbate the conditions driving climate change. Safeguards ‘on paper’ are insufficient to avoid negative impacts and strict accountability mechanisms must be put in place. Academic researchers can be part of that accountability mechanism through case study reports, policy briefs, technical facilitation to help ensure community needs are met and safeguards are executed as written. Impacts beyond the project scale must be assessed to avoid negative consequences for social and ecological systems at the landscape level. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Even with aggressive treatment consisting of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy, response rates remain poor. In an attempt to improve outcomes, investigators have developed nanoliposomes loaded with 186Re, which are capable of delivering a large dose (&lt; 1000 Gy) of highly localized β- radiation to the tumor, with minimal exposure to healthy brain tissue. Additionally, 186Re also emits gamma radiation (137 keV) so that it's spatio-temporal distribution can be tracked through single photon emission computed tomography. Planning the delivery of these particles is challenging, especially in cases where the tumor borders the ventricles or previous resection cavities. To address this issue, we are developing a finite element model of convection enhanced delivery for nanoliposome carriers of radiotherapeutics. The model is patient specific, informed by each individual's own diffusion-weighted and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data. The model is then calibrated to single photon emission computed tomography data, acquired at multiple time points mid- and post-infusion, and validation is performed by comparing model predictions to imaging measurements obtained at future time points. After initial calibration to a one SPECT image, the model is capable of recapitulating the distribution volume of RNL with a DICE coefficient of 0.88 and a PCC of 0.80. We also demonstrate evidence of restricted flow due to large nanoparticle size in comparison to interstitial pore size. © SPIE.

It suggests that PVPs are able to enhance farmers’ adaptive capacity by raising agricultural productivity and their incomes. They also help mitigate climate change by reducing CO2 emissions. The distribution of the benefits and costs, brought by PVPs, is, however, so uncertain that requires further scrutiny. PVPs are successful in rising energy-water efficiency, but the environmental trade-offs with the underground water depletion and e-wastes requires solutions. Using PVPs to achieve gender equalities may only be materialised if the structural discrimination against women in land ownership and access to resources is challenged, along with the interventions of PVPs in rural communities. This book chapter recommends more in-depth and longitudinal studies to explore the complex and long-term implications of PVPs. More evidence is also needed to assess the effectiveness of governance reforms in access of PVPs in poor communities. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068522122

To get the system ready for data acquisition and saving the data, it became necessary the construction of an electronically arrangement that understands; Open Source code, diverse types of electronic sensors and a free hardware device named “Arduino Uno board”. The prototype of a green panel in which we installed the electronic system with sensors that recorded the changes in an automatic way, then they were sent to a computer connected to the system with an USB wire for capturing data in Microsoft Excel, with an interval defined by Open Source Code, constructing a database, after 44 days of monitoring, for processing the data we occupied the software “R studio” of Open Source for continuing the study with a statistical analysis giving the central tendency measures, graphs, histograms, density curves and proving the correlation between variables with correlation coefficient (R) obtained by “Pearson” methodology. The study of time series and for developing linear and non-linear equations were done with the least squares’ methodology and GARCH method, running a simple regression, that included: logarithmic terms, quadratic terms, first differences, “dummies” and constants, in this case the statistical suites of choice were primarily E views, secondarily Minitab, SPSS, SAS and STATA. At the end of the regression, the results were in favor for the implementation of green panels in buildings, because they can bring several benefits to the environment. The conclusion was that the experiment generated atmospheric conditions that reduced in 8 °C of atmospheric temperature and the relative humidity in air is augmented in 15% and reduces carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and the diminution of the “Urban Heat Island” effect in weather for a determined green area. © 2019 Universidad de La Habana.

Almost 80% of the annual N2O emissions in Poland originate from agriculture, and its main source is the use of agricultural soils. This study attempts to estimate the N2O emissions from agricultural soils and presents statistical analyses and spatial distributions for all Polish communes. For this purpose, a solution has been proposed which could be successfully applied by local government in order to assess N2O emissions, as well as to monitor the impact of actions undertaken to limit them. The annual N2O emissions from agricultural soils in Polish communes varies from 0.002 Mg N2O-N to 437.77 Mg N2O-N (with an average value of 21.13 Mg N2O-N and a standard deviation of 23.86 Mg N2O-N), and the cultivation of organic soils is its main source. The use of fertilizers and nitrogen fertilization with plant residues, as well as indirect emissions from nitrogen leaching, are also significant. The results may be used to provide a database for local governments, which will serve, not only to identify local emission sources related to agricultural soils, but also to properly plan and prioritize measures for its reduction. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

If a cooling network exists alongside the heating network, the return line of the cooling network can serve as heat source for a large-scale central heat pump. In this system setup, a heat pump couples the heating and cooling networks with each other. This enables cooling down the return line of the cooling network and simultaneously pre-heating the return line of the heating network. The design of these integrated systems is challenging and is increasingly carried out with mathematical optimization methods. In this work, we present a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for designing district heating and cooling systems coupled with a large-scale heat pump. The result is an optimized design and operation of the heat pump integrated in the overall energy supply system, which includes also conventional technologies such as gas boilers, combined heat and power units, compression and absorption chillers. The MILP model is applied to a district heating and cooling system of a research campus in Germany. The installation of a central heat pump leads to cost savings of 6 % and a CO2 reduction of 38 % compared to a benchmark design without heat pump. If lower temperatures in the heating network can be realized, the heat pump operates at higher COPs and meets larger shares of the network demands, which leads to further cost savings of 12 %. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

Rural areas of the northeastern United States have experienced increased temperature and precipitation extremes, especially over the past three decades, and face unique challenges due to their physical isolation, natural-resource–dependent economies, and high poverty rates. To explore the impacts of future extreme events on vulnerable, rural populations in the Northeast, we analyzed future (2046–2075) annual maximum daily maximum temperature, annual minimum daily minimum temperature, annual maximum daily precipitation, and annual minimum two-week summer precipitation for two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios using four global climate models and gridded temperature and precipitation observations. We then combined those projections with estimates of county-level population and relative income for 2060 to calculate changes in extreme person-events compared to a historical period (1976–2005), with a focus on Northeast counties that are rural (less than 250,000 people) and vulnerable (in the bottom income quartile). For all counties and lowest income quartile counties in the rural Northeast, extreme heat person-events increase nineteen-fold and twenty-nine fold, respectively, under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario, far exceeding the decrease in extreme cold person-events. The number of extreme precipitation and drought person-events does not significantly change across the rural Northeast. For the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario, counties in the bottom two income quartiles experience the 1976–2005 once-per-year daily heat event twenty-three times per year by 2046–2075; the lower greenhouse gas emissions scenario reduces the incidence to eleven times per year.

AA2024 samples are thermo-mechanically treated to produce a macroscopically inhomogeneous distribution of intermetallic particles. The AA2024-T351 samples are allowed to corrode by immersion in 0.51 M aqueous NaCl and (ex-situ) ECL measurements are performed to follow copper re-distribution. Luminol ECL light emission is orders of magnitude more intense on copper than aluminum and macro and microscopic images are obtained to elucidate the re-distribution of electrochemically active copper. S phase de-alloying produces a radical re-distribution of copper on a microstructural scale (1-10 μm) but macroscopic copper distributions (1-10 mm) remain largely unchanged. In-situ experiments using the SVET show that macroscopic copper distribution directs localization of corrosive attack such that net anodic activity (pitting/intergranular attack) is concentrated in regions with lowest surface coverage of copper and net cathodic activity is concentrated in regions of highest coverage. Results are explained in terms of the role of solution chemistry and pH in influencing the transition from transient to stable pitting. © The Author(s) 2019.",,"Alloying; Chemiluminescence; Dealloying; Electrolytes; Sodium chloride; Copper distribution; Electrical contacts; Electrogenerated chemiluminescence; In-situ experiments; Inhomogeneous distribution; Inter-metallic particle; Orders of magnitude; Thermo Mechanically Treated; Copper corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073475489

Despite recent expansion in the literature that evaluates vulnerability at the local level, approaches to understanding future scenarios and to integrating climatic and nonclimatic factors are inconsistent and often lack clear methodological information. This study utilized systematic review methods to characterize and compare future scenarios and the integration of climatic and nonclimatic stimuli in community-focused VAs published over the last five years. Five common methods for assessing future dimensions of vulnerability were characterized. Key challenges regarding sources and scales of information were highlighted alongside methods to integrate data spanning climatic and nonclimatic information at scales ranging from local to global. The majority of VAs considered current and past vulnerability; few VAs incorporated future scenarios and these studies focused on future climatic conditions while largely overlooking changes in nonclimatic drivers of vulnerability. Approaches to evaluate future dimensions of vulnerability included climate model projections, socioeconomic model projections, temporal analogue approaches, longitudinal approaches, and local perceptions. These methods often failed to capture the dynamic interactions between variables through time, as future impacts are unlikely to follow previous patterns of change. To combine datasets of different scales, VAs created vulnerability indices, overlaid spatial datasets, or used expert judgement. These approaches tended to aggregate local characteristics to the regional level at the expense of community specificity. There is a need for methodological advances to assess future scenarios and to combine datasets in the field of community-level climate change VAs to make these studies more responsive to local realities and relevant to the development of climate change adaptation strategies. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

We focus on three energy services: heating and cooling in buildings, ownership and use of consumer goods, and passenger mobility. We identify a set of 28 actions across these three energy services ranging from multi-functional end-use devices and area-based procurement of whole-home retrofits to shared urban mobility services and open digital platforms. For each action we identify the lead implementation actor, scale of action, and the extent of policy and financing requirements. For selected actions, we also provide examples of best practice from around the world, drawing on both peer-reviewed and grey literature.

As many millions of people are expected to be displaced in the coming decades, scholars and policymakers are searching for precedence to inform their research and planning, particularly from experiences of Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement (DIDR). Nowhere in the world is DIDR and other closely related forms of planned resettlement more prevalent than in China: an estimated 78 million people have been displaced by development projects over the last six decades. While planned resettlement has consistently been shown to cause impoverishment, the Chinese state views it as the answer to a multitude of social ills including poverty, environmental damage, low levels of domestic consumption, and most recently, climate change, providing impetus to the normalisation of resettlement as adaptation. This paper examines the prospects for just outcomes in resettlement projects by examining distributive justice at multiple scales in existing resettlement practice in China. It finds that due to the interplay between resettlement and questions of procedural justice, prospects for just outcomes are quite limited, and that in order to achieve fair adaptation, alternatives to planned resettlement should be emphasised. © 2019 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adaptation; climate change; distributive justice; procedural justice; relocation","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; environmental justice; natural hazard; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069916397

Recent investigations have indicated that humic substances existing in redox-dynamic terrestrial environments, such as intermittently wet soils, may be uniquely important for regulating greenhouse gas emissions. However, many relevant studies have relied on the use of commercially available humic substances and/or synthetic humic analogs. In the present study, during a 42-d anoxic incubation, we investigated the regulatory and catalytic effects of increasing concentrations of site-specific (i.e., native) humic acid (HA) in an Appalachian upland soil known to experience redox-oscillating conditions in the field. Extracted native HA was characterized using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR), Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR), and total CHNS elemental analyses. We found that native HA was relatively enriched in aromatic and amino acid C. Increasing concentrations of native HA added at the start of soil incubations led to higher rates of CO2 emission and microbial Fe(III) reduction, indicating that a buildup of soil HA allows for a greater number of electrons to shuttle between Fe(III) reducers and Fe(III) electron acceptors during microbial oxidation of organic C. Treatments with native HA were also compared against a synthetic HAanalog treatment containing 0.2 g anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid (AQDS) kg-1 dry soil to investigate catalytic electron cycling by native HA and AQDS. Our data suggest that the buildup of native humic substances, which are relatively rich in aromatic and amino acid C, leads to globally relevant increases in CO2 emissions, the redox cycling of Fe, and the availability of organic P after transition to anaerobic conditions in upland soils. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"Amino acids; Anoxic water; Aromatic compounds; Carbon dioxide; Catalytic oxidation; Electrons; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Iron compounds; Ketones; Landforms; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Phosphorus; Reduction; Soils; Anaerobic conditions; Biogeochemical reactions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Catalytic cycling; Electron acceptor; Microbial oxidation; Number of electrons; Terrestrial environments; Soil pollution; anthraquinone derivative; aromatic amino acid; carbon dioxide; humic acid; iron; phosphorus; Article; carbon footprint; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; concentration response; controlled study; desorption; electron transport; elemental analysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; incubation time; oscillation; oxidation reduction reaction; soil analysis; synthesis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074530633

Indigenous peoples in Canada experience a high prevalence of nutrition-related chronic disease because of the poor quality and high cost of their food supply. Since European colonization, they have transitioned from a diet of minimally processed traditional foods (game, fish, and plants) procured using pursuits such as hunting, fishing, gathering, and horticulture to a diet comprised mostly of processed market foods. This nutrition transition is the result of factors such as colonial policies and practices; climate change; environmental degradation; contaminants in traditional foods; and limited availability of, or access to, economical and healthful market foods. Presenters Malek Batal and Laurie Chan characterized the contemporary diets of First Nations and Inuit populations and demonstrated novel methods for modelling more optimal diets using 2 datasets: the First Nations Food, Nutrition, and Environment Study and the Inuit Health Survey. It was demonstrated how the NOVA classification characterized the portion of the diet consisting of processed foods. Dietary components were then manipulated to reduce ultra-processed food and drink intake to increase the Healthy Eating Index score. Linear programming was explained as a way to mathematically design theoretical diets that aim to optimize food cost, nutrition quality, and contaminant level of traditional foods. While diet-modelling methodologies have limitations, they provide a basis for engaging Indigenous peoples and governments to develop nutrition goals and policies anchored in contemporary food realities. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

The optimum strategy for peak load as a truck pulls up a hill may be considerably different from the optimum strategy for cruising down the motorway. In the past it has been a compromise to provide settings which work well in all regions of the engine map. Delphi Technologies' new DFI7 injector gives both an increased array of options when it comes to rate shaping, and also dynamic flexibility to change the rate shape between injection events. DFI7 builds on DFI21 miniaturised control valve technology in a twin actuator set up. The twin actuators have full independent control, meaning they can be operated separately as standalone actuators or in combination to provide more complex injection rate shapes. This enables injection strategy to be mapped to the different load conditions of the engine, providing the optimum injection strategy for each load point using the same set of injector hardware. This paper will look at the achievable injection strategies with DFI7, the potential improvement this could make to emissions and efficiency, and how the design has been developed to fit within a current Euro VI DFI5 injector envelope. © The author(s) and/or their employer(s), 2018.","Diesel; Efficiency; Emissions; Fuel consumption; Injection; Rate-shaping","Actuators; Commercial vehicles; Engines; Fuel consumption; Fuel systems; Fuels; Injection (oil wells); Particulate emissions; Diesel; Dynamic flexibility; Fuel efficiency; Independent control; Injection rates; Load condition; Optimum strategy; Rate shaping; Efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071182882

At the same time, evidence has accumulated that fine particulate matter pollution can exacerbate asthma symptoms and generate substantial economic costs. To measure these costs, we use a unique nationwide panel dataset tracking asthmatic individuals’ use of rescue medication and their exposure to PM 2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of &lt;2.5 μm) concentration between 2012 and 2017, to estimate the causal relationship between pollution and inhaler use. Our sample consists of individuals using an asthma digital health platform, which relies on a wireless sensor to track the place and time of inhaler use events, as well as regular nonevent location and time indicators. These data provide an accurate measurement of inhaler use and allow spatially and temporally resolute assignment of pollution exposure. Using a high-frequency research design and individual fixed effects, we find that a 1 μg/m 3 (12%) increase in weekly exposure to PM 2.5 increases weekly inhaler use by 0.82%. We also show that there is seasonal, regional, and income-based heterogeneity in this response. Using our response prediction, and an estimate from the literature on the willingness to pay to avoid asthma symptoms, we show that a nationwide 1 μg/m 3 reduction in particulate matter concentration would generate nearly $350 million annually in economic benefits. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

In this study, a mixture of different amounts of rice husk biochar (RHB) at 1.5%, 2.0% or 2.5% by weight (wt.%) and 20 wt.% vermicompost were used to grow Chinese kale in a soil on a high rise building in Bangkok city. The effect of this mixture on yields of Chinese kale and the level of carbon storage in the soil and plants were evaluated, since this could contribute towards urban food security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Eight treatments were evaluated as (i) the soil alone (TC), and soil supplemented with (ii) 20 wt.% vermicompost (TM20), (iii-v) RHB (TB1.5, TB2.0 and TB2.5), or (vi-viii) vermicompost with RHB (TMB1.5, TMB2.0 and TMB2.5). Treatment TMB2.0 gave the highest yield of Chinese kale shoots, followed by TMB2.5, TM20 and TMB1.5, respectively. In addition, TMB2.5 gave the highest carbon storage in the soil plus plants, followed by TMB20, TM20 and TMB1.5. Thus, adding the appropriate amount of RHB and vermicompost mixture in the soil led to a higher yield of plant products, including an increased level of soil carbon storage.

This projection is driven by recent changes within the system's framework, addressing the current surplus of emission allowances and reducing the overall cap. More specifically, the Market Stability Reserve starts operating in 2019 and the linear reduction factor increases from 1.74 percent to 2.2 percent annually from 2021, increasing scarcity and allowance prices. Considering the growing amount of auctioning revenues projected, it becomes ever more important to assess the use of these revenues and their potential contribution to accelerate decarbonisation efforts. While there are various opportunities to invest auctioning revenues to drive emission reductions, we argue that strategic investments in energy efficiency programmes provide opportunities for realising multiple dividends: additional emission reductions from both ETS and non-ETS sectors, lower economic and societal decarbonisation costs, and support for the political process to further tighten the ETS cap. Our assessment of the status of auctioning revenue use at EU Member State level shows that Member States have made only limited use of these multiple dividends in recent years. In 2017, no more than 22.4 percent of total revenues have been strategically invested in energy efficiency programmes, as Member States have officially reported to the European Environment Agency's reporting obligations database. However, evidence from efficiency programmes funded by auctioning revenues in Ireland, Germany and Czech Republic illustrate that these programmes deliver energy savings and emission reductions, cost savings to consumers, tax revenue to the national budgets, employment and economic growth. We conclude that the EU carbon price can provide important signals to investors and energy users, but auctioning revenues can also be a powerful tool in the energy transition and the strategic use of revenues needs to be accelerated in all Member States. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Additionally, rapid population and economic growth are resulting in an increasing demand for space cooling. The ground-source heat pump has been proven a reliable, cost-effective, safe, and environmentally-friendly alternative for cooling and heating spaces in various countries. In tropical countries, the presumption that the ground-source heat pump may not provide better thermal performance than the normal air-source heat pump arises because the difference between ground and atmospheric temperatures is essentially low. This paper reports the potential use of a ground-source heat pump with horizontal heat exchangers in a tropical country-Thailand. Daily operational data of two ground-source heat pumps and an air-source heat pump during a two-month operation are analyzed and compared. Life cycle cost analysis and CO2 emission estimation are adopted to evaluate the economic value of ground-source heat pump investment and potential CO2 reduction through the use of ground-source heat pumps, in comparison with the case for air-source heat pumps. It was found that the ground-source heat pumps consume 17.1% and 18.4% less electricity than the air-source heat pump during this period. Local production of heat pumps and heat exchangers, as well as rapid regional economic growth, can be positive factors for future ground-source heat pump application, not only in Thailand but also southeast Asian countries. © 2019 by the authors.","Ground source heat pump; Horizontal heat exchanger; Tropical climate","Air source heat pumps; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic analysis; Investments; Population statistics; Pumps; Regional planning; Tropics; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Horizontal heat exchanger; Life cycle cost analysis; Operational data; Regional economic growths; Thermal Performance; Tropical climates; Tropical countries; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065627608

Yet discussions of the anthropocene can also be better contextualized in terms of their featuring certain phenomena as ‘new’ that are really much more longstanding phenomena. For example, many Indigenous peoples have ancient traditions of environmental ‘mobility.’ This essay reviews some of the history of Indigenous philosophies, especially Anishinaabe, of mobility, migration, and resettlement. Often these philosophies focus on fluid and transformative relationships as constituting the fabric of resilient societies. Indigenous traditions of mobility are critically relevant for climate justice. They put into relief how colonial power can operate as a containment strategy that works to curtail mobility.

High levels of population genetic diversity may buffer foundation species against climate disruptions, but the strong selective pressures associated with climatic shifts may also rapidly reduce such diversity. We characterized genetic diversity and its responsiveness to experimental drought in the foundation plant, black grama grass (Bouteloua eriopoda), which dominates many western North American grasslands and shrublands. Previous studies suggested that in arid ecosystems, black grama reproduces largely asexually via stolons, and thus is likely to have low genetic variability, which might limit its potential to respond to climate disruptions. Using genotyping-by-sequencing, we demonstrated unexpectedly high genetic variability among black grama plants in a 1 ha site within the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, suggesting some level of sexual reproduction. Three years of experimental, growing season drought reduced black grama survival and biomass (the latter by 96%), with clear genetic differentiation (higher F ST ) between plants succumbing to drought and those remaining alive. Reduced genetic variability in the surviving plants in drought plots indicated that the experimental drought had forced black grama populations through selection bottlenecks. These results suggest that foundation grass species, such as black grama, may experience rapid evolutionary change if future climates include more severe droughts. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Experimental evolution; Genotyping-by-sequencing; Natural selection; Sevilleta long-term ecological research","drought; ecosystem; genetic variation; grassland; New Mexico; Poaceae; Droughts; Ecosystem; Genetic Variation; Grassland; New Mexico; Poaceae",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062770402

The methodology is based upon mass material balance in both gas condensate and wet gas systems and permits for oil/condensate volumetric determination utilizing a novel concept referred to as pseudo formation volume factor (Bo*). This method allows for a continuous oil/condensate volumetric assessment across all four hydrocarbon phases: black oil, volatile oil, gas condensate, and wet gas. A Duvernay field application example is presented. In conventional oil/condensate volumetric methods, a discontinuity is observed at the boundary between undersaturated gas and oil systems when you move across the mapped phases. The discontinuity results from an inconsistent oil/condensate volumetric approach between oil and gas primary phases. Oil/condensate volumetrics is a function of an oil formation volume factor (Bo) in oil systems while, in comparison, a function of a condensate-gas ratio (CGR) in gas systems. This volumetric assessment inconsistency is exemplified in areas of multiple phases, where operators are mapping oil/condensate from wet gas to black oil over a localized area. Realistically, a distinct boundary between in-situ fluid phases does not exist; rather, this change in phase is gradual. The traditional Bo is a volumetric comparison of the live-oil volume to the dead-oil volume of an equivalent unit mass of oil. Evolved gas from the live-oil volume creates the volumetric shrinkage observed within the dead-oil volume. The fundamental basis of the Bo is a mass material balance and can be expressed as a ratio of the dead-oil density to the live-oil density if the mass of evolved gas is accounted for. The Bo* approach applies the same mass material balance concept to the recovered standard condition condensate within the gas-condensate and wet gas system. This condensate shrinkage concept, however, is not based upon the evolved gas from the oil, since the primary phase is gas in the gas-condensate and wet gas systems. In contrast, the Bo* concept is a density comparison of the standard condition condensate recovered at the surface to its associated density in the gas phase at downhole pressure and temperature conditions. The fundamental assumption in the Bo* mass balance solution is ideal gas behavior. The gross live-fluid gas density is corrected to the live-fluid gas density of the standard condition condensate only. This is based upon a liquid component mass balance ratio within the recombined fluid, applied to the gross live-fluid density. The Bo* however, can also be algebraically solved for, which is the recommended approach. Like the traditional Bo, the Bo* is a strong predictive function of the mapped initial gas-oil ratio (GOR). An apparent boundary transition between the Bo and Bo* correlations is observed in the expected 3,200 SCF/STB range of GOR. Both the Bo and the Bo* can also be predictively linked to the hydrocarbon maturity, pressure, and temperature mapping. Hydrocarbon volumetric assessment utilizing the Bo* approach determines oil/ condensate volumes by applying a Bo (oil phase) or Bo* (gas phase), correlated to a mapped predictive variable such as GOR. Gas volumes are subsequently a function of the calculated oil/condensate in-place and the mapped GOR. The Bo* approach is volumetrically equivalent to a traditional volumetric approach in gas systems and is based upon fundamental mass balance concepts. The advantage of the Bo* methodology is the ability to consistently and continuously assess oil/condensate volumetrics across contiguous oil and gas phase windows. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Density of gases; Gases; Mapping; Shrinkage; Volatile organic compounds; Assessment approaches; Associated densities; Condensate gas ratios; Formation volume factors; Oil formation volume factors; Predictive variables; Temperature mapping; Volumetric shrinkage; Gas condensates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079131668

In its first two years the platform learned how to better accelerate local action. Even so, cities will need to make bigger improvements more quickly to meet local, national and global goals for reductions in carbon emissions and energy consumption. The BEA seeks to enable city building efficiency action at the intersection of policy and private markets. The BEA platform engages 37 cities or subnational governments and over 40 organizational partners. Each city commits to implement at least one building efficiency policy, one demonstration project, and to track their progress. To increase city ambition and long-term thinking towards a zero emissions future, the BEA partnership is now framing city commitments to include an overall vision of zero carbon buildings (ZCBs) by 2050. This provides a timely rallying message for cities to consider the applicability of ZCBs in their local context, compare notes with those leading the charge, and engage stakeholders to take coordinated action. Through it all, the BEA's support architecture for building efficiency helps cities take the first and most crucial step towards deep decarbonisation: reducing demand. This also comes as the World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) launched the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment in 2018 to drive ambition of local governments and businesses toward ZCBs at scale. ZCBs are not often presented as a near-term possibility in smaller developing country cities where rapid urbanization will lead to immense growth in the next 30 years. Without significant changes, new construction in these cities has the potential to lock in inefficient design strategies that will require new buildings built today to undergo major renovations in the future to reduce emissions and improve adaptability. The BEA plans to help primarily these high-growth medium-sized cities in developing countries understand their near-term feasible pathways to ZCBs. Some considerations for increasing city action on zero carbon buildings include: 1. Energy efficiency is a critical first step: Addressing energy efficiency increases the feasibility of achieving zero carbon by reducing the amount of renewable energy needed to meet remaining energy demand. 2. Boundary definitions can impact feasibility: Expanding boundaries beyond an individual building can include considering off-site measures, embodied carbon, district or portfolio approaches, or interactions with additional urban infrastructure. 3. Education about the feasibility of ZCBs is needed: increased awareness of ZCBs and how to achieve them results in broader understanding that they are possible in most contexts, or even already exist today. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Due to different metrics, system boundaries and limits, it is hard to compare ambition levels of the new requirements of an nZEB in the different EU Member States. The assessment is even more complicated due to different national calculation methods and boundary conditions. In this paper a methodology is presented, which allows a relative comparison of ambition levels by the use of building simulation and a common reference building. The methodology is tested with different simulation programs in the countries Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Results confirm that the use of different standard simulation tools requires previous calibration of the reference building. Remaining limitations of the comparison for the case of different climate zones are addressed by defining a passive house in local climate as reference building with high ambition level, but this issue is also subject to further investigations. © (2019) by International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) All rights reserved.",,"Circuit simulation; Software engineering; Building simulation; Energy performance of buildings; Local climate; Model calibration; Passive house; Simulation program; Switzerland; System boundary; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107446634

Such information is critical for using ocean resources responsibly and sustainably as the ocean becomes increasingly important to society. The contributions of many nations cooperating to develop the Global Ocean Observing System has resulted in a strong base of global and regional ocean observing networks. However, enhancement of the existing observation system has been constrained by flat funding and limited cooperation among present and potential users. At the same time, a variety of actors are seeking new deployments in remote and newly ice-free regions and new observing capabilities, including biological and biogeochemical sensors. Can these new needs be met? In this paper, a vision for how to sustain ocean observing in the future is presented. A key evolution will be to grow the pool of users, engaging end users across society. Users with shared values need to be brought together with commitment to sustainable use of the ocean in the broadest sense. Present planning for sustained observations builds on the development of the Global Ocean Observing System which has primarily targeted increased scientific understanding of ocean processes and of the ocean's role in climate. We must build on that foundation to develop an Ocean Partnership for Sustained Observing that will incorporate the growing needs of a broad constituency of users beyond climate and make the case for new resources. To be most effective this new Partnership should incorporate the principles of a collective impact organization, enabling closer engagement with the private sector, philanthropies, governments, NGOs, and other groups. Steps toward achieving this new Partnership are outlined in this paper, with the intent of establishing it early in the UN Decade of Ocean Science. © 2019 Weller, Baker, Glackin, Roberts, Schmitt, Twigg and Vimont.","Ocean observation; Partnership; Shared value; Society; Sustained",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065431959

Many countries also lack or have under-developed indigenous fossil fuel resources, or rely on environmentally unfriendly fuels such as coal or Heavy Fuel Oil. Many underdeveloped regions though are blessed with considerable agricultural resources, and well-suited to Distributed Power Generation, where smaller decentralized power plants are located close to the actual energy consumers. Distributed Power eliminates the need for an electricity transmission grid, or reduces the investment costs necessary to strengthen the grid system, and helps ensure stable, secure electricity to support local economic growth. Agricultural wastes can be used as a locally available feedstock to produce the energy required to electrify regions and stimulate economic growth. This paper examines the benefits of applying Poly-generation – the production of multiple products at a single location – and examines a proposed bio-refinery scheme to produce ethanol from agricultural waste. The ethanol production process produces a waste biogas, which can then be used in a high efficiency Cogeneration (or Combined Heat and Power) plant as a fuel for gas turbines to generate electricity and steam (heat), not just for the bio-refinery but also local industry and businesses. By creating a high value product (ethanol) along with a free fuel, the bio-refinery acts as an anchor plant to provide reliable, affordable electricity to the local community. As well as providing economic benefits, such a concept has multiple environmental benefits as regions and nations try to combine growth in energy demand with reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions: agricultural residues that would otherwise have decayed emitting methane and CO2 into the atmosphere are used to create a high value product in ethanol, while using the biogas as a fuel displaces combustion of fossil fuels, reducing both combustion emissions and those associated with transportation of the fuel to the point of use.

There are two ways to reduce CO2 emissions from power generation: improved conversion efficiency of fuel into electrical energy, and switching to lower carbon content fuels Gas turbine generator sets, whether in open cycle, combined cycle or cogeneration configuration, offer some of the highest efficiencies possible across a wide range of power outputs. With natural gas, the fossil fuel with the lowest carbon content, as the primary fuel, they produce among the lowest CO2 emissions per kWh generated. It is possible though to decarbonize power generation further by using the fuel flexibility of the gas turbine to fully or partially displace natural gas used with hydrogen. As hydrogen is a zero carbon fuel, it offers the opportunity for gas turbines to produce zero carbon electricity. As an energy carrier, hydrogen is an ideal candidate for long-term or seasonal storage of renewable energy, while the gas turbine is an enabler for a zero carbon power generation economy. Hydrogen, while the most abundant element in the Universe, does not exist in its elemental state in nature, and producing hydrogen is an energy-intensive process. This paper looks at the different methods by which hydrogen can be produced, the impact on CO2 emissions from power generation by using pure hydrogen or hydrogen/natural gas blends, and how the economics of power generation using hydrogen compare with today’s state of the art technologies and carbon capture. This paper also addresses the issues surrounding the combustion of hydrogen in gas turbines, historical experience of gas turbines operating on high hydrogen fuels, and examines future developments to optimize combustion emissions.

The cities must act to reduce the carbon footprint - even the small towns. In Germany, the process of green logistics solutions of the CEP services has now started because Germany has the most booming CEP market in Europe. But the focus of these solutions is not yet on small towns. Nonetheless, especially the health resorts have to reduce their traffic.

The capability of solving rather large problems that include time and space discretization is particularly relevant for planning the transition to a system where non-dispatchable energy sources are key. Here, one of the main challenges is to realistically describe the technologies and the system boundaries: on the one hand the linear modeling, and on the other the number of variables that can be handled by the system call for a trade-off between level of details and computational time. With this work, we investigate how modeling wind turbines, H2 generation via electrolysis, and storage in salt cavern affect the system description and findings. We do this by implementing methodological developments to an existing MILP tool, and by testing them in an exemplary case study, i.e. decarbonization of the Dutch energy system. It is found that modeling of wind turbines curtailment and of existing turbines are key. The deployment of H2 generation and storage is driven by the interplay between area availability, system costs, and desired level of autarky. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","energy storage; energy transition; MILP; technology modeling; wind turbines",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069692817

The isotopic composition of the closed-system Fischer-Tropsch synthesis gas and the composition of known abiogenic gas were systematically studied, and the deep Songliao Basin gas was also investigated. The results show that closed-system Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of gaseous hydrocarbon isotopes exhibits a partial reverse order, which includes the reverse order of methane and ethane such as δ13C-C1&gt;δ13C-C2&lt;δ13C-C3 and δ2H-C1&gt;δ2H-C2&lt;δ2H-C3. Furthermore, experimental data on the control of NaBH4 content indicates that the carbon isotopes demonstrate a reverse order on condition that the H2/CO2 (mole ratio) is equal to or greater than 4.0; meanwhile, the hydrogen isotopes show a normal order. The deep Songliao Basin hydrocarbon gas component is similar to thermogenic gas and has a trend of a transition to oceanic hydrothermal system abiogenic gas. In addition, the deep Songliao Basin gas isotopic pattern is different from both Lost City and Kidd Creek where the deep Basin gas carbon isotopic pattern has a reverse order, and the hydrogen isotopic pattern has a normal order. Therefore, the deep Basin gas might be a mixture of the oil-type gas and the coal-formed gas, which could be the cause of the isotopic reverse. © 2019 Zhifu Wei et al.",,"biogenic emission; catalyst; coalbed methane; hydrocarbon resource; hydrothermal system; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; magnetite; China; Songliao Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072564826

The severity of the noise and emission output of the aircraft are heavily influenced by the manner in which the aircraft takes off. Aircraft manufacturers have developed and distributed their own software to calculate take-off parameters, departure paths, and noise data. However, this software does not have the capability to accurately estimate pollution output. Therefore, it is necessary to develop accurate mathematical models and software to calculate emission based on aircraft departure flight paths and take-off parameters. This paper presents aircraft pollution emission models based on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) database and Boeing Methods 2 (BM2) data. Methods for converting (Boeing Climb-Out Program) BCOP’s flight data to meet the calculation of emission are constructed in this paper. After then, the Aircraft Pollution Emission Analysis Tool (APEAT) was developed to calculate pollution emissions for various take-off conditions and parameters. This paper also proposes equivalent CO2 and weighted equivalent CO2 metrics to analyze the overall effect of take-off parameters on airport regional air quantity. Finally, some suggestions were made that can be used to reduce the aircraft pollution emissions in take-off phase. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Aviation emission; Emission index; Environmental impact; Flight parameters; Takeoff performance","Carbon dioxide; Civil aviation; Environmental impact; Takeoff; Aircraft departure; Aircraft manufacturers; Emission index; Flight data; Flight parameters; Flight safety; International Civil Aviation Organization; Pollution emissions; Pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070743971

This paper now presents the influence of low-pressure EGR that is applied to a TDGI engine and the effects of EGR on fuel consumption and emission is studied. By dyno steady-state testing and vehicle simulation, a fuel consumption reduction of 6.18% is achieved under WLTC. The result will interest many professionals working in this field. Stringent legislative measures/national and international legislation/laws are forcing the automotive industry to reduce the fuel consumption and emission. To comply with those regulations and to stay competitive on the global market, it is necessary to adopt new technology. Cooled exhaust gas recirculation (CEGR) is an effective way to improve fuel economy and to reduce NOx. LP EGR technology was applied to a 1.5-L three-cylinder TDI engine during this study which is specified below. Design of experiment methods was used to adopt the best combination of CR11, valve timing, modifying piston geometry, and the camshaft. To reduce combustion duration, the ignition coil was upgraded from 75 to 90 MJ. Performed vehicle steady state simulation to realize fuel consumption reduction at WLTC cycle. Engine dyno test under steady state operating condition with CR11, able to achieve fuel consumption reduction of 6.18% at WLTC cycle compared to the base engine.

The goal of this research was to determine an efficient brackish water use method to increase irrigation efficiency and reduce N2O emission. To this end, we conducted a field experiment with four salinity levels of irrigation water (1.1, 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 g·L-1 with drip irrigation) at Hetao Irrigation District (Inner Mongolia, China) in 2017 and 2018. The results show that irrigation with 3.5-5.0 g·L-1 water salinity increased the soil salinity compared with irrigation using 1.1-2.0 g·L-1 water salinity. The soil water content with 5.0 g·L-1 brackish water irrigation was significantly higher than with 1.1-3.5 g·L-1 water salinity due to the effect of salinity on crop water uptake. The overall soil pH increased with the increase in irrigation water salinity. Saturated soil hydraulic conductivity decreased with the increase in irrigation water salinity. These results indicate that brackish water irrigation aggravates the degree of soil salinization and alkalization. The soil N2O cumulative flux resulting from irrigation with 5.0 g·L-1 water salinity was 51.18-82.86% higher than that resulting from 1.1-3.5 g L-1 water salinity in 2017, and was 32.38-44.79% higher than that resulting from 1.1-2.0 g·L-1 in 2018. Irrigation with brackish water reduced maize yield, and the reduction in yield in 2018 was greater than that in 2017, but irrigation with 2.0 g·L-1 brackish water did not significantly reduce maize yield in 2017. These results suggest that reducing the salinity of irrigation water may effectively reduce soil N2O emission, alleviate the degree of soil salinization, and increase crop yield. © 2019 by the authors.","Correlation relationship; Hetao Irrigation District; Irrigation water salinity; Maize yield; Soil N2O emission; Soil salinization and alkalization","Crops; Soil moisture; Water supply; Hetao irrigation districts; Irrigation efficiency; Irrigation waters; Maize yield; Mulched drip irrigations; Saturated soil hydraulic conductivities; Soil salinization; Soil water content; Irrigation; alkalinization; brackish water; correlation; drip irrigation; irrigation system; maize; nitrous oxide; salinity; salinization; soil emission; soil property; soil water; yield response; China; Hetao Plain; Nei Monggol; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070337488

The German Federal Government with its Climate Protection Plan 2050 reinforced its target to reduce Germany's greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95 percent compared with 1990. The achievement of these targets requires nothing less than a fundamental transformation of spatial planning. In the paper a methodology to scientifically assess the likely impacts of possible combinations of policies or strategies to achieve the energy transition, i.e. to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of urban mobility and transport is proposed and demonstrated, using the Ruhr Area, the largest conurbation in Germany, as an example. The results of the policies examined so far can be summarised as follows: Push measures as high energy prices, speed limits or reduction of the number of lanes of main roads are more effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions than pull measures as the promotion of cycling, walking, electric cars or public transport. Between policies or policy packages there can be positive or negative synergies, i.e. The impacts of measures can reinforce or weaken each other. The results show that even with ambitious policies the greenhouse gas emission targets of the national and state governments will not be achieved and that more radical policies are needed. © 2019 The Authors.

Research on the role of cities in developing clean energy has paid limited attention to the interaction with financialised governance of infrastructure, which makes the implementation of plans largely dependent on private investment. A conceptual approach combining economic sociology of actor networks and urban political economy is used to analyse the career of the business model designed to transform old infrastructures into new clean energy assets. The analysis focuses on interactions between city council, public bodies and electricity distribution network business. Climate policies are creating uncertainties for energy businesses over revenues from ageing networks, suggesting scope for alliance with local governments. Making new liquid assets for clean energy from old infrastructure is however shown to be a process marked by instability and reversals. In conclusion, it is argued that concepts from actor-network theory and urban political economy used together reveal the hidden contingencies of financialisation in particular socio-technical interactions, and their materiality in the context of climate change. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The paper discusses technology selection, pilot test configuration, test results, projected operating costs and reliability, and conclusions. The field trial was conducted at an oilfield wastewater facility where up to 10,000 barrels per day of produced water containing 3,700 mg/L of TDS (total dissolved solids) was being treated in a series of unlined ponding basins to remove free oil and solids, and then used to irrigate an area containing salt-tolerant grasses, shrubs, and trees. Due to concerns that local groundwater might be impacted, in 2016 the operator was given two years by regulators to substantially reduce the salt, aromatic hydrocarbon, and boron content of the water, or cease surface discharge. After a detailed review of options, the operator elected to conduct a 60-day pilot test of a process that consisted primarily of electrocoagulation followed by reverse osmosis to desalinate the produced water and remove aromatic hydrocarbons. Boron removal would be accomplished by use of a boron-specific anion exchange resin downstream of the reverse osmosis membranes. The pilot treatment system would be designed and installed to comply with the local Regional Water Quality Control Board specifications for surface discharge, herein collectively called the ""Effluent Specifications"" (Table 1). In July 2016, the operator started the 60-day pilot test. After an initial commissioning period, the facility demonstrated the ability to safely and reliably treat the produced water to below the limits contained in the Effluent Specifications.

Non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria can utilize a high variety of organic and inorganic nitrogen sources. In recent years, several physiological studies indicated an involvement of the cyanobacterial PII protein in regulation of ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, and cyanate uptake. However, direct interaction of PII has not been demonstrated so far. In this study, we used biochemical, molecular genetic and physiological approaches to demonstrate that PII regulates all relevant nitrogen uptake systems in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803: PII controls ammonium uptake by interacting with the Amt1 ammonium permease, probably similar to the known regulation of E. coli ammonium permease AmtB by the PII homolog GlnK. We could further clarify that PII mediates the ammonium- and dark-induced inhibition of nitrate uptake by interacting with the NrtC and NrtD subunits of the nitrate/nitrite transporter NrtABCD. We further identified the ABC-type urea transporter UrtABCDE as novel PII target. PII interacts with the UrtE subunit without involving the standard interaction surface of PII interactions. The deregulation of urea uptake in a PII deletion mutant causes ammonium excretion when urea is provided as nitrogen source. Furthermore, the urea hydrolyzing urease enzyme complex appears to be coupled to urea uptake. Overall, this study underlines the great importance of the PII signal transduction protein in the regulation of nitrogen utilization in cyanobacteria. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

Of its population of 110,000, approximately half live on the crowded capital island of South Tarawa. Tarawa's land and people are increasingly impacted by sea level rise and the increasing frequency of storm surge inundation. Existing natural resilience is low with land levels generally less than 2m above mean sea level and less than 500m in width. Population is rapidly growing, largely due to migration from the outer islands, placing increasing pressures on natural resources, infrastructure and essential services. The Temaiku Land and Urban Development project has developed a sustainable solution to assist Kiribati in strengthening resilience against the effects of climate change. 300 hectares of low-lying land will be reclaimed and raised by approximately 2 to 5 metres to provide a resilient basis for future land and urban development. The Project is of national importance and has the potential to house over 35,000 people and provide a resilient governance hub to accommodate key government infrastructure. The resilience of the proposed reclamation to the effect of climate change is largely dependent on the coastal resilience of the development. Coastal design considerations included the selection of finished surface levels to provide resilience against future inundation; a perimeter 'no build' Coastal Hazard Buffer Zone and a combination of phased soft and hard coastal defence solutions. An integrated planning, engineering and environmental approach was implemented throughout the development of the project to enable the design to be cognisant of, and address key social and environmental risks and opportunities.

Previous studies have often regarded As and other chemical components in groundwater as the dissolved state; however, the effects of colloidal components on the migration and transformation of arsenic is neglected and has attracted far less attention. The objective of this study is to identify the hydrogeochemical characteristics of high arsenic groundwater in Datong Basin under the effect of colloids. Based on field sample collection, geochemical mapping of arsenic distribution in groundwater, colloid ultrafiltration, and lab analysis, the hydrochemistry of high arsenic groundwater and the colloidal effect in Datong basin were identified. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The high As groundwater hydrochemistry in Datong Basin is dominated by sodium bicarbonate type, and the reduced geochemical environment is prevailing in groundwater. (2) The highest concentration of As in groundwater is up to 979.66 g/L and the majority of As is As(V). pH, ORP and other water chemistry factors promote the enrichment and formation of high As groundwater by changing the surface potential of the colloid and reduced dissolution. (3) The concentration of As varies remarkably before and after ultrafiltration, which indicated that the colloid has an adsorption effect on As. As occurring in the dissolved state is higher than other phases in the samples with low and middle As concentration; however, in terms of high As groundwater, As mainly exists in the range of 0.22∼0.45kDa. The iron in groundwater is mostly in the form of colloids and the Fe concentration is often positively correlated with total arsenic concentration.

In the treatment of papermaking wastewater by anaerobic granular sludge, the cumulative gas production was maximum at a Ca2+ concentration in the substrate of 120 mg/L, whereas it was the lowest at a concentration of Ca2+ in the substrate of 4000 mg/L. A high Ca2+ concentration in the substrate (≥1200 mg/L) will cause the pH of the fermentation broth to decrease during the fermentation process, which is not conducive to the anaerobic fermentation of the methanogenic process, resulting in unsatisfactory anaerobic digestion of the granular sludge. In addition, when the Ca2+ concentration was below 200 mg/L, the abundance of the important bacterial family Ruminococcaceae (rumen bacteria) in the anaerobic fermentation hydrolysis stage was drastically reduced and methane gas production increased. When the Ca2+ concentration was above 200 mg/L, the abundance of Anaerolineaceae (Anaerobic Streptomyces), which supplies organic acids, was substantially reduced. The methane gas production decreased as the Ca2+ concentration increased. Thus, the results showed that when the concentration of Ca2+ was above 200 mg/L, the methanogenic activity of granular sludge decreased. © 2018, BioResources.","Anaerobic Granular Sludge; Ca2+ concentration; High throughput sequencing; Microbial community","Bacteria; Fermentation; Granular materials; Methane; Sludge digestion; Substrates; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic fermentation; Anaerobic granular sludge; Cumulative gas productions; High-throughput sequencing; Methanogenic activity; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Papermaking wastewater; Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Concentration; Fermentation; Granules; Methane; Production; Sludge; Substrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064727232

We proposed a modeling scheme to represent ZEVs in four-step trip-based travel demand models. We then tested six ZEV scenarios that were a cross-combination of three ZEV ownership levels and two ZEV operating cost levels. The proposed modeling scheme and scenarios were implemented on the Maryland Statewide Transportation Model (MSTM) to analyze the impacts of different ZEV ownership and cost combinations on travel patterns and on CO2 emissions. The main findings were the following: (1) A high-ZEV ownership scenario (43.14% of households with ZEVs) could achieve about a 16% reduction in statewide carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2Eq) emissions from 2015 base year levels; and (2) CO2Eq emissions at a future year baseline (2030) (the Constrained Long-Range Plan) level dropped by approximately 11% in low-ZEV ownership scenarios, 17% in medium-ZEV ownership scenarios, and 32% in high-ZEV ownership scenarios. The high-ZEV ownership results also indicated a more balanced distribution of emissions per unit area or per vehicle mile traveled among different counties. © 2019 by the authors.","GHG emission; Mode choice; Scenario analysis; Travel demand model; Zero-emission vehicles","carbon emission; development strategy; discrete choice analysis; emission control; greenhouse gas; ownership; scenario analysis; technology adoption; traffic emission; travel demand; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063465142

Governments and people thus put a premium on the reduction of air pollution in the living environment. Consequently, it draws considerable attention on how to efficiently collect air quality data, especially in cities. In the past, the job of air quality monitoring was usually conducted by installing a few monitoring stations on fixed locations. However, this scheme provides just coarse-grained monitoring, where the resolution of air-quality samplings may be poor. Even worse, it is difficult to move monitoring stations after installation, but the monitoring mission could be often changed. To deal with the problems, many studies propose various mobile solutions to air quality monitoring by equipping gas sensors on mobile devices or vehicles, which allow people to actively and cooperatively detect air pollution in their surroundings. In the chapter, we provide a comprehensive survey of these mobile solutions, and our discussion has four parts. First, we introduce the techniques to evaluate air quality, including an index to report the quality of air and models to predict the dispersion of air pollution. Then, we present the mobile solutions to collect air quality, which can be realized by pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. Afterward, we discuss how to analyze raw data collected by smartphones, followed by the issue of reporting sensing data collected by cars. Some research directions and challenges for future mobile solutions to air quality monitoring will be also addressed in the chapter. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",,"Air quality; Health risks; Air quality data; Air quality monitoring; Coarse-grained; Global problems; Living environment; Mobile solutions; Monitoring stations; Quality sampling; Monitoring",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090520891

Rice husk is a unique biomass resource because its ash content is typically higher than 15% and more than 88% of this mineral matter is composed of silica. Ash partitioning and deposition mechanisms in rice husk combustion are still under investigation and will be the focus of this paper. Two different rice husk resources were tested in this work: one is from China, and another is from the United States, which are abbreviated as RH_CN and RH_US, respectively. The experimental work was performed in a 100 kW down-fired oxy-fuel combustor (OFC), and both fuels were co-fired with natural gas to achieve combustion conditions that are comparable to coal combustion. Two conditions were tested: (1) air combustion and (2) oxy-combustion with 70% O2 and 30% CO2 in oxidant gas (denoted as OXY70). Results suggested that similar sub-micrometer accumulation modes and super-micrometer fragmentation modes appeared for both rice husks. Although the composition of super-micrometer particles was similar and enriched in silica for both rice husks, the sub-micrometer particles from RH_CN are mainly composed of volatile elements (K, Na, Cl, and P), while these from RH_US are mainly composed of Si. This compositional difference in sub-micrometer aerosols subsequently affects the ash deposit formation; for example, the tightly bound inside deposits from RH_CN have much more volatile elements than those from RH_US. More importantly, apparent ash shedding on deposits occurred after 0.5 h for RH_CN, but this cannot be observed in RH_US until the maximum sampling time (2 h). © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustors; Deposits; Fuels; Micrometers; Silica; Accumulation modes; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Combustion condition; Compositional difference; Deposition behavior; Deposition mechanism; Micrometer particle; Submicrometer particle; Coal combustion",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074444464

In order to evaluate the carbon storage changes of tree, soil, and litter, and the soil total nitrogen (STN) in two typical artificial forests in the region, we conducted plot surveys for different ages of both artificial forest types. Soil samples were collected at different depths from 0-100 cm. The results indicated that forest ecosystem carbon storage increased with tree development. The rates of mean annual carbon sequestration of Pinus tabulaeformis and Robinia pseudoacacia plantation ecosystems were 3.31 and 3.53 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively. The rate of mean annual carbon sequestration of R. pseudoacacia plantation ecosystems was higher by 6.65% than that of P. tabulaeformis plantation ecosystems. The soil organic carbon (SOC) and STN decreased at deeper soil depths in both plantations at different stand ages, significantly decreasing in the 0-60 cm of soil (P &lt; 0.05), and the highest SOC content and storage were in the top 0-20 cm of soil. The temporal patterns for SOC and STN changes at different soil sampling depths from 0 to 100 cm all showed an initial decrease during the early stage of restoration, and then an increase that coincided with the development of the two plantation forests. At 0-100 cm depth, the SOC storage was in the range of 40.95-106.79 and 45.13-113.61 Mg ha-1 for the P. tabulaeformis forest and R. pseudoacacia forest, respectively. The STN storage in the 0-100 cm soil layer with the stand age development ranged from 4.16 to 8.34 Mg ha-1 in the R. pseudoacacia plantation and 4.19-7.55 Mg ha-1 in the P. tabulaeformis forest. The results showed a significant positive correlation between SOC and STN. This study suggests that we should pay more attention to changes in soil carbon and nitrogen sequestration during long-term vegetation restoration.

Mn:CsPbCl3 NCs were prepared by tailoring the amount of SnCl2 added during the growth of NCs. The element and microstructure analysis revealed that the Sn ions were successfully doped into the host NC lattice and had the valence state of +2. With the increase in the Sn doping content, the doping efficiency of the Mn2+ ions increased and the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of NCs was enhanced. The optimum synthesis of Mn:CsPbCl3 NCs was obtained at an Sn/Mn/Pb molar ratio of 1/1/1, and the PL quantum efficiency reached 43%. More importantly, on increasing the ultraviolet illumination time, almost unchanged single exponential decay times of the Mn2+ emissions and slow reduction in the PL intensities of Mn:CsPbCl3 NCs were found after Sn doping, indicating that Sn doping can significantly improve the ultraviolet irradiation stability of Mn:CsPbCl3 NCs. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chlorine compounds; Efficiency; Irradiation; Lead compounds; Molar ratio; Nanocrystals; Optical properties; Perovskite; Stability; Tin; Tin compounds; Effective synthesis; Emission efficiencies; Exponential decays; Microstructure analysis; Photoluminescence intensities; PL quantum efficiency; Ultraviolet illumination; Ultraviolet irradiations; Boron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074087011

Here, we compared the structure and function of the sediment bacterial community in the artificial reef area, the future artificial reef area, and the control area in Bohai Bay by 16S rRNA genes sequencing. Our results indicated that bacteria communities in the sediment were both taxonomically and functionally different between the reef area and control area. In the artificial reef area, the α-diversity was significantly lower, whereas the β-diversity was significantly higher. Functional genes related to chemo-heterotrophy, nitrate reduction, hydrocarbon degradation, and the human pathogens and human gut were more abundant, whereas genes related to the metabolism of sulfur compounds were less abundant in the artificial reef than in the control area. The differences in bacterial communities were primarily determined by depth in the artificial reef area, and by total organic carbon in the future reef area and control area. This study provides the first overview of molecular ecology to assess the impacts of artificial reefs on the bacteria community. © 2019, Published by NRC Research Press.","Artificial reefs; Environmental factor correlation analysis; Function genes; Sediment bacterial community","hydrocarbon; nitrate; RNA 16S; sulfur derivative; RNA 16S; artificial reef; bacterium; correlation; diversity index; environmental factor; gene; marine sediment; microbial community; molecular ecology; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Bacillus; bacterial structures; Bacteroidetes; bay; Betaproteobacteria; coral reef; degradation; Deltaproteobacteria; Desulfobulbus; environmental factor; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; gene function; Halomonas; heterotrophy; intestine; Lutibacter; Lutimonas; Marinobacter; Marinobacterium; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; Proteobacteria; Ralstonia; sediment; species diversity; Sulfurovum; total organic carbon; Vibrio; animal; bacterial structures; bacterium; bay; ecology; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; sediment; Bohai Bay; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Structures; Bays; Coral Reefs; Ecology; Geologic Sediments; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062395958

Using the national recommendation method, we calculated the carbon emissions data of Shaanxi’s thermal power in the 1995-2015 period, and analyzed the response to environmental management policies. The policy response selects energy industry development and environmental governance as the endogenous variables, and uses the methods of co-integration and error correction model to analyze the long-term ensuring future equilibrium and short-term impact mechanism for the three. Based on variance decomposition, this paper refines the contribution of dynamic energy industry development and environmental governance to thermal power carbon emissions. The research shows that the carbon emission of thermal power in Shaanxi province rose from 1891.63 × 104 t in 1995 to the peak of 11086.14 × 104 t in 2010, and then the improvement of energy efficiency has brought a downward trend of carbon emissions. Energy industry development and environmental governance can negatively effect carbon emissions from thermal power plants. In the long run, carbon emissions from thermal power plants can be gradually reduced. The contribution of the two variables is about 5% and 6% respectively, which has great room for improvement. © 2019, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Call mechanism; Efficiency improvement; Energy industry development; Environmental governance; Pollution reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070542077

Despite several advantages of OFDM, its less pronounced frequency localization property and considerable out-of-band (OOB) emissions make it less suited for many applications in 5G such as massive machine communications and Internet of Things. In order to reduce the high OOB emissions, novel multicarrier modulation techniques like universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC) and generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) employing improved pulse shaping are currently being investigated. An important aspect is “spectral shaping”, i.e., generating spectral notches in OFDM signals, as already explored in the past for applications in ultra-wideband (UWB) systems. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of suppressing OOB emissions employing FIR-filtering and active interference cancellation (AIC), respectively, in the context of 5G scenarios. Moreover, we propose a novel scheme to combine AIC and FIR-filtering into one multicarrier transmission system, i.e., UFMC with AIC. The simulation results show that the proposed AIC algorithm for UFMC reduces OOB emissions more effectively and introduces less spectral overshoot compared to the conventional method while hardly increasing computational complexity. © VDE Verlag GMBH.

Meanwhile, the air quality comprehensive evaluation system has been constructed based on the six major pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, PM10, PM2.5 and O3) involved in China's current air quality national standards. After analyzing the monthly data of six pollutants in 11 cities of Zhejiang Province from January 2015 to April 2018 by the above method, the authors found that, although the air quality of cities in Zhejiang Province did not reach the long-term serious pollution of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, the air quality changes in the northern cities of Zhejiang were worse than those in southern Zhejiang. For example, the air quality of Shaoxing in northern Zhejiang has dropped by 14.85% in the last study period when compared with that of the beginning period, and Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, has also seen a decrease of 6.69% in air quality. The air quality of Lishui, Zhoushan and Wenzhou in southern Zhejiang has improved by 8.04%, 4.67% and 4.22% respectively. Apart from the geographical influence, the industrial structure of these cities is also an important cause for worse air quality. From the local areas in southern Zhejiang, cities have developed targeted air pollution control measures according to their own characteristics, including adjusting the industrial structure, changing the current energy consumption structure that heavily relies on coal, and improving laws and regulations on air pollution control, etc. In the four cities in central Zhejiang, the air quality at the end of the period (April 2018) has decreased from the beginning of the period (January 2015), given that there were no fundamental changes in their industrial structure and energy pattern. © 2019 by the authors.","Air quality; Entropy weight method; Fuzzy optimization model","air quality; atmospheric pollution; industrial structure; numerical method; numerical model; pollution control; urban pollution; China; China; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068851389

We previously found that deletion of ccpA, a key regulator of carbon catabolite repression (CCR), reduced transformation efficiency of Streptococcus oligofermentans, the current work further investigated the regulatory mechanisms of CcpA. The competence operon comCDE is subjected to basal and autoregulatory transcription. A luciferase reporter detected a transcriptional readthrough (TRT) from the upstream tRNAArg into the comCDE operon, which was induced by L-arginine. Insertion of the Escherichia coli T1T2 terminator downstream of tRNAArg abolished TRT, and reduced the basal comCDE transcription by 77% and also the transformation efficiency. Deletion of ccpA increased tRNAArg TRT and tRNAArg-comCDE polycistronic transcript by twofold. An in vitro transcription assay determined that CcpA promoted the transcription termination of tRNAArg TRT, and RNA EMSA and SPR assays detected equal binding affinity of CcpA to both the RNA and DNA of tRNAArg. These results indicate that CcpA controls the basal comCDE transcription by post-transcriptional actions. Overexpression of comDE or its phospho-mimicking mutant comDED58E reduced transformation efficiency, indicating that excessive ComE impairs competence development. CCR-regulated competence was further confirmed by higher tRNAArg TRT but lower transformation efficiency in galactose than in glucose. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"2 chloro 6 n cyclopentyladenosine; bacterial protein; catabolite control protein A; ComE protein; transfer RNA; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; carbon; repressor protein; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterium competence; binding affinity; CcpA gene; comDE gene; controlled study; DNA sequence; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; gene inactivation; gene overexpression; gene rearrangement; gene sequence; in vitro study; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; promoter region; protein DNA binding; protein phosphorylation; Streptococcus; Streptococcus oligofermentans; transcription regulation; transcription termination; catabolite repression; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; operon; Streptococcus; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; Catabolite Repression; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Operon; Repressor Proteins; Streptococcus; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066118748

The results show that this metastable phase material displays anisotropic mechanical properties, and its in-plane Young's modulus is comparable with that of penta-graphene. DHQ-graphene is a metallic carbon material with a much higher electronic density of states of around 0.193 eV per states per atom. Equally importantly, it is also found that the most favorable adsorption site is the bridge site in the edge shared by the six- and ten-membered rings of DHQ-graphene, which has a stronger adsorption energy for oxygen (-0.27 eV) with dispersion correction (DFT-D3). The charge transfer from a DHQ-graphene sheet to an O atom amounts to 0.834e, 3.35% higher than that of perfect graphene. This implies that DHQ-graphene should have a good ability to adsorb oxygen with an easily controlled adsorption structure. Interestingly, it may conceivably be synthesized by a bottom-up approach from the carbon skeleton of naphthalene (C10H8). In addition, a 3D stacked structure of this material has also been investigated.

This study examines precipitation shifts in the Hulan River Basin - a cold watershed located in a black soil region in Northeast China, analyzes influences of such precipitation shifts on performance of the current remote sensing precipitation products within the considered region, and particularly in sub-regions with rapid precipitation shifts, investigates how well can precipitation occurrence, amounts and trends be detected from space. Utilizing local precipitation data and three latest TRMM products (3B42V7, 3B42RT, CHIRPS), rapid precipitation shifts in the region and their evident influences on retrieval accuracies are proved. Nevertheless, there are still considerable uncertainties associated with the mechanisms and drivers of such precipitation shifts and it remains undetermined whether such rapid precipitation shifts are representative in other black soil regions. These two unresolved issues are essentially significant, and therefore, should be future research priorities towards a better performance of remote sensing precipitation products in black soil regions. &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Climate action; Land surface feedbacks; Retrieval","Cognitive systems; Earth (planet); Signal processing; Soils; Space optics; Surface measurement; Climate action; Land surface; Precipitation data; Precipitation distribution; Precipitation products; Research priorities; Retrieval; Retrieval accuracy; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065713146

Global climate change mitigation, and ecological sustainability in general, therefore crucially depend on the sustainability practices of urban residents. Present climate change policies are not working, as annual emissions are still growing. Clearly, new approaches are needed. One possible new approach is to implement smart city policies. In this paper, the potential for smart city policies to help make significant energy (and related greenhouse gas) savings in urban transport and building construction and operation is investigated. The main findings are that although significant potential exists, it will not be realised unless supporting policies are in place.

Furthermore, energy management strategies (EMSs) play a pivotal role in the performance of HEVs. This paper presents a novel real-time EMS, namely fuzzy adaptive-equivalent consumption minimization strategy (Fuzzy A-ECMS), for a parallel HEV. The proposed EMS is formulated by combining the ECMS, which is derived from Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP), with a fuzzy logic controller adjusting the equivalent factor (EF) based on the deviation between reference state of charge (SOC) and actual SOC for a better SOC trajectory. Improved fuel economy and SOC charge sustainability are the main control objectives. To test and verify the performance of the studied controller, comparative simulations of the Fuzzy A-ECMS and rule-based EMS, conventional SOC-based A-ECMS together with standard ECMS under different standard driving cycles and a real driving cycle are conducted via MATLAB/Simulink and AVL CRUISE.

Current greenhouse CO2 control strategy usually depends on expert experience, which may control [CO2] in a moderate range but cannot make it optimal due to lack of considering plant photochemistry reactions. A state-space kinetic model structure covering major photosynthetic reactions as affected by CO2 is useful for [CO2] control strategy development in a greenhouse because modern control theories are usually based on state-space models. In this work, a state-space kinetic model structure for photosynthesis was built, which describes the major reaction cascades of photophosphorylation, Calvin cycle, and biophysical processes such as CO2 transport through the stomata under moderate [CO2] range without considering photorespiration. Simulations were performed with a large range of model parameters to demonstrate the effect of [CO2] on stable sugar production and the flexibilities of the developed model structure. The results clearly show whether increasing of CO2 will lead to more production of sugar or not in different scenarios. The model structure may be extended to cover other photosynthetic influence factors such as temperature by using the well-known Arrhenius equation. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018",,"Greenhouses; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Photosynthesis; State space methods; Arrhenius equation; Biophysical process; Control strategies; Modelling and simulations; Modern control theory; Photophosphorylation; Photosynthetic activity; Photosynthetic reaction; Carbon dioxide; carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; biological model; carbon cycle; kinetics; metabolism; phosphorylation; photosynthesis; plant; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Phosphorylation; Photosynthesis; Plants; Sugars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066958619

The structure and dispersion of titanium species for the as-synthesised materials and their influence on the catalytic performance of Zn catalysts in the acetylene hydration reaction were systematically studied. All of the synthesised materials were characterised by FTIR, XRD, BET, TEM, NH 3 -TPD, XPS, TG and solid-state UV-vis techniques. NH 3 -TPD and pyridine FTIR confirm that the incorporation of titanium species greatly enhanced the acid sites and total acid quantity. The XRD, TEM and UV-vis results reveal that the addition of titania in the form of Ti 4+ ions having a tetrahedral coordination can facilitate the control of zinc particle sizes and enhance the dispersion of zinc species. XPS suggests that the introduction of titania enhanced the enrichment of zinc species on the surfaces of supports. In addition, the superior interaction between active Zn species and the modified support effectively inhibited the deposition of carbon and the reduction of active Zn species during the reaction. Moreover, the incorporation of titania considerably enhanced the catalytic activity and stability of Zn/MCM catalysts.

To improve fuel economy and reduce emissions, lean-burn engines must regulate their FAR immediately under different operating conditions. The precision of FAR control is limited by the large time-varying feedback delay which is caused by mixture combustion, exhaust gas transport, and lean NOx trap (LNT) module. Hence, a FAR predictive controller is proposed to track the desired FAR value precisely in the control framework of feedforward and feedback control. First of all, a feedforward predictive model for the FAR in the cylinder and a feedback predictive model for the FAR in the exhaust pipe with a time-delay characteristic are built respectively. Next, the FAR tracking requirement and the physical actuator constraints are transformed into the optimization objective function. Finally, a feedback/embedded feedforward predictive controller is designed, and the optimization problems are solved online to obtain the fuel injection quality. The simulation results based on GT-POWER illustrate that the proposed predictive control algorithm with feedforward predictive control can track the dynamic FAR precisely in a wide range. Meanwhile, the feedback controller decreases the effects of time delay and parameters uncertainty on the system dynamics. © 2013 IEEE.","feedforward predictive control; fuel-air ratio; Lean-burn engine; state observer","Delay control systems; Exhaust systems (engine); Feedback control; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gases; Model predictive control; Time delay; Different operating conditions; Feedforward and feedback control; Fuel-air ratios; Lean-burn engines; Optimization objective function; Predictive control; Predictive control algorithm; State observer; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068329451

But China's trading program is likely to face significant challenges, due to its large scale and high complexity. First, the accuracy and credibility of China's emissions data have been widely criticized. There are significant inconsistencies between the national and provincial emissions inventories, and the facility-level data are even less satisfying. Institutional capacities related to the carbon market need to be significantly enhanced to strengthen monitoring, reporting, and verifying capabilities. Second, compared to emissions trading programs in other parts of the world, China's program is likely to face greater market volatility, due to the country's economic structural transition from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy. Wise cap-setting and allowance allocation methods and proper price containment mechanisms are needed to maintain market stability. And third, China is a market economy with many features of a central planning system, particularly in the energy sector. Large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) do not act as profit-maximizing entities, and their behaviors could undermine the efficiency of the cap-and-trade program. To address these challenges, we provide a series of policy recommendations, including capacity building from central to local levels, wise selection of allowance allocation methods to cope with changing economic realities, and deepening market-oriented reforms in energy sectors and SOEs.

The electronic absorption spectra of 1-3 in toluene all featured strongly absorbing ligand-center 1π,π∗ transitions below 380 nm, broad and intense diimine ligand-localized 1ILCT (intraligand charge transfer)/1π,π∗ transitions at 380-450 nm, weaker 1LLCT (ligand-to-ligand charge transfer)/1MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) transitions at 450-520 nm, and very weak spin-forbidden 3LLCT/3MLCT/3π,π∗ transitions at 550-680 nm. Variations of the core diimine ligand from phen to dppz caused a slight red-shift of the absorption bands at &lt;450 nm for 2 compared to that of 1; while changing the core diimine ligand to dppn in 3 induced a more pronounced red-shift of the bands at 380-680 nm compared to those of 1 and 2. All three complexes exhibited structured room-temperature phosphorescence maximized at 590 nm and broad triplet excited-state absorption at 450-800 nm in toluene. However, the emission quantum yield of 3 was more than two orders of magnitude lower than those of 1 and 2 in toluene because the emitting state of 3 was the 2nd triplet excited state (T2). The nature of the lowest triplet excited state (T1) in toluene varied from the piq ligand localized 3π,π∗ mixed with some 3MLCT/3LMCT (ligand-to-metal charge transfer) characters in 1 and 2 to dppn ligand-based 3π,π∗/3ILCT configuration in 3. The different nature of the T1 state in 3 resulted in a much stronger transient absorption (TA) at ca. 540 nm and 600-800 nm with a much longer TA lifetime (∼23 μs). In addition, the T1 state varied from pig ligand-localized 3π,π∗/3MLCT/3LMCT in toluene to dppz localized 3π,π∗/3ILCT state in CH3CN for 2, which resulted in a shorter triplet lifetime, reduced emission quantum yield, but stronger TA signals in the NIR regions for 2 in CH3CN. Because of the strong triplet excited-state absorption of 1-3 at 532 nm, all three complexes manifested strong reverse saturable absorption (RSA) at 532 nm, with the RSA trend following 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1. Fluorenyl substitution not only enhanced the RSA at 532 nm for 2 and 3, but also made them potential broadband reverse saturable absorbers. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",,"iridium complex; phenanthroline derivative; toluene; absorption; Article; conjugation; controlled study; phosphorescence; pig; priority journal; quantum yield; room temperature; spectroscopy; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077433948

The results indicate that the electronic structure of anions contributes greatly to the charge distribution of the Li+ solvation sheath, and consequently extends to the thermodynamics of the carbonate molecules, affecting reduction, oxidation reaction and products on the interface between electrolytes and electrodes.

Hourly demand data for space heating, swimming pool heating, hot water and electricity provision as well as the local weather data are used as inputs to a transient model developed in TRNSYS. Economic performance is evaluated by considering the investment costs and the cost savings due to the reduced electricity and natural gas consumptions. The results show that 38.2% of the electricity demand can be satisfied by the PV/T S-CHP system based on an installation area of 4,000 m2. The coverage increases to 81.3% if the excess electricity is fed to the grid. In addition, the system can cover 23.7% of the space heating demand and 53.8% of the demand for the swimming pool and hot water heating. A comparison with an equivalent gas-fired internal combustion engine (ICE) CHP system shows that the PV/T system has a longer payback time, i.e., 11.6 years vs. 3 years, but significantly outperforms the ICE solution in terms of CO2 emission reduction, i.e., 435 tons CO2/year vs. 164 tons CO2/year. These findings suggest that even though the economic competitiveness of the proposed PV/T S-CHP system is not yet favourable when compared to the alternative gas-fired ICE-based system, the S-CHP solution has an excellent decarbonisation potential, and that if this is of importance in the wider sense of energy-system decarbonisation, it is necessary to consider how the higher upfront costs can be addressed. © 2019 The Authors.

The taxation of China’s coal industry affects the progress of world emissions reduction to some extent. This paper establishes six countermeasure scenarios with different tax systems considering carbon tax and indirect tax, then constructs a dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium model to simulate the tax system changes of the coal industry. It turns out that in both rural and urban populations, coal consumption is more sensitive to the carbon tax and indirect tax compared with the consumption of other commodities. The reduction effect of increasing tax will grow and social reduction cost will be reduced over time. Increasing the coal industry tax can reduce CO2 emissions significantly and will suffer relatively less GDP loss, for example increasing 20% of indirect tax on the coal industry will lead to 3.65 billion tons of CO2 reduction during 2018-2030, accounting for 10.05% of 2015 world CO2 emissions. We found that increasing taxes can improve all industries’ energy efficiency, which reflects on the powerful role of the coal industry in guiding the market to reducing CO2 emissions. Finally, these results strongly recommend that China should increase indirect tax as quickly as possible to reach the long-term interests as soon as possible. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

Moreover, the frequency of N inputs may affect primary productivity but is rarely studied. To assess the response patterns of above- and belowground productivity to rates of N addition under different addition frequencies, we manipulated the rate (0–50 g N m−2 year−1) and frequency (twice vs. monthly additions per year) of NH4NO3 inputs for six consecutive years in a temperate grassland in northern China and measured ANPP and BNPP from 2012 to 2014. In the low range of N addition rates, BNPP showed the greatest negative response and ANPP showed the greatest positive responses with increases in N addition (&lt;10 g N m−2 year−1). As N addition increased beyond 10 g N m−2 year−1, increases in ANPP dampened and decreases in BNPP ceased altogether. The response pattern of net primary productivity (combined above- and belowground; NPP) corresponded more closely to ANPP than to BNPP. The N effects on BNPP and BNPP/NPP (fBNPP) were not dependent on N addition frequency in the range of N additions typically associated with N deposition. BNPP was more sensitive to N addition frequency than ANPP, especially at low rates of N addition. Our findings provide new insights into how plants regulate carbon allocation to different organs with increasing N rates and changing addition frequencies. These root response patterns, if incorporated into Earth system models, may improve the predictive power of C dynamics in dryland ecosystems in the face of global atmospheric N deposition. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aboveground net primary productivity; belowground net primary productivity; N deposition; N response efficiency; root fraction","aboveground production; asymmetry; atmospheric deposition; belowground production; carbon cycle; enrichment; net primary production; nitrogen; resource allocation; root system; semiarid region; steppe; temperate environment; China; carbon; nitrogen; China; ecosystem; plant; Carbon; China; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068026535

The traditional approach for the uncertainty estimation is to conduct an ensemble of simulations where the model configuration is perturbed and/or different models are considered. This procedure is very computationally expensive and may not be feasible, in particular for higher-resolution experiments. In this paper, a new method based on Bayesian hierarchical models (BHMs) that requires just one model run is proposed. It is applied to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model's 2-m temperature in the Botnia-Atlantica region in Scandinavia for a 10-day period in the winter and summer seasons. For both seasons, the estimated uncertainty using the BHM is found to be comparable to that obtained from an ensemble of experiments in which different planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes are employed. While WRF-BHM is not capable of generating the full set of products obtained from an ensemble of simulations, it can be used to extract commonly used diagnostics including the uncertainty estimation that is the focus of this work. The methodology proposed here is fully general and can easily be extended to any other output variable and numerical model. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"Boundary layers; Climate models; Hierarchical systems; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Bayesian hierarchical model; Model configuration; Planetary boundary layers; Surface radiation; Traditional approaches; Uncertainty estimation; Weather research and forecasting models; Weather simulation; Weather forecasting; Bayesian analysis; computer simulation; estimation method; hierarchical system; numerical model; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067338933

The Western region has undertaken an industrial transfer from the Eastern and Central regions. Therefore, the CO2 emission intensity in the western region is higher than those of the Eastern and Central regions of China, and consequently its low-carbon development pathway has an important impact for China as a whole. Sichuan Province is not only the province with the highest CO2 emissions, but also the most economically developed province in Western China in 2018. In order to promote low carbon development in the western region, it is important to understand the features of emissions in Sichuan Province and to formulate effective energy strategies accordingly. This paper uses the IPCC regional emission accounting method to calculate the carbon emissions of 15 cities in Sichuan province, and to comply with the city-level emission accounts. The results show that the total carbon emissions of Sichuan province over the past 10 years was 3258.32 mt and reached a peak in 2012. The smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, coal mining and dressing were the leading sectors that contributed to the emissions, accounting for 17.86% and 15.82%, respectively. Raw coal, cleaned coal, and coke were the most significant contributors to CO2 emissions, accounting for 43.73%, 9.55%, and 6.60%, respectively. Following the above results, the Sichuan provincial government can formulate differentiated energy structure policies according to different energy consumption structures and carbon emission levels in the 15 cities. By controlling the level of total emissions and regulating larger industrial emitters in Sichuan province, some useful information could be provided as an essential reference for low-carbon development in Western China, and contribute to the promotion of emissions mitigation from a more holistic perspective. © 2019 by the authors.

However, very few studies have been undertaken to investigate the environmental impacts of HACs at the city level. This is particular the case in Shenzhen, a megacity with rapid development in South China. This paper, therefore, is designed to assess the carbon emissions from the usage stage of air conditioners in residential buildings, including energy and refrigerants effects. The results show that the total carbon emissions from the service stage of HACs in Shenzhen have generally increased in the past decade. The main contributor is electricity consumption, which accounts for nearly 80% of the total emissions, followed by refrigerants leak (20%). Meantime, the electricity consumption of HACs takes up nearly 30% of the total residential electricity consumption, which should be taken as the critical issue for building energy efficiency. Besides, the refrigerants leak and associated impact should not be overlooked due to significant impact on emission reduction. To summarize, these findings provide a valuable basis for energy conservation and emission reduction in the HACs sector in cities. © Advancement of Construction Management and Real Estate, CRIOCM 2017.All right reserved.","Carbon emissions; Electricity; Household air conditioners (HACs); Refrigerant leak","Carbon; Domestic appliances; Electric power utilization; Electricity; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Housing; Project management; Refrigerants; Building energy efficiency; Carbon emissions; Electricity-consumption; Emission reduction; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Household air conditioners (HACs); Residential building; Residential electricity consumption; Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069850227

With continuing economic growth and climate change, lake abundance and surface areas throughout the world have been threatened by many factors, including by human and environmental disruptions. However, we still have limited knowledge on how human activities and climate change affect lake reductions and associated ecosystem services. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of lake shrinkage will help maintain an ecological balance in urban planning, especially in rapidly developing countries. We explore the determinants of lake shrinkage and abundance reduction from the 1980s to the 2010s using remote sensing data of lakes in two large cities in eastern China: Nanchang and Shanghai. In order to account for the non-independence of time-series data, time series auto-regressive generalized least squares (GLS) models were used to examine the relationship between lake area/abundance and human activities and climate change. Our results show that human activities rather than climate change, are the most important determinants for the areas and numbers of lake shrinkage, and gross domestic product (GDP) and population size could explain more than half of the variation in the number and area of lakes with areas larger than 20 ha in the two cities. GDP and lake area shrinkage do not exhibit a linear relationship. This highlights the importance of wetland protection in the early development stage. Because the main determinants are human activities, cities have the ability to protect wetlands via suitable planning. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

This paper estimates the carbon emissions at the provincial, municipal, and county spatial scales in the Yangtze River Delta region during 2008-2015. On this basis, this paper makes a comprehensive analysis of the pathway and difference of the urbanization to the carbon emission by using the scale variance decomposition method, the space correlation analysis method, the mediation effect test method, and the space panel data model. The results show that the urbanization of the Yangtze River Delta has a significant positive impact on carbon emissions; The pathway from urbanization to industrial structure has a significant impact on carbon emissions. Although the pathway from industrial structure to urbanization to carbon emissions is insignificant, the industrial structure directly affects carbon emissions. There is a significant path from urbanization to the level of economic development to carbon emissions, but there is no mechanism for the economic development level to adversely affect the level of urbanization and thus affect carbon emissions; the chain action pathway from the urbanization level to the employment level to the economic development level to carbon emissions is not significant.

The assembly was formed on 1.0 μm thick mesoporous films of NiO using a layer-by-layer procedure based on Zr(iv)-phosphonate bridging units. The structure of the Zr(iv) bridged assembly, abbreviated as NiO-DA-RuCP22+-Re(i), where DA is the dianiline-based electron donor (N,N,N′,N′-((CH2)3PO3H2)4-4,4′-dianiline), RuCP2+ is the light absorber [Ru((4,4′-(PO3H2CH2)2-2,2′-bipyridine)(2,2′-bipyridine))2]2+, and Re(i) is the CO2 reduction catalyst, ReI((4,4′-PO3H2CH2)2-2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl. Visible light excitation of the assembly in CO2 saturated solution resulted in CO2 reduction to CO. A steady-state photocurrent density of 65 μA cm-2 was achieved under one sun illumination and an IPCE value of 1.9% was obtained with 450 nm illumination. The importance of the DA aniline donor in the assembly as an initial site for reduction of the RuCP2+ excited state was demonstrated by an 8 times higher photocurrent generated with DA present in the surface film compared to a control without DA. Nanosecond transient absorption measurements showed that the expected reduced one-electron intermediate, RuCP+, was formed on a sub-nanosecond time scale with back electron transfer to the electrode on the microsecond timescale which competes with forward electron transfer to the Re(i) catalyst at t1/2 = 2.6 μs (kET = 2.7 × 105 s-1). © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aniline; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Chlorine compounds; Chromophores; Electron transitions; Excited states; Light; Lithium compounds; Nickel oxide; Zirconium compounds; Back electron transfer; Electron intermediate; Electron transfer; Nanosecond transient absorption; One-sun illumination; Photocurrent density; Saturated solutions; Visible light excitation; Rhenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064623557

However, few studies have specified the relationship between invasive plant expansion and ecoregions at the global scale under climate change. To address this gap, we provide risk maps highlighting the response of invasive plant species (IPS), with a focus on terrestrial and freshwater ecoregions to climate change, and further explore the climatic features of ecosystems with a high potential for invasive plant expansion under climate change. We use species distribution modelling to predict the suitable habitats of IPS with records at the global scale. Hotspots with a potential risk of IPS (such as aquatic plants, trees, and herbs) expanding in global ecoregions were distributed in Northern Europe, the UK, South America, North America, southwest China, and New Zealand. Temperature changes were related to the potential of IPS expansion in global ecoregions under climate change. Coastal and high latitude ecoregions, such as temperate forests, alpine vegetation, and coastal rivers, were severely infiltrated by IPS under climate change. Monitoring strategies should be defined for climate change for IPS, particularly for aquatic plants, trees, and herbs in the biomes of regions with coastal or high latitudes. The role of climate change on the potential for IPS expansion should be taken into consideration for biological conservation and risk evaluation of IPS at ecoregional scales. © 2019 Wang et al.","Climate change; Freshwater ecoregions; Invasive plant species; ISSG; Species distribution modelling; Terrestrial ecoregions","ice; alpine tundra; aquatic environment; area under the curve; Article; biogeographic region; biome; cell expansion; cell invasion; circadian rhythm; climate change; conservation biology; desert; ecological niche; ecosystem; freshwater environment; grassland; habitat; herb; inland water; invasive plant species; lake; mangrove; Mediterranean forest; montane grassland; precipitation; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; river; rock; savanna; scrub; sensitivity and specificity; species distribution; taiga; temperate conifer forest; temperate deciduous forest; temperature; tree; tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest; tundra; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063636618

Opencast coal mining and burning of coal for electricity have caused a series of environmental challenges. Biogenic generation of methane from coal possesses the potential to improve economic and environmental outcomes of clean coal utilization. However, whether the microbes inhabiting the grassland soil have the functional potential to convert coal into biomethane is still unclear. Results: Microbial communities in an opencast coal mine and in grassland soil covering and surrounding this mine and their biomethane production potential were investigated by Hiseq sequencing and anaerobic cultivation. The microbial communities in covering soil showed high similarity to those in the surrounding soil, according to the pairwise weighted UniFrac distances matrix. The majority of bacterial communities in coal and soil samples belonged to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The dominant bacterial genera in grassland soil included Gaiella, Solirubrobacter, Sphingomonas and Streptomyces; whereas, the most abundant genus in coal was Pseudarthrobacter. In soil, hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium was the dominant methanogen, and this methanogen, along with acetoclastic Methanosarcina and methylotrophic Methanomassiliicoccus, was detected in coal. Network-like Venn diagram showed that an average of 28.7% of microbial communities in the samples belonged to shared genera, indicating that there is considerable microbial overlap between coal and soil samples. Potential degraders and methanogens in the soil efficiently stimulated methane formation from coal samples by the culturing-based approach. The maximum biogenic methane yields from coal degradation by the microbial community cultured from grassland soil reached 22.4 μmol after 28 day. Conclusion: The potential microbial coal degraders and methanogenic archaea in grassland soil were highly diverse. Significant amounts of biomethane were generated from coal by the addition of grassland soil microbial communities. The unique species present in grassland soil may contribute to efficient methanogenic coal bioconversion. This discovery not only contributes to a better understanding of global microbial biodiversity in coal mine environments, but also makes a contribution to our knowledge of the synthetic microbiology with regard to effective methanogenic microbial consortia for coal degradation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biomethane; Coal; Grassland soil; Microbial community; Opencast coal mine","Bacteria; Biodiversity; Coal; Ecosystems; Methane; Methanogens; Proven reserves; Soil surveys; Soils; Synthetic biology; Anaerobic cultivation; Biomethane; Environmental challenges; Environmental outcome; Grassland soils; Microbial biodiversity; Microbial communities; Opencast Coal Mine; Coal mines; biogas; coal mine; grassland soil; methane; microbial community; opencast mining; soil biota; China; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Firmicutes; Methanobacterium; Methanosarcina; Proteobacteria; Solirubrobacter; Sphingomonas; Streptomyces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073677756

Existing literature on climate analogues struggles with 2 methodological challenges: How to deal with the unavoidable uncertainty of climate projections and how to define reasonable lower limits of similarity for climate analogues. Here, we suggest a new method to identify robust climate analogues (RCAs) based on a clustering approach in climate space where each spatial grid element is represented by 3 points: Its current climate, and a lower and upper bound of the climate projections. If the upper and lower bound of the projections for such a grid element share the same cluster and, additionally, this cluster contains current climate points, then the grid elements related to the latter are defined as RCAs. This definition divides the map of the investigated region into areas with RCAs and uncharted areas where, under the current uncertainty range of climate projections, such an attribution is not justified. An exemplary application of the algorithm for Europe shows that RCAs can be identified for 37% of the land area and that the new method allows selection of socioeconomically reasonable RCAs from climatologically equivalent (given the current uncertainty) grid elements. © 2019 Inter-Research.

Increasing government legislation is driving towards greener vehicles with reduced CO2 and NOx emissions and greater fuel economy, especially within urban environments. Manufacturers use new technologies in their powertrain systems to tackle these problems. This paper simulates and evaluates the performance of using a half toroidal CVT in series with a conventional multi-speed transmission, by analysing different shifting strategies to optimise fuel consumption and NOx emissions over the NEDC using this novel approach. The results show an 8.83% increase in fuel economy and up to an 11.34% reduction in NOx emissions is possible using this arrangement. The introduction of CVT adds a further 1.18% increase in fuel economy and 3.59% decrease in NOx emissions. The paper concludes that this novel arrangement should be considered by automotive manufacturers as a solution for improvements to powertrain technology.

As no co-location study was undertaken, this work retro-spectively investigates whether the supersite relocation has led to discontinuities in the time series of concentrations of commonly studied gaseous pollutants (NOx, NH3, SO2 and O3) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10 ). Two years of measurements pre-and post-relocation (2014–15 and 2016–17 respectively) were analysed in conjunction with meteorological variables and local emission data. The deweather package was applied to the concatenated time series to minimise the influence of meteorology. Similar average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and O3 were observed, but there were substantial differences in that of NOx and NH3 (increase by factors of ∼1.6 and ∼3, respectively). The considerably higher NH3 concentrations at Chilbolton are attributed to the close proximity of mixed farmland, in particular to a strong south-westerly source contributing to ∼50% of the annual average. NOx and PM concentrations in easterly winds arriving at Chilbolton are ∼2.7 and ∼1.5 times larger than at Harwell, from sources including the M3 motorway and Greater London. Westerly concentrations of NOx remain similar, therefore despite a higher frequency of westerly wind, annual mean concentrations are larger. Lower concentrations of PM arriving from the west result in similar annual averages. The secondary inorganic and black carbon components of PM were broadly similar between the sites. The differences in average NOx and NH3 at Chilbolton must be taken into account when considering long-term regional trends based on the southern UK supersite data. © 2019 The Author(s).

By this model, we aim to reduce the total cost of power allocation. The model is applied to solve a problem of electricity allocation in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The main problems of electricity in East Kalimantan are the power outages, high prices, and high emission despite the abundance of gas and coal. The proposed model attempts to reduce these problems altogether. Four scenarios are applied to find the best possible solution. The scenarios are using power generated by: 1) the state electricity company (SEC); 2) the SEC and the independent power producer (IPP); 3) the SEC and a rental power plant (Rent); 4) the SEC and a private company (PC). The experiments show that using power generated by SEC + IPP produces the cheapest fuel cost and minimum outages. While SEC + Rent produces the smallest emissions and outages. There is no scenario that can reduce outages, prices, and emissions simultaneously.

Living space is needed to mitigate the (further) inordinate increase of rents in some cities and regions and to ease finding appropriate flats at affordable prices for low- and medium-income households. But how to activate investors and the real estate market? Having the triangle of sustainability in mind with its ecologic, social and economic cornerstones the discussion - metaphorically spoken - currently pulls the three corners: Which should have the highest priority? The economically driven most favourable solution is lowering the requirements for new buildings such as the energy performance to make building cheaper. The social perspective prefers an increase of public social housing investments regardless of efficiency standards. And the ecological side argues that a high performance is needed to reach energy and climate targets in the buildings sector. Starting at this point of discussion, firstly, the paper reflects the assumptions behind the numbers of new homes needed against a sufficiency background. Secondly, it presents current changes in German building policies: a new legislation for energy supply and efficiency is currently in preparation. It discusses the potential to integrate sufficiency aspects in building policies, focussing specifically on the new regulation, financial incentives, and energy advice. The paper analyses if and to what extent it is likely to balance the three cornerstones of sustainability by integrating sufficiency aspects into efficiency policies. Household experiences with prepayment meters are used as an example to illustrate the potential for tapping efficiency and sufficiency potentials in low-income households considering social, economic, and ecological aspects. Based on the identified (in)consistencies, thirdly, it suggests further development in German policies to make better use of synergies between the ecologic, social and economic demands on buildings. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Vegetation cover can influence rates of greenhouse gas production through differences in microbial communities, plant carbon uptake potential, and root transport of gases out of the soil into the atmosphere. To predict future changes in greenhouse gas production from High Arctic ecosystems in response to climate change, it is important to understand the interaction between trace gas fluxes and vegetation cover. During the growing seasons of 2008 and 2009, we used dark static chambers to measure CH4 and N2O fluxes and CO2 emissions at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, NU, across a soil moisture gradient, as reflected by their vegetation cover. In both years, wet sedge had the highest rates of emission for all trace gases, followed by the mesic tundra ecosystem. CH4 consumption was highest in the polar semi-desert, correlating positively with temperature and negatively with moisture. Our findings demonstrate that net CH4 uptake may be largely underestimated across the Arctic due to sampling bias towards wetlands. Overall, greenhouse gas flux responses vary depending on different environmental drivers, and the role of vegetation cover needs to be considered in predicting the trajectory of greenhouse gas uptake and release in response to a changing climate. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

How this change in activity influences fungi inhabiting those roots is not well known. Particularly for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that rely exclusively on plant-derived carbon, these changes may exert significant pressure on fungi, leading to functional or compositional changes. As part of a larger study examining the effects of vineyard groundcover vegetation on root-associated fungi in a model grapevine, we asked how AM fungi change both in terms of distribution of fungal structures and community structure as roots age and if this depends on the legacy effect of unique microbial communities associated with different groundcovers. AM fungal communities varied with groundcover vegetation but not between young and old roots. AM fungal structures, however, differed between young and old roots with more arbuscules in young roots and more vesicles and/or spores in older roots. This trend was consistent across the different groundcover-trained communities, although one groundcover led to more arbuscules overall. We discuss these changes in light of our current understanding of the temporal dynamics of the AM symbiosis in aging roots and pose several hypotheses and directions for future research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Arbuscule; Cover crops; Grapevine; Root senescence; Vesicle",,Article in Press,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060187924

Frequent congestions in the cities cause the increase of delays, stop-and-go actions and especially travel times. Up-to-date methods of traffic control are focused on advanced intelligent transport systems solutions in order to increase the quality of urban traffic network. This is directly affects improvement of traffic parameters quality such as travel time, delay, etc. Also, defined parameters affect the quality of environmental factors in urban traffic network (emission of pollution from motor vehicles, fuel consumption, noise level, etc.). Higher level of traffic control is enabled by direct real-time communication between vehicles (personal vehicles, public transport vehicles, etc.). This method outperforms traditional fixed cycle management of signalized intersections, which use predetermined signal plans. Benefits of using cooperative actuated control where model with implemented control algorithms is compared with existing traffic model with fixed time signal plans are described.

Most future climate change studies consider changes between arbitrary time periods. We specify these time periods by splitting climate-change impacted streamflow time series at instances of highest change, by using statistical tests. We used the daily streamflow from 2000 to 2099 simulated from a comprehensive ensemble of the EURO-CORDEX climate change data in three basins across Germany (Treene, lowland; Kinzig, mid-range mountain; and Ammer, pre-alpine). Change points in each basin were detected by using six change point tests. The robustness of changes was analyzed with a bootstrapping procedure. A set of 32 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) was used to examine characteristics of hydrologic changes in the simulated discharge time series between pre- and post-change-point period in absolute change and in deviation of the Range of Variability Approach (RVA). The results show that the occurrence of change points due to climate change is spread throughout the decades, but strongly clustered in the current and upcoming decade. The selection of global and regional climate models impacts the occurrence of change points to a greater extent than the choice of greenhouse gas emission scenarios and bias correction method. The highest significant alteration of IHA occurs in the lowland-, less in the alpine- and least in the mid-range mountain catchment. The transition of hydrologic regimes to an alternative state after the identified change points is likely to occur because the majority of indicators move out of the current state of RVA. We further notice ecoregion-dependent changes in summer discharges and extreme low flows, which increase in the lowland and decrease in the pre-alpine catchment. This may have a detrimental effect on local aquatic communities. We conclude that the combined analysis of simulated climate scenarios, change points and IHA enables a better interpretability of potential future hydrological changes both in timing and severity and provides an early warning signal of changes for climate change mitigation. © 2019 The Authors","Change point analysis; Climate change scenarios; Ecoregion; EURO-CORDEX; Indicators of Hydrological Alterations (IHA)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073732587

Achieving this goal requires an energy transition. This transition will have a large impact on Dutch society and the business community. It is important that Dutch citizens and companies support and agree on the policies that aim to accelerate and achieve the Dutch energy transition. This paper explores the legitimacy of these policies and how to measure the degree of such legitimacy. Policy legitimacy consists of public support for policy goals (input legitimacy) and support for the specific interventions needed to achieve these goals (output legitimacy). Policy legitimacy is based not only on effectiveness and efficiency, but also on other underlying aspects that are related to good governance. We conducted a survey among Dutch citizens and company representatives which shows there to be support (input legitimacy) for the Dutch climate policies. In other words, Dutch citizens and companies support their government's pursuit of an energy transition. We also explored two concrete interventions: 1) an 'in-home display', collectively paid for by all energy consumers, and 2) an in-home display that is paid for by the energy companies. Both types of interventions are supported by around 50 % of citizens and companies. Companies and citizens broadly agree with each other, although they are slightly more likely to support the type of intervention with the least negative impact on them. We found strong correlations between eight underlying aspects of legitimacy and the overall support for the interventions. The eight aspects had differing levels of appreciation, depending on the type of intervention. However, in general, we found fairness to carry more weight than cost-effectiveness. We also found that public support for a particular policy goal would not automatically result in support for the associated intervention. This last finding emphasises the importance of ex-ante testing of specific interventions, to determine the related level of public support, so that policy will be more effective and efficient. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Eight patients received three RT courses (2 re-RTs); of those 2 received 4 RT courses (3 re-RTs). Local relapse in the prostate was assessed by multiparametric magnetic resonance and/ or choline positron emission tomography. Before treatment planning, all patients had been evaluated for late toxicity from previous RT according to RTOG/EORTC. Biochemical control was assessed according to Phoenix definition. Mean age at the third RT course was 68 (standard deviation, SD: 7.2); all patients had a good performance status. At diagnosis, four cases were classified as high risk PCa, three as intermediate and one as low per NCCN 2017. Biochemical progression free interval after first and second RT-course were 74 (IQR: 59.3–133.6) months and 33 (IQR: 20.8–53.1) months, respectively. Biochemical and radiological response was registered in all patients. At present, seven out of eight patients are disease free. Overall toxicity profile was good; no severe acute or late genitourinary or gastrointestinal events were recorded. Multiple RT courses with high precision technology and image guidance can be proposed as a possible salvage therapy for locally recurrent, low-burden PCa recurrence in adequately selected patients. Deeper understanding of radiobiological effects of hypofractionation and larger series of patients are warranted to fully evaluate the applicability of multiple RT courses in the setting of locally recurrent PCa. © 2019, AEPress, s.r.o.

A superior activity of W-Rh-NPs with respect to E-Rh-NPs is ascribed to the absence of surface carbon reducible species derived from the synthesis in organic solvent, and thus confirms the importance of the use of water as the preferred medium for laser synthesis of clean nanocrystals in liquid environment.

However, in most adaptation actions, risks such as greenhouse gas emissions, and those that impose negative externalities on global communities and ecosystems, are often overlooked. This article contextualises adaptation of maize stover (MS) as a dairy cattle feed among resource-poor farmers in western Kenya. In so doing, it attempts to establish the nexus between resource constraint and maladaptation to climate change. Simulation of methane emissions was carried out from secondary data and a survey of dairy cattle feeding strategies by resource-poor farmers. The level of greenhouse gas emissions in dairy feeding strategies is used as a measure and indicator of sustainability.

High efficiency, increased metals recovery, decrease in capital and operational costs, possibility of easy control and adjustment are the advantages of adsorption processes. Anion-exchange resins and activated carbons are used as adsorbents. This paper presents Irgiredmet experience on gold adsorption technology using both adsorbents (RIP, RIL, CIP, CIL processes). It includes results of long-term studies of different theoretical and practical issues of adsorption processes. Irgiredmet started development of ion exchange technology (RIP, RIL) in 1964. Laboratory and pilot plant tests were conducted to develop process design criteria for 15 RIP plants of the former USSR. During this test work a great number of newly synthesized resins including strong- and medium-base resins was studied, different types of adsorption feed (ores and concentrates) were tested; some theoretical regularities of adsorption process were investigated; the technology of two stage adsorption for silver gold ore, improved flowsheet for gold elution and resin regeneration, designs of technological equipment for adsorption, elution, electrowinning processes including pulsation columns, electrowinning cells etc. were developed. Irgiredmet took part in commissioning of practically all RIP plants in the former USSR. Due to its efforts RIP process became to be the standard technology. Last Irgiredmet RIP projects include the development of adsorption technology using medium-base resin for the three mines owned by GC Petropavlovsk (Amur region, Russia). The complex of the testworks on activated carbon gold adsorption technology including the search of prospective activated carbons; study on gold adsorption mechanism; development, testing and introduction of process flowsheets and the equipment for their realization was conducted. The original gold elution process was developed. The developed CIP technology was firstly introduced at Lebedinsky gold plant (Yakutia). Now carbon adsorption technology is widely used at Russian gold mines as CIP, CIL, CIC processes.

In recent years, many regions on land and in the ocean experienced heat waves with devastating impacts that would have been highly unlikely without human-induced climate change. Impacts are particularly severe when heat waves occur in regions with high exposure of people or crops. The recent 2018 spring-to-summer season was characterized by several major heat and dry extremes. On daily average between May and July 2018 about 22% of the populated and agricultural areas north of 30° latitude experienced concurrent hot temperature extremes. Events of this type were unprecedented prior to 2010, while similar conditions were experienced in the 2010 and 2012 boreal summers. Earth System Model simulations of present-day climate, that is, at around +1 °C global warming, also display an increase of concurrent heat extremes. Based on Earth System Model simulations, we show that it is virtually certain (using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calibrated uncertainty language) that the 2018 north hemispheric concurrent heat events would not have occurred without human-induced climate change. Our results further reveal that the average high-exposure area projected to experience concurrent warm and hot spells in the Northern Hemisphere increases by about 16% per additional +1 °C of global warming. A strong reduction in fossil fuel emissions is paramount to reduce the risks of unprecedented global-scale heat wave impacts. ©2019.

Simultaneous temporal changes of abiotic and biotic conditions, such as in the composition of soil communities, soil carbon and nutrient concentrations, plant community assembly or selection processes, are currently discussed as potential drivers for strengthening BEF relationships. Despite the popularity of these explanations, experimental tests of underlying mechanisms of strengthening BEF relationships over time are scarce, and confounding influences of calendar year cannot be ruled out unless ecosystems of different age are compared in the same calendar years. To address this critical gap of knowledge, we reestablished the plant communities of a long-term biodiversity experiment that had started in 2002 (the Jena Experiment) with new seeds and old or new soil again in 2016. Comparing these treatments with the original communities set up in 2002, we tested whether old communities had stronger plant diversity effects on plant productivity than young ones and if this depended on soil- or plant-related processes. Our first results show that in old communities, the effect of plant diversity on productivity was indeed stronger than in young communities and that this could not be explained by the age of the soil only. However, we found significant effects of soil on the composition of soil organisms, which might be relevant for other ecosystem functions and may have stronger effects over time. Our new experimental approach enables us to test which mechanisms cause strengthening BEF relationships for many different ecosystem functions independent of the study year. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Community age; Ecosystem function; Experiment; Grassland; Nematodes; Plant history; Soil history",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069590980

The authors have provided more information as follows. In the manuscript entitled 'CO2 induced phase transitions in diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks', minor errors with the attached coordinates and energies reported in the paper have recently been identified. In this communication, we correct these errors. Here, we present updated optimized geometries and binding energies. We also take this opportunity to include an extended computational details section to ensure reproducibility. In addition, we show that the overall conclusions of the paper are not affected by these changes. A detailed comparison with the results reported by Lee et al.1 revealed that the DFT optimization of the coordinates provided with the manuscript do not lead to the values reported in the manuscript, and they warrant correction. Corrected coordinates and updated tables (Tables 1-7) and figures (Fig. 1, 2, 4 and 5) are included here for calculations using the PBE functional. These structures have been repeated using a slightly tighter force threshold than in the original manuscript (details below). The M06-L calculations reported in the original manuscript are not revisited since they were performed to assess the role of dispersion. Since the publication of our work in 2015, a far more detailed study of this effect has been published by one of the authors rendering these M06-L calculations unnecessary and we refer readers interested in the role of dispersion on the carbamate formation to this more recent study by Lee et al.1 In addition to correcting our DFT calculations, we examine the effects of the revised DFT values on the lattice model in this work.We recompute the lattice model with the M06-L and PBE values fromthe original manuscript as well as the corrected PBE values reported below (Fig. 6-8 and Tables 8-10). In all three sets of isotherm plots the ordering is preserved but the inflection points are spaced differently with the new PBE numbers, leading to quantitative differences that are nonetheless qualitatively similar to previous work. Finally, we discuss different ways that CO2 can coordinate to the metal binding site, as shown in Fig. 3. We should have notedmore clearly in ourmanuscript that these were starting configurations and not necessarily the final converged structures since our goal was to try several starting geometries to determine which coordination environment around the metal site was lowest in energy. Take for example bidentate insertion. Chemical intuition suggests that this structure could rotate to one that has only one CO2 oxygen center closer to the metal than the other and we observe this in our optimized structure. The resulting geometries we obtained for the starting arrangements noted in the figure are higher in energy than the chain model as reported in our original paper.We wish to emphasize that at the time of our 2015 study, our objective was to understand whether or not CO2 was bound to the metal and if one-dimensional chain formation could lead to a step in the adsorption isotherm. It has since become clear that a far more thorough study of the arrangements of the amines is required to truly understand competing amine arrangements preset in experiment. This was outside the scope of our work. Once more, these calculations are perhaps now outdated given work in the field in recent years. We again refer interested readers to a more recent study by Lee et al.1 1. Extended computational details to ensure reproducibility In the course of rectifying the error in our calculations, we wanted to ensure that all revised calculations were converged using the exact same protocol; therefore, we repeated the PBE calculations for the pair and chain models using updated computational details given here to ensure reproducibility. The M2(dobpdc) MOF contains six unsaturated metal sites per unit cell. To calculate the binding energies of CO2 in its amine appended analogue mmen-M2(dobpdc), one mmen ligand per CO2 was added per unit cell. The smaller sized ethylenediamine (en) was used to saturate the remaining amines not involved in CO2 binding. In the case of the pair mode, two mmen-amines are included per unit cell only. All DFT calculations were performed with periodic boundary conditions carried out using the VASP 5.4.4 package (original calculations were performed with VASP 5.3.3). The PBE functional was employed to examine the energetics of CO2 adsorption.3 On-site Hubbard U corrections were employed for metal d electrons.4 The U values are determined to reproduce oxidation energies in the respective metal oxides and are given in the tables below. The electron-ion interactions in these calculations were described with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method developed by Blöchl with an energy cutoff of 550 eV.5 This combination of the PBE functional, PAW scheme, and energy cutoff was used for full geometry optimization of the various species investigated until the forces on all atoms were smaller than 0.02 eV Å-1 and the SCF convergence was set to 1 × 10-7 eV. Given the large size of the unit cell and the tests with other numbers of K-points from the original study, only results obtained from G-point calculations are reported here. Finally, heats of adsorption are now reported below along with E + ZPE values, while in the original manuscript only E + ZPE were reported. No changes were made to how the vibrational corrections were computed; however, we have included some additional details to ensure reproducibility.6 Harmonic vibrational modes (ωi) were computed for CO2 in the gas phase and its bound product state (amine-CO2-MOF complex). The framework itself was taken to be rigid and only the vibrational modes associated with the motion of the amine, the metal center, first coordination sphere (oxygen atoms bound to the metal in the MOF backbone), and (if present) the bound CO2 were computed. Since the harmonic approximation breaks down for low frequency modes, we replaced all modes less than 50 cm-1 with 50 cm-1 when computing the zero-point and thermal energies. The following standard harmonic expressions were used to compute the vibrational corrections: Zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE) is: [Equation presented here] While for the bound product, the rotational and translational degrees of freedom of CO2 have been converted to additional vibrational modes allowing one to compute the thermal correction simply as: [Equation presented here] 2. Values for the chain model The chain model used in our original study included 1 mmen- and 5 en-amines. The values from the original paper are reported in Table 1. When we repeat these calculations using the procedure described in Section 1, we obtain the values in Table 2. In addition to the chain model described above (1 mmen- and 5 en-amines per unit cell), during our original study we performed calculations with another model that was not included in the manuscript since its values yielded results further from experiment. This model includes only 1 mmen-amine per unit cell (no other amines) and was used to test the assumption that the five enamines are indeed spectators with respect to the metal dependence of the binding energy. We present the results from this model in Table 3. In the original paper we noted that the energy and bond length trends are correlated and are consistent with the Irving-Williams series. This is no longer true for all metals under investigation, with Zn being an outlier. The results for Zn can be explained by more recent work.1 3. Values for the pair model The model used to compute the ""pair"" adsorption mechanisms included 2 mmen-amines and 0 en-amines. The values in the original paper are presented in Table 5. 4. Lattice model plots The lattice models to generate adsorption isotherms for these systems were run at one temperature (∼25 °C) using four different input parameters. First the M06-L and PBE values from the original paper were used once more as it has been some time since we have run the lattice model. Then the model is repeated with the new set of values from PBE. If we compare Fig. 7 and 8, the order is preserved, but the infliction points are spaced a bit differently. This is due to the scaling factor being constant and is something we scaled for each of the different systems as well. The slope is also a bit different, but not more then we should expect for this simple lattice model. Furthermore, we only ever aimed to reproduce the step and the order of the metals. Any finer details cannot be expected to be obtained from this model. The exact values used to compute the isotherms are given in the tables below.

Bordeaux, Pessac, 33615, France","Most populations of Scots pine in Spain are locally adapted to drought, with only a few populations at the southernmost part of the distribution range showing maladaptations to the current climate. Increasing tree heights are predicted for most of the studied populations by the year 2070, under the RCP 8.5 scenario. These results are probably linked to the capacity of this species to acclimatize to new climates. The impact of climate change on tree growth depends on many processes, including the capacity of individuals to respond to changes in the environment. Pines are often locally adapted to their environments, leading to differences among populations. Generally, populations at the margins of the species' ranges show lower performances in fitness-related traits than core populations. Therefore, under expected changes in climate, populations at the southern part of the species' ranges could be at a higher risk of maladaptation. Here, we hypothesize that southern Scots pine populations are locally adapted to current climate, and that expected changes in climate may lead to a decrease in tree performance. We used Scots pine tree height growth data from 15-year-old individuals, measured in six common gardens in Spain, where plants from 16 Spanish provenances had been planted. We analyzed tree height growth, accounting for the climate of the planting sites, and the climate of the original population to assess local adaptation, using linear mixed-effect models. We found that: (1) drought drove differences among populations in tree height growth; (2) most populations were locally adapted to drought; (3) tree height was predicted to increase for most of the studied populations by the year 2070 (a concentration of RCP 8.5). Most populations of Scots pine in Spain were locally adapted to drought. This result suggests that marginal populations, despite inhabiting limiting environments, can be adapted to the local current conditions. In addition, the local adaptation and acclimation capacity of populations can help margin populations to keep pace with climate change. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing, case-by-case, populations' capacities to cope with climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Gene flow; Local adaptation; Maladaptation; Mixed-models; Phenotypic plasticity; Phenotypic variation","Climate models; Drought; Forestry; Population statistics; Trees (mathematics); Gene flows; Local adaptation; Maladaptation; Mixed models; Phenotypic plasticity; Phenotypic variations; Climate change; climate change; coniferous tree; drought; gene flow; growth rate; height; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; tree; Drought; Forestry; Pinus Sylvestris; Spain; Spanish; Tree Dimensions; Spain; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068573950

Renewable building materials are those materials that can be regenerated quickly enough and in theory, their production could be carbon-neutral. In order to evaluate the thermal efficiency of renewable materials in the framework systems of building envelope structures, test samples were made with the filling of renewable materials. The aim of the work is to find out the thermal conductivity coefficient of these natural composites and to compare them.

Micro-CHP, notionally defined as CHP systems with a capacity lower than 50 kW, offers an alternative, and in some cases a complementary, solution to centralized power generation. A micro-CHP system would be typically installed at a residential or small commercial site where it would consume fuel such as diesel or natural gas to generate electricity locally and further use the rejected waste heat for local heating, air-conditioning, and/or humidification needs. This is in contrast to the rejected heat being dissipated at centralized power plants using cooling towers. The combined efficiency of primary energy usage for such systems can be higher than 90% on a fuel lower heating value (LHV) basis. Since a large fraction of the electricity generated from all the centralized power plants is consumed by the residential and commercial sectors, CHP implementation in these sectors can have a huge impact on both energy savings and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions’ reduction. Apart from these benefits, decentralized CHP as a form of distributed electricity generation offers numerous advantages such as reduced electrical grid stress, reduced electricity transmission and distribution losses, and potentially improved resiliency of the electricity grid. Various technologies including reciprocating internal combustion engines, Stirling engines, Brayton cycle engines, Rankine cycle engines, fuel cells, and solid-state devices such as thermoelectric generators and thermionic generators can be used as micro-CHP systems. This chapter provides a detailed technological review of engine-based micro-CHP systems and further presents the challenges and opportunities for achieving high fuel conversion efficiency. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Brayton cycle engines; Combined heat and power; Distributed generation; Internal combustion engines; Micro-CHP; Micro-cogeneration; Natural gas generators; Stirling engines",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103918262

This highlights the need for climate-wise conservation strategies. With such strategies, a well-connected network of protected areas (PAs) is one of the most important means to support species survival. An extensive and representative PA network can enhance the resilience of regional populations of species, resulting in slower species loss in landscapes with a significant proportion of area of habitat being protected. This paper presents analyses of both the observed (1974â€“2010) and the predicted changes (by 2051â€“2080) in boreal bird populations in Finland. Firstly, the results show some general patterns of climate change on bird species: (1) species are shifting their ranges towards north, (2) range sizes of many species are declining, and (3) these changes are different in northern and southern species and in species occupying different habitats. Secondly, the paper looks more into the role of protected area (PA) network in securing birds in a changing climate and concludes that at least in Finland, open habitats, such as open mires and mountain heaths, change more rapidly in their species composition in protected areas than for example old-growth forests. However, generally, species decline less within than outside PAs showing that protected areas alleviate climate change effects on bird species of conservation concern. This finding, further supported by results from elsewhere in Europe, provides evidence for the resilience of PA networks in preserving species under climate change. Representative PA network that includes high cover for key habitats is hence needed in all latitudinal zones. The projected efficiency of the PA network in maintaining biodiversity was partly dependent on the strength of climate change varying with respect to future scenarios. This suggests that a flexibly adaptive climate-wise conservation planning is required to be better prepared for preserving biodiversity in the face of uncertain climate change. Thirdly, the paper discusses several aspects of climate change studies and avian biodiversity that have been hitherto understudied especially in the northern biomes. The paper suggests that future studies should concentrate on (1) abundance-based models and prioritisations, (2) speciesâ€™ adaptive capacity (ability to avoid the impacts of climate change through dispersal and/or evolutionary change) and sensitivity (limited potential to persist in situ under changing climate) to climate change, (3) the role of the landscape matrix around the PAs and (4) the effects of the biogeophysical features of the PAs themselves. In conclusion, we envision that improved assessments regarding the ability of PA networks to maintain biodiversity in northern biomes are needed to enhance our ability to perform climate-wise conservation planning. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bird species; Boreal; Climate change; Protected area network; Range shift; Representativeness",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071512563

Although plasma metabolite profiles are increasingly investigated for their potential to detect liver injury earlier than current clinical markers, their utility may be compromised because such profiles are affected by the nutritional state and the physiological state of the animal, and by contributions from extrahepatic sources. To tease apart the contributions of liver and non-liver sources to alterations in plasma metabolite profiles, here we sought to computationally isolate the plasma metabolite changes originating in the liver during short-term fasting. We used a constraint-based metabolic modeling approach to integrate central carbon fluxes measured in our study, and physiological flux boundary conditions gathered from the literature, into a genome-scale model of rat liver metabolism. We then measured plasma metabolite profiles in rats fasted for 5–7 or 10–13 h to test our model predictions. Our computational model accounted for two-thirds of the observed directions of change (an increase or decrease) in plasma metabolites, indicating their origin in the liver. Specifically, our work suggests that changes in plasma lipid metabolites, which are reliably predicted by our liver metabolism model, are key features of short-term fasting. Our approach provides a mechanistic model for identifying plasma metabolite changes originating in the liver. © 2019 Vinnakota, Pannala, Wall, Rahim, Estes, Trenary, O’Brien, Printz, Reifman, Shiota, Young and Wallqvist.

Kemper was the largest IGCC project in the world, the first to use lignite as fuel, and the first to capture and sell CO2. Although the gasification operations of the plant were suspended, the plant operated for over 200 days of successful lignite gasification, gathering valuable data useful for future development and applicable to a wide range of industrial applications and technologies. Kemper featured air-blown Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIG™) technology that centers around the Transport Gasifier-a pressurized, circulating fluidized bed unit that features high riser densities and high solids circulation rates. Other unique components of the technology are the Pressure Decoupled Advanced Coal feed system (PDAC) and the Continuous Fine and Coarse Ash Depressurization systems (CFAD and CCAD). These innovative systems were developed by Southern Company, with industrial and institutional partners, at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) in Wilsonville, Alabama over a period of 20 years. Each train at the Kemper IGCC project represented a scale-up of the PSDF pilot plant by a factor of about 100 in terms of capacity, with each of the two Transport Gasifiers at Kemper having a feed capacity of 5,000 tons per day. Other technologies were integrated and tested on a commercial scale at Kemper, including syngas filtration, acid gas removal, and hydrogen-rich low Btu syngas combustion. The Particulate Control Devices (PCDs) used dry filtration technology to remove essentially all the fine particulates from the syngas. The acid gas removal system (UOP's SelexolTM process) at the plant captured carbon dioxide from the syngas, diverting it for use in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and making the Kemper facility's carbon emissions comparable to those of a similarly sized natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant. Kemper's two Siemens SGT6-5000F gas turbines operated reliably on the high hydrogen, lignite-derived low Btu syngas from air-blown gasification operations. Kemper operations demonstrated excellent environmental performance, with emissions of various components well below the permit levels that were based on other IGCC plant performances and other national standards. This paper discusses integrated plant operations and performance of the major components of the TRIGTM facility and compiles relevant experience and data gathered over the operation of the project. The paper also includes a selection of major lessons learned during various phases of the project from design through operations of the first-of-a-kind plant. © 2019 36th Annual International Pittsburgh Coal Conference: Clean Coal-Based Energy/Fuels and the Environment, PCC 2019.

We estimate the single and interactive effects of competition and extreme weather events on the performance of the global legume invader Lupinus polyphyllus (Lindl.). In three experimental studies we assessed (i) the stress tolerance of seedling and adult L. polyphyllus plants against extreme weather events (drought, fluctuating precipitation, late frost), (ii) the competitive effects of L. polyphyllus on native grassland species and vice versa, and (iii) the interactive effects of extreme weather events and competition on the performance of L. polyphyllus. Drought reduced growth and led to early senescence of L. polyphyllus but did not reduce adult survival. Fluctuating precipitation events and late frost reduced the length of inflorescences. Under control conditions, interspecific competition reduced photosynthetic activity and growth of L. polyphyllus. When subjected to competition during drought, L. polyphyllus conserved water while simultaneously maintaining high assimilation rates, demonstrating increased water use efficiency. Meanwhile, native species had reduced performance under drought. In summary, the invader gained an advantage under drought conditions through a smaller reduction in performance relative to its native competitors but was competitively inferior under control conditions. This provides evidence for a possible invasion window for this species. While regions of high elevation or latitude with regular severe late frost events might remain inaccessible for L. polyphyllus, further spread across Europe seems probable as the predicted increase in drought events may favour this non-native legume over native species. © 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands","Demographic dynamics; disturbance; ecological novelty; environmental change; flooding; habitat filtering; pulsed resources","abiotic factor; biological invasion; biotic factor; climate change; demography; disturbance; ecological approach; environmental change; experimental study; extreme event; flooding; global change; habitat structure; intraspecific interaction; introduced species; invasive species; legume; physiological response; resource availability; stress resistance; water use efficiency; Lupinus polyphyllus; environment; introduced species; lupin; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; weather; Environment; Introduced Species; Lupinus; Stress, Physiological; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064523486

A better control of the post-flame temperature field to contain the thermal (Zel'dovich) route resulted in significant reductions of engine emissions. An improved knowledge of the chemistry and rate of the secondary prompt, NNH, and N 2 O pathways is now required to decrease nitric oxide emissions further. For this effort, NO laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements are presented for lean (?=0.7), jet-wall, stagnation, premixed flames at pressures of 2, 4, and 8 atm. For all cases, the NO-LIF signal increases rapidly through the flame front, and relatively slowly in the post-flame region where the temperature is too low to sustain the thermal pathway. Nitric oxide mole fractions are inferred from the measurements and show that the pressure has a very weak, monotonic, adverse effect on NO formation. Reaction pathway analyses are applied to flame simulations performed with a thermochemical model capturing the general trends of the data to assess the contribution of each NO formation route. For all cases, the N 2 O pathway, which proceeds mostly in the flame front region, dominates. This route produces slightly larger amounts of NO at higher pressures, but the variation appears very limited when considering the termolecular nature of its initiation reaction. The thermal route is predicted to progress slowly in the post-flame region, which causes a shallow increase in the NO mole fraction. The NNH and prompt pathways generate small amounts of NO, and their contributions reduce with the pressure. Overall, the thermochemical model predicts that the formation of NO is relatively unaffected by the pressure, which is consistent with the experiments. The experimental dataset reported in this work is made available for the development of thermochemical models.","High pressure; Laser-induced fluorescence; Nitric oxide formation; Particle Tracking Velocimetry; Stagnation flames","Atmospheric pressure; Fluorescence; Laser optics; Laser produced plasmas; Nitric oxide; High pressure; Laser induced fluorescence; Nitric oxide formation; Particle tracking velocimetry; Stagnation flames; Fighter aircraft",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049202137

Direct emissions correlate to the static GWP value of a refrigerant and the refrigerant charge of the heat pump. Indirect emissions occur in the production, distribution, operation and disposal of the heat pump with special respect to the refrigerant. This approach allows a direct comparison of the impact of low GWP refrigerants on lifecycle carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.

However, the dry seasons in the Brazilian semiarid region have become longer due to climate variability, and they have affected the operation of hydropower plants during the last decade. Brazil has a growing energy demand, and energy mix diversification is essential to meet the power capacity required to support sustainable development. Investments in photovoltaic power plants are already a robust strategy to foster a new cycle of socioeconomic development based on a low-carbon economy. Hybrid power generation using hydro- and solar energy resources can be an alternative source due to the seasonal complementarity between them in the Brazilian semiarid region. During the dry periods, the photovoltaic power plant can replace hydropower generation. The present study aimed to evaluate the contribution of a solar photovoltaic plant to increase power generation in the Sobradinho hydropower plant operating in the São Francisco River, the most important water resource in the Brazilian semiarid region. The results showed that the PV power plant contributes to saving water for other multiple usages and avoids emissions of greenhouse gases by thermal power plants in long periods of intense drought. According to the simulation results for the 2013–2015 period, the PV plant would add around 8350 GWh to the actual power generated in Sobradinho using an area smaller than 0.5% of its water reservoir surface. In addition, hybrid power generation would avoid emissions around 27.10 6  t CO 2 released into the atmosphere by thermal power plants using fossil fuels during 3 years.

In the LIFE IP project, Implementation of Air Quality Plan for Małopolska Region – Małopolska in a healthy atmosphere (LIFE14IPE PL 021), an inter-regional framework for both emissions and air quality modelling, was developed. The emission modelling component is built on the previous LIFE+ project WEISS[1], in which VITO developed EISS, a user-friendly and flexible emission inventory support software optimized to work with different types of emission sources and pollutants. The air quality modelling component is built upon existing expertise and tools developed inside the LIFE+ project ATMOSYS[2], in which VITO developed a modular web based air quality management dashboard to support air quality management in any air pollution (hotspot) region. In this contribution, we focus on the emission modelling component. As residential heating is identified as one of the main drivers of the observed air pollution in the hotspot region, the EISS tool was adapted and applied to compile a comprehensive high resolution trans-boundary residential emission inventory. This transboundary inventory was created based on existing methodologies to compile local bottom-up residential emission inventories in the different sub-regions (Southern Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia), which were harmonized to the fullest. The harmonization efforts resulted in consistent transboundary residential emissions for reference year 2015, still fulfilling the requirements of the three different sub-regions. Based on these emissions, different (regional) emission reduction scenarios were determined. All trans-boundary residential emission data sets were then complemented with trans-boundary emissions for all sectors, as required for regional air quality modelling. Within this paper, the process to harmonize residential emissions across country borders is described in detail, the resulting high resolution residential emissions are discussed and the EISS tool is presented. Furthermore, the replicability and transferability of the project’s best practices (regarding emission modelling) to other regions will be discussed. © 2019 Harmonisation within Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling for Regulatory Purposes, HARMO.

The micro-arc oxidation (MAO) coating technique is the modern process to form a ceramic oxide layer on the reactive metal substrate (base metal) by electrochemical and electro - thermal oxidation in an alkaline electrolytic solution. Using MAO technique, an oxide layer of thickness 72 µm was formed on the piston crown. This oxide layer acts as a thermal barrier to reduce the in-cylinder heat rejection and increase the durability of the piston by withstanding high temperature and pressure produced during combustion. Combustion flames have been captured using the AVL combustion analyzer to analyze the development and propagation of flames within the engine cylinder. From the flame images, it was observed that propagation of flame was faster in MAO coated piston compared to uncoated piston. This is because of higher local temperature inside the combustion chamber that was resulted due to low thermal conductivity of MAO layer. It was also found that carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were reduced as a result of efficient fuel combustion, while NOx emissions increased because of increased combustion temperatures for MAO coated pistons. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Electro-thermal oxidation; Flame propagation; Micro-arc oxidation; Piston crown; Thermal barrier","Carbon monoxide; Ceramic materials; Engine cylinders; Fuels; Ignition; Pistons; Surface mount technology; Thermal conductivity; Thermooxidation; Combustion temperatures; Emission characteristics; Flame propagation; High temperature and pressure; Low thermal conductivity; Microarc oxidation; Thermal barrier; Thermal oxidation; Engine pistons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071578180

It is considered by the National Development Plan of Colombia 2018-2022, as an economic agent that boosts development in the region and that requires the strengthening of its policies and environmental liability. Therefore, this paper aims to show the importance of implementing methodologies based on the logic of nature (exergy) that objectively indicates the environmental impact of an extractive gold activity, such as open-pit gold mining. The extractive activity or process to be studied consists of the following stages: topsoil removal, by using machinery and explosives to create craters and to access the mineral present in the subsoil; physical transformation of the extracted material through crushing, grinding, gravimetric separation, flotation, leaching, adsorption, elution, and electrodeposition, along with smelting and casting to obtain gold and silver ingots. Thus, this paper analyzes the exergy performance of each unit process of the open-pit extractive process. The obtained results are used in a sensitivity analysis, which determines the system efficiency, by assuming increase of gold on the extracted material in the exploitation stage, by using the same supplies and input of the current process. In other cases, the open-pit mining process is analyzed, by changing its technologies in the mining process and assuming that this change reduces the inlet ore to 60%, by discarding a 40% of material without gold and by reducing supply consumption in 25%. By improving the system efficiency, the exergy destroyed is reduced and the emissions to the environment diminish. Therefore, this method may be implemented as a basic guideline when it comes to decision-making processes in the planning of the extractive processes, by integrating the environmental component with gold production. © 2019 Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.All rights reserved.","Exergetic Cost; Exergy; Extractive Gold Process; Gold; Open-Pit Mining; Silver","Data mining; Decision making; Economic geology; Environmental impact; Exergy; Extraction; Flotation; Ingots; Machinery; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Decision making process; Economic agents; Environmental liabilities; Exergy Analysis; Gold and silver; Gold production; National Development Plan; System efficiency; Open pit mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083191848

The digital era brings about a fast and continuous production of information, whose management becomes a challenge for both large companies and users worldwide, in their private environment. The huge amount of data needed to carry out day-to-day operations means a continuing need for increased storage space, which translates into high hardware costs. Thus, cloud services have emerged as an optimal and long-lasting solution to this problem. According to a simplified definition, the term ""Cloud Computing"" refers to the storage, processing and use of data outlying and Internet-accessed systems. In this way, in order to achieve their goals, users can dispose of almost unlimited computing power on request, without having to make significant capital investments and can access the data via an Internet connection from wherever they are. The benefits of Cloud Computing consist mainly in the reduction of spending for IT users and the promotion of the development of a large number of new services. Using Cloud Computing, even the smallest businesses can address increasingly larger markets, while administrations can increase the attractiveness and efficiency of their services, while keeping their spending under control. The cloud’s unexpected economies of scale reduce overall costs and increase efficiency, especially when replacing locally-run servers of an organization. A fundamental concept of Cloud Computing is that through this model information technology is made available to users in the form of services (as by analogy, communications technology is made available to users in the form of voice/ voice services, data, etc.) used in the form of periodic subscriptions (as telephone services are used as a monthly subscription). However, the new technologies bring with them their own challenges. Today, much as ever, cloud providers are facing challenges to be able to deliver the energy efficiency of their services, but also their sustainability. Using a large number of cloud data centers increases costs as well as carbon emissions, which still affects the cloud services' sustainability. The main requirement for Sustainable Cloud Computing is energy efficiency which can be acquired mainly by using renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions. This will ensure continuity and security in the process of energy supply, while preserving traditional resources, but at the same time will significantly reduce imports of primary energy resources. Cloud computing technology has its name in the form of a cloud, often described in the graphical representation of a network. Cloud Computing was developed as a consequence of the rising access to IT resources. If in previous years, in traditional outsourcing models, either customer or provider would own the physical resources, Cloud Computing comes with the novelty of being able to access to technological capabilities without owning the software used by the payee. Another important aspect is the fact that by using renewable energy one can also stimulate the economic development starting at the local level, but also at the regional and global level, thus creating new jobs and, implicitly, employment opportunities. [7] Given this economic and social context, the European Commission has developed a set of energy strategy aimed at ensuring an economy characterized by greater safety and durability, but also significantly reduce carbon emissions. The increased use of renewable energy will not only combat climate change as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but it will also have an impact on the reduction of air pollution and it will most probable create new jobs in the environment and renewable energy sectors. Nowadays, in many European countries including Romania, it is necessary to encourage the usage of renewable energy resources as they offer a wide range of advantages [6], [10]. Consequently, nowadays, there is a growing concern for developing computer systems in order to predict, analyse and monitor the performance indicators of renewable energy technology processes. The results of this endeavour have a great importance to the green energy producers as they are required to submit the estimates of alternative energy production requested by the Romanian National Energy Regulatory Authority (ANRE) but they are also relevant to developing decision support systems for a more efficient management of electricity generation from renewable sources [9]. Among the renewable energy sources one can mention solar and wind energy, geothermal energy, hydroelectric power, sea energy, biofuels, and renewable waste. If we take into consideration the figures from Eurostat, the use of renewable energy in the EU has increased strongly in latest years. More exactly, the percentage of energy obtained from renewable sources has almost doubled the number in recent years, reaching 17.0% in 2016 from an approximate of 8.5% in 2004. This was brought about also by the legally binding targets set by the EU through Directive 2009/28/ EC in trying to promote the use of energy from renewable sources. This will have a major impact on the long run as some of the benefits of renewable energy consist of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, but also the dependency on fossil fuels markets [2]. However, the main problem with the renewable power supply is that it is usually intermittent and unpredictable and hence one should try to adopt measures for making the renewable supply constant. In the research work for this article, we have used both quantitative methods (which aim at obtaining statistical, percentage or numerical data, measurable) but also qualitative, which is based not on calculations but on the interpretation of different types of content. The use of qualitative research methods in this paper was based on the fact that qualitative research does not seek to obtain generic information about certain subjects of interest but rather seeks to reach deeper information levels related to them. Moreover, it always implies a holistic approach. Starting from the idea that qualitative research is based more on textual interpretation, which requires the correct definition of the concepts or their scientific substantiation, thus emphasizing the importance of the chosen subject, I consider that the qualitative research is the most suitable for the field addressed whose study is based on the tools and methods of research specific. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Climate change mitigation is one of the major global purposes. To achieve the goal it is necessary to solve a number of issues. The key one is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emissions while keeping high growth rates of living standard, industry and economy. Some countries develop such technologies to decrease greenhouse gases emissions, in particular, carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS technologies). Meanwhile, the development of CCS technologies has advantages and disadvantages both for global economy and the economy of the Russian Federation. The potential of CCS technologies development in the Russian Federation is also caused by the level of public environmental awareness of CCS projects deployment. Currently global community attitude to the CCS technologies development is controversial. Thus, the study of public environmental awareness and improving public perception of CCS technologies development is an extremely essential issue. The paper reviews the level of public awareness concerning CCS technologies across the world. It provides the comparison of public awareness in different countries. The recommendations for raising Russian public awareness of CCS technologies are made. © SGEM 2019.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon storage; CCS technologies; Public perception","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Capture and storage technologies; Carbon storage; CCS technologies; Climate change mitigation; Environmental awareness; Environmental issues; Greenhouse gases emissions; Public perception; Carbon capture",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073351787

The Arctic Ocean is the region of the world experiencing climate change at the steepest rate compared with other latitudes. Since marine planktonic microorganisms play a key role in the biogeochemical cycles in the ocean it is crucial to simultaneously evaluate the effect of warming and increasing CO2 on marine microbial communities. In 20 L experimental microcosms filled with water from a high-Arctic fjord (Svalbard), we examined changes in phototrophic and heterotrophic microbial abundances and processes [bacterial production (BP) and mortality], and viral activity (lytic and lysogenic) in relation to warming and elevated CO2. The summer microbial plankton community living at 1.4°C in situ temperature, was exposed to increased CO2 concentrations (135-2,318 μatm) in three controlled temperature treatments (1, 6, and 10°C) at the UNIS installations in Longyearbyen (Svalbard), in summer 2010. Results showed that chlorophyll a concentration decreased at increasing temperatures, while BP significantly increased with pCO2 at 6 and 10°C. Lytic viral production was not affected by changes in pCO2 and temperature, while lysogeny increased significantly at increasing levels of pCO2, especially at 10°C (R2 = 0.858, p = 0.02). Moreover, protistan grazing rates showed a positive interaction between pCO2 and temperature. The averaged percentage of bacteria grazed per day was higher (19.56 ± 2.77% d-1) than the averaged percentage of lysed bacteria by virus (7.18 ± 1.50% d-1) for all treatments. Furthermore, the relationship among microbial abundances and processes showed that BP was significantly related to phototrophic pico/nanoflagellate abundance in the 1°C and the 6°C treatments, and BP triggered viral activity, mainly lysogeny at 6 and 10°C, while bacterial mortality rates was significantly related to bacterial abundances at 6°C. Consequently, our experimental results suggested that future increases in water temperature and pCO2 in Arctic waters will produce a decrease of phytoplankton biomass, enhancement of BP and changes in the carbon fluxes within the microbial food web. All these heterotrophic processes will contribute to weakening the CO2 sink capacity of the Arctic plankton community. © 2019 Vaqué, Lara, Arrieta, Holding, Sà, Hendriks, Coello-Camba, Alvarez, Agustí, Wassmann and Duarte.","Arctic Ocean; Microbial food-webs; pCO2; Temperature; Viral life cycle","chlorophyll a; glutaraldehyde; mitomycin; acidification; alkalinity; arctic climate; Arctic Ocean; Article; bacterial microbiome; bacterial viability; biogeochemical cycle; climate change; community dynamics; epifluorescence microscopy; flow cytometry; grazing; greenhouse effect; heterotrophy; lysogenization; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial growth; microcosm; mortality rate; nonhuman; pH; phototrophic bacterium; phytoplankton; plankton; temperature; virus detection; virus viability; warming; zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066449954

In addition to hurricanes, Sandy and Irene, are the storms occurring at high tide bringing damaging floods to coastal communities, causing major damage to the historical neighborhoods and developing areas, specifically, new Seaport District. Like other historical ports in the United States, most of Boston, including the new Seaport District, has neighborhoods/commercial districts built on filled coastline. Within recent years, the Seaport District has experienced significant economic increase in businesses/residents. This area has been revived and a thriving community has formed. However, solid mitigation to handle extreme weather and rising seawater is lacking. During the winter storms on 2018 in which the rising sea water flooded neighborhoods, Boston saw the storm surge as a threat to continual development in the Seaport District and around the city. One great storm surge could cause enormous economic damage to the city's coastlines. Several towns in Massachusetts have adopted their own mitigation plans. Boston is researching and exploring the economic and life safety issues to address or prepare for the changing climate. Adopting a formal plan is vital to preserving and protecting Boston's rich history and neighborhoods. This paper addresses mitigation measures to form a robust plan for policy makers, useful recommendations for engineers and designers working on infrastructure/buildings in coastal communities. These mitigation measures include protecting life safety equipment, MEP services/equipment, structural durability, accessibility with flood events, functional design recommendations for at-risk buildings, and retention. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Floods; Ports and harbors; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Sea level; Seawater; Storms; Changing climate; Climate change mitigation; Coastal communities; Economic damages; Economic increase; Functional design; Mitigation measures; Structural durability; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075953460

During agitation, manure undergoes mechanical stress and is exposed to the air, disrupting anaerobic conditions. An on-farm study was conducted to better understand the effects of agitation on CH4 emissions, and explore the potential for intentional agitation (three times) to disrupt the exponential increase of CH4 emissions in spring and summer. Results showed that agitation substantially increased manure temperature in the study year compared to the previous year, particularly at upper- and mid-depths of the stored manure. The temporal pattern of CH4 emissions was altered by reduced emissions over the subsequent week, followed by an increase during the second week. Microbial analysis indicated that the activity of archaea and methanogens increased after each agitation event, but there was little change in the populations of methanogens, archaea, and bacteria. Overall, CH4 emissions were higher than any of the previous three years, likely due to warmer manure temperatures that were higher than the previous years (despite similar air temperatures).

As this urbanisation is expected to continue in the future, it is important to understand its environmental impacts and the role that spatial planning strategies and urbanisation regulations can play herein. This is addressed by (1) quantifying the cities' expansion and intra-urban restructuring using Local Climate Zones (LCZs) for three periods in time (2005, 2011 and 2017) based on the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) protocol, and (2) cross-referencing observed land-use and land-cover changes with existing planning regulations. The results of the surveys on urban development show that, between 2005 and 2011, the city showed spatial expansion, whereas between 2011 and 2017, densification mainly occurred within the existing urban extent. Between 2005 and 2017, the fraction of open LCZs increased, with the largest increase taking place between 2011 and 2017. The largest decrease was seen for low the plants (LCZ D) and agricultural greenhouse (LCZ H) categories.

Some places are more vulnerable than others, also some people are more vulnerable than others. Vulnerability is not static, but changes over time. Vulnerability is not only a physical issue, people can also be vulnerable due to lack of correct (execution of) rules and laws. The impact of climate change is often addressed in terms of (increased) vulnerability. This paper examines whether this is gaining more insight, and perspective to act, and if so, to whom. Next to that arguments are delivered to improve the situation of the most vulnerable people, who turns out to be the least blessed ones, since they lack everything to make them successful in ordinary life and the increase of threats will even worsen their situation. To overcome this, society has to invest both in improved spatial planning and rescue services on one hand and in schooling for the poor, so that they can have a job and earn money to get an improved position, on the other. Better planning can create more chance to get out on time and to save lives. Policy-wise specific attention has to be paid to the most vulnerable people, since they are unable to improve their situation by themselves. This has to be done with help from others, mainly people and organizations that have the ability to oversee the situation and the power to improve it. The impact of attachment to place is an issue that gets special attention, because this is often interrupted for the poorest people, creating more uncertainty. Some suggestions to improve their situation are presented.

Designing tailings storage facilities (TSFs) for reduced dust emissions is also not readily considered as part of the tailings engineering process, and most TSFs are still uncovered in South Africa. This paper advocates proactively engineered, wind resistant tailings landscapes by incorporating principles of aerodynamic design into final closure design content. This is imperative in the wake of much dryer, windier, and warmer climate predicted for sub-Saharan Africa. This paper considers tailings specific wind erosion scenarios modelled from field data for a large TSF in South Africa. The revised wind erosion equation is applied to determine comparative wind erosion scenarios for geometric variation that informs the landscape engineering process. The methodology considers local climate, surrounding regional relief (wind direction and energy scenarios), TSF construction methodology (particulate grading and segregation), geometrical design (wind speed amplification), and material physical and chemical characteristics (particle size, moisture regimes, and dispersion properties). The modelled output demonstrates that wind erosion exponentially increases on unprotected slopes with an increase in slope angle comparing 14, 18, and 26° slope angles, implying that uncovered tailings landscapes should be designed much flatter to withstand wind erosivity over time. Mitigation scenarios are incorporated into the model to evaluate effectiveness of surface protection considering the scale of high dust risk areas and the degree of effectiveness that can be expected. The outcomes of this study suggest that unless the substantial effects of wind are not considered during the geometrical design and final closure landscape planning stages, uncovered tailings landscapes will remain serious sources of dust pollution. A case is made that wind erosion should be incorporated as a matter of principle closure design of TSFs. © 2019 Australian Centre for Geomechanics.All right reserved.","Closure design; Revised wind erosion equation; Tailings dust; Wind erosion",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114346062

In recent years, the integration of renewable diesel facilities with the existing infrastructure in refineries has proven lucrative and there are a number of projects in various phases of operation, engineering or construction. One common renewable diesel production process is via the hydrotreating of vegetable oils and grease, which produces a diesel product that can be blended with conventional diesel products from crude oils. Hydrotreating vegetable oils and grease produces sour fuel streams, such as fuel gas and LPG, and a hydrogen recycle streams that contain CO2 and CO as well as hydrogen sulfide in small quantities. In addition, small quantities of sour water are produced that require treatment Due to the low sulphur content of the feedstock, a sulphiding agent is typically added to the hydrotreater to maintain the catalyst in a sulfided state. This paper presents a case study involving the design and potential integration of the sour water and acid gas treatment units for a renewable diesel facility with an existing refinery Sulphur Complex. The case study evaluates the potentials for operating cost reduction by integrating an enrichment loop in the acid gas treatment plant as well as for using the existing infrastructure of the refinery to limit emissions. © 2019Sulphur 2019 + Sulphuric Acid.

The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, after being ratified by 55 countries - representing at least 55% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement's long-term goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels; and to limit the increase to 1.5 C, since this would substantially reduce the risks and effects of climate change. Being aware of climate change, aleady in 2009 The European Union published the original Renewable Energy Directive (RED 2009/28/EC) that establishes an overall policy for the production and promotion of energy from renewable sources in the EU. It requires the EU to fulfil at least 20% of its total energy needs with renewables by 2020 – to be achieved through the attainment of individual national targets. As a subtarget all EU member states must also ensure that at least 10% of their transport fuels come from renewable sources by 2020. In December 2018, the revised Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001/EU entered into force. It establishes a new binding renewable energy target for the EU for 2030 of at least 32%, with a clause for a possible upwards revision by 2023. Under the new Governance regulation, EU countries are required to draft 10-year National Energy & Climate Plans (NECPs) for 2021-2030, outlining how they will meet the new 2030 targets for renewable energy and for energy efficiency. The subtarget of for renewable energy in transport is raised to 14%.

This study assesses the GHG emissions (CO2eq) of incineration and anaerobic digestion (AD) under different electricity production mix. The electricity production mix of China, Malaysia, Japan, Russia, UK, US (East), Czech Republic, Germany, France and Finland were considered. Incineration has a lower net CO2eq emission in China and Malaysia. However, the AD is environmentally preferable than incineration in Russia, Japan, Czech Republic, Germany, US (East), UK, Finland and France. The net CO2eq emission of incineration in China (9.41 kg CO2eq/t MSW) is lower than a country with greener electricity mix e.g. France (401.76 kg CO2eq/t MSW) where the main electricity source is nuclear. This is due to the higher avoided CO2eq emission compare to generate electricity from fossil fuel. Electricity produces from the WtE process is identified as the major factors in affecting the net CO2eq emission than the other two assessed factors (waste collection and transportation (distance), the efficiency of the WtE process). This suggests energy efficiency plays a significant role in enhancing the net CO2eq emissions and to reduce the carbon intensity of WtE.

Different studies prove the techno-economic potential of these technologies but, due to the added complexity, it is challenging to design and control such systems. This paper describes an integrated optimal design and control algorithm, which is applied to the design of a district heating network with solar thermal collectors, seasonal thermal energy storage and excess heat injection. The focus is mostly on the choice of the size and location of these technologies and less on the network layout optimisation. The algorithm uses a two-layer program, namely with a design optimisation layer implemented as a genetic algorithm and an optimal control evaluation layer implemented using the Python optimal control problem toolbox called modesto. This optimisation strategy is applied to the fictional district energy system case of the city of Genk in Belgium. We show that this algorithm can find optimal designs with respect to multiple objective functions and that even in the cheaper, less renewable solutions, seasonal thermal energy storage systems are installed in large quantities. © 2019 by the authors.","District energy systems; District heating; Genetic algorithm; Optimal control; Optimal design; Renewable energy; Seasonal thermal energy storage","Computer software; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimal control systems; Thermal energy; District energy systems; District heating networks; Integrated optimal designs; Multiple objective functions; Optimal controls; Optimal design; Renewable energies; Thermal energy storage systems; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069615547

What is effective is the transformation of reality to open channels towards the participation of civil society in the decision-making process. In this paper we attempt to explore the idea of sustainability within our relationship with the natural environment. Sustainability assumes that natural and human technological resources can be utilised while maintaining the environment. Sustainability must also be understood within the context of ecological, cultural, social, economical and ethical realms. In putting this in perspective, the idea of sustainability becomes more concrete. Amongst a range of environmental constraints that are of necessity playing an increasing role in social development planning, climate change represents the most urgent and far-reaching challenge of our time.

Literature suggests that the Congolian lowland rainforest does not follow this pattern: the Central Congolian forest (CCLF), south of the Congo River, is thought to harbor fewer vertebrate species and endemics than the Northeastern (NELF) and Northwestern lowland rainforests (NWLF) north of the Congo River. We used data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database on terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, and reptiles), to test whether differences in sampling effort caused the irregular biodiversity pattern in this region. Our results show that even though the diversity within the Congolian lowland rainforests remains to be fully mapped, current differences in richness are unlikely to be caused by undersampling alone. We argue that the lower vertebrate richness in the CCLF is due to both its relatively small size and isolated position: Forest cover fluctuated throughout the history of the Congo Basin due to climatic variability, reducing speciation and increasing extinction, while immigration towards the CCLF is limited due to the barrier effect of the Congo River. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of both fundamental ecology and conservation management. © 2019, Societe Royale Zoologique de Belgique.

The growing demand for food and fiber, increases pressure on delivery of other ecosystem services provided by soil, namely water purification and regulation, carbon sequestration and regulation, nutrient cycling and provision of habitat for biodiversity. In this context, Functional Land Management framework was developed to optimise rather than maximize the delivery of those five soil functions related to agricultural land use. Latvia has specific challenge: from one side it is a development of the traditional bioeconomy sectors, namely agriculture and forestry, to its potential, but from another side there is an international commitment to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, in this study trade-offs and synergies between supply and demand of primary productivity, carbon regulation and biodiversity are explored to meet socio-economic and climate targets simultaneously. In Latvia, one of the opportunities how to achieve both targets is to return unmanaged and overgrown agricultural land to production with climate-smart land management practices.

Regrettably there are some countries or regions which still have very strict standard restrictions about RA usage in asphalt mixtures, mainly in surface layers. For example in current technical standards in the Czech Republic the use of RA in stone mastic asphalt mixtures or asphalt concrete for premium surface layers is banned. Recycling of construction materials saves direct primary costs like new material purchasing and at the same time also facilitates savings of other costs like energy, material disposal and transport etc. Those factors are connected to environment-friendly approaches, primarily in the case of emission and greenhouse gas production reduction. Material disposal can subsequently be reduced solely to waste or by-product materials which have no way of further utilization. In this respect a 5 km trial section was designed including 12 different variants of stone mastic asphalt mixtures. The mixtures contained 0%, 20%, 30% and 50% reclaimed asphalt. The mixtures differed not only in amount of used RA, but also in source of RA (normal and SMA RA), used bituminous binder and used additives. The selected additives were based on cellulose fibers modified by an oil-based rejuvenator and crumb rubber modification in some alternatives of the used rejuvenator. The performance of the asphalt mixtures was assessed by term of stiffness modulus (IT-CY method), thermal induced crack propagation (SCB test), flexural strength (three-point bending test) and resistance to permanent deformations.

The elementary steps of the reduction to formic acid, HCOOH, or CO + H 2 O are traced by transition state theory. The umbrella-shaped three-carbonyl ligands at each cation induce a high electron density in the [2M-2S] core and they also impose stereo-selectivity by limiting the mobility of adsorbed reactants and intermediates. The hexacarbonyl complexes have high proton affinities, 700-850 kJ mol -1 . Inclusion of cobalt ensures high proton-electron affinities (H + , e - ) of 250-300 kJ mol -1 and cobalt is able to directly coordinate and activate hydrogen. In the [CoFeS 2 (H + , e - )](CO) 6 complexes charge separation is observed, the proton being attached to sulphur, whereas the electron is delocalised at the metal cation centres. The parent hexacarbonyl complexes and their reduced forms after accepting the proton-electron couple have intense excitation lines in the visible spectrum. While the preferred position for H-binding is at a sulphur atom, visible light excitations can promote the sulphur-bonded proton to cobalt-bonded active hydrogen. The inclusion of cobalt thus provides a selective, low-energy path of two proton-electron reduction to formic acid. Cobalt centres transfer the activated hydrogen to the carbon dioxide molecule so as to form a HCO 2 intermediate and this is the rate-determining step. The di-iron disulfide [2Fe-2S] complexes act in a different way: hydrogen is either fixed at a sulphur centre or shared by the two iron cations and it is transferred preferably to the oxygen end of a CO 2 molecule to form a COOH intermediate. The path to formic acid is predetermined by cobalt-bonded hydrogen transfer to the carbon centre of CO 2 in the first reduction step. Catalyst decay paths are considered and high stability of the cobalt-containing complexes is revealed. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Electrons; Formic acid; Iron compounds; Molecules; Positive ions; Reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; Sulfur compounds; Charge separations; Electron reduction; Hexacarbonyl complex; High-electron-density; Rate determining step; Transition state theories; Two-step reduction; Visible light excitation; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062033617

One of the solutions to this problem is implementation of slurry acidification techniques by adding concentrated sulfuric acid. In the study the prerequisites for application of these techniques in large-scale cattle and pig-rearing complexes in the subjects of the Russian Federation located within the boundaries of the Baltic Sea catchment area were considered; the main features of the Russian legislation related to the treatment of slurry were analysed. In addition, a series of experiments was conducted with the samples of slurry from the Russian farms for preliminary assessment of sulfuric acid demand. With the mathematical model created in the framework of the EU project “Baltic Slurry Acidification”, the economic efficiency of slurry acidification techniques on a pilot farm in Russia was determined. The work done showed that the region under consideration had a significant potential for slurry acidification: out of 11.8 million tons of manure produced in the region, 7.4 million tons could potentially be used for this purpose. Slurry acidification techniques have both pros and cons associated, primarily, with the increased risks of emergencies when handling the particularly dangerous substances, sulfuric acid included. © 2019 Latvia University of Agriculture.

Among other things, a redundant 24 V supply with corresponding disconnection is required. The battery switch is a key component. Commercial, construction, and agricultural vehicles (CAV) need to operate at the highest possible availability and the lowest possible cost of ownership. This is why automated and autonomous driving has the potential to revolutionize the CAV sector. Driverless machines can be operated around the clock and almost non-stop. Platooning allows automated, interconnected trucks to drive in a convoy and very close to each other. Platooning saves fuel. The North American Council for Freight Efficiency has calculated the following:In a scenario with two virtually connected trucks, the fuel consumption of the front vehicle is reduced by 4.5%, and by 10% in the rear vehicle, due to reduced aerodynamic drag on all of the vehicles.In a scenario with three connected trucks, platooning even leads to an average savings of 10% for all three vehicles. This improves traffic flow, saves fuel, and reduces harmful emissions such as nitrogen oxides (Figure 1). In agriculture, automated, precisely controlled tractors spread fertilizer and seed much more accurately. In addition, automated systems significantly reduce the risk of accidents. All of this protects the environment and saves costs. This is why, in sectors such as logistics, the interest in automated driving is even higher than that of private car manufacturers. It is safe to assume that the first automated vehicles will be either trucks or other commercial vehicles. A key function of the system is the battery disconnect switch. This master cutoff introduces an isolator to ensure the batteries in the 24 V main network are properly separated from the redundant 24 V network. For guaranteed reliability in areas with extreme weather, from excessive cold to sweltering heat, a battery disconnect switch design must withstand and work reliably in a range of harsh conditions and environments. © 2019 SAE International.",,"Aerodynamic drag; Agricultural robots; Automation; Automobile manufacture; Automobile safety devices; Automotive industry; Costs; Electric power systems; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Safety engineering; Secondary batteries; Seed; Trucks; Agricultural vehicles; Automated driving; Automated systems; Automated vehicles; Autonomous driving; Disconnect switch; Harmful emissions; Risk of accidents; Commercial vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084306797

There is a need to find innovative solutions for economical managing of abandoned sites, while ensuring risks to public and the environmental safety. This new approach to repurposing mine sites, which was presented in the article may take advantage of existing mine infrastructure and contribute to the local community, environmental and economy after the mine has been closed down. The aim of this study is to present potential benefits of combining the integration of CO2 storage with the production of heat and methane. The CO2 storage in coal mines becomes more acceptable when integrated into a complete, overall energy development plan. The novelty of this concept is a comprehensive approach to the problem of abandoned mines management. This aim could be achieved by using CO2 properties for enhanced coal bed methane recovery and geothermic energy extraction in abandoned coal mines. CO2-geothermics aims at enhancing a density profile by cooling and condensing CO2 using a heat exchanger at the top of the reservoir. A theoretical evaluation indicates some important benefits of CO2-geothermics over other types of geothermal energy. The efficiency of the system is potentially very high, because the heat transport capacity per kg fluid in a dual-phase CO2-system is almost 4 times higher than for a comparable hydrothermal project. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The present study focused on understanding the impact of air quality and meteorology on visibility impairment for a tropical coastal city (Chennai, India). Visibility measurements were carried out for 176 days representing summer, winter and post-monsoon season. The meteorological and air quality parameters for the study period were taken from the nearest continuous monitoring station supervised by the Central Pollution Control Board of India (located within 2 km of the visibility monitoring site). It was found that the average visibility experienced by the city is 11.24 ± 5.47 km. The seasonal variations in the data monitored showed maximum average visibility (15.06 ± 2.87 km) during summer, followed by winter (7.64 ± 3.53) and post-monsoon season (5.80 ± 2.72). The stepwise linear regression model was developed to predict visibility. The model developed for winter showed PM2.5 is the significant predictor with reasonable R2 value of 0.68. It was observed that there is a strong negative correlation between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and visibility. During summer ozone, PM2.5, wind speed, relative humidity, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) turned out to be the significant predictors for visibility and Pearson correlation showed inverse correlation between visibility and ozone (-0.683), as well as PM2.5 (-0.587). Thus the model developed for summer was able to capture the photochemistry of the summer and explained 71% variation in visibility. The number of low visibility events (&lt; 2 km) were estimated for different seasons excluding fog events (RH &gt; 90). The results showed large numbers of low visibility events in winter (348) followed by post-monsoon (205). The results also indicated that haze events increased with an increase in particulate matter concentration (&gt; 60 µg/m3), RH (&gt; 65) and decrease in wind speeds (&lt; 1 m/s). © 2019 WIT Press","Air pollution; Meteorology; Regression; Visibility reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072114369

The paucity of feedstock varieties is a major challenge plaguing the sustainability of this sector. Biomethane potential, biodegradability and degradation kinetics of organic substrates are essential for assessing the suitability of feedstocks for methane generation and the overall performance of the anaerobic digestion process in biogas plants. Waste from the vegetable okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) is a novel substrate; its biodegradability and degradation dynamics in biomethane production are largely unstudied, and were therefore the aims of this research. The substrate was digested for 25 days at the mesophilic condition and the biomethane potential data were recorded. Measured data of methane yield and the elemental composition of the substrate were used to fit five models (modified Gompertz, Stannard, transference function, logistic and first-order models) to predict degradation parameters and determine biodegradability of the substrate, respectively. Low lag phase (0.143 d), positive kinetic constant (0.2994/d) and the model fitness indicator (<10) showed that transference and first-order kinetic models predicted the methane yield better than did other growth functions. The experimental methane yield was 270.98 mL/gVS, theoretical methane yields were 444.48 mL/gVS and 342.06 mL/gVS and model simulation ranged from 267.5 mL/gVS to 270.89 mL/gVS. With a prediction difference of 0.03-1.28%, all growth functions acceptably predicted the kinetics of A. esculentus waste. The findings of this study offer information on this novel substrate important for its use in large-scale biogas production. Significance: • Growing interest in biogas technology as an alternative energy source for both South African rural dwellers and industries, has mounted enormous pressure on known feedstocks, and instigated the search for novel substrates. • Our study shows that okra waste is a viable feedstock for biogas production. • The suitability of the first-order kinetic model over other models in predicting okra waste degradation was highlighted. © 2019.

Increasing numbers of vehicles are associated with growing noise levels from road transport in urban areas and rising public health problems. Motor transport is considered to be a main source of noise pollution, so it is important to investigate the level of traffic noise and assess the relationship with traffic flows. The paper describes the main methods for determination of noise characteristics of traffic flows. The dependences for the prediction of the equivalent noise level and the results of field measurements of sound levels are presented. The results of field experiments and the calculated values of sound levels obtained by the analytical method are tested for homogeneity, using the Wilcoxon test. Experimental studies have established that the external sound level depends largely on the speed of vehicles, road conditions, and basic operating characteristics of highways. The analytical method associated with the use of deterministic and probabilistic models makes it possible to predict the traffic noise. But when dealing with the foregoing methods, there arise specific problems, many of which have not been resolved: there is no uniform terminology, nor is there any consensus on the use of noise characteristics of traffic flows in calculations at different stages of construction and reconstruction of highways of a certain traffic flow model under conditions of human settlements. Standardized measurement methods have been established and revised throughout the years by many renowned researchers. These methodologies have been revised in order to minimize problems that may occur and may not be foreseen by a less experienced researcher when adopting the measurement methods. Standardizing the measurement method is also useful for researchers because it becomes possible for researchers from around the world to compare their data. The joint effect of road conditions and the operational status of the roadway on the acoustic pollution of the roadside area is not fully taken into account. Therefore, applying the internationally recognized acoustical measurement standards is a good way to start any noise measurement experiment. The purpose of experimental research is to investigate the joint effect of road conditions and the operational status of the roadway on the acoustic pollution of the roadside area of settlements: identify the main characteristics of noise produced by traffic flows, consider the comparability of results of the field experiment and analytical computations. Slopes of 20…40‰ have little impact on the noise caused by the movement of passenger cars and trucks. In this case, the average acoustic emissions are identical to those used in the prediction of noise mode. © 2019 The Author(s).","Acoustic emission; Equivalent noise level; Noise; Road; Roadside area; Traffic","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Acoustic noise measurement; Automobiles; Forecasting; Motor transportation; Noise pollution; Roadsides; Telecommunication traffic; Traffic control; Urban transportation; Acoustical measurements; Analytical computations; Environmental noise managements; Noise; Noise levels; Operating characteristics; Road; Standardized measurement; Acoustic noise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076967008

The results showed that stem density varied between 3 ha-1 in Acer ceasium to 273 ha-1 in Abies pindrow, with a total stand density of 350 trees ha-1. The importance value index (IVI) varied between 2.27 (Acer ceasium) and 62.22 (Abies pindrow). The mean basal area was recorded at 132.15 m2 ha-1. The average stem volume was measured at 120 m3 ha-1. The mean stem and total tree biomass carbon was 639 and 967 t ha-1 respectively. Similarly, the understory vegetation and litter, dead wood and cone biomass carbon was found 1.43 t ha-1 and 12.02 t ha-1 respectively. Soil carbon (0-30 cm) was calculated by using Walkey-Black methods multiplied by mean soil bulk density measurements. The average soil organic carbon was calculated 70.75 t ha-1. The Total average carbon stock of the community was calculated at 568.63 t ha-1. These results provide the evidence that, Abies Pindrow dominant community has a greater potential of sequestering carbon.

The oijective is minimizjng the total lifetime cost (LC) of the RO.rystem, and the oijective function is made up of two parts: an initial cost (Iq part that depends on the area of the membrane, and an operating cost (OC) part that depends on the transmembrane pressure. Since area and pressure are reverse!J' proportional, increasing the IC would reduce the QC or vice-versa. Hence, the total cost must have a minimum point with respect to area, which was our decision variable. The physical data regarding the process were acquiredfrom a company operating in Izmir province of Turk. The model was solved by using a commerciaf Y available optimization software. The optimum area was found as 22.8 nl (245.417 JI).

However, when higher rates are attempted, production becomes capped by blower and/or plant equipment limitations. Moreover, in some cases when a plant applies for a new operating permit for increased production, the local regulatory reduces the stack emission limit making plant expansion modifications more challenging. Increasing the rate of existing mist eliminator installations without equipment modifications results in higher operating pressure drop, higher penetration of small mist particles and formation of downstream drip acid caused by reformation (re-entrainment) of acid mist particles. Often it may seem there are no practical ways to expand. In general, if the plant could be designed not to generate mist in the first place or to keep mist formation to a minimum that would be highly desirable for plant operation and expansion. However, this is often not a realistic possibility given the constraints imposed on modern day manufacturers and operators. This paper describes the theory of mist capture along with tradeoffs when upgrading different types and styles of fiberbed mist eliminators for plant expansion based on existing inlet mist levels. Different design options are discussed for increasing capacity and reducing maintenance along with some project examples. Almost every expansion project is custom with a unique set of requirements and constraints. © 2019Sulphur 2019 + Sulphuric Acid.

The main sources of CO 2 around the world are electricity production, heating, industrial purposes, and transportation. One of the critical factors, global energy-related CO 2 emissions, increased to 32.5 Gt in 2017. However, carbon capture technologies have improved and carbon storage methods are beginning to be used widely around the world. One option to minimize the effects of CO 2 gas is converting it into another product. In addition to carbon emissions due to hydrocarbons, geothermal power plants, which have the highest capacity among renewables sources, emit non-condensable gases such as CO 2 and H 2 S at high concentrations, based on geothermal reservoir characteristics and power cycle type. In Turkey, Italy, and some African countries that have important geothermal sources, geothermal-based CO 2 gas emissions are greater than elsewhere in the world. In Turkey, the country’s 40 installed geothermal power plants produce energy by different power cycles, such as binary, single, and multi-flash systems. The total installed capacity was approximately 1200 MWe in 2018 and is expected to reach to 4000 MWe in 2030. The non-condensable gases emitted from these plants are composed of 95–98% CO 2 gas and are due to the reservoir rocks, such as marble and limestone from Paleozoic-aged Menderes metamorphic rocks. CO 2 emissions emitted by the geothermal power plants range from 900 to 1300 gr/kwh and are inevitable because of the use of open cycles in Western Anatolia in Turkey. Only a small amount of waste CO 2 emissions have been used to produce dry ice in the region. However, Turkey is one of the countries that is required to reduce emissions according to the Kyoto and Paris Climate Agreements. A global problem is the capture of CO 2 gas and its storage or conversion to another product, which has been studied by researchers for a long time. A solution may be biofuel production from geothermal-based CO 2 in countries with geothermal power plants that are high producers of CO 2 emissions, such as Turkey and Italy. In this study, a conceptual design of the Helioculture process is applied to geothermal power plants to produce biofuel by CO 2 . The Helioculture process is a new approach by which it is possible to produce biofuel or ethanol using a photo-biocatalytic process. The process uses solar energy and waste CO 2 to catalyze the direct-to product synthesis of renewable fuel. It is evaluated with applicable technology for high-CO 2 producing geothermal power plants, such as the Kızıldere (Denizli) geothermal field in Turkey. Based on the results, Helioculture-based fuel production may be five times greater than traditional biodiesel production in the region. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Biodiesel; CO 2 capture and storage; CO 2 emissions; Ethanol; Geothermal power plant; Hybrid system; Turkey",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064709837

Soft mobility (SM), i.e. cycling or walking, is one of the most studied behavioral policies, due to its ability to generate multiple positive environmental and health impacts. This work presents the assessment of different soft mobility scenarios through the MAQ modelling system.

Fire intervals are projected to decline drastically as climate warms, and forests that reburn before recovering from previous fire may lose their ability to rebound. We studied recent fires in Greater Yellowstone (Wyoming, United States) and asked whether short-interval (&lt;30 years) stand-replacing fires can Erode lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forest resilience via increased burn severity, reduced early postfire tree regeneration, reduced carbon stocks, and slower carbon recovery. During 2016, fires reburned young lodgepole pine forests that regenerated after wildfires in 1988 and 2000. During 2017, we sampled 0.25-ha plots in stand-replacing reburns (n = 18) and nearby young forests that did not reburn (n = 9). We also simulated stand development with and without reburns to assess carbon recovery trajectories. Nearly all prefire biomass was combusted (“crown fire plus”) in some reburns in which prefire trees were dense and small (≤4-cm basal diameter). Postfire tree seedling density was reduced sixfold relative to the previous (long-interval) fire, and high-density stands (&gt;40,000 stems ha−1) were converted to sparse stands (&lt;1,000 stems ha−1). In reburns, coarse wood biomass and aboveground carbon stocks were reduced by 65 and 62%, respectively, relative to areas that did not reburn. Increased carbon loss plus sparse tree regeneration delayed simulated carbon recovery by &gt;150 years. Forests did not transition to nonforest, but extreme burn severity and reduced tree recovery foreshadow an erosion of forest resilience. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

A waste heat recovery system presents a great opportunity to reclaim energy from the onsite refrigeration systems and convert it into useful hot water. A £216,275 project funded by The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and Innovate UK was setup to investigate the use of a waste recovery system within an onsite refrigeration system. The results showed a savings of 5% by the refrigeration plant in total along with an individual saving of 27% by the compressor within the refrigeration system.

Currently, the business-as-usual waste management practices in Myanmar are largely affecting the environment and public health. Therefore, this study developed an alternative approach to waste management for reducing the environmental impacts in Myanmar by highlighting the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from business-as-usual practices and three proposed scenarios during 2018-2025. The calculation methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Institute for Global Environmental Strategies were used for estimating the GHG emissions from waste management. It was estimated that the current waste management sector generated approximately 2,000 gigagrams of CO2-eq per year in 2018, trending around 3,350 Gg of CO2-eq per year in 2025. It was also observed that out of the proposed scenarios, Scenario-2 significantly minimized the environmental impacts, with the lowest GHG emissions and highest waste resource recovery. Moreover, the GHG emissions from business-as-usual practices could be reduced by 50% by this scenario during 2018-2025. The target of the similar scenario could be achieved if the local government could efficiently implement waste management in the future. © 2019 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.","Environmental impacts; Greenhouse gas emissions; Waste disposal; Waste generation; Waste management","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Developing countries; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public health; Waste management; Business-as-usual; Environmental strategy; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Local government; Waste generation; Waste generation rates; Waste management practices; Waste resources; Waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067502646

With a distributed hydrological model incorporating an agricultural sub-model, time-series rice growth and its yield can be simulated in correspondence with time-series soil moisture simulated by a hydrological model. Whereas such an agro-hydrological model is useful for assessing the climate change impact on agriculture in that it can simulate the potential rice production and the water-related damages on it against the given rainfall and meteorological condition, one of the challenges in simulating a realistic situation by a model is how to give a planting date in the model in regions where it is not fixed to a certain calendar date and differs in different fields and in different years. In this study, we examined an algorithm to estimate planting date in paddy fields using satellite data. The data we used are the 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) product by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), which provides global coverage with 250-m spatial resolution. The time series of the EVI values at each pixel was analyzed first to detect heading dates as the local maxima in each year. Considering the number of days for growing rice, the existence of the second and the third rice cropping was judged from the time intervals of the local maxima. The planting dates were then estimated from the determined heading dates and local minima of the EVI time-series EVI. The estimated planting dates were validated against national statistical data in Japan and also with field-surveyed data in Cambodia. They showed reasonable estimations in the areal statistics, but there remained gaps in the comparison at individual fields. © 2019, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering.","Climate change; Hydrological model; MODIS; Planting date; Rice production","Agriculture; Climate change; Hydrology; Plants (botany); Radiometers; Soil moisture; Time series; Distributed hydrological model; Enhanced vegetation index; Hydrological modeling; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Numerical model simulations; Planting date; Rice production; Climate models",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064334606

SMR plant energy efficiency is often poorly predicted during simulation and optimization, owing to a lack of physical detail in the relevant unit operation models. Our recent work addressed this lack of detail by introducing a physics-based, distributed model of a steam-methane reforming furnace and incorporating the model into a multi-resolution hydrogen plant model. However, a sensitivity study found that efficiency at the optimal operating point is highly dependent on the performance of product separation, which relies on pressure-swing adsorption (PSA). As mathematical models of PSA units pose numerical challenges, previous studies of hydrogen production at the flowsheet level relied on simplified models, often ignoring dependence of the separation performance on the rest of the process. In this work, we integrate a dynamic PSA model into a multiresolution hydrogen plant flowsheet with a detailed SMR model. Further, we demonstrate that the resulting, large-scale model can be reliably simulated and optimized using pseudo-transient continuation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-resolution flowsheets; Periodic processes; Pressure-swing adsorption; Steam-methane reforming",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069909717

It was proved that these mechanisms consist in heating material to a critical temperature at which an intensive decomposition of the material occurs with release of a critical amount of combustible gases and their inflammation. This makes it possible to establish effect of fire protection and properties of roofing formulations on inhibition of the reed inflammation process. Experimental studies have confirmed that untreated reed inflames under thermal action in 58 seconds which is respectively equal to the induction period of material decomposition and flame spreads throughout the material surface which results in a complete combustion of material. Duration of the induction period extends to 587.45 s due to decomposition of flame retardants under thermal action with emission of non-combustible gases inhibiting material oxidation and significantly intensifying formation of a heat protective layer of coke on the reed surface. This leads to a growth of the coke layer thickness and inhibition of heat transfer from high temperature flame to the material. The study has made it possible to determine conditions of fire protection of reed by creating a barrier for thermal conductivity. In addition, when a flame-retardant protection coating is applied, the temperature effect manifests itself in reactions in the pre-flame region with formation of soot-like products on the surface of a natural combustible material. This gives grounds to assert that the mechanism of imparting fire protection properties to the reed by means of bloating formulations is feasible and that the proposed technological solutions have practical attractiveness. The latter, in particular, relate to determination of quantity of the polymeric component since the reed is characterized by hydrophobicity and the aqueous solution of the flame detergent flows off the surface. Thus, there are grounds to assert that the controlled fire protection of reed can be ensured through the use of a complex roofing formulation of a mixture of flame retardants and a natural polymer capable of forming a flame-retardant film on the material surface. © 2019 Yuriy Tsapko, Aleksii Tsapko, Olga Bondarenko.","Fire protection of reed; Flame retardant coatings; Heat conduction; Surface treatment; Thermophysical properties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069984961

It is therewith critical for the entire industry to work towards sustainable design and construction with which environmental impacts could be utmost reduced. An overview of research reveals that the primary emission type, throughout a building lifecycle, constitutes emissions at the construction stage (a.k.a. upstream embodied carbon), as well as emissions at the operational stage. While there has been a significant research interest on mitigation strategies for curbing operational emissions, embodied emissions are generally overlooked. However, recent studies have revealed that reducing operating carbon is accompanied with a little increase in embodied carbon. Therefore, this study posits that both aspects, when tackling the global carbon emissions challenge, are equally important and need to be collectively examined, and a potential resolution would be identifying the interplay between embodied and operational carbon. According to the comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art literature pertaining to lifecycle carbon issues, this study reiterates the increasing significance of embodied carbon, urges that accurate assessment approaches for embodied carbon should be formulated, and recommends that the future research focus should be placed on holistic carbon assessment standard that could calibrate both embodied and operational carbon impacts. © Advancement of Construction Management and Real Estate, CRIOCM 2017.All right reserved.","Buildings; Climate change; Embodied and operational carbon emissions; Environmental impacts","Buildings; Carbon; Climate change; Construction; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Project management; Sustainable development; Assessment approaches; Building and construction; Building life cycle; Carbon emissions; Construction stages; Design and construction; Global carbon emission; Mitigation strategy; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069805413

Its aim is to limit the access of traffic towards heavily congested areas, thus to force road users to shift to other means of transportation by imposing toll fares to the vehicles willing to access these areas. Previous urban congestion pricing schemes have been efficiently discouraging individual vehicles from accessing congested areas by reducing traffic and mitigating environmental emissions. This study presents a new methodology for a dynamic zone-based congestion pricing system in networks with heterogeneous users, where the variable fares are calculated based on traffic congestion and environmental emission indicators. Congestion pricing methodology aims to determine optimal toll fares based on traffic congestion, vehicle type, and emissions produced based on the London Emission Model (LEM) to ensure reduction of emissions in the network-wide level. Further, methodology is developed within Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) framework with a microscopic simulation model, that enables behavioral adaptation of the drivers during the pricing period as well as realistic congestion propagation. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated against a potential fixed pricing scheme in a Leicester city network, with 9652 sections, 3757 nodes where pricing policy area covers four zones with radius of 1.5 km from the centre. Simulation outputs have shown decrease in traffic delay time and NOx emissions within the cordon area where the congestion pricing policy is applied. However, further strategic traffic management improvements are required to control the mode shift phenomena in the boundary area produced by the congestion policy. © 2019 The Author(s).","dynamic congestion pricing; traffic analysis; traffic modeling; urban tolls",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080913228

In the target year 2030, two scenarios are developed with the same socioeconomic development and transport demand projections. Business-as-usual scenario does not consider the mitigation measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions while the countermeasure scenario does. Among the 940.5 kt CO 2 -eq reduction (15.0 % of emissions from passenger transport in 2030’s business-as-usual scenario), the promotion of energy-efficient vehicles helps to reduce 631.0 kt CO 2 -eq, followed by 146.7 kt CO 2 -eq reduction by modal shift from motorbike to mass rapid transports. The shift from fuel-motorbike to electric motorbike helps to reduce 83.2 kt CO 2 -eq, together with 41.4 kt CO 2 -eq reduction by shifting from conventional bus to compressed natural gas bus. The promotion of eco-driving with digital tachograph in passenger car helps to reduce 38.2 kt CO 2 -eq. As the co-benefit, the air pollution due to transportation activities might be reduced thanks to the implementation of mitigation measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.

Drawing on interviews, policy document analysis, and site tours to buildings and energy infrastructure, this paper analyzes how deep decarbonization is being embedded into urban buildings, energy systems, and institutions. It argues that practitioners are finding ways to create new low/ zero carbon future buildings, but are having difficulty correcting the historical development path through retrofitting. This paper examines solutions and challenges brought to light by urban decarbonization in practice targeting existing buildings from which other cities can learn. Four key lessons for low/zero carbon retrofits are highlighted: 1) shift primary targets from homeowners to owners of multiple buildings, 2) expand the suite of resources available to support zero carbon retrofits, 3) experiment and teach using public investment, and 4) institutionalize energy and carbon reporting linked to municipal department targets. Given the necessity of low-carbon, efficient, and climate-resilient building retrofits to address the climate crisis, action can be scaled up by considering buildings and energy infrastructure an infrastructure priority for public investment.

This makes it necessary to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies that contribute to the maintenance of technical efficiency (TE). This study analyzed the relationship of TE with farmers' mitigation and adaptation action preferences, their risk and environmental attitudes, and their perception of climate change. Through the stochastic frontier method, TE levels were estimated for 370 farmers in Northwest Mexico. The results showed the average efficiency levels (57%) for three identified groups of farmers: High TE (15% of farmers), average TE (72%), and low TE (13%). Our results showed a relationship between two of the preferred adaptation actions against climate change estimated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. The most efficient farmers preferred ""change crops,"" while less efficient farmers preferred ""invest in irrigation infrastructure."" The anthropocentric environmental attitude inferred from the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale was related to the level of TE. Efficient farmers were those with an anthropocentric environmental attitude, compared to less efficient farmers, who exhibited an ecocentric attitude. The climate change issues were more perceived by moderately efficient farmers. These findings set out a roadmap for policy-makers to face climate change at the regional level. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation and mitigation preferences; Climate change perception; Environmental attitudes; Farmers' risk attitude; Technical efficiency","adaptive management; analytical hierarchy process; climate change; farmers attitude; perception; policy making; preference behavior; risk perception; strategic approach; technical efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069757842

They are key factors related to farmers’ attitudes towards the environment and climate change. Several methodological approaches, which were considered to be preferable for measuring the level of risk of an economic agent, ranging from highly risk-tolerant to highly risk-averse attitudes, are available. The Multiple Price List (MPL) method is one of the stated approaches that is gaining relevance. In this study, we apply the MPL and relate the risk outcomes to farmers’ socio-economic characteristics and their perceptions of the environment and climate change. Data were collected using a face-to-face survey, carried out with a group of 370 farmers of an irrigation district, located in the northwest of Mexico. The results showed a risk level of about 0.32, according to the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) coefficient, locating farmers of the region in a risk-averse group. The heterogeneity analysis showed that the socioeconomic factors and the perceptions of climate change are related to the farmers´ stated risk level. Farmers who are young women, with a tendency to use public support for structural investment, were shown to be risk-tolerant.

These buildings constitute part of the country’s modern heritage. The aim of the study was to empirically analyze – through documentation, in-situ observation and measurements with non-destructive testing – the state of damage and deterioration of school buildings, taking into account that these buildings continue functioning as before, even surpassing their useful life by more than 30 years, with minimal or no maintenance processes. Further to normal wear, tear and aging of materials, Chile’s frequent exposure to earthquakes has added lesions and structural damages. This study compares the behavior of buildings constructed with reinforced masonry from an early period (from the 40s to 60s) to the modular buildings constructed with industrialized systems and elements from a later period (from the 60s to 80s), considering the country’s seismicity and climatic diversities. In both cases the designs meet standards and regulations for quality and resistance. Pathological processes in structural and enveloping elements were recorded through direct observation. In addition, the instruments used (thermography, metal detector, humidity meter, Hammer test and laser level) enabled further analysis of the building’s constructive features. They account for possible causes of damage, monitor structural resistance conditions and measure constructive durability parameters. © 2019, RILEM.","Construction pathology; Modern architecture; Modular building; School architecture; Seismic behavior; Structural monitoring",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052286585

The evaluation involved both qualitative components, such as ethnographic observation, and quantitative components, such as closed-ended questionnaires and demographic data. The participants who engaged in the report-back process were significantly different from those who did not engage both in terms of their demographics, and in their indoor air pollutant concentrations. Participant understanding generally corresponded with the intended meaning of the research team, suggesting successful data communication. Additionally, many of the participants reported that they were inspired to take action in order to reduce their indoor air pollutant exposure as a result of the report-back process and information provided.

To quantify soil CO2 efflux, field experiments were conducted in situ (2015–2017) with an LCi-SC soil CO2 flux system under three semi-arid ecosystems in the Mediterranean as one of the main identified climate change hotspot. Mean values of Rs rates showed that soil CO2 effluxes were significantly different among various terrestrial ecosystems with higher Rs in semi-natural ecosystems as under Steppe 1.739 ± 0.717 μmol CO2 m–2 s–1 (658.093 ± 271.336 g C m−2 yr−1) and under Forest 4.205 ± 1.731 μmol CO2 m–2 s–1 (1591.307 ± 655.066 g C m−2 yr−1) than under the natural ecosystem Garrigue 0.914 ± 0.309 μmol CO2 m–2 s–1 (345.887 ± 116.935 g C m−2 yr−1). It appears that soil CO2 efflux is highly ecosystem-specific, so it is required to be verified across ecosystem types.We recorded a very strong relationship between Ts and Ws, as documented by the correlation coefficient (r = –0.848), respectively R-squared (71.908%).

The growing concern on the impacts caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from agroindustry production as well as the commitment to international treaties supports the relevance of controlling and estimating their emissions. The objective of this work is to calculate the emissions of the main sources of GHG in the cultivation and transport of soybean production in the macro-regions of Mato Grosso, pointing out the main routes and modal integration of the production sites to the main Brazilian ports. For this purpose, the Life Cycle Assessment methodology was adopted. The results show that in most cases, the production of one kg of soybean emits more CO2 than transportation of the same mass.

Metropolises are especially vulnerable in three main systems, often referred to as the FEW (i.e., food, energy, and water) nexus. In this context, urban rooftops are underutilized areas that might be used for the production of these resources. We developed the Roof Mosaic approach, which combines life cycle assessment with two rooftop guidelines, to analyze the technical feasibility and environmental implications of producing food and energy, and harvesting rainwater on rooftops through different combinations at different scales. To illustrate, we apply the Roof Mosaic approach to a densely populated neighborhood in a Mediterranean city. The building-scale results show that integrating rainwater harvesting and food production would avoid relatively insignificant emissions (13.9–18.6 kg CO2 eq/inhabitant/year) in the use stage, but their construction would have low environmental impacts. In contrast, the application of energy systems (photovoltaic or solar thermal systems) combined with rainwater harvesting could potentially avoid higher CO2 eq emissions (177–196 kg CO2 eq/inhabitant/year) but generate higher environmental burdens in the construction phase. When applied at the neighborhood scale, the approach can be optimized to meet between 7% and 50% of FEW demands and avoid up to 157 tons CO2 eq/year. This approach is a useful guide to optimize the FEW nexus providing a range of options for the exploitation of rooftops at the local scale, which can aid cities in becoming self-sufficient, optimizing resources, and reducing CO2 eq emissions. © 2018 The Authors.

In addition, we introduce the initial and basic calculation of wind energy density at the height of 100 m, the method for development of wind resources, and the development of wind energy responding to climate change. The Vietnam sea region has a huge potential for wind energy resource in 0–30 m deep-water with an area of 111,000 km2 and a potential capacity of producing 64,000 GW and in 30–60 m deep-water with an area of 142,000 km2 and a potential capacity of producing 106,000 GW. The most promising region is the coastal area of Binh Thuan - Ca Mau provinces with a density of nearly 1000 W/m2, which is one of the high potential regions in the world. Wind farms have been deployed in this region with a total capacity of 1 GW and is expected to be 9 GW in 2030.

The province of Groningen suffers from earthquakes, caused by decades of gas extraction. As a response, the National government reduced onshore gas extraction with over fifty percent already and decided it should be terminated completely before 2030. The biggest industrial gas consumers are forced to change to alternatives. But the most ambitious target of all is to completely replace the use of natural gas for renewable energy in residential and non-residential buildings in the next three decades, leading to zero emissions in 2050 in the built environment. In 2015, in the Netherlands 87 percent of all houses are heated with individual gas fired central heating systems. Also 12 % was heated with gas fired collective heating systems. That means that all but one percent of all houses in the Netherlands will be affected by this shift in policy. On average a thousand houses should be transformed and renovated every day, many of them on a large scale, for the next thirty years. Although almost 30 % of the Dutch housing stock is owned by housing associations, most houses have to be renovated by individual homeowners. Dutch houses have been made more energy efficient gradually in the last decades. Now policy must switch from supporting minor renovation to facilitate major renovations in order to replace natural gas for alternative renewable energy sources. In this paper we will discuss the scale of the task ahead. The authors of the paper are involved in the ex-ante evaluation of the Dutch Climate agreement, to be signed in December 2018. This agreement will contain specific measures to facilitate the transition of the Dutch built environment. In this paper we will discuss the natural gas free concepts that are being discussed, the supporting policies as well as the costs and benefits both for society as a whole and for individual households. Since it will be their houses that must be changed, individual homeowners and landlords are the key stakeholders in this process. All effort should be aimed at supporting them. In this paper we present the outcomes of a one year study that answers the wide-ranging question: Who should do what, when and how to renovate 99 % of all Dutch buildings in the next 30 years?. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

To sustain this growth, energy and electricity demands will increase. In 2015, of the 1337 TWh produced, 916 TWh were from fossil fuels. We prepared several models of electricity demand from 2015 to 2030, based on publicly available datasets and trends. Models were tested on data from previous years and adjusted accordingly. From several scenarios, we decided to introduce two possibilities, i.e., a scenario using high energy savings in all sectors, and a scenario counting on a high industrial growth not supported by an equal increase of electricity savings. For both cases we prepared models for extreme situations: (1) where coal- and lignite-based power plants are preferred after slow-down of a renewable energy boom, and (2) with high utilization of renewable energy supported by natural gas and nuclear energy. With GDP and population increasing at the same rate as in previous years, the unambiguous result in all scenarios is a 2 to 3-fold increase of the electricity demand by 2030. On the electricity production side, all scenarios stress the role of coal, renewables and nuclear sources. Both energy and climate policies should be prepared for such a development in advance. © 2019 by the authors.","Electricity; Energy policy; India; Sustainable development","Developing countries; Electric power utilization; Electricity; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Gas plants; Natural gasoline plants; Public policy; Sustainable development; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Electricity saving; Energy and climate policies; India; Policy implications; Renewable energies; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065494173

Despite this, in Canada and most other developed countries, consumers have been slow to adopt electric vehicles. In March of 2019, to encourage increased adoption of electric vehicles, the government of Canada announced a new federal EV subsidy program that will offer a rebate of up to $5000 on the purchase of zero-emission vehicles. When evaluating the costs and benefits of such a program, it is important to consider that the magnitude of emissions reductions achieved through EV subsidies relates to the emissions intensity of the electricity used to power the EV. In this paper, the cost-effectiveness of achieving emissions reductions through EV subsidy programs is evaluated with respect to each provincial electricity system in Canada. These results were then used to compare the cost-efficiency of EV subsidies to other investments in climate change mitigation initiatives, and ultimately decide whether EV subsidies are feasible to implement in any of Canada's provinces. © 2019 The Authors.

We have sensors collocated in triplicate at Interstate 25 Globeville (I25GLO; a USEPA near road site in an environmental justice area), one at La Casa (a USEPA NCore site), and one at National Jewish Hospital (a PM2.5 FEM site). Low cost sensors are garnering significant interest from regulatory agencies, researchers, and community groups as a way to measure relative differences in space and time, especially for unique events like wildfires and other source specific hot spots. Denver is focusing on PM2.5 to start based on good comparisons to FRM and FEM instruments in other real world field studies. The USEPA sites at GLO and LaCasa use GRIMM 180 EDM instruments to measure PM2.5, while at National Jewish Hospital a Teledyne 640 is utilized. We will present results showing sensor to sensor variability, comparison with two federal equivalent method (FEM) instruments, and comparing sensors to FEM instruments with different aerosol characteristics, i.e. near road vs residential. We will show overall bias of the sensors against the FEM instruments, seasonal variation based on temperature and humidity changes, and how we are reporting data to the community, both corrected and uncorrected. Denver will also discuss our expanding sensor network over the next several years as a result of a $1M Bloomberg Mayor's Challenge grant and how we are partnering with the local school district to make this exposure information actionable for the 10%+ of Denver Public School students affected by asthma. We also have plans to strategically deploy at least 100 more sensors throughout the city via an innovative public private partnership (P3), that will add nitrogen dioxide and/or ozone to the monitoring suite. © 2019 Cornerstone",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076056343

Dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR) is an important and ancient metabolic process for energy conservation with global importance for geochemical sulfur and carbon cycling. Characterized sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) are found in a limited number of bacterial and archaeal phyla. However, based on highly diverse environmental dsrAB sequences, a variety of uncultivated and unidentified SRM must exist. The recent development of high-throughput sequencing methods allows the phylogenetic identification of some of these uncultured SRM. In this study, we identified a novel putative SRM inhabiting hot spring microbial mats that is a member of the OPB56 clade (""Ca. Kapabacteria"") within the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi superphylum. Partial genomes for this new organism were retrieved from metagenomes from three different hot springs in Yellowstone National Park, United States, and Japan. Supporting the prediction of a sulfate-reducing metabolism for this organism during period of anoxia, diel metatranscriptomic analyses indicate highest relative transcript levels in situ for all DSR-related genes at night. The presence of terminal oxidases, which are transcribed during the day, further suggests that these organisms might also perform aerobic respiration. The relative phylogenetic proximity to the sulfur-oxidizing, chlorophototrophic Chlorobi further raises new questions about the evolution of dissimilatory sulfur metabolism. © 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

The EU aims at fostering the synchronised deployment of EVs and necessary recharging infrastructure. There is currently a lack of studies in the literature for analysing the societal impacts of EV and infrastructure deployment at continental scale. In our paper, we analyse the likely impact of related plans of the EU member states (MSs). With the help of qualitative and quantitative analyses, we study the impact of plans on recharging infrastructure deployment, contributions to the EU climate and energy goals, air quality objectives, and reinforcement of the EU's competitiveness and job creation. We soft-link a fleet impact model with a simplified source receptor relationship model, and propose a new model to calculate job impacts. The results overall show modest impacts by 2020, as most member states' plans are not very ambitious. According to our analysis of the plans, a reduction of CO2 emissions by 0.4%, NOx emissions by 0.37%, and PM2.5 emissions by 0.44%, as well as a gross job creation of more than 8000 jobs will be achieved by 2020. The member state plans are very divergent. For countries with more ambitious targets up to 2020, such as Austria, France, Germany, and Luxemburg, the climate, energy, and air quality impacts are significant and show what would be achievable if the EU would increase its pace of EV and infrastructure deployment. We conclude that more ambitious efforts by the member states' to deploy electric vehicles could accelerate the reduction of CO2 emissions and lead to less dependence on fossil oil-based fuels, along with air quality improvements, while at the same time creating new job opportunities in Europe. In regards to the ratio of publicly accessible recharging points (RPs) per EV, we conclude that member states have to come up with more ambitious targets for recharging point deployment, as the current plans will lead to only one recharging point per every 20 EVs by 2020 across the EU. This paper can serve as useful input to the further the planning of EV and recharging infrastructure deployment in the EU and elsewhere. Our study highlights that the different strategies that are followed in the EU member states can be a fertile ground to identify best practices. It remains a challenge to quantify how different support policies impact EV deployment. In terms of further research needs, we identify that more detailed studies are required to determine an appropriate level of infrastructure deployment, including fast chargers. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollutants; Alternative fuels; Electric vehicles; Electro-mobility; Employment effects; Greenhouse gas emissions; Recharging and refuelling infrastructure; Transport","Air quality; Air refueling; Alternative fuels; Carbon dioxide; Competition; Electric vehicles; Employment; Greenhouse gases; Air pollutants; Air quality improvement; Electro mobilities; Employment effects; Infrastructure deployments; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Source-receptor relationships; Transport; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068395213

As it is a dedicated aim of the EC and the EU member states to promote the utilisation of biomass fuels for energy production as a measure for CO2 emission mitigation and since high quality wood fuel resources are not available in high volumes in many European regions, the fuel spectrum to be applied in residential biomass combustion systems must be broadened in order to cover the rising fuel demand while avoiding increasing fuel prices in future. Moreover, measures to further increase the thermal efficiency of residential biomass boilers are urgently required to use the available biomass potentials as efficiently as possible and to keep them competitive in comparison to fossil fuel based systems, also in terms of energy labelling. Within an EU funded project a condenser based on the diffusion bonding technology has been developed for a fuel flexible biomass boiler based on extreme air staging with ultra-low emissions and optimised in terms of compactness and high efficiency. The development work has been supported by CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations. Subsequently, a condenser prototype has been manufactured and tested during a comprehensive test run program with two different biomass fuels (forest residues, miscanthus pellets). The results, which are presented in this paper, show, that an economically attractive solution could be reached which is able to fulfil the requirements for fuel flexible operation and to ensure high efficiencies of the overall plant. © 2019 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Biomass; Combustion; Efficiency; Emissions; Flue gas condensation; Fuel flexibility",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071064672

The synthesis of DMSP is confined to some species of microalgae especially, prymnesiophytes and dinophytes and its concentration level varies with some environmental factors. In this context, this research work applies an experimental approach to assessing the production rate of DMSP under varying salinity (28, 30, 32 PSU) across distinctive growth phases. For this purpose, estuarine isolated microalgae, Prymnesium simplex (prymnesiophyceae) was selected as a model organism. The results showed that the growth rate response of P. simplex was significantly reduced at lower salinity (28 and 30 PSU) compared to higher salinity in this range (32 PSU). The concentration of DMSP and particulate fraction of DMSP was also elevated at higher salinity in the exponential phase of growth and lower at lower salinity. In contrast, the maximum production of dissolved DMSP was seen at lower salinity. Essentially research is to determine a maximum contribution of the regionally important prymnesiophyte family in the process of biogeochemical sulphur cycling. © The Author(s).","Dimethylsulphoniopropionate; DMSPd; DMSPp; Osmolyte; Prymnesiophyceae; Salinity","Algae; Microorganisms; Dimethylsulphoniopropionate; DMSPd; DMSPp; Osmolytes; Prymnesiophyceae; Salinity; Growth rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077310113

Various structural and parametric deficiencies have been identified as potential causes of these albedo biases, related to vegetation distribution and abundance, snow albedo, and the representation of snow interception by forest canopies. There is, however, little understanding of how the albedo biases directly influence simulated climate because of difficulties in isolating them from other complex processes and feedbacks. In this study, we conduct a number of novel simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model (CESM), replacing the model's internal surface albedo calculation with values prescribed from observations or from other model simulations. Results show that while biases in surface albedo are largest in winter, those during spring have the greatest impact on surface climate because incoming solar radiation is much stronger. Correcting biases in the seasonal cycle of albedo in CESM reduces climatological temperature biases across the boreal region in spring and partially corrects Arctic sea level pressure biases, but due to compensating errors, overall climate biases are not always reduced. Additionally, we impose albedo patterns extracted from other climate models with large positive and negative albedo biases to illustrate the climate responses that can result. Prescribed surface albedo produces significant impacts on surface radiation, near-surface land temperatures, and, more rarely, atmospheric circulation. This is important because small changes to mean climate during spring can have major implications for the snow and surface radiation regimes. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","Albedo; Atmosphere-land interaction; Climate models; Climate variability; Model evaluation/performance; Snow cover","Climatology; Land surface temperature; Sea level; Snow; Solar radiation; Albedo; Atmosphere-land interactions; Climate variability; Model evaluation/performance; Snow covers; Climate models; albedo; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; climate modeling; climate variation; Northern Hemisphere; sea level pressure; snow cover; solar radiation; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062975520

Interestingly, although Africa contributes less greenhouse gas emissions (that lead to climate change) than more developed continents, it is one of the most vulnerable continents when faced with climate change. International stakeholders are motivated to implement climate change adaptation strategies, e.g. sustainable development and the introduction of genetically modified crops in Africa’s agricultural sector, to lower the continent’s vulnerability. However, when developing and implementing adaptation strategies, cognizance must be allocated to the unique cultural values of various stakeholders. This is often not the case as cultural value systems of communities are neglected in these processes, e.g. the African values system of Ubuntu (which focuses on relationality). It is imperative to investigate and compare individualistic-capitalistic Western values (with its focus on sustainable development and economic growth) and the values of Ubuntu as it pertains to environmental ethics. Both value systems attribute different significance to relationality between humans, non-humans, and the natural environment. From this, I argue that the individualistic-capitalistic West has much to learn from Africa’s Ubuntu and the ensuing potential for climate change adaptation. Subsequently, a call for a universal paradigm shift will be made, away from the economic and development foci of individualistic-capitalistic values, towards Ubuntu degrowth which prioritizes communitarianism, and the principle of sufficiency. I suggest that relevant and diverse stakeholders meet around the “global roundtable” to consider and discuss different perspectives and cultural values when developing climate change adaptation strategies on a global level. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101505568

This compound is known to adsorb gasses and carbon, participate in biological redox reactions and provide habitat biofilms for desirable microbiota proliferation. Therefore, biochar holds potential to modify rumen fermentation characteristics and reduce enteric CH4 emissions. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of hardwood biochar supplementation on fermentation parameters, methane (CH4) production and the ruminal archaeal, bacterial, and fungal microbiota using the in vitro RUSITEC (rumen simulation technique) system. Treatments consisted of a control diet (oaten pasture: maize silage: concentrate, 35:35:30 w/w) and hardwood biochar included at 400 or 800 mg per day (3.6 and 7.2% of substrate DM, respectively), over a 15-day period. Biochar supplementation had no effect (P ≥ 0.37) on pH, effluent (mL/d), total gas (mL/d), dry matter (DM) digestibility or CH4 production (mg/d). The addition of 800 mg biochar per day had the tendency (P = 0.10) to lower the % of CH4 released in fermentation compared to 400 mg/d biochar treatment. However, no effect (P ≥ 0.44) was seen on total VFA, acetate, propionate, butyric, branched-chain VFA, valerate and caproate production and the ratio of acetate to propionate. No effect (P &gt; 0.05) was observed on bacterial, archaeal or fungal community structure. However, biochar supplementation at 800 mg/d decreased the abundance of one Methanomethylophilaceae OTU (19.8-fold, P = 0.046) and one Lactobacillus spp. OTU (31.7-fold, P &lt; 0.01), in comparison to control treatments. Two fungal OTUs classified as Vishniacozyma victoriae (5.4 × 107 increase) and Sporobolomyces ruberrimus (5.4 × 107-fold increase) were more abundant in the 800 mg/d biochar samples. In conclusion, hardwood biochar had no effects on ruminal fermentation characteristics and may potentially lower the concentration of enteric CH4 when included at higher dosages by manipulating ruminal microbiota abundances.

Wind and solar power technologies are two most mature technologies today which can offset the use of fossil fuel-based power plants and decarbonize the electrical grid. Bhutan is generating renewable power by using its rivers in the run off river hydropower scheme, which is supplied across the whole country. Apart from hydropower small scale wind and standalone solar PV systems are currently operational; limited studies are available on solar and wind power potentials in Bhutan. Therefore, this paper discusses the assessment wind and solar resource potential of some of the selected sites of Bhutan using measured data from local weather stations and also NRELs climate data. The wind data is used to analyze the wind power density and wind power potential using Weibull distribution. Also, wind power potential at different heights are estimated after extrapolating wind speeds using wind log formulae. Wind power potential estimate analysis shows that valleys of Wangduephodrang, Tsirang and Trashiyangtse are found to have good potential for wind farm development.

This study aimed to determine the impact of site, season, and grazing on microbial population size, microbial biomass carbon, and dehydrogenase activity in two semiarid areas in Kerman Province, Iran. Soil samples were taken from four sites that were either cold or warm and either grazed or not-grazed over two seasons. Microbial count, microbial biomass carbon, and dehydrogenase activity were determined via plate count, fumigation-extraction, and colorometric methods, respectively. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference in fungal and bacterial plate count, microbial biomass, and dehydrogenase activity among the studied areas. Fungal and bacterial counts, microbial biomass carbon, and dehydrogenase activity were greater at cold sites compared to warm sites, possibly due to increased plant cover, soil organic carbon, and moisture. In addition, there was temporal variation in microbial properties and dehydrogenase activity with the increased activity of the spring samples. Grazing did not change the soil chemical properties but did alter its microbiological properties and dehydrogenase activity, indicating their greater sensitivity in estimating soil quality. Based on the measured microbial properties, the cold sites have an advantage in sustaining soil quality, and the warm sites are more likely to require protective management programs. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

One of the most critical sources of water in the western United States, the Colorado River extends 1,450 mi (2,334 km) through seven western states from Wyoming to California. It provides drinking water for nearly 40 million people, irrigates over 4.9 million ac (2 million ha) of land, and can generate more than 4,200 MW of electricity.Today, the CRB and the people and environments it serves face a looming supply-demand imbalance. Extended drought and climate change threaten unprecedented reductions in surface water flows even as urban population growth and new environmental and recreation demands promise to dramatically increase need for the river's water. The region's irrigated farmers, who hold legal rights to 70% to 80% of Colorado River surface water flows, are being asked to help cover expected supply-demand imbalances by conserving and sharing their agricultural water with other users. However, formidable legal, social, and cultural barriers make it difficult for farmers to share their water without facing real or perceived risks of permanent loss of their resource rights and of threats to their livelihoods and rural communities. This study draws on field visits and in-depth interviews with more than 60 irrigators, agricultural leaders, water experts, environmentalists, and federal and state officials in three western states-Colorado, Arizona, and California. It analyzes six instrumental case studies of innovative collaboration between irrigators and environmentalists, municipalities, and government agencies to conserve agricultural water while generating water for nonagricultural purposes. Based largely on in-depth interviews, the study analyzes existing legal, social, and cultural barriers to agricultural water conservation collaboration in the case study regions. It then identifies key hydrological and legal structural openings and related social conditions that have facilitated collaboration in these six cases among diverse, often opposing water interests.The study concludes by proposing a preliminary framework of analytical questions that can be applied in other contexts in the CRB where collaboration for agricultural water conservation may find favorable structural and social conditions. These cases suggest that in a highly diverse CRB in which uniform, system-wide solutions face many obstacles, responses to the CRB's formidable problems may benefit from close attention to innovative insights and lessons generated at the local level. © 2019 Soil Conservation Society of America.

Their distribution and structure are controlled by several key drivers, including sediment supply, type of vegetation, elevation, and local hydrodynamics. These dynamic systems are highly vulnerable and estimated to be experiencing annual losses of 1-2% globally. Past restoration efforts have largely implemented managed realignment strategies, however, examples of, and research on, conservation initiatives employing direct transplantation of saltmarsh vegetation into damaged or receding saltmarsh stands is less common. Here an example of transplantation restoration was investigated to understand its influence on sediment dynamics. Sediment settlement, deposition, and accretion rates of natural and restored vegetation (Bolboschoenus maritimus) and adjacent bare mudflats in a small estuary system were studied across consecutive seasons from summer 2015 to spring 2016 to examine the success of transplantation. Natural areas of B. maritimus were shown to be most effective at retaining deposited material, although experiencing the least amount of deposition (an average of 48 g/m2 per day), accreting by nearly 7.5 mm over the experimental period. Mudflat areas experienced the most deposition (an average of 322 g/m2 per day) whilst exhibiting the greatest erosion over the study, a decrease in level of 6 mm. Restored areas experience similar rates of deposition as their natural counterparts, however, did not retain this material as efficiently, presenting an erosion of 1.6 mm. The study indicates certain biogeomorphic processes have been altered within the restored area and beginning to reflect those of the natural area. However, the restored vegetation does not yet fully match the functionality of the natural B. maritimus stand, specifically where the natural stand displayed a net accretion of material the restored area did not. Such discrepancies may impact on the continued survival of the restoration site, which may have implications for the potential of transplanting to deliver ecosystem services, such as climate change mitigation through carbon burial. © 2019 Taylor, Paterson and Baxter.","Accretion; Restoration; Saltmarsh; Seasonal; Sediment deposition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068602006

Methane (CH4) being the cleanest hydrocarbon fuel, its share in energy basket should increase while considering its Global Warming Potential (GWP), whereas the reduction of direct methane emissions to the atmosphere must be in line with the Global Methane Initiative and targets for Green House gas emissions (GHG). This paper highlights the programs undertaken by the operator in developing its CBM asset as a sustainable venture through successful initiation and implementation of energy intensification, carbon footprint reduction and community development schemes. The paper highlights the various project initiaties focused on design optimization of energy intensive processes taken to reduce use of fuel. The paper also highlights the emission reduction done by encouraging local industries to shift to cleaner fuels, directly reducing emission of Green House Gasses (GHG). Extensive training and awareness programs were conducted for local farmers to promote use of System of Rice Intensification (SRI), bio-manure, vermi-composting and water conservation. Further initiatives included setting up bio-gas plants, reducing enteric fermentation and creating bio mass burning awareness. Planned, systematic and sustainable approach towards every activity of CBM field development enabled the operator to commercialize the project while reducing carbon footprint.

The U.S. Gulf Coast is an attractive target for CO2 storage because of the favorable formation properties for injection and containment of CO2. Deltaic formations are one of the primary targeted depositional environments in the Gulf Coast. This paper investigates CO2 storage in deltaic saline aquifers through a combination of geological modeling and flow simulation. The geological model in our study is developed based on a laboratory-scale 3D flume experiment replicating the formation of a delta structure and populated with geologic properties according to Miocene Gulf of Mexico natural analogues. We used invasion percolation simulations to understand the gravity-driven flow and the relationship between architecture, stratigraphy, and fluid migration pathways. The results were used to develop an upscaled model for compositional simulation with the key features of the original geological model and to determine injection schemes that maximize the injection capacity and minimize the amount of mobile CO2 in the formation. In order to achieve this, we used compositional reservoir simulations to study the pressure-driven flow and phase behavior. The results of invasion percolation simulations were used to identify the key stratigraphic units affecting CO2 migration. The realistic geometries and high resolution of the model facilitate the transfer of results from synthetic to subsurface data. The results allow for the analysis of deltaic depositional environments, important stratigraphic surfaces, and their impact on CO2 storage. The reservoir simulation model and phase behavior were validated against available field and lab data. The results of reservoir simulations were used to investigate the effects of main mechanisms, such as gas trapping and solubilization, on storage capacity. We compared our simulation results on the basis of invasion percolation (gravity driven) and reservoir simulation (pressure driven). The comparison is helpful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and determine best practices to evaluate CO2 migration within similar formations. The unique and extremely well characterized deltaic model allows for unprecedented representation of the depositional aquifer architecture. This research combines geologic modeling, flow simulation, and application for CO2 storage. The integrated conclusions will constrain predictions of actual subsurface flow performance and CO2 storage capacity in deltaic systems, while identifying potential risks and primary stratigraphic migration pathways. This research gives insights on prediction of CO2 storage performance and characterization of prospective saline aquifers.

The simultaneous occurrence of hot and humid extremes (hot, humid conditions) strongly influence human, animal, and plant health. In this study, the heat index (HI), a human-perceived temperature that takes into account changes in both temperature and humidity, was calculated for the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), USA. The trend revealed the HI to be mainly increasing except for the eastern regions of the MRB. Central and southern areas of the MRB were identified as hot spots having the highest risk for extreme HIs during both day and night.

Previous studies of farming practices in two provinces, namely Jambi on the island of Sumatra and Central Kalimantan on Borneo, have shown that this type of farming system is beneficial for human livelihoods. However, the evidence reported here indicates that it is not appropriate to describe current farming practices at these two locations as paludiculture because they do not achieve conditions of high water table and low greenhouse gas emissions. It is recommended that management of hydrology, including temporary or permanent blocking of canals, should be undertaken in order to reduce subsidence and CO2 emissions. To achieve sustainable productive use of degraded peatlands, they should be rewetted and planted with suitable crops and tree species. © 2019 International Mire Conservation Group and International Peatland Society.","Agroforestry; Cultivation; Kalimantan; Peat swamp; Sumatra",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070782971

However, this sector cannot be separated from the pros and cons for a long time. In a way, this sector can increase both national and regional income but on the other side, the adverse effects of it can threaten the survival of humans and the environment. Open tin mining activity has converted previously vegetated land cover become the nonvegetated land cover. Furthermore, the land cover changes to the mining area have a major impact on global warming which has become an international issue in the past few decades. This research aims to map and measuring land cover changes especially from vegetated to non-vegetated land cover related to tin mining activity in Bangka Regency.

In this factory, wastewater was treated by an open-type anaerobic baffled reactor (OABR) that comprised 60 compartments. A part of the wastewater was fed to a pilot-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor to enable a comparison of the process performance and GHG emission characteristics with those of the OABR. In the OABR, 94.4% of the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 18.1% of ammonia nitrogen was removed. GHGs emitted from the OABR included both methane and nitrous oxide. The total GHGs emitted from the OABR was 0.153 t-CO2eq/m3-wastewater. Nitrous oxide accounted for approximately 65% of the total GHGs emitted from the OABR. By contrast, 99.6% of the methane emission and 99.9% of nitrous oxide emission were reduced by application of the UASB. However, the ammonia removal efficiency of the UASB was only 2.2%. Furthermore, Acinetobacter johnsonii, which is known as a heterotrophic ammonia remover, was detected only in the OABR. These results indicated that high nitrous oxide emissions were caused by denitrification in the OABR and that application of the closed anaerobic system could drastically reduce the emissions of both methane and nitrous oxide. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission; natural rubber processing wastewater; nitrous oxide; open-type anaerobic baffled reactor; up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket","Ammonia; Chemical oxygen demand; Gas emissions; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Rubber; Rubber factories; Rubber industry; Wastewater treatment; Acinetobacter johnsonii; Anaerobic baffled reactor; Anaerobic waste water treatment; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Process performance; Rubber processing; Upflow anaerobic sludge blankets; Greenhouse gases; ammonia; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; rubber; anoxic conditions; bioreactor; chemical oxygen demand; denitrification; emission; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; wastewater; wastewater treatment; Acinetobacter johnsonii; carbon footprint; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; microbial community; nonhuman; rubber industry; Viet Nam; waste water management; anaerobic growth; greenhouse gas; sewage; waste water; Acinetobacter johnsonii; Anaerobiosis; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Rubber; Vietnam; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045205230

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations of the models are obtained by using the dynamic programming principle. We obtain the optimal emissions, optimal local and foreign investments in environment projects, optimal revenues, and optimal trajectories of carbon stock under three situations, namely, situation without JI, with JI (noncooperative), and with JI (cooperative), of the two countries by solving these equations. We also compare their optimal Nash equilibrium solutions. We find that the introduction of JI mechanism can slow down the growth of the carbon stocks by reducing emissions or increasing investment in emission reduction projects, compared to the situation without JI mechanism. However, the JI mechanism does not reduce the revenue of the two countries under certain conditions.

Because of these long-standing issues, RTP materials are unable to meet real needs. Herein, we present a new strategy for preparing super-stable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) silica (SiO2) microspheres with lifetimes up to 1.26 s and excellent stability against oxygen, water, strong acids, bases and oxidizers, via a one-pot hydrolysis-assisted crosslinking carbonization method. In this strategy, carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) were generated via a crosslinking and carbonization process of EDA and TEOS under hydrothermal conditions, and CPD-embedded SiO2 microspheres (CPDs/SiO2 Ms) are formed by the hydrolysis reaction of TEOS simultaneously. The luminescence centres of the URTP CPDs/SiO2 Ms are the CPDs. The Si-O network effectively stabilized the triplet states of the CPDs and endowed the composite microspheres with super-stable URTP. As far as we know, this is the first report of such a stable URTP material. We believe that the facile strategy presented in this paper sheds new light on designing stable URTP materials and has wide potential applications in fields like photoelectric devices, anti-counterfeiting, time resolved imaging, etc. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.",,"Carbonization; Crosslinking; Hydrolysis; Phosphorescence; Silica; Anti-counterfeiting; Carbonization methods; Carbonization process; Composite microspheres; Hydrothermal conditions; Room temperature phosphorescence; Silica microspheres; Time resolved imaging; Microspheres",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069797725

These detailed transient models are written using NPSS (Numerical Propulsion System Simulation). The main components of the NPSS models include a compressor, turbine, High-Temperature Recuperative heat exchanger (HTR), cooler, heater, pipes, and valves. In the transient models, the thermal mass and CO2 fluid volume for each main component are based on representative data or proven design practices for the corresponding component. The steady-state performance of each main component has been validated with representative data while the transient performance of the HTR has been validated with published experimental data. The models have been used to study the methods to ramp down the power output. The methods include extracting the CO2 from the inventory, reducing the opening of turbine inlet throttle valve, and increasing the temperature of the cooling water entering the cooler. These methods, along with a hybrid method of combining the first two methods, were evaluated for the rate of turndown in the power output, operability of the compressor, and cycle efficiency. The preliminary results suggest that inventory extraction is the most efficient but has a slow turndown rate while turbine throttle control is less efficient but results in a faster turndown rate. In addition, the inventory extraction reduces the margin of the compressor choke line but the turbine throttle control increases the margin of the choke line.

There are many benefits that countries, especially developing ones can gain from renewable fuels like biodiesel. Apart from the possibilities that opens for economic growth and development across the country, especially for rural communities; opportunities are available for independent power producers to generate power to off-grid users and local businesses. This is only achievable from engines and fuels with good economic performance. This paper analyse the impact of Callophyllum inophyllum (CI) biodiesel on the fuel saving and the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction, focusing on the application of CI biodiesel in two different systems, namely internal combustion engines in the transport sector and gas turbines in the power sector. The results showed that application of CI biodiesel in the power sector is able to have more significant savings in fuel and reduction in the CO2 emissions. © 2019 The Authors.

Introducing biphenyl groups (Bp-) on the dmp ligand enhanced the molar extinction coefficient (ε) of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band in the visible region (ε = 7,500 M-1cm-1) compared to that of the phenyl (Ph-)-containing analog (ε = 5,700 M-1cm-1 at λmax = 388 nm). However, introducing 4-R-Ph- groups (R = the electron-withdrawing groups NC-, or NO2-) led to a red shift in the band to λmax = 390, 400, and 401 nm, respectively. Single-crystal X-ray analysis showed the Ph- groups were twisted because of the steric repulsion between the 2,6-protons of the Ph- groups and 5,6-protons of the dmp ligand. The result strongly indicated that the π-conjugation effect of the 4-R-Ph- groups is so weak that the lowering of the energy of the dmp π* orbitals is small. However, when 4-R-ph- was substituted by a 5-membered heterorings, there was a larger red shift, leading to an increase in the ε value of the MLCT absorption band. Thus, the substitution to 2-benzofuranyl- groups resulted in visible-light absorption up to 500 nm and a shoulder peak at around 420 nm (ε = 12,300 M-1cm-1) due to the expansion of π-conjugation over the substituted dmp ligand. The photocatalytic reaction for CO2 reduction was tested using the obtained CuI complexes as photosensitizers in the presence of a Fe(dmp)2(NCS)2 catalyst and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole as a sacrificial reductant, which showed improved CO generation. © 2019 Takeda, Monma, Sugiyama, Uekusa and Ishitani.","CO2 reduction photocatalyst; Cu(I) diimine complex; Emission; Redox photosensitizer; Visible-light absorption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068535808

Drawing on the experiences of farmers from the Savelugu Municipal Assembly in Ghana, the paper investigates whether the adaptation practices by NGOs are localized and sufficiently progressive to ensure sustainable adaptation. The study is situated within the interpretive paradigm using a qualitative approach. Data was collected through interviews and focus group discussions with NGOs and farmers in the municipality. The study finds that institutions, particularly international NGOs and the various interventions they led, have been very critical for developing potential of farmers to be actively involved in the processes of change to minimize the negative impacts of climate change. They provide direct and indirect capacity building activities such as providing farmers with information on climate change and its impact on their yields and livelihoods, building farmers skills and knowledge to deal adequately with climate variability, laying the foundations for individuals to build various capitals, directly assisting in coping and adaptive livelihood activities, financial assistance to build livelihood capitals and engaging in impact offsetting strategies. These determinants of the adaptive capacity provide interesting input in terms of guidance for management options to enhance the adaptive capacity of the communities in the face of climate change.

Moreover, a high share of variable renewable energy sources disrupts the power system reliability and flexibility. Therefore, the coupling of multiple energy carriers is underlined to address the above-mentioned issues that are supported by the latest technologies, such as combined heat and power, heat pumps, demand response, and energy storages. These coupling nodes in energy hubs stimulate the conversion of the electric power system into the integrated energy system that proves to be cost-effective, flexible, and carbon-free.

A promising approach to overthrow this problem is the utilization of solid state recycling in converting aluminum machining chips directly into semifinished products to eliminate the cost of the remelting process and reduce CO2 emissions. Therefore, in recent work, chips of aluminum alloy (AA6061) were recycled by compaction and then extrusion conducted at 500°C, followed by equal channel pressing (ECAP) to study the resultant material properties and its microstructure. Moreover, the present investigation explores the influence of ECAP after hot extrusion on the corrosive behaviour of the recycled samples in saline solution (NaCl) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear polarization (LP). The results demonstrated a remarkable enhancement of the recycled chips' properties subjected to hot extrusion followed by the ECAP process.

PFNW is proposing to receive and stabilize supernatant tank waste from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hanford Site that is classified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as “low-level mixed waste”. Due to the origins of the waste, the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) has expressed concerns that the waste may contain dimethyl mercury (DMM) and that emissions of DMM may occur as a result of processing the waste. DMM is listed as a toxic air pollutant (TAP) under Ecology regulations for sources of TAPs in Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173-460. Ecology and the local air quality agency, Benton Clean Air Agency (BCAA), regulate emissions of TAPs through a series of review processes known as “first, second, and third tier review.” First tier review includes an analysis of potential TAP emissions and comparison to regulatory emission rate thresholds. If potential emissions of a TAP exceed the regulatory emission rate threshold, an air dispersion modeling analysis is required to determine if the maximum off-site concentration is above the ambient concentration threshold. If the maximum off-site concentration is above the ambient concentration threshold, then second tier review is required. Second tier review includes a health impact assessment of the potential emissions. If health risk or hazard from the potential TAP emissions exceeds the regulatory threshold, third tier review could be required. The ambient concentration threshold (“acceptable source impact level”, or ASIL) for DMM in WAC 173-460-150 is 1 x 10-99 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3), which is essentially a “zero threshold” and represents less than one molecule of DMM. In the first tier review, PFNW quantified potential TAP emissions from the processing of the waste, including DMM. The waste was analyzed for DMM content and the results were below the detection threshold. Ecology therefore required PFNW to use conservative assumptions about the concentration of DMM and the results of the air dispersion modeling analysis showed that the maximum off-site concentration of DMM was above the regulatory threshold. PFNW was thus required to submit a second tier review for the potential emissions of DMM. Ambient air concentrations from the facility were calculated using the air dispersion model AERMOD. Off-site concentrations were modeled for a discrete receptor grid including the maximally exposed individual, maximally exposed resident, maximally impacted worker, and sensitive populations such as nearby workplaces, residences, schools, retirement facilities, daycares, hospitals, and doctor’s offices. Modeled concentrations for these areas were used to calculate human health risk from multiple exposure pathways. Results of the health impact assessment showed that the hazard from potential emissions of DMM associated with processing and stabilizing of DMM at PFNW were several orders of magnitude lower than the hazard threshold in all areas analyzed. PFNW has submitted these technical analyses to Ecology for review in support of its air permit application for processing and stabilizing of the waste. © 2019 Air and Waste Management Association.

The increasing drought conditions can cause water shortage and heat waves and can influence the agricultural production or the water supply of cities. The Carpathian region is also affected by this phenomenon; thus, we aimed at identifying the tendencies between 1960 and 2010 applying the CarpatClim (CC) database. We calculated the trends for each grid point of CC, plotted the results on maps, and applied statistical analysis on annual and seasonal level. We revealed that monthly average temperature, maximum temperature and evapotranspiration had similar patterns and had positive trends in all seasons except autumn. Precipitation also had a positive trend, but it had negative values in winter. The geospatial analysis disclosed an increasing trend from West to East and from north to west. A simple binary approach (value of 1 above the upper quartile in case of temperature and evapotranspiration, value of 1 below the lower quartile; 0 for the rest of the data) helped to identify the most sensitive areas where all the involved climatic variables exceeded the threshold: Western Hungary and Eastern Croatia. Results can help to prepare possible mitigation strategies to climate change and both landowners and planners can draw the conclusions. © 2019, Reasearch Centre for Astronomy and Earth Sciences Hungarian Academy.

Regional requirements such as Emission Control Areas and the Norwegian ban on shipping emissions in its World Heritage listed fjords by 2026 indicate the same. Electric propulsion with battery storage is increasingly being used to reduce fuel costs and emissions, by enabling increased use of shore electrical power and solar photo-voltaic (PV) modules. European ferry operators have demonstrated operational savings with marine electric propulsion by completely replacing diesel fuel with mains electricity. For example, the Ar Vag Tredan ferry in France uses shore electrical power stored in super-capacitors and the Norwegian car ferry Ampere uses shore electrical power stored in lithium-ion batteries. It is no coincidence that Ar Vag Tredan and Ampere have aluminium hulls. Ampere is half the mass of a similar sized steel ferry, improving the viability of its electrical propulsion system.1 This has important implications for Australia, because Australian aluminium shipbuilders have a significant share of the world market in contracted aluminium vessels. Australia is therefore in a unique position globally with regard to the development of high-efficiency vessels.

The results show that with an integrated building design approach, cutting edge technologies and high energy efficiency measures a net reduction of 29 % energy in the retail, 32 % for row house and 41 % for the detached house model is achieved compared to design complying with the minimum requirement of the applicable energy code. By adding building integrated solar photovoltaic (BIPV) system, a net reduction of 86 % in electrical energy import to the retail, 100 % for row house and 96 % for the detached house model is achieved. Additionally by sharing waste heat recovered from retail refrigeration compressor racks, up to 68% of the space and ventilation heating demand of the retail-residential complex can be met. It has been found that by feasible combination of buildings designed to harness on-site energy and sharing energy between the individual buildings, dependence on utility grids can be reduced for climate change resilient urban infrastructure. © 2019 Building Simulation Conference Proceedings.

There are several reasons why the problem has received increased attention. The primary problem is fulfilling the social and living needs of households. Secondly, there is the problem of fuel poverty (or energy poverty) of Polish households, caused by high energy prices and, simultaneously, low financial income of their residents. The third issue is the effect of fuel poverty on ecological security of households. The fourth is the implementation of systemic solutions in the socio-economic policy for the benefit of energy security, which currently fails to supply any explicit legal definition of energy poverty. Having properly defined the problem, the authorities could consequently devise instruments understood as the operational form of public intervention (a specific action strategy) aimed to provide a comprehensive solution to this problem. Finally, the fifth pillar is the use of geothermal energy as an alternative source of thermal energy as a measure to reduce low emission and diminish its consequences from the viewpoint of local ecological security. The investigation undertaken to assess the potential of geothermal energy in increasing the level of energy security by eradicating or at least reducing the phenomenon of household energy poverty clearly confirms the effectiveness of this energy resource and the viability of the undertaking. The key factors contributing to this exciting perspective are the specific properties of geothermal energy and its relatively low price compared to conventional fossil-fuel-based energy sources. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).","Energy poverty; Geothermal energy; Security energy",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074093465

The outcome of this case suggests that local communities can promote bottom-up sustainability innovation through cross-sector collaboration that combines grassroots efforts led by policy entrepreneurs and nongovernmental actors with technical capacity provided by the government. The outcome also suggests that financial incentives are important, albeit with caveats, for motivating citizen participation in sustainability innovation. There are, however, a number of challenges associated with sustaining such innovation over time.

Gynodioecious breeding systems allows for selfing by hermaphrodites, whereas enforced outcrossing through females lowers risk of inbreeding. Females persist due to female advantage in the system. Using the gynodioecious species Silene acaulis (L.) Jacq., we compared establishment performance and female frequency in 17 populations in open, sparsely vegetated habitats versus closed, denser vegetated habitats, across a regional climate gradient in high-Arctic Svalbard. For two populations, genetics were performed using microsatellites to compare inbreeding levels between habitats. As S. acaulis is a pioneer species, we expected denser vegetation to represent more competitive environments, reducing establishment performance and increasing female frequency due to female advantage. We expected similar responses to harsher regional climate. Establishment performance was reduced in closed habitats and harsher climate, but female frequency was slightly lower in closed habitats and did not differ between regional climates. High inbreeding levels may indicate that female advantage is counteracted by pollen limitation. However, female frequency increased with latitude. Lower sun angle at higher latitudes reduce the heat-trap effect of the cushion growth form, and female advantage might be expressed as response to reduced microclimate amelioration. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.","Establishment; Female frequency; Genetic diversity; Gynodioecy; Successional stages; Svalbard (spitsbergen)","angiosperm; arctic environment; autogamy; energy budget; female; genetic variation; gynodioecy; hermaphrodite; inbreeding; microclimate; outcrossing; performance assessment; reproductive strategy; seedling establishment; succession; Arctic; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Silene acaulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063747919

Every year people make 850 million visits to museums. If the sector were to track its GHG emissions it could no longer ignore its direct impact on climate change. How can we determine, and can we reduce, the sector’s impact on climate through GHG emissions from energy use? What will mobilize museums to use their valuable relationship with the public to foster climate awareness in ways that lead to broader individual action and support for policies engendering positive climate impacts? This paper examines the slow process of building environmentally-sustainable practice in the museum field in the United States, explains existing programs for monitoring GHG emissions, and identifies how the future of sustainable and resilience action lies with collaboration and cross-institutional movements. It explores the roles of supporting, cross-institutional approaches such as Keeping History Above Water, #NotAnAlternative, and #MuseumsforParis, and cross-sector approaches of #WeAreStillIn. It concludes that, based on field-wide Summits, the success of other standards, and the growth of hashtags as social evidence of a movement, the field can no longer avoid its responsibility to climate. The changes the human world needs most are all related to our changing climate. If humans address the causes and opportunities of that changing climate, we can build a more just, verdant, and peaceful world.

The EPA also finalized regulations pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to reduce GHG emissions from stationary sources such as power plants, GHG-emitting oil and gas sources, and landfills. Various stakeholders have challenged a majority of these rules generally contesting the scope of EPA’s authority and its methods for regulating GHG emissions.

Lastly, to identify the best policy with which to regulate tourist transportation to the Borobudur Temple. To achieve those purposes, the real systems are identified and translated into system dynamic models using causal-loop and stock-and-flow diagrams. The model consists of three sub-systems, i.e., the number of tourists, the modes of transportation, and the volume of CO2 emissions. Moreover, this study generated eight scenarios for comparison with respect to the volume of CO2 emissions resulting from several transportation modes. The result of simulation with system dynamic methodology indicated that the CO2 emissions produced by scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4 are within the range of 1,800,000 kg CO2, which means that they approach the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50% by 2035.

In children, exposure to urban air pollution is associated, among others, with decelerated neurodevelopment early in life and increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, academic failure and the start of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. However, the evidence of the effects of air pollution on brain development is still inadequate, mainly due to the limitations in (a) characterizing brain development (most studies were based on subjective tools such as questionnaires or neuropsychological tests) and (b) air pollution exposure (most studies only used residential levels based on geographical modelling and also overlooking the variation in the mixture of air pollutants as well as the composition and hence toxicity of particulate pollutants in different settings), (c) the lack of studies during the most vulnerable stages of brain development (foetal and early life (first two years post-natally)) and (d) the lack of structural and functional imaging data underlying these effects. In mice, in utero exposure to fine particles was linked to structural brain changes and there is a need to establish the generalizability of these findings in human beings. Though scarce, current evidence in children supports the importance of the pre-natal period as a susceptible window of exposure. Two studies in schoolchildren found that pre-natal air pollution exposure might damage brain structure while exposure during childhood was not linked to any structural alteration. Another study showed that children with higher traffic-related air pollution at school had lower functional integration in key brain networks, but no changes in brain structure, possibly partly because of the time window of air pollution exposure (in utero versus childhood exposure). A key development is to discover the windows of greatest sensitivity of structural brain changes to air pollution exposure by incorporating the recent advances in non-invasive imaging to characterize natal and post-natal brain development and exploring whether and to what extend placental dysfunction could mediate such an association. Studying pre-natal life is important because effects at this time are of a potentially irreversible nature and because the largest preventive opportunities occur during these periods. © 2019 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)",,"academic failure; air pollutant; air pollution; attention deficit disorder; autism; brain development; childhood; fetus brain; global disease burden; human; neuroimaging; placenta disorder; placenta function; prenatal development; priority journal; questionnaire; Review; urban area; vulnerable population; adverse event; air pollution; animal; brain; child; child development; diagnostic imaging; drug effect; embryology; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; female; maternal exposure; mental disease; mouse; pregnancy; prenatal diagnosis; prenatal exposure; prevention and control; procedures; urban health; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animals; Brain; Child; Child Development; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Mice; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Urban Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064178182

This study selected two paddy soil samples, one from the city of Yueyang of Hunan Province and one from the city of Haikou of Hainan Province, that differ significantly in iron content. During a 25-day incubation, the effects of Fe(II) and Fe(III) contents and changes in the levels of several major iron forms on soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels and emission of CH 4 and CO 2 were observed. The ratio of Fe(II) content to all active Fe increased with an increase in Fe(II) content after soil flooding, and the proportion of all active Fe was significantly higher in the soil samples from Yueyang than in those from Haikou. In only 5 days, 92% of Fe(III) was converted to Fe(II) in Yueyang soil samples, and almost all Fe(III) had been transformed into Fe(II) by the end of incubation. Similar behaviors occurred in soil samples collected from Haikou, but Fe(II) represented only 59% of the active Fe by the end of incubation. In total, 2.2 g kg −1 of organic carbon in the Yueyang soil sample was converted to CO 2 and CH 4 , and the DOC content increased to 410% of its initial value by the end of incubation. In the Haikou soil, only 0.7 g kg −1 of organic carbon was converted to CO 2 and CH 4 , and its DOC content increased to 245% of its initial value by the end of incubation, which was a much smaller increase than observed for the Yueyang sample. Decomposition of organic carbon in the soil was closely related to iron reduction, and reduction of iron in soil significantly affected the conversion rate of organic carbon in soil. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Active iron; Paddy soil; Redox; Soil organic carbon decomposition","carbon; ferric ion; ferric oxide; iron; chemistry; flooding; microbiology; Oryza; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; Carbon; Ferric Compounds; Floods; Iron; Oryza; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062798848

Our present study was conducted to investigate the effects of light-dependent systemic regulation on the photosynthetic performance of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) under heterogeneous light conditions. Soybean plants were treated with heterogeneous light. Then gas exchange characteristics were measured to evaluate the photosynthetic performance of leaves. Parameters related to photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence, Rubisco and photosynthates were examined to study the mechanisms of light-dependent systemic regulation on photosynthesis. Light-induced systemic signalling by illuminated leaves reduced the Pn of both upper and lower non-illuminated leaves on the same soybean plant. The decrease in gs and increase in Ci in these non-illuminated leaves indicated restriction of carbon assimilation, which was further verified by the decline in content and activity of Rubisco. However, the activation state of Rubisco decreased only in upper non-illuminated leaves. Quantum efficiency of PSII (ΦPSII) and ETR also decreased only in upper non-illuminated leaves. Moreover, the effects of light-induced systemic signalling on carbohydrate content were also detectable only in upper non-illuminated leaves. Light-induced systemic signalling by illuminated leaves restricts carbon assimilation and down-regulates photosynthetic performance of non-illuminated leaves within a soybean plant. However, effects of such systemic regulation differed when regulated in upward or downward direction. © 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands","Directional effects; light heterogeneity; light signalling; photosynthates; photosynthesis; soybean (Glycine max L.

With the rapid development of the economy in China, CO2 emissions have increased dramatically. To reduce CO2 emissions, ensure the sustainability of China’s economy and implement the Paris International Convention, it is important to investigate the main factors affecting CO2 emissions and use those factors to accurately forecast CO2 emissions. In order to achieve accurate prediction of CO2, this paper proposes a CO2 emission prediction model based on principal component analysis (PCA) and particle swarm optimization for least squares support vector machine (PSO-LSSVM). Through data 1990-2016 in Hebei Province of China, this paper identifies 24 influencing factors though the bivariate correlation analysis. After applying PCA to reduce the dimensions of the influencing factors, two principal components were extracted as input variables. Then the parameters of the LSSVM model are obtained by PSO and the forecast model is established. By comparing the prediction results with actual values, it is proved that the prediction error of the PSO-LSSVM prediction model is 0.663%, which is smaller than that of the traditional BPNN and LSSVM models. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

To explore whether the strategy of environmental pollution prevention and control formulated by the central government can effectively prevent the failure of traditional environmental regulation, the central and local governments were selected as the participants of a game model. The incentive mechanism was introduced into the constraints, the evolutionary game model of governments and enterprises was established, and the optimal regulation strategy of both sides was constructed from the effect of environmental pollution prevention and control. Results show that the key to preventing the failure of pollution control strategies is to introduce the constraints of the central government, allocate the cost of pollution control, and provide financial support for the prevention and control of environmental pollution. In addition, the central and local governments should adopt different prevention strategies. The optimal allocation strategy of the special funds for environmental pollution prevention and control at the central government level should be to correlate positively the amount of funds with the amount declared by the local government and show a marginal decreasing relationship. Local governments should not impose severe penalties on enterprises for excess discharge of pollutants. With the escalating discharge, imposing reasonable environmental taxes and reducing the marginal emission reduction costs of enterprises are better regulation means than increasing penalties. © 2019 Technoscience Publications.

In this work, the CdS, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and C3N4 (CdS-rGO-C3N4) composite was synthesized by a simple one-pot hydrothermal method and utilized to construct a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Compared with CdS, C3N4 and CdS-C3N4, the CdS-rGO-C3N4 composite exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance, due to the expanded absorption of C3N4 in the visible region by CdS and promoted the charge carrier separation of a photoelectrode by rGO. Based on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with CdS-rGO-C3N4 and a PCB72-binding aptamer (ap/CdS-rGO-C3N4/GCE), a PEC aptasensor for the detection of 2,3′,5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB72) was developed. When H2O2 was added into the electrolyte, the PEC sensor exhibited an amplified response toward PCB72, and could be operated in a self-powered mode at a potential of 0 V. Under optimum conditions, the constructed PEC aptasensor exhibited a wide linear range of 10 to 1000 ng mL−1 for PCB72 detection, with a low detection limit (S/N = 3) of 1.0 ng mL−1. Moreover, this aptasensor exhibited high selectivity, good reproducibility and high stability. The applicability of the developed PEC strategy was demonstrated by determining PCB72 in environmental water. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Cadmium sulfide; Carbon nitride; Electrolytes; Glass membrane electrodes; Graphene; II-VI semiconductors; Nitrides; Environmental water; Glassy carbon electrodes; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Hydrothermal methods; Photoactive materials; Photoelectrochemicals; Reduced graphene oxides; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Photoelectrochemical cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063923823

Systematic and in-depth research into these issues is seldom conducted. In this research we combine qualitative and quantitative studies and use six state-of-the-art energy-economy analysis models and four long term scenarios to explore the distribution of regional contributions for climate change mitigation in the future. We focus on the energy investment gap and policy cost. The study's conclusion is that, under the assumption of carbon tax as a source of energy investment from 2025, the global positive energy investment gap in the climate change mitigation scenario will not appear until around 2035-2040. Asia and OECD90+EU (Countries from the OECD 1990, EU and its candidates) are the regions that will have a significant direct impact on the global energy investment gap under climate policies in the future. However, from the perspective of the relative value (the percentage of the energy investment gap relative to the energy investment in the Current Policies (CPol) scenario), Asia will contribute the most to the global energy investment gap under the climate stability policies. Under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) scenario, Asia will contribute the most in the near term and REF will contribute the most in the medium term. The findings show that OECD90+EU will bear more cost in the pledges scenario, and Asia will bear more cost in the climate stability scenarios in the medium term. Contrary to the common sense expectation, the developed regions will contribute the least in terms of the proportion of the policy cost to the respective economic aggregates under the climate stability scenarios in the medium and long term, but the opposite is true in the developing regions. By and large, from the perspective of the current climate change mitigation policies, the developed regions and developing regions will achieve a win-win situation in the long run, but the relative contribution of the developed regions is not as great as was previously expected. These novel findings should prove to be useful to policy makers when developing transition strategies for climate change mitigation. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate policy; Energy investment; Energy mix; Policy cost; Regional contribution","climate change; cost analysis; economic conditions; environmental policy; OECD; policy making; pollution tax; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069751865

For any organization to survive in the current arena of growing climate change laws and regulations, and increasing public influence, the issue of sustainability must be fundamental to the way it operates. A sustainable manufacturing approach will enable economic growth to be combined with environmental and social sustainability and will be realized via collaboration between a multidisciplinary community including chemists, biologists, engineers, environmental scientists, economists, experts in management, and policy makers. Hence, employees with new skills, knowledge, and experience are essential. To realize this approach, the design and development of a series of workshops encompassing systems thinking are presented here. After close consultation with industry, an annual program of interactive workshops has been designed for graduate students to go beyond examining the ""greening"" of chemical reactions, processes, and products, and instead embed a systems thinking approach to learning. The workshops provide a valuable insight into the issues surrounding sustainable manufacturing covering change management, commercialization, environmental impact, circular economy, legislation, and bioresources incorporating the conversion of waste into valuable products.

A major effect of global change on carbon cycling is altered exposure of natural organic matter (NOM) to solar radiation, particularly solar UV radiation. In terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, NOM is degraded by UV and visible radiation, resulting in the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide, as well as a range of products that can be more easily degraded by microbes (photofacilitation). On land, droughts and land-use change can reduce plant cover causing an increase in exposure of plant litter to solar radiation. The altered transport of soil organic matter from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems also can enhance exposure of NOM to solar radiation. An increase in emission of CO2 from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to the effects of global warming, such as droughts and thawing of permafrost soils, fuels a positive feedback on global warming. This is also the case for greenhouse gases other than CO2, including methane and nitrous oxide, that are emitted from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These trace gases also have indirect or direct impacts on stratospheric ozone concentrations. The interactive effects of UV radiation and climate change greatly alter the fate of synthetic and biological contaminants. Contaminants are degraded or inactivated by direct and indirect photochemical reactions. The balance between direct and indirect photodegradation or photoinactivation of contaminants is likely to change with future changes in stratospheric ozone, and with changes in runoff of coloured dissolved organic matter due to climate and land-use changes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; fresh water; analysis; animal; Arctic; atmosphere; chemistry; climate change; drought; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; ice cover; natural resource; ozone depletion; ozone layer; photolysis; pollutant; sea; solar energy; ultraviolet radiation; Animals; Arctic Regions; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Droughts; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Fresh Water; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Ice Cover; Natural Resources; Oceans and Seas; Ozone Depletion; Photolysis; Solar Energy; Stratospheric Ozone; Ultraviolet Rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062883421

However, the role of climate stresses on local conflicts over natural resources, the role of policies and adaptation in these conflicts, and opportunities to enhance cooperation have been neglected. These gaps are addressed in this paper using evidence from participatory action research on 79 cases of local collective action over natural resources that experience conflicts in Bangladesh and Nepal. Climate trends and stresses contributed to just under half of these conflict cases. Nine factors that enable greater cooperation and transformation of conflict are identified. Participatory dialogue and negotiation processes, while not sufficient, changed understanding, attitudes and positions of actors. Many of the communities innovated physical measures to overcome natural resource constraints, underlying conflict, and/or institutional reforms. These changes were informed by improving understanding of resource limitations and indigenous knowledge. Learning networks among community organizations encouraged collective action by sharing successes and creating peer pressure. Incentives for cooperation were important. For example, when community organizations formally permitted excluded traditional resource users to access resources, those actors complied with rules and paid towards management costs. However, elites were able to use policy gaps to capture resources with changed characteristics due to climate change. In most of the cases where conflict persisted, power, policy and institutional barriers prevented community-based organizations from taking up potential adaptations and innovations. Policy frameworks recognizing collective action and supporting flexible innovation in governance and adaptation would enable wider transformation of natural resource conflicts into cooperation. Key policy insights Climate stresses, policy gaps and interventions can all worsen local natural resource conflicts. Sectoral knowledge and technical approaches to adaptation are open to elite capture and can foster conflicts. Many local natural resource conflicts can be resolved but this requires an enabling environment for participatory dialogue, external facilitation, flexible responses to context, and recognition of disadvantaged stakeholder interests. Transforming conflict to greater cooperation mostly involves social and institutional changes, so adaptation policies should focus less on physical works and more on enabling factors such as negotiation, local institutions, knowledge, and incentives. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

An efficient and flexible control strategy is highly desirable for CO2removal in CO2absorption/stripping system. The excellent performance of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection scenarios could make it a better option for the flexible controllability of a CO2absorption/stripping plant. MPC performance depends significantly on the accuracy of the identified mathematical model of the plant. The state-space model is believed as the better option for MPC as it represents the plant model with true dynamics. Therefore, this study is focused on the design of the 2 × 2 MPC control strategy in MATLAB® MPC Designer Toolbox using 2nd order continuous-time state-space model. The main aim of this study is to develop a plant-wide control scheme based on MPC for the natural gas absorption/striping system. Step changes in the CO2composition of sweet gas (±5%) and stripper temperature (±15%) have been introduced in the absorption/stripping simulation model. The results show that the MPC controller has achieved the new setpoint of CO2composition within 0.5 sec in the setpoint tracking scenario. Similarly, the MPC controller has been able to reject the disturbances successfully introduced as ± 15% step change in stripper temperature within 7.5 sec. Hence, the performance of the MPC controller using the state-space model at higher step changes is adequate with no peak, closer to the setpoint, and no overshoot in the output. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A representative mail survey (N 5 786) of the general public in these cities revealed that 60% of respondents identified climate change as personally risky, with the perception that it will impact either their family or their city in the next 30 years. Our results indicate that the gap in risk perceptions between the public and experts may be decreasing, although we discuss several limitations and reasons why this result requires further investigation. Using regression models, we analyze factors that are hypothesized to drive risk perceptions and discover that pro-environmental worldview and perceived personal responsibility are the most influential predictors.

In a context where Indigenous peoples and perspectives are poorly represented in global climate politics, it is important to understand how Pacific people represent their own interests and imagine their own futures as pressures to move due to climate change take hold. We examine political action outside of formal governance spaces and processes, in order to understand how Indigenous people are challenging state-centric approaches to climate change adaptation. We do so by studying the works of Pacific activists and artists who engage with climate change. We find that *banua–an expansive concept, inclusive of people and their place, attentive to both mobility and immobility, and distributed across the Pacific Islands region–is essential for the existential security of Pacific people and central to contemporary climate activism. We find that Pacific activists/artists are challenging the status quo by invoking *banua. In doing so, they are politicising (im)mobility. These mobilisations are coalescing into an Oceanic cosmopolitanism that confronts two mutually reinforcing features of contemporary global climate politics: the subordination of Indigenous peoples, perspectives and worldviews; and the marginalisation of (im)mobility concerns within the global climate agenda. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","*banua; Anthropocene; Mobility; Oceanic cosmopolitanism; Pacific Islands","Anthropocene; climate change; human settlement; indigenous population; marginalization; mobility; politics; social movement; Pacific islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064830784

Wetlands are permanently or temporarily inundated with water and rich in nutrients. Therefore, wetlands equipped with Plant-Microbial Fuel Cells (Plant-MFC) can provide a new source of electricity by converting organic matter with the help of electrochemically active bacteria. In addition, sediments provide a source of electron donors to generate electricity from available (organic) matters. Eight lab-wetlands systems in the shape of flat-plate Plant-MFC were constructed. Here, four wetland compositions with activated carbon and/or marine sediment functioning as anodes were investigated for their suitability as a bioanode in a Plant-MFC system. Results show that Spartina anglica grew in all of the Plant-MFCs, although the growth was less fertile in the 100% activated carbon (AC100) Plant-MFC. Based on long-term performance (2 weeks) under 1000 ohm external load, the 33% activated carbon (AC33) Plant-MFC outperformed the other Plant-MFCs in terms of current density (16.1 mA/m2 plant growth area) and power density (1.04 mW/m2 plant growth area). Results also show a high diversity of microbial communities dominated by Proteobacteria with 42.5-69.7% relative abundance. Principal Coordinates Analysis shows clear different bacterial communities between 100% marine sediment (MS100) Plant-MFC and AC33 Plant-MFC. This result indicates that the bacterial communities were affected by the anode composition. In addition, small worms (Annelida phylum) were found to live around the plant roots within the anode of the wetland with MS100. These findings show that the mixture of activated carbon and marine sediment are suitable material for bioanodes and could be useful for the application of Plant-MFC in a real wetland. Moreover, the usage of activated carbon could provide an additional function like wetland remediation or restoration, and even coastal protection. © 2019 by the authors.","Activated carbon; Bioanode; Constructed wetlands; Marine sediment; Microbial community; Plant-MFC; Sediment-MFC","Activated carbon; Anodes; Bacteria; Electric power generation; Sediments; Shore protection; Submarine geology; Wetlands; Bioanode; Constructed wetlands; Marine sediments; Microbial communities; Plant-MFC; Microbial fuel cells; activated carbon; bacterium; constructed wetland; electrochemistry; equipment; fuel cell; grass; marine sediment; microbial activity; microbial community; organic matter; relative abundance; remediation; Annelida; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria; Spartina anglica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072216363

The increased level of phenol concentration in the Antarctic environment causes a significant risk to the aquatic and terrestrial lives there due to its persistence, biomagnification and accumulation in the food chain. The biodegradation of phenol in Antarctica is considered highly challenging owing to its harsh and extremely cold climate. Therefore, actions of bioremediation are crucial to overcome this problem. To date, little data is available regarding the biodegradation of phenol by aboriginal Antarctic bacteria, and reports on the utilisation of phenol as sole carbon source by strains isolated from Antarctic soil are scarce. In the present study, bacteria isolated from Antarctic soil and identified as Arthrobacter sp. strain AQ5-15 based on 16S rRNA sequence was screened and optimised through conventional method for efficient phenol degradation. Based on preliminary screening, AQ5-15 strain was capable of completely degrading 0.5 g/L phenol within 108 h at 10°C. A study on the effects of significant factors including nitrogen source and concentration, salinity, pH and temperature was carried out to optimise the conditions for phenol degradation. Finding revealed that this strain is a psychrotolerant with optimum temperature at 20°C and prefer neutral or near-neutral condition for phenol degradation. The basic knowledge obtained from this study will provide the benefits on custody of the Antarctic environment especially in removing phenol and its derivatives at low temperature. © 2019 Malaysian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

In recent days, farmers in the country are impacted by climate change. Events of surface runoff, landslides, and soil erosions, along with changes in rainfall pattern and intensity have elevated a decline in crop productivity and soil fertility. Considering the situation, a pilot project on Resilient Mountain Village was implemented in Kavrepalanchowk district of Nepal from 2014–2016 with a participatory approach to demonstrate climate-smart practices. These practices include the application of locally prepared bio-fertilizer (named as “jholmal”), green manuring in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and mulching in bitter-gourd (Momordica charantia L.) to determine crop yields compared to farmers’ business as usual practice. The results showed that there was a significant effect of jholmal in rice production during 2015–2016 when compared to farmers' business as usual practice. Likewise, green manuring also showed a significant difference in rice yield compared to farmers’ usual practice in 2015–2016. Bitter-gourd yields were significantly higher in mulching treatment compared to the farmers’ business as usual practice in 2015 and 2016. Rice yield increased by at least 10.1% and 8.1% while using jholmal and green manuring, respectively, whereas bitter-gourd yield increased by 18.1% with mulching practices. Our findings show that farmers have adopted these practices and minimized the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, thus moving forward to producing safer food using a climate-friendly approach. © 2019 The Author(s).

The mechanism was examined by electrochemical methods and electronic structure calculations. From controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) in CH3CN/2% H2O solutions, 1-Co supported by a non-macrocyclic ligand gives a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2-to-CO conversion of 78%, while 2-Co and 3-Co supported by tunable macrocycles afford higher selectivities for CO evolution with FEs of 91% and 98%, respectively, with the balance of charge going to H2 production in each case. Electrochemical experiments show that the turnover frequencies across the catalyst series increase systematically from 66 s-1 (1-Co) to 570 s-1 (3-Co). These results demonstrate that increasing the rigidity of the ligand framework enhances catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction over the competing H2 evolution reaction. Indeed, catalysis was extended to water, where the same trend was observed, and CPE in CO2-saturated aqueous solutions using a mercury electrode revealed that 3-Co catalyzes CO2 reduction at an overpotential of 420 mV in 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer with a Faradaic yield for CO of 93%. Homogeneous behavior was observed in acetonitrile solutions at carbon-based electrodes, while the catalysts were found to adsorb to mercury and exhibit heterogeneous behavior in aqueous solutions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and localized orbital bonding analysis indicate that the first reduction of each cobalt(II) catalyst is ligand-based to form [CoII(L-)]+ species. The second reductions are computed to transition from being ligand-localized (1-Co) to mainly metal-centered (3-Co) across the series as the ligand is more constrained, which yields a more nucleophilic cobalt center in 3-Co that enhances CO2 reduction, kinetically and thermodynamically, with respect to 1-Co and 2-Co. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","aqueous solution; bipyridyl- N-heterocyclic carbene; cobalt catalysts; density functional theory; electrocatalytic CO2 reduction; macrocycles; redox-active ligands","Acetonitrile; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Chemical bonds; Cobalt compounds; Density functional theory; Electrodes; Electronic structure; Hydrogen production; Redox reactions; Reduction; Sodium bicarbonate; Solutions; CO2 reduction; Cobalt Catalyst; Macrocycles; N-heterocyclic carbenes; Redox-active ligand; Ligands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070965802

AOM rate measurements are essential for assessing the efficacy of the benthic methane filter to mitigate the evasion of this potent greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Incubation techniques with trace amounts of radiolabeled substrate (typically 14CH4) represent the most sensitive approach for methane oxidation rate measurements. Yet, radiotracer application can be performed in different ways, rendering the comparability of AOM rate measurements in field and laboratory investigations problematic. We compared four different 14CH4-based short-term incubation approaches to quantify methane turnover rates in lake sediments. Three of the applied methods yielded similar and reliable downcore rate profiles. They provided clear evidence for AOM with maximum rates of 15 nmol cm−3 d−1 at ~ 17 cm sediment depth. Using the short-term slurry incubation (SL) method, however, we were unable to detect the AOM activity maximum that we observed with the other approaches. We hypothesize that changes in the microbial structure and disruption of physical interactions due to mixing of sediments negatively affected the activity of AOM communities and longer incubation times are necessary to enhance the sensitivity of this approach. Minor variabilities in rate measurement that we found in the non-SL incubations may be related to small-scale sediment heterogeneity, differential partial methane loss during sample handling, and/or an uneven application of the radiotracer. Whole-core incubations interfere the least with the in situ conditions, but the ultimate choice of the AOM rate measurement method will depend on the individual sampling requirements. © 2019 The Authors.

Hydropower is a very good candidate, since it is the only renewable energy source whose production can be adapted to demand, and still has a large exploitation margin, especially in developing countries. However, in Europe the contribution of hydropower from the cold water in the mountain areas is at stake under rapid cryospheric down wasting under global warming. Italian Alps are no exception, with a large share of hydropower depending upon cryospheric water. We study here climate change impact on the iconic Sabbione (Hosandorn) glacier, in the Piemonte region of Italy, and the homonymous reservoir, which collects water from ice melt. Sabbione storage plant has operated since 1953 and it was, until recently, the highest altitude dam of Europe at 2460 m asl, and the former second largest dam of the Alps with 44 Mm3. We use two models, namely Poly-Hydro and Poly-Power, to assess (i) present hydrological budget and components (i.e., ice/snow melt, rainfall), and (ii) hydropower production under optimal reservoirs' management, respectively. We then project forward hydrological cycle including Sabbione glacier's fate, under properly downscaled climate change scenarios (three General Circulation Models, three Representative Concentration Pathways, nine scenarios overall) from IPCC until 2100, and we assess future potential for hydropower production under the reservoir's re-operation. Mean annual discharge during 2000-2017 is estimated at 0.90 m3 s-1, with ice melt contribution of ca. 11.5%, and ice cover as measured by remote sensing changing from 4.23 km2 in 2000 to 2.94 km2 in 2017 (-30%). Mean hydropower production during 2005-2017 is estimated as 46.6 GWh. At the end of the century ice covered area would be largely depleted (0-0.37 km2), and ice melt contribution would drop largely over the century (0%-10%, 5% on average at half century, and null in practice at the end of century). Therefore, decreased ice cover, and uncertain patterns of changing precipitation, would combine to modify the future stream fluxes (-22% to -3%, -10% on average at half century, and -28% to 1%, average -13%, at the end of century). Power production, driven by seasonal demand and water availability, would change (decrease) in the future (-27% to -8%, -15% on average at half century, and -32% to -5%, -16% at the end of century). Our results demonstrate potential for decrease of cold water in this area, paradigmatic of the present state of hydropower in the Alps, and subsequent considerable hydropower losses under climate change, and claim for adaptation measures therein. © 2019 by the authors.","Alps; Climate change; Glacierized catchments; Hydropower","Budget control; Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Developing countries; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Ice; Remote sensing; Reservoir management; Alps; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; General circulation model; Greenhouse gas reductions; Hydro power production; Hydropower; Renewable energy source; Hydroelectric power plants; alpine environment; catchment; cold water; cryosphere; downscaling; general circulation model; glacial environment; global warming; hydroelectric power plant; ice cover; snowmelt; valley glacier; water budget; Alps; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070293206

SO productivity in turn is limited by low iron, light, and temperature, which restrict the efficiency of the carbon pump. Iron and light can colimit productivity due to the high iron content of the photosynthetic photosystems and the need for increased photosystems for low-light acclimation in many phytoplankton. Here we show that SO phytoplankton have evolved critical adaptations to enhance photosynthetic rates under the joint constraints of low iron, light, and temperature. Under growth-limiting iron and light levels, three SO species had up to sixfold higher photosynthetic rates per photosystem II and similar or higher rates per mol of photosynthetic iron than temperate species, despite their lower growth temperature (3 vs. 18 °C) and light intensity (30 vs. 40 μmol quanta·m 2 ·s −1 ), which should have decreased photosynthetic rates. These unexpectedly high rates in the SO species are partly explained by their unusually large photosynthetic antennae, which are among the largest ever recorded in marine phytoplankton. Large antennae are disadvantageous at low light intensities because they increase excitation energy loss as heat, but this loss may be mitigated by the low SO temperatures. Such adaptations point to higher SO production rates than environmental conditions should otherwise permit, with implications for regional ecology and biogeochemistry. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

In this study, the potential effects of such closures on air quality and human health were analyzed by linking a regional photochemical model with a health impacts assessment tool. The impacts varied significantly across 13 of the state's largest coal-fired power plants, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude, even after normalizing by generation. While some power plants had negligible impacts on concentrations at important monitors, average impacts up to 0.5 parts per billion (ppb) and 0.2 μg/m3 and maximum impacts up to 3.3 ppb and 0.9 μg/m3 were seen for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), respectively. Health impacts arose mostly from PM2.5 and were an order of magnitude higher for plants that lack scrubbers for SO2, with maximum impacts from a single power plant up to 178 deaths per year. Variations in impacts on ozone and PM2.5, and their associated health outcomes, were caused by sharply different NOx and SO2 emissions rates and spatial factors. Carbon dioxide emissions were relatively uniform, ranging from 1.00 to 1.26 short tons/MWh, and can be monetized based on a social cost of carbon. Combined monetized societal impacts from health impacts and carbon dioxide emissions ranged from $57/MWh to $143/MWh and exceeded wholesale electricity prices for all coal-fired power plants analyzed. This suggests that both air pollution and climate should be considered if externalities are used to inform decision making about power plant dispatch and retirement.

Any disturbance of its quality can lead to fertility damage, and its modification deregulates all the physicochemical, biological and biochemical functions taking place in the soil, and implicitly affecting crop plants for which soil is the support and source of nutrients. Salinity is one of the most widespread soil degradation processes, which jeopardizes the proper use of agricultural land. Globally, the total area of soil affected by high salinity is about one billion hectares, with affected areas estimated to be around 1 million hectares in Europe. Romania also has significant areas affected by the salty strips caused by the unrealistic exploitation of some soils and, on the other hand, by irrigation with water with soluble salts, which produces secondary salinisation. In BrÄƒila county, the farming land affected by salinity covers an area of approximately 60,000 ha, being concentrated mainly in the meadows of the main rivers and around the salty lakes in the county. This paper forwards an analysis of the lands affected by salinity in the Northern BÄƒrÄƒgan Plain, in Romania, as well as its influence on the germination of corn seeds. To this end, a series of surveys were conducted to study seed germination for 3 corn hybrids, namely Losc, DKC3568 and Olt. The studies were carried out under controlled laboratory conditions, and the germinations of the three hybrids under different saline conditions (5%, 10%, 15% sodium chloride) were evaluated. Research has shown that the Olt hybrid resists best at high salinity concentrations.

Survey responses were tabulated, and audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative coding to identify responses by research topic, country/region, and sector. Results Health practitioners indicated that their jurisdiction is currently experiencing an increased risk of arboviral diseases associated with climate variability, and most anticipated that this risk will increase in the future. National health sectors reported financial limitations and a lack of technical expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), statistics, and modeling, which constrained their ability to implement climate services for arboviruses. National climate sectors were constrained by a lack of personnel. Stakeholders highlighted the need to strengthen partnerships with the private sector, academia, and civil society. They identified a gap in local research on climate-arbovirus linkages, which constrained the ability of the health sector to make informed decisions. Strategies to strengthen the climate-health partnership included a top-down approach by engaging senior leadership, multi-lateral collaboration agreements, national committees on climate and health, and shared spaces of dialogue. Mechanisms for mainstreaming climate services for health operations to control arboviruses included climatic-health bulletins and an online GIS platform that would allow for regional data sharing and the generation of spatiotemporal epidemic forecasts. Stakeholders identified a 3-month forecast of arboviral illness as the optimal time frame for an epidemic forecast. Conclusions These findings support the creation of interdisciplinary and intersectoral ‘communities of practice’ and the co-design of climate services for the Caribbean public health sector. By fostering the effective use of climate information within health policy, research and practice, nations will have greater capacity to adapt to a changing climate.Background Small island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean region are challenged with managing the health outcomes of a changing climate. Health and climate sectors have partnered to co-develop climate services to improve the management of emerging arboviral diseases such as dengue fever, for example, through the development of climate-driven early warning systems. The objective of this study was to identify health and climate stakeholder perceptions and needs in the Caribbean, with respect to the development of climate services for arboviruses. Methods Stakeholders included public decision makers and practitioners from the climate and health sectors at the regional (Caribbean) level and from the countries of Dominica and Barbados.

Here we review the role that geoscience and the subsurface could play in decarbonizing electricity production, industry, transport and heating to meet UK and international climate change targets, based on contributions to the 2019 Bryan Lovell meeting held at the Geological Society of London. Technologies discussed at the meeting involved decarbonization of electricity production via renewable sources of power generation, substitution of domestic heating using geothermal energy, use of carbon capture and storage (CCS), and more ambitious technologies such as bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (BECCS) that target negative emissions. It was noted also that growth in renewable energy supply will lead to increased demand for geological materials to sustain the electrification of the vehicle fleet and other low-carbon technologies. The overall conclusion reached at the 2019 Bryan Lovell meeting was that geoscience is critical to decarbonization, but that the geoscience community must influence decision-makers so that the value of the subsurface to decarbonization is understood. © 2019 UKRI.

This is due to the wide range of hydrocarbon weight fractions, from bitumen to light hydrocarbon encountered in the source rock, along with the presence of both, the organic and the inorganic porosity systems, simultaneously. In such a play, while comparing zones of similar total porosity and water saturation, intervals with a better fluid type and porosity system will contribute more to the flow than other zones. In this paper an approach to poro-fluid typing a source rock is presented through examples from a carbonate source rock case study from the Middle East. The following core measurements were acquired on two wells: 1. NMR T 1 -T 2 measurements on as received, oil saturated and water saturated samples, 2. Retort measurements for effective and total porosity and saturation analysis 3. Solvent extraction saturations for quantifying total hydrocarbon saturation, and 4. Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure Analysis for estimating pore throat size distribution. TOC measurements were also acquired on all the samples. A classification technique called the Blind Source Separation analysis (BSS) is carried out on the combined dataset of NMR 2D maps and various classes are identified based on the typical signatures observed on the maps in different saturation states. The classes identified using BSS were correlated to other core measurements to assign a physical meaning to each class. Based on the results, three key poro-fluid groups are identified. These groups are bitumen hosted porosity, porosity in the organics, and inorganic hosted porosity. By integrating results from MICP and SEM, we identify the typical pore sizes observed in the above groups and recommend zones that will bet better contributors to flow. Finally, we tie the results back to the limited measurements available in the log domain to predict zones with better flow potential. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Bituminous materials; Classification (of information); Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum geology; Pore size; Rocks; Solvent extraction; Carbonate source rocks; Classification technique; Core measurements; Light hydrocarbon; Mercury injection capillary pressures; Physical meanings; Total hydrocarbons; Water saturations; Blind source separation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059975646

The study links climate-ecosystem-economic (CEE) models and discusses uncertainties within those tools. The example focuses on the key forage species in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (Western Canadian Arctic), i.e., Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida). Arctic cod can be trophically linked to sea-ice algae and pelagic primary producers and are key vectors for energy transfers from plankton to higher trophic levels (e.g., ringed seals, beluga), which are harvested by Inuit peoples. Fundamental changes in ice and ocean conditions in the region affect the marine ecosystem and fish habitat. Model simulations suggest increasing trends in oceanic phytoplankton and sea-ice algae with high interannual variability. The latter might be linked to interannual variations in Arctic cod abundance and mask trends in observations. CEE simulations incorporating physiological temperature limits data for the distribution of Arctic cod, result in an estimated 17% decrease in Arctic cod populations by the end of the century (high emission scenario), but suggest increases in abundance for other Arctic and sub-Arctic species. The Arctic cod decrease is largely caused by increased temperatures and constraints in northward migration, and could directly impact key subsistence species. Responses to acidification are still highly uncertain, but sensitivity simulations suggests an additional 1% decrease in Arctic cod populations due to pH impacts on growth and survival. Uncertainties remain with respect to detailed future changes, but general results are likely correct and in line with results from other approaches. To reduce uncertainties, higher resolution models with improved parameterizations and better understanding of the species' physiological limits are required. Arctic communities should be directly involved, receive tools and training to conduct local, unified research and food chain monitoring while decisions regarding commercial fisheries will need to be precautionary and adaptive in light of the existing uncertainties. © 2019 Steiner, Cheung, Cisneros-Montemayor, Drost, Hayashida, Hoover, Lam, Sou, Sumaila, Suprenand, Tai and VanderZwaag.","Arctic change; Arctic cod; Arctic ecosystems; Canadian Arctic; Climate change; Subsistence fisheries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064684005

It may be argued that addressing both of these issues, advancing Indigenous-Settler reconciliation, and mitigating climate change, can be done in the same space. Indeed, though Indigenous peoples in Canada and elsewhere have recently moved forward with renewable energy initiatives within their Territories, there has been very little critical analysis on just how such projects have been operationalized and whether renewable energy can or even should be considered a vehicle for reconciliation efforts. In this paper, we present a systematic review of Canadian literature (spanning from 1980 to 2017) concerning Indigenous peoples' involvement in renewable energy to better understand the stated motivations and desires of Indigenous peoples in Canada taking leadership, partnering in, and (or) participating in the renewable energy sector. Using a series of keyword search strings across three academic databases, two theses databases, and a grey literature search, we retrieved literature (n = 980) that was subjected to four exclusionary forms and then thematically analyzed the included literature (n = 26). Our findings suggest Indigenous peoples' experiences and motivations are varied, yet many are developing renewable energy in their Territories to: break free of colonial ties, move towards energy autonomy, establish more reliable energy systems, and reap the long-term financial benefits that clean energy can provide. Despite the apparent advantages seen throughout most of the literature reviewed here, we suggest further research in this area is necessary before this kind of positive rhetoric of renewable energy in Indigenous communities builds enough momentum that proponents become blind to possible shortcomings. We conclude with a broader discussion of the interactions between Indigenous-Settler reconciliation in the context of renewable energy projects as well as offering indicators for future research to fill current knowledge gaps. © 2019 Published by NRC Research Press.","Renewable energy; Indigenous peoples; energy sovereignty; Nation-to-Nation relationships; Indigenous-Settler reconciliation; free, prior, and informed consent","Climate change; Fossil fuels; Motivation; Renewable energy resources; Search engines; Federal governments; Financial benefits; Indigenous community; Indigenous people; Renewable energies; Renewable energy projects; Renewable energy sector; Systematic Review; Energy policy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062806443

In this context, most decarbonisation scenarios for transport foresee large market penetration of electric vehicles in 2030 and 2050. The emergence of electrified car mobility is, however, uncertain due to various barriers such as battery costs, range anxiety and dependence on battery recharging networks. Those barriers need to be addressed in the 2020–2030 decade, as this is key to achieving electrification at a large scale in the longer term. The paper explores the uncertainties prevailing in the first decade and the mix of policies to overcome the barriers by quantifying a series of sensitivity analysis scenarios of the evolution of the car markets in the EU Member States and the impacts of each barrier individually. The model used is PRIMES-TREMOVE, which has been developed by E3MLab and constitutes a detailed energy-economic model for the transport sector. Based on model results, the paper assesses the market, energy, emission and cost impacts of various CO2 car standards, infrastructure development plans with different geographic coverage and a range of battery cost reductions driven by learning and mass industrial production. The assessment draws on the comparison of 29 sensitivity scenarios for the EU, which show that removing the barriers in the decade 2020–2030 is important for electrification emergence. The results show that difficult policy dilemmas exist between adopting stringent standards and infrastructure of wide coverage to push technology and market development and adverse effects on costs, in case the high cost of batteries persists. However, if the pace of battery cost reductions is fast, a weak policy for standards and infrastructure is not cost-effective and sub-optimal. These policies are shown to have impacts on the competition between pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Drivers that facilitate electrification also favour the uptake of the former technology, the latter being a reasonable choice only in case the barriers persist and obstruct electrification. © 2019 by the authors.","Battery costs; CO2 standards; Electric vehicles; Energy-economy model; Recharging infrastructure; Transport modelling; Transport sector decarbonisation","Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Battery cost; CO2 emission reduction; Decarbonisation; Energy-economic model; Energy-economy models; Industrial production; Infrastructure development; Transport modelling; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069571008

As a result, the negative balance for this component is deepening. Therefore, taking into account the role of sulphur in plant nutrition, the current state of knowledge limited mainly to winter oilsed rape and the progressing reduction of sulphur emissions into the atmosphere, studies have been performed to determine the effect of various sulphur fertilizers, both soil as well as soil and plant spray, on yield, yield components, plant physiological parameters and grain chemical composition depending on different sulphur contents in the soil (two locations). The experimental factors were: 2 locations (IUNG - PIB Puławy 51°24'59? N - 21°58'09? E, IOR - PIB Poznań 52°24'24? N - 16°55'47? E) and 6 variants of sulphur fertilization. Spring wheat fertilization with sulphur, regardless of the form of the fertilizer used, resulted in a significant increase in grain yield, TGW (1000 grains weight), SPAD (greening index) and N content in the grain. The best results of the applied sulphur fertilization on the yield, yield components and mineral composition of wheat grain were recorded in conditions of insufficient sulphur in soil. Among the fertilizers used, liquid Sulfone was characterized by clearly better yield-forming traits than any other fertilizer, regardless of a dose. © 2019 Polish Society Magnesium Research.

This study examines how discrete-event simulation (DES) can identify areas for reducing FWG through packaging and consumer milk consumption behavioral changes. Household model parameters included: amount and type of consumption, type and number of containers bought, buying behavior, and shelf life of milk. Simulations comparing the purchase of quart, half gallon, and gallon milk containers were run for 10,000 days to identify which package type reduced waste for 50 1, 2 and 4-person households. Based on consumption averages from the U.S. National Dairy Council, results suggest that if 1 and 4-person households change their purchasing behavior from 1 half-gallon to 1 quart and 2 gallons to 3 half-gallons, they can reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from milk consumption by 33% and 12%, respectively, without reducing their total milk consumption. Purchasing enough smaller containers to be equivalent to a larger size decreased spoilage, but not enough to reduce a consumer's total milk consumption GHG emissions. Results showed that packaging accounts for 5% of the total milk consumption GHG emissions; most of a consumer's impact comes from milk spoilage and consumption. © 2019 by the authors.","Dairy; DES; Food waste; GHG; Household; Milk; Model; Packaging; U.S. consumer","behavioral response; dairy farming; emission; emission control; food waste; greenhouse gas; milk; model; packaging waste; simulation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069782291

With its large heat and carbon capacity and relatively slow dynamics, the ocean plays an integral role in climate, and provides an important source of predictability at seasonal and longer timescales. In addition, the ocean provides the slowly evolving lower boundary to the atmosphere, both driving and modifying atmospheric weather and climate. Understanding and monitoring ocean climate variability and change, to constrain and initialize models as well as identify model biases for improved climate hindcasting and prediction requires a more scale-sensitive, long-term observing system. A climate observing system has requirements that significantly differ from, and sometimes are orthogonal to, those of other applications. In general terms, they can be summarized by the simultaneous need for both large spatial and long temporal coverage, and by the accuracy and stability required for detecting the local climate signals. This paper reviews the requirements of a climate observing system in terms of space and time scales, and revisits the question of which parameters such a system should encompass to meet future strategic goals of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), with emphasis on ocean and sea-ice covered areas. It considers global as well as regional aspects that should be accounted for in designing observing systems in individual basins. Furthermore, the paper discusses which data-driven products are required to meet WCRP research and modeling needs, and ways to obtain them through data synthesis and assimilation approaches. Finally, it addresses the need for scientific capacity building and international collaboration in support of the collection of high-quality measurements over the large spatial scales and long time-scales required for climate research, bridging the scientific rational to the required resources for implementation. © 2019 Stammer, Bracco, AchutaRao, Beal, Bindoff, Braconnot, Cai, Chen, Collins, Danabasoglu, Dewitte, Farneti, Fox-Kemper, Fyfe, Griffies, Jayne, Lazar, Lengaigne, Lin, Marsland, Minobe, Monteiro, Robinson, Koll, Rykaczewski, Speich, Smith, Solomon, Storto, Takahashi, Tonazzo and Vialard.","Climate information; Climate observations; Integrated observing system; Observing gabs; Ocean observations",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069786953

However, this technique has not yet been exploited extensively at the subcellular level. Here, we test the feasibility of a focal stimulation approach using stimulated emission depletion/reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions-like illumination, whereby switchable light-gated channels are focally activated by a laser beam of one wavelength and deactivated by an overlapping donut-shaped beam of a different wavelength, confining activation to a center focal region. This method requires that activated channelrhodopsins are inactivated by overlapping illumination of a distinct wavelength and that photocurrents are large enough to be detected at the nanoscale.

A study was conducted to develop the fueling strategy for power generation of offshore facilities and for operation of various offshore vessels. Examples of offshore facilities include central processing plant (CPP), floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) and floating storage and offloading (FSOs). Marine operations include marine support vessels include crew boats, research boats, anchor handling tugs, supply vessels and flotels. These vessels are involved during the hook-up and commissioning (HU&C) and during normal and special offshore operation. Marine support vessels generally bunker fuel from main storage from offshore facilities. While suggesting the ""fuel type"", several points were considered with emphasis on the Original Equipment Maker (OEM) requirements, applicable local & international emission regulation and supply reliability. The ""Fueling Strategy"" study evaluated the pros and cons of single versus multi-fuel policy, identified the applicable fuel grade, and identified fuel storage location requirements with associated capacity.
