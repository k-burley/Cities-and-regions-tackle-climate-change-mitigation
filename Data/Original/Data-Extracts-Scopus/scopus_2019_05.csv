Although the urban poor are increasingly recognized as needing to be part of climate adaptation planning and implementation, many governance arrangements fail to explicitly include them. In order to make climate governance more inclusive, transformative capacity is needed. Drawing on two case studies from different urban contexts in South Africa, this paper explores the nature of inclusive governance between local government and the urban poor and the extent to which this has contributed to transformative development trajectories. The findings suggest that inclusive governance will be strengthened when local government (1) recognizes the everyday reality of the urban poor and works with them to identify priorities for transformative change, (2) supports sustained intermediaries who are urban poor themselves and (3) draws on diverse modes of governance to find new ways to engage diverse actors and experiment with inclusive adaptation planning and practice. These practices will help to build transformative capacity that can envisage and enable new ways of governing urban risk and implementing adaptation that puts the poor, frequently most impacted by climate and disaster risk, at the centre. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation planning; Inclusive governance; Local government; South Africa; Transformative capacity; Urban risk","adaptive management; disaster management; environmental planning; environmental risk; governance approach; local government; risk assessment; sustainability; urban population; South Africa; climate change; socioeconomics; South Africa; urbanization; Climate Change; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061247477

The underground economy accounts for a significant proportion of China's economy, but is not included in ofcial statistics. Therefore, the nexus of CO2 and the underground economy in China is worthy of exploration. To this end, this paper identifies the extent to which the underground economy affects CO2 emissions through the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 1998 to 2016. Many studies have focused on the quantification of the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic development. However, the insights provided by those studies have generally ignored the underground economy. With full consideration of the scale of the underground economy, this research concludes that similar to previous studies, the inversely N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) still holds for the income-CO2 nexus in China. Furthermore, a threshold regression analysis shows that the structural and technological effects are environment-beneficial and drive the EKC downward by their threshold effects. The empirical techniques in this paper can also be applied for similar research on other emerging economies that are confronted with the difficulties of achieving sustainable development. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; EKC; Industry structural effects; Informal economy; Technological effects","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic conditions; economic development; environmental economics; Kuznets curve; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067086352

The results show that China’s carbon intensity presents significant spatial spillover effects under different spatial weights, which indicates that the carbon intensity of a province is influenced not only by its own characteristics, but also by the carbon emission behaviors of geographically adjacent and economically similar provinces and regions. Financial structure, financial scale, and financial efficiency all have significant effects on carbon intensity within a province, while financial structure is also linked to carbon intensity in other regions, but financial scale has no significant spillover effect on carbon intensity in space. Areas with high financial efficiency can reduce their own carbon intensity as well as that of surrounding areas.

Based on a spatial panel econometric model with related energy and economic data from 101 counties in Inner Mongolia between 2007 and 2012, four main results are obtained: (a) The CO2eq emissions in Inner Mongolia rapidly increased at an average annual growth rate of 7.27% from 2007 to 2012, increasing from 287.69 million tons to 510.47 million tons. (b) The county-level CO2eq emissions in Inner Mongolia increased, but the growth rate decreased annually. Additionally, CO2eq emissions are highly heterogeneous in the region. (c) Geographic factors were the main cause of the spatial spillover effects related to county-level CO2eq emissions. Specifically, the levels of urbanization and technological progress were conducive to CO2eq emission reductions, and the economic growth and industrial structure had the opposite effect in Inner Mongolian counties. (d) Technological progress had a significant spatial spillover effect in Inner Mongolian counties, and the effects of other factors were not significant. Implementing relevant strategies that focus on the inter-county interactions among the driving forces of CO2eq emissions could promote energy savings and emission reductions in Inner Mongolia. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, we estimate methane emissions from an important downstream consumer of NG, the ammonia fertilizer industry, which commonly uses NG as a feedstock and a fuel for the production of ammonia and other upgraded products. Using a Google Street View (GSV) car equipped with a high-precision methane analyzer, we adopted a mobile sensing approach to measure methane mixing ratios along public roads that are downwind of the ammonia fertilizer plants. Useful data were collected from six plants, which represent &gt;25% of the total number of U.S NG-based ammonia fertilizer plants, and use &gt;20% of the total NG consumption by this industry. Based on the measured data, a source characterization model was applied to estimate the methane emission rates from the upwind plants. Assuming that the estimates are representative of emissions during normal operations of a plant, we calculated the NG loss rate (i.e. the ratio between NG emission rate and NG throughput). If the sampled plants are representative of the U.S. ammonia fertilizer industry, the industrial-averaged NG loss rate (± standard deviation) is estimated to be 0.34% (±0.20%), and the total methane emissions (± standard deviation) from this industry are estimated to be 29 (±18) Gigagram per year (Gg CH4/yr) in 2015–2016. This is significantly higher than the reported methane emissions of 0.2 Gg CH4/yr from the U.S. EPA’s Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gas Tools (FLIGHT). This study begins to fill an important knowledge gap in quantifying methane emissions along the NG value chain, and demonstrates the capability of mobile sensing for characterizing airborne emissions. © 2019 The Author(s).","Ammonia fertilizer industry; Bayesian inference; Methane emission; Mobile sensing","ammonia; Bayesian analysis; chemical industry; equipment; estimation method; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; methane; natural gas; precision; sampling; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070555032

By analyzing the results from the state-of-the-art global integrated assessment model, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, this paper aims to understand the future levels of financial investment needed for building and maintaining energy-related infrastructure in the two regions for fulfilling stringent targets consistent with 'well below 2 °C'. The results indicate that a rapid upscaling and structural change of these investments towards decarbonization are necessitated by the climate stringent scenarios. China and Europe need to increase their low carbon investments by 65% and 38% in a scenario reaching the 2° target relative to their respective reference scenarios which assume no such target from 2016-2050. In a more stringent climate policy scenario of the 1.5° target, these investment needs will increase by 149% and 79% for China and Europe respectively. Among all the energy sectors, energy efficiency, renewable electricity generation and electricity transmission and distribution are the three largest investing targets for the two regions. However, those investments will not likely be realized without strong policy incentives.

Based on the PM 2.5 data from 283 prefecture-level cities in China, we combine the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model and environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and use a geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to evaluate the effects of different factors influencing haze pollution in different regions. Nighttime light data from NOAA was used in place of gross domestic product (GDP) in a robustness test. From a global analysis perspective, the EKC is established, and the inflection point is approximately 40000 yuan per capita; however, the GWR estimate is better than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate with an improvement in R 2 from 0.20 to 0.75. The GWR estimation results show that different environmental protection inputs have different effects in different regions: 1. Technical inputs tend to increase productivity rather than reduce emissions in most areas except Guangdong and Jiangsu. 2. The industrial output values in Guangxi and Yunnan have a greater impact on pollution than those in other regions. 3. In the central and eastern regions with dense populations, comprehensive public transportation can effectively reduce haze pollution. In terms of environmental protection measures, park green areas can reduce pollution, and due to the current status of industrial waste recovery in China, increasing the recovery rate of industrial waste is not conducive to reducing pollution.

However, these analyses of long-term warming trends have generally been constrained by the short duration or coarse spatial resolution of available observational datasets. Here, we integrate two existing datasets of Great Lakes surface temperature (LSWT) to evaluate long-term warming trends during 1982–2012 at fine spatial scales and understand the roles of lake bathymetry and climatic factors in regulating the spatially heterogeneous warming rates with the aid of regional climate modeling. Our results show amplified warming in Lake Superior, central-northern Lake Michigan, and central Lake Huron, and muted lake warming elsewhere. This spatial heterogeneity in summertime lake warming is primarily ascribed to the interplay of lake bathymetry and climatological springtime (April–May–June) air temperature. The climatological air temperature strongly influences the relationship between lake warming rates and bathymetry, as the summertime warming rates increase markedly with greater lake depth in the relatively cold environment of Lake Superior but change little in the warmer environment of Lake Ontario. This conditional dependence on background temperature has important implications for understanding and predicting global lake temperature trends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate trends; Great Lakes; Lake surface temperature; Lake warming; Regional climate model; Spatial pattern","bathymetry; climate change; climate modeling; lake water; regional climate; spatial variation; surface temperature; trend analysis; warming; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; Laurentian Mountains; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054585691

The transport sector is a major source of CO2 emissions, and the most rapidly growing sector in terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in China. This paper estimated CO2 emissions in the transport sector across 30 provinces through the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) top-down method and identified the spatiotemporal pattern of the decoupling of transport CO2 emissions from economic growth during 1995 to 2016 by the modified Tapio's decoupling model. The CO2 emissions in the transport sector increased from 103.10 million ton (Mt) in 1995 to 701.04 Mt in 2016. The year, 2005, was a turning point as the growth rate of transport CO2 emissions and the intensity of transport CO2 emissions declined. The spatial pattern of transport CO2 emissions and its decoupling status both exhibited an east-west differentiation. Nearly 80% of the provinces recently achieved decoupling, and absolute decoupling is beginning to take place. The local practices of Tianjin should be the subject of special attention. National carbon reduction policies have played a significant role in achieving a transition to low-carbon emissions in the Chinese transport sector, and the integration of multi-scale transport CO2 reduction policies will be promising for its decarbonisation. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Indicator of decoupling; Negative environmental externalities of the transport sector; Transition to low carbon economy","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; economic growth; emission control; emission inventory; environmental impact; fuel consumption; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; transportation; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066923202

For measuring the gauge factors, carbon fiber filaments are attached to the base specimen surface at different angles. Their resistance response to multidimensional strain field is investigated by four-point bending tests. Piezoresistive models of carbon fiber filament in plane stress states are created using the test results. In the test setup, carbon fiber filaments are placed both on the tension side and the compression side. Both the models show that the piezoresistive response of carbon fiber filament is dominated by the longitudinal strain. Based on the inequality in the sensitivities to tensile strain and compressive strain, the piezoresistive models are modified further. The modified piezoresistive models reveal the following 3D-strain based gauge factors: 1.82 for longitudinal tensile strain, 1.64 for longitudinal compressive strain, 0.10 for transverse tensile strain, and -0.25 for transverse compressive strain. The 2D-strain based gauge factors depend not only on the polarity of the longitudinal strain and transverse strain, but also on the polarity of the strain in the thickness direction. The piezoresistive models are verified experimentally. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon fiber; CFRP; gauge factor; piezoresistivity; plane stress state","Bending tests; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Gages; Four-point bending test; Gauge factors; Longitudinal strain; Longitudinal tensile; Piezoresistive gauge factor; Piezoresistivity; Plane-stress state; Resistance response; Tensile strain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069443039

To achieve a significant reduction in toxic emissions into the Arctic environment, it is necessary that the advanced technologies are in place to reduce material consumption, which, however, means higher capital investment. This prerequisite is in line with the national and regional policies, according to which the government is to stimulate the introduction of advanced technologies or to compensate, fully or in part, for overexpenditure (that some of the Russian regions may incur). In order to enhance the efficiency of managing the nation's mineral and fuel-and-energy resources and, in the first place, the resources of the Arctic, the authors have developed the technology life cycle model. Technological innovations are what reduces businesses' operating costs: the overall reduction of material consumption leads to lesser environmental load. A new type of economic analysis is suggested - investment-and-innovation analysis (retrospective and predictive analysis) - which ensures the analytical correlation between the targets of the industries' performance and those of technological innovation performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economic analysis; Energy resources; Life cycle; Mineral resources; Operating costs; Arctic environments; Conceptual frameworks; Effective management; Environmental loads; Environmental pollutions; Material consumption; Technological innovation; Technology life cycle; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068222294

However, the transboundary pollution confounded by local emission, meteorological conditions, and it is difficult to predict. Currently, most of urban air pollution prediction methods do not predict with transboundary air pollution. Therefore, we introduce a dynamic transboundary air pollution prediction approach based on convolutional recurrent neural networks(D-CRNN) which: (i) Divide the prediction inputs into prediction locations and transboundary air pollution sources; (ii) Use two different convolutional recurrent neural networks to solve the spatial-temporal feature of each inputs. (iii) Through a transboundary prediction network to integrate the spatial-temporal feature of prediction locations with the spatial-temporal feature of transboundary air pollution sources in a dynamic asynchronous method. Then use those mixed features to predict the air pollution. We evaluate our DCRNN model with the local atmospheric monitoring data in Kyushu, Japan and the transboundary air pollution data from 33 coastal cities in eastern Asia from January 2015 to July 2017. The results show that our D-CRNN model have achieved 86.2%, 78.6% accuracy of total prediction and transboundary air pollution in next 6 hours. © 2019 IEEE.","component; convolution neural network; deep learning; environmental prediction; long short-term memory; transboundary air pollution","Advanced Analytics; Air pollution; Big data; Convolution; Deep learning; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Atmospheric monitoring; component; Convolution neural network; Environmental prediction; Meteorological condition; Spatial-temporal features; Trans-boundary air pollutions; Trans-boundary pollution; Recurrent neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066610798

The electric energy and operational costs linked to the solid processing stage can account for 20% and 53% of the overall treatment respectively, and as such they are primary factors among utilities which must be considered while working toward more efficient strategies with less energy use. As part of the growing awareness of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, municipal wastewater treatment plants have begun reporting their GHG emission inventories. However, there is not yet a standardized or fully comprehensive CFP analysis for the biosolids management. In this paper, two major metropolitan WRRFs in China and the USA with two different biosolids management approaches were compared in terms of energy and carbon footprint (CFP). Site-specific equipment inventories coupled with state-of-the-art methodologies were used for the carbon and energy intensity assessment. Tailored biosolids management strategies and scenarios were included in the analysis to provide a venue for the reduction of their environmental impact. Co-digestion with food waste (FW) and the economic feasibility of its implementation were proposed as a GHGs mitigation strategy to highlight the energy recovery potential. Although both plants had similar energy intensity, Plant A (Shanghai) exhibited three times larger CFP primarily due to site-specific limitations on their biosolids management. The study showed the potential to improve CFP by 28.8% by selecting convenient strategies (i.e., incineration with AD). Energy recovery with its concurrent environmental benefits can be further enhanced by implementing FW co-digestion. This study shows the economic and environmental relevance of selecting adequate biosolids processing strategies and energy recovery practices in WRRFs. © 2019","Biosolids; Carbon footprint; Co-digestion; Energy intensity; Resource recovery","Biological materials; Biosolids; Emission control; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Recovery; Waste incineration; Wastewater treatment; Water resources; Carbon footprints (CFP); Codigestion; Economic feasibilities; Energy intensity; Environmental benefits; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Processing strategies; Resource recovery; Carbon footprint; biosolid; carbon footprint; comparative study; waste management; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Article; biosolid; carbon footprint; China; economic aspect; economic feasibility; energy cost; energy recovery; environmental impact; feasibility study; food waste; greenhouse gas; intermethod comparison; priority journal; sludge management; United States; waste water treatment plant; water resource recovery facility; California; city; economic model; economics; procedures; sewage; theoretical model; waste disposal; China; United States; Carbon Footprint; China; Cities; Los Angeles; Models, Economic; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061566330

We show that there will be more severe heatwaves (in terms of intensity, duration, and frequency) due to mean warming, with minor contributions from future temperature variability changes. While these changes come primarily from greenhouse gas increases, aerosol reductions contribute significantly over the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, per degree of global warming, aerosol reductions induce a significantly stronger response in heatwave metrics relative to greenhouse gas increases. The stronger response to aerosols is associated with aerosol-cloud interactions, which are still poorly understood and constrained in current climate models. This suggests that there may exist large uncertainties in future heatwave projections, highlighting the critical significance of reducing uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interactions for reliable projection of climate extremes and effective risk management. ©2019.

China, with the largest population in the world, is challenged with sever PM2.5 concentration, particularly in the urban area. Understanding the key factors influencing PM2.5 concentration is the basic step for taking targeted measures. Previous studies have identified the key impact factors on PM2.5 concentration in only a few selected cities, which barely contributes to China's PM2.5 concentration reduction. Therefore, this study aims to identify the key impact factors of PM2.5 concentration in 152 Chinese cities in eastern, central, and western China by using Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method. The findings of the study are as follows: emission intensity (EI) inhibited the PM2.5 concentration of 137 cities (i.e. 90.13% of the152 cities); energy intensity (EnI) depressed that of 99 cities (i.e. 65.13%); economic output (EO) stimulated that of 120 cities (i.e. 78.95%); and population (P) spurred that of 124 cities (i.e. 81.58%). This is the first study that provides a full picture of the key impact factors on Chinese urban PM2.5 concentration.

The results predict that CO2 prefers to adsorb at the bridge site of silver clusters and the C-O bond is difficult to break due to a high activation barrier at the electronic ground state. However, as the photogenerated plasmon energy of silver nanoparticles matches with the dissociation energy of the C-O bond, the CO2 easily dissociates into CO and an adsorption oxygen atom. Moreover, our calculated results demonstrate that the generated CO strongly adsorbed on silver clusters is favorable to its succeeding reduction reaction with hydrogen to CH3OH and CH4. The reaction barrier of the generation of CH3OH is lower than that of the formation of CH4, because the proton combines with the carbon more easily than with the oxygen atom at the initial reaction step. It well accounts for the experimental observation that CH3OH can be formed from the CO2 reduction on silver nanoparticles under visible light irradiations. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Gas adsorption; Ground state; Metal nanoparticles; Oxygen; Plasmons; Pollution control; Silver nanoparticles; Carbon dioxide reduction; Dissociation energies; Electronic ground state; Metallic silver; Reaction barriers; Reaction selectivity; Reduction reaction; Visible-light irradiation; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065307402

Quantitatively separating their impacts remains a challenge. To this end, we used time-varying Budyko-type equations and a hierarchical Bayesian model in this paper to separate their impacts in 31 provincial-level divisions of China. The time-varying Budyko-type equations treat the Budyko equation parameter w as a variable, which depends on human activities (represented by per capita gross regional production) and climate change (represented by temperature and precipitation). The hierarchical model quantifies the uncertainty of parameters and the interrelation between covariates across regions in China. The results show that the time-varying Budyko-type equation can improve the fitting capability for water resources in China. The hierarchical Bayesian model, which considered spatial dependence, reduced the uncertainty of the parameters compared to spatially independent counterparts. For most regions of China, human activities reduce water resources while climate change increases them.

We studied the community assembly processes and co-occurrence interactions of soil methanotrophs in three habitats (an alpine meadow, a marsh meadow, and a marsh) from Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Methanotrophic communities and CH 4 oxidation potentials varied considerably between the habitats, and the diversity of methanotrophs was significantly lower in marsh meadow than in the other two soils (P &lt; 0.001). Methanotrophic bacterial diversity was significantly correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, total carbon (TC), and total nitrogen (TN), while methanotrophic community structure was mostly correlated with soil C/N, TC, soil moisture, and TN. Stochasticity dominated methanotrophic community assembly, and increased from 67.6% in the alpine meadow and 68.0% in the marsh meadow to 98.2% in the marsh. The natural connectivity of co-occurrence network was greater in the alpine meadow than in the other two habitats, suggesting a more stable network in the alpine meadow. Methanotroph diversity contributed to the sub-network topological differences and keystone species were identified such as USCγ, Methylobacter, and RPC-1. The results suggest the existence of distinct community assembly processes and co-occurrence patterns of soil methanotrophs among different habitats, which may ultimately enhance the understanding of factors influencing CH 4 oxidation rates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Co-occurrence; Deterministic; Methane; Methanotrophs; Phylogenetic diversity; Stochastic","Aerobic bacteria; Assembly; Methane; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Stochastic systems; Wetlands; Co-occurrence; Deterministic; Methanotrophs; Phylogenetic diversity; Stochastic; Ecosystems; alpine environment; assembly rule; bacterium; coexistence; global climate; keystone species; meadow; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; microbial community; oxidation; phylogenetics; soil microorganism; soil water; stochasticity; water content; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methylobacter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062262234

The pilots have been running for many years. Does ETS significantly restrain the increase of carbon emission intensity? Based on China’s panel data for provinces and industries, this paper uses the policy assessment method to evaluate the inhibition by ETS of carbon emission intensity. The assessment scope includes six provincial pilots and pilot industries covered by ETS. The results show that ETS has significant suppression of carbon emission intensity only in Beijing and Guangdong. There is no significant impact on the carbon emission intensity of Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Hubei. Through the carbon emission intensity inhibition analysis of the industries covered by ETS from Beijing and Chongqing, the results of the production and supply of electric power, steam and hot water, petroleum processing and coking in Beijing have a significant impact on the ETS. Only the smelting and pressing of ferrous metals in Chongqing has a significant impact on the ETS. © 2019 by the authors.

In this paper, a model is proposed for analyzing the potential reduction in emissions associated with the adoption of a bicycle-sharing system. Methods are proposed for extracting human travel modes from mobile phone GPS trajectories, together with a geometry-based probability model, to support particle swarm optimization. A comparison study is implemented to analyze the model's computational efficiency. Based on the resulting optimal layout for the network of bicycle docking stations, and considering demand uncertainty, a multi-scenario integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize rebalancing procedures (i.e., moving bicycles between docking stations according to demand), to determine the detailed design-scale information required. Mobile phone GPS trajectories from approximately 3.7 million local mobilities are used to construct a case study for Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. The results show that, compared with the previous methods, the optimal layout solved by the proposed method could reduce emissions by a further 6.4% and 4.4%. With an increase from 30 to 90 bicycle stations, the adoption of bicycle-sharing can reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 3.1–3.8 thousand tonnes. However, emission reduction will maximally decrease by 21.26% after offset by bicycles production and rebalancing-generated emission. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bicycle-sharing; Geometry-based probability model; Particle swarm optimization; Potential emission reduction; Rebalancing optimization","Cellular telephones; Computational efficiency; Emission control; Integer programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sporting goods; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Bicycle sharing; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Integer linear programming models; Layout optimization; Potential reduction; Probability modeling; Rebalancing; Bicycles; comparative study; cycle transport; emission control; GPS; linear programing; mobile phone; optimization; sustainability; urban transport; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Tokyo [Kanto]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062820741

To this end, we build a price model based on an energy input-output table in hybrid units that ensures the consistency of the analysis. The results indicate that carbon taxation has small negative impact on GDP. There are, however, relatively substantial emissions reductions. To explore whether the impacts are spatially blind, in the sense of having similar impacts on urban and rural residents, the results of the distributional effects show that the impacts of carbon taxation on different urban household groups reveal small differences and are slightly regressive. Yet for rural residents, carbon taxation may be significantly regressive. In addition, rural residents are found to be affected much more than urban residents. Furthermore, the paper explores a policy intervention to investigate the effects of redistributing the carbon tax paid by households. The main results reveal that reallocating the carbon tax to the groups with low income levels can offset the negative distributional effects significantly. Moreover, the results of Miyazawa-style interrelational income multiplier analysis indicate that the household groups with high income would benefit significantly from the income increases in those with low income levels, but not vice versa. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon taxation; Energy input-output model; Income distribution; Miyazawa's input-output model; Quadratic programming","Carbon; Emission control; Quadratic programming; Carbon taxation; Economy wide effects; Emissions reduction; Energy inputs; Income distribution; Input output model; Multiplier analysis; Urban and Rural Residents; Taxation; algorithm; economic impact; emission control; Gross Domestic Product; household income; income distribution; input-output analysis; policy analysis; pollution tax; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059670908

Using the methodology of qualitative study, this article critically investigates these policy changes that generate incompatible regulatory concerns. The incompatibility creates competing regulatory concerns over energy-climate-environment in the policy making process, and generates discord between China's central and provincial governments.

Findings: The empirical results indicate that China’s overall environmental efficiency is low and that there is huge improvement space for energy saving. Under the concerns of emission reduction, the energy-saving potential of the central region exceeds that of both the eastern and western regions. With regard to water, electricity and gas consumption, the electricity-saving potential exceeds the potential for both water saving and gas saving. Originality/value: Previous studies rarely focused on the energy-saving potential, while considering environmental pollution.

Consequently, the Chinese government has implemented a number of policies and measures to reduce air pollution. Relying on published information over the last three decades in China, we analyzed trends in air pollutant emissions (SO 2 and NO x ) and concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and ozone (O 3 ). During the past decade, SO 2 and NO x emissions had declined throughout China and concentrations of PM 2.5 and PM 10 had considerably decreased in most cities, but average reported 90th MDA8 O 3 , M7, and AOT40 O 3 for 31 capital cities showed an increasing trend between 2013 and 2017. Despite progress in air pollution reduction and an increasing number of “clear sky” days, PM concentrations throughout China remain higher than the World Health Organization guidelines, and urban smog and haze remain a major threat to human health and the environment. Thus far, significant emission reductions have occurred largely through robust administrative power, especially when emission reductions were tied to the performance evaluations and promotion of government officials. Similar to most already-industrialized nations, China is now shifting away from SO 2 -dominated to NO x - and O 3 -dominated air pollution. Existing technologies and improved operations of existing control equipment appear unlikely to achieve sufficient reductions in NO x and O 3 pollution. Considering the complex relationship between O 3 , NO x , VOCs, weather, and socio-economic changes in China, it is necessary to increase research on impacts of increasing ozone on plants and to adopt novel technologies and implemented to further reduce air pollution to levels that will protect human health and the environment. © 2019","Administrative power; Air pollution; Challenges; Policies; Pollution reduction","Control equipment; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Health; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Public policy; Administrative power; Air pollutant emission; Challenges; Industrialized nations; Policies and measures; Pollution reduction; Socio-economic change; World Health Organization; Air pollution; nitric oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); ozone; particulate matter; policy implementation; pollution control; pollution policy; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; concentration (parameter); nitrous oxide emission; particulate matter; practice guideline; priority journal; socioeconomics; weather; World Health Organization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060768628

A spatial lag model with decomposed direct and indirect spatial effects was used to estimate the impact of industrial air pollution on health care expenditures in Chinese provinces from 2002 to 2014. The control variables of health reform, GDP per capita, urbanization, aging, education level, and hospital supplies were considered. Moran's I index was applied to investigate the spatial agglomeration of health care expenditures. The spatial lag model with fixed effects provided the best fit to measure the effect of industrial air pollution on health care expenditures. The global Moran's I of provincial health care expenditures increased from 0.3988 in 2002 to 0.4554 in 2014. The estimated spatial lag coefficient of provincial health care expenditures was 0.188. The estimated direct and indirect effects of industrial air pollution on provincial health care expenditures were 0.032 and 0.0072, respectively. The direct effect of health reform on health care expenditures was −0.006. The results indicate that the strengthening spatial agglomeration of provincial health care expenditures is caused by the joint effect of industrial air pollution, health reform, and other socioeconomic factors. Industrial air pollution increases health care expenditures in the local and neighboring provinces. Most importantly, the effect of industrial air pollution outweighs the reduction effect of health reform on health care expenditures. The final remarks of this paper suggest three main measures to reduce industrial air pollution and its health costs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Health care expenditures; Health reform; Industrial air pollution; Spatial lag model; Spatial spillover","Agglomeration; Air pollution; Costs; Control variable; Health damage; Indirect effects; Reduction effects; Socio-economic factor; Spatial effect; Spatial lag models; Spatial spillover; Health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061632502

(5) which caused the BDE to become negative. The correct and final version follows. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. The change in enthalpy for the bond formation of a PAH from its atoms was calculated based on the following equation [Formula presented]where n C and n H is the number of C and H atoms, respectively. E PAH , E C and E H are the total energies of the PAH, of an isolated carbon atom in its triplet state and a hydrogen atom in its doublet state and the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPV PAH ) was calculated based on, [Formula presented]where n CC and n CH are the number of –C and –H bonds, respectively. Furthermore ν CC,i and ν CH,j are the vibrational frequencies of the bonds i and j, respectively, which were calculated via the harmonic oscillator approximation and the finite-difference method. The enthalpy of atomization of the PAH was calculated based on the following relationship, [Formula presented]where BDE CH and BDE CC are the average bond-dissociation energies of the –H bond and –C bond, respectively. The change in enthalpy for the bond formation of the PAH is equal to the negative atomization enthalpy, [Formula presented] Therefore after combination of equations (1)–(4), the average BDE per –C bond in an arbitrary PAH becomes, [Formula presented] The BDE CH was estimated based on the energy required to dissociate a hydrogen atom from coronene (R = C 24 H 12 ) forming the corresponding radical (R • = [Formula presented]) given by, [Formula presented] The average BDE CH for coronene at B3YP/cc-pVDZ(5d,7f) level of theory was found to be 454 kJ mol −1 comparable to value reported for the BDE CH in benzene 473 kJ mol −1 and methane 439 kJ mol −1 . [28] The zero-point vibrational energy (ZPV) of –H at the same level of theory was found to be 34 kJ mol −1 in excellent agreement with the zero-point energy (ZPE) 36 kJ mol −1 , calculated from the IR band of the –H stretching in PAHs located between 3000 and 3100cm −1 [29], with the formula given by, [Formula presented] The ZPV of –H was calculated with the following equation, [Formula presented]where ZPV RH and ZPV R • . are the zero-point vibrational energies of coronene and coronene radical in its triplet state calculated at B3YP/cc-pVDZ(5d,7f), respectively. The average BDE CH of various stable carbon structures and the capped-SWCNT are shown Fig. 6. These calculations show that the stability of planar carbon materials is higher than carbon materials with curved surfaces (e.g. Fullerenes, NC and CNTs). This is associated to the existence of the energy requirements to bend GNR.[30] The bending energy is considerable smaller that the shearing and compression energy as we have previously shown for GNR of varying size. [30] Noteworthy, is that the average BDE CC is correlated to the degree of curvature of the materials shown in Fig. 6. GNR has the highest BDE CC due to its planar structure. This is followed by nanocones (NC) whose energy increases inversely proportional to the tip angle, defined by one of the vertical mirror planes of the C 5v and C 4v , point group symmetries, respectively. The stability of the capped-SWCNT we have examined is intermediate between that of fullerene and the NCs. The most stable capped-SWCNT based on the calculated BDE was the capped (3,3)-SWCNT whereas the least stable was the capped (4,4)-SWCNT due to square geometry at the tip apex.[Figure presented] Fig. 6 Stability trends of various carbon materials based on the bond dissociation enthalpy of the C-C bond (BDE CC ) calculated by Eqn.

As well as enhancing energy management and building performance, the analysis of these datasets can enhance the management of decentralized energy systems (electrical storage, PV generation, heat storage, etc.). To optimize the interaction between the building and the grid, it is essential to determine the total energy flexibility of the user and the building. A building has different possibilities for demand side management, energy storage and energy exchange for which a functional-layered approach is proposed from the user up to building and its interaction with the energy infrastructure. Central is the principle of the human-in-the-loop, where a bottom-up approach places the human needs as a central starting point for the energy interaction optimisation. The combination of Big Data with deep learning techniques offers new possibilities in the prediction of energy use and decentralized renewable energy production (e.g. from local weather data taking into account local phenomena such as urban heat islands). This combined with a more bottom-up approach of multi-agent systems with a gossip-based cooperative approach using Small Data offers decentralized control and monitoring autonomy to reduce the complexity of the energy system integration and transition. This makes it possible to relate the outcomes of the urban energy system integration on a neighbourhood level. The approach is being applied to a typically medium-sized office building. A first application of the human-in-the-loop controlling the lighting systems in the open-plan workplace of the test-bed office building showed some estimated annual energy saving of around 24%. Practical application : Analysis of a large database containing so called Big Data of clusters of buildings seems promising. Therefor there is the need to study the potential impact of utilization of big building operational data in building services industry. Besides this there is also a need for a data mining-based method for analyzing massive building operational data of a specific building, Small Data. This work sets out a general framework and method for doing both and to combine the strength of both approaches. The presented combined approach and results will be of interest to engineers and facility managers wondering what the key constraints to optimal use data to optimize low energy/carbon control strategies might have within their work. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2019.","BEMS; Big Data; energy flexibility; neighbourhood energy management; Small Data; smart grid","Big data; Data integration; Data mining; Deep learning; Digital storage; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy utilization; Heat storage; Information management; Multi agent systems; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Smart power grids; Storage management; BEMS; Energy flexibility; Neighbourhood; Small data; Smart grid; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059909978

To address this knowledge gap, we used repeat forest inventory data from 92,285 trees across four large permanent plots (4–25 ha in size) in temperate mixed forests in northeast China to ask the following questions: (1) How do soil conditions and stand age drive biomass demographic processes? (2) How do vegetation quality (i.e., functional trait diversity and composition) and quantity (i.e., initial biomass stocks) influence biomass demographic processes independently from soil conditions and stand age? (3) What is the relative contribution of growth, recruitment, and mortality to net biomass change? Using structural equation modeling, we showed that all three demographic processes were jointly constrained by multiple abiotic and biotic factors and that mortality was the strongest determinant on net biomass change over time. Growth and mortality, as well as functional trait diversity and the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (CWMSLA), declined with stand age. By contrast, high soil phosphorous concentrations were associated with greater functional diversity and faster dynamics (i.e., high growth and mortality rates), but associated with lower CWMSLA and initial biomass stock. More functionally diverse communities also had higher recruitment rates, but did not exhibit faster growth and mortality. Instead, initial biomass stocks and CWMSLA were stronger predictors of biomass growth and mortality, respectively. By integrating the full spectrum of abiotic and biotic drivers of forest biomass dynamics, our study provides critical system-level insights needed to predict the possible consequences of regional changes in forest diversity, composition, structure and function in the context of global change. © 2019 The Authors.

PM 2.5 primarily originates from urban activities, and built environment may affect its formation and dispersion. Previous studies were based on limited data from ground-monitoring stations, and high resolution pollution maps are unavailable for statistical analyses. In this study, a 1 km*1 km wall-to-wall map of PM 2.5 concentration is developed with remote sensing data in Wuhan, China, and spatial statistics are used to figure out the influence of the built environment on PM 2.5 concentrations. In terms of land cover, high-rise high-density building areas have the largest impact on PM 2.5 concentrations, and the effect of forestland on the concentrations is not obvious in winter. In terms of land use, industrial lands are unrelated to air pollution in the downtown, while transportation has become a main source of PM 2.5 pollution. In terms of urban form, floor area ratio and building density are positively associated with PM 2.5 concentrations, and different types of road densities have different effects on air pollution. Finally, the implications of the study for urban planning and development are given. It is necessary to develop a polycentric urban structure to balance high population density and reduce traffic emissions in downtown areas. Road and bus networks should be optimized simultaneously to reduce traffic emissions and “small blocks and narrow roads” may be considered as an alternative for urban development. The spatial morphology of streets and buildings should be considered during urban design and urban renewal. In general, the study contributes to the application of remote sensing in urban planning and development, and remotely sensed PM 2.5 concentration data could provide further findings than the air pollution data obtained from ground monitoring and “bottom-up” models in past studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Built environment; China; Remote sensing; Urban planning","Air quality; Health risks; Land use; Monitoring; Pollution detection; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Urban growth; Urban planning; Walls (structural partitions); Building densities; Built environment; China; High population density; Planning and development; PM2.5 concentration; Remote sensing data; Spatial morphologies; Remote sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062730794

Development of facile approaches toward highly active carbon materials for ORR is urgently desirable. We accidentally discovered a method for preparing heteroatom-doped carbon catalyst through an in situ self-templating and self-sacrificing strategy during the carbonization of a single polymer precursor. The prepared N,S co-doped and hierarchical porous carbon possesses a large specific surface area up to 2446 m 2 g −1 , which is the state-of-the-art among the porous carbons prepared by direct pyrolysis of linear polymer precursors. The use of in situ nanoarchitecturing and active-site engineering ensures that the N,S co-doped porous carbon catalyst has sufficient active sites for charge/mass transport and catalysis. As expected, as-prepared carbonaceous electrocatalyst exhibited superior ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes and outperformed the state-of-the-art benchmark Pt/C and the best carbonaceous electrocatalysts for ORR in aqueous media so far. Moreover, the N,S co-doped carbon catalyst was demonstrated to be a highly efficient air cathode for Zn–air batteries.

The experiment measured all the main properties of the developed PVT module. The excellent heat transfer performance of its roll-bond absorber plate was also validated by outdoor steady-state tests. Then, the steady-state numerical models were used to simulate the performance of the PVT prototype in TRNSYS. By comparing the simulation and experimental results, two robust models were selected which have their own advantages in charactering the thermal and electrical properties of the PVT collector. Through validating the numerical models with experimental data, the deviation between the simulated and the measured values was further reduced. In addition, a complete photovoltaic thermal–domestic hot water (PVT-DHW) system with such PVT collectors was developed in TRNSYS, by which the annual system output and efficiency were predicted and analysed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","PVT model; Roll-bond absorber; Thermo-laminating; TRNSYS","Costs; Heat transfer performance; Manufacture; Numerical models; Photovoltaic cells; Climatic conditions; Domestic hot water; Manufacturing cost; Manufacturing process; Photovoltaic thermals; Steady state test; Thermal and electrical properties; TRNSYS; Collector efficiency; climate conditions; comparative study; design method; experimental study; heat transfer; numerical model; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; testing method; China; Sichuan Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063081400

China has committed to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. With its heavy reliance on domestic coal resources, China faces an enormous challenge of transitioning its economy to a low-carbon energy mix to achieve long-term climate and local air quality goals. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is widely recognized as an important option for emissions mitigation. The near-term readiness and cost of CCUS technologies, the sectors and regions of CO2 capture, and the location and adequacy of CO2 storage sites all affect the application of CCUS in China's low-carbon development. This study uses GCAM-China, a global integrated assessment model with details for 31 provinces in China, to examine the role of CCUS as part of China's climate mitigation strategy over the period of its Nationally Determined Contributions as well as in the transition to deeper emissions reductions toward mid-century. The inclusion of new provincial CO2 storage cost curves gives a more detailed evaluation of where, in terms of geography and sector, and when CCUS deployment in China may take place. The results suggest that the scale of deployment varies depending on socioeconomic development pathways and the level of deployment of other low-carbon technologies. Across provinces and development pathways, early deployment of CCUS occurs within industrial and synthetic fuel production sectors, followed by increased deployment in the power sector by mid-century. Several provinces, such as Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Henan, emerge as particularly important in CCUS deployment, as a result of large CO2 point sources and storage availability. Results indicate that storage resource availability is unlikely to constrain CCUS deployment in most provinces through the end of the century. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture; China; Integrated assessment model; Provincial-level analysis; Utilization and storage","Air quality; Carbon capture; Climate models; Coal deposits; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Synthetic fuels; Carbon capture , utilization , and storages; China; Global integrated assessments; Integrated assessment models; Low-carbon technologies; Provincial-level analysis; Socio-economic development; Synthetic fuel productions; Carbon dioxide; air quality; assessment method; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; greenhouse gas; modeling; China; Hebei; Henan; Nei Monggol; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063916969

And trade openness is also one of the critical factors to help transitional economies reduce carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth simultaneously through the combination of scale, composition, and technique effects. This paper is designed to explore the effect of trade openness on the environmental quality and investigate the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for a panel of CIS countries over the period of 2000–2013. The two-equation model is used to estimate the direct effect of trade openness on CO2 emissions and the indirect effect via per capita income. The instrumental variable techniques are employed to consider for endogeneity of per capita income and trade openness to estimate the indirect effect, and GLS analysis is conducted to estimate the direct effect of trade openness on CO2 emissions. The result shows that trade openness increases CO2 emissions directly while indirectly decreasing it due to its negative effect on per capita income.

We calibrated and validated the dynamic process-based soil carbon model “Yasso07” for a wind-throw prone forest area of 1.4 M ha in the State of Baden Württemberg in central Europe, Germany. We fitted climate-biomass models using retrospective climate data and biomass measurements from three consecutive national forest inventories for six forest growth regions. Three IPCC scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), three storm frequencies (10, 20, and 50 years interval), and three post-storm harvest strategies (business-as-usual, full retention, and 50% retention), in combination with a total of 27 scenarios, were applied for projections into the 21st century. We could reduce the uncertainty of YassoBW parameter values significantly by up to 30%, by applying Bayesian calibration, although the absolute value of most parameters did not deviate very much from the original Yasso07 parameters. The projection results showed that forest soil organic carbon (SOC) may lose approximately 30 and 10 t C/ha during the first and the second half of this century, respectively. Three storm frequencies led to a larger range of annual SOC reduction (-0.34, -0.49) t C/ha than climate and harvest strategies (-0.41, -0.42) t C/ha. If no storms occur, the total carbon stock would increase to over 200 t/ha with 258 t/ha under RCP8.5. Considering storm impacts, total forest carbon was reduced from -20 to -90 t C/ha, regarding 10 and 50 year storm frequencies respectively. The largest reduction of forest soil carbon stock originated from the loss in non-solubles (N), followed by acid-solubles (A), humus (H), water-solubles (W) and ethanol-solubles (E). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon forestry; Forest soil carbon modelling; Retention forestry; Wind forest interaction; Wind storm management","Climate change; Climate models; Organic carbon; Soils; Storms; Timber; Bayesian calibration; Biomass measurements; Climate change scenarios; Different frequency; Forest soils; National forest inventories; Retention forestries; Wind storms; Forestry; best management practice; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest inventory; forest soil; forestry; management practice; organic carbon; simulation; soil carbon; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062704744

Among renewables, geothermal energy is a powerful source for producing electricity and heat, simultaneously. The Sabalan geothermal field in northwestern Iran has a great geothermal potential and 11 geothermal wells have been drilled there during the last decade. The present design of the Sabalan geothermal power plant does not utilize the potential of the waste hot water and this useful energy flow would be wasted by injecting it into the underground reservoir. In this study, four geothermal energy utilization scenarios are modelled, analyzed and compared. The first and second scenarios are focused on electricity production in single and double flash geothermal system, while the third and fourth ones consider direct uses besides electricity production. Direct applications considered in this paper are district heating, greenhouses, tourist centres, fish farming and heat supply for factories. Exergy analysis is conducted to find a reliable system design. Also, the efficiency analysis indicates that the double-flash condensing power plant designed can generate 27.5 MW electricity and 76.1 MW heat from existing wells with direct geothermal uses.

In the future, more and more countries are likely to experience similar situation as RE generation is increasingly considered not only as a means to reduce CO2 emissions, but also as an interesting economic alternative in areas with appropriate RE resources. However, RE generation delivers a variable level of power depending on the wind speed, and is not dispatchable in the same way as conventional energy sources due to the special characteristics. The integration of high penetration level of RE generation in some regions has brought much challenge on maintaining power system reliability and the balance between load and generation. Since the power system were originally designed around large-scale synchronous generators, new approaches and solutions are required when RE generation is integrated into power system with high penetration. This paper provides an introduction about the special characteristics of RE generation, and tries to explore potential challenge caused by the integration of RE generation into power systems.

Thus, climate change adaptation is crucial, especially for natural resource-dependent farmers. Based on a qualitative research approach using a feminist political ecology lens, this article investigates gendered patterns of rural agrarian livelihoods and climate adaptation in the province of Thái Bình. In doing so, we identify differentiated rights and responsibilities between female and male farmers, leading to unequal opportunities and immobility for females, making them more vulnerable to climate impacts and threatening to reduce their capacity to adapt. This research also shows that demands on farmers to contribute to perpetual increases in agricultural output by the state poses a challenge, since farming livelihoods in Vietnam are increasingly becoming feminised, as a result of urbanisation and devaluation of farming. Past and present national strategies and provincial implementation plans linked to climate change do not consider the burden affecting rural female farmers, instead the focus lies on addressing technical solutions to adaptation. With little attention being paid to an increasingly female workforce, existing gender inequalities may be exacerbated, threatening the future existence of rural livelihoods and the viability of Vietnam's expansion into global markets. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; Climate change adaptation; Feminist political ecology; Gender inequality; Policy; Sustainability; Vietnam; Vulnerability","adaptive management; agricultural market; agriculture; climate change; feminism; gender; livelihood; policy implementation; policy making; political economy; rural area; sustainability; urbanization; vulnerability; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067026127

The mitigation and adaptation to climate change, however, are offering tremendous business opportunities around the world, especially for businesses operating in the agri-food, energy, finance, and health sectors, water infrastructure, built environments, and other relevant services. When the severity of heat waves is considered, for instance, it would become quite clear that the demand for cooling would accelerate, putting further stress on energy supply and increasing the risk of electricity black outs. Similarly, the projections also provide warnings about increased drought risk in many regions around the globe, and even worse, it should also be emphasized that 60% more food will be needed globally, while 100% more demand for food is projected in developing countries by the year 2050. While all these are being projected, we are experiencing progressively increasing stress on our global freshwater resources, which are worsened further by climate change-driven impacts and water pollution. Consequently, reducing agri-food production systems' susceptibility to climate change and strengthening the resilience of such systems are extremely important to sustain and improve the livelihoods of billions of people around the globe. Moreover, reducing emissions due to fossil fuels consumption and production is vital for the whole global population, and agri-food and energy sectors have tremendous potentials for reducing inefficiencies and emissions while simultaneously playing their crucial roles in food and energy security as well as poverty reduction.

The dosing unit is a plunger-sleeve pump nozzle system driven by a charged solenoid, and is pump-end controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) signals. The core characteristics of the unit include both metering precision control and failure diagnosis methods. In this study, both physical-mathematical analysis and experiments were carried out. A so-called whole state T3 metering theory was developed by studying the system using a physical-mathematical model based on energy conservation. The study showed that the liquid discharge, which is associated with the plunger-sleeve relative position, correlates well with a measurable variable T3. Experimental investigations verified that the metering results were independent of the state variations in some range and that metering is controlled with high precision. Two typical DEF dosing systems based on the dosing unit and some specific failure modes are introduced. Significant variation of the parameter T3 in the T3 model is useful for the detection of specific failure modes. © 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) dosing unit; Plunger-sleeve pump; Sensor-free diagnosis; T3 metering theory; TK421.5","Catalysts; Diesel engines; Failure analysis; Optical pumping; Pulse width modulation; Pumps; Voltage control; Diesel exhausts; Experimental investigations; Mathematical analysis; Measurable variables; Plunger sleeve; Selective catalyst reduction; T3 metering theory; TK421.5; Exhaust systems (engine)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065472207

From theoretical perspective, not only does it call for sector-specific infrastructure asset management knowledge, traditional risk-based disaster analysis and emergency management techniques, but it also demands quality data and stakeholders’ competency to holistically integrate the information and analyze the data. To address these limitations, this research provides a physics-based synthesis framework for interdependent civil infrastructure system resilience analysis. The framework consists of four major components: (i) setting resilience analysis boundary through the prescribed criteria; (ii) establishing an infrastructure resilience management lifecycle; (iii) defining the physics-based modeling of infrastructure system functions; and (iv) designing the interfaces between interdependent infrastructure systems. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework are tested through a case study involving two interconnected infrastructure systems (i.e. stormwater drainage system and road transport system) located in Hong Kong. It incorporates relevant infrastructure information by using the ArcGIS platform which is integrated with the physics-based vulnerability analysis methods from the two distinct knowledge domains. Cascading effects of adverse events propagating through the two infrastructures are delineated using an empirical nominal damage function. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climatic hazards; Infrastructure systems; Interdependency; Physics-based; Resilience","Disasters; Quality control; Risk assessment; Risk management; Climatic hazards; Infrastructure systems; Interdependency; Physics-based; Resilience; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062148943

Arg) plantations have expanded into regions with sub-optimal growth conditions: distinct dry seasons and temperatures cooler than in humid tropics. The impact of these new marginal environments and future climate change on rubber tree development and latex yield is largely unknown. This hampers reliable prediction of farmers’ revenues and extent of carbon sequestration at landscape level. To improve our understanding of rubber trees response to planting at high altitudes and associated increase in planting densities, we applied the process-based Land Use Change Impact Assessment tool (LUCIA). It was calibrated with detailed ground survey data from Xishuangbanna, southwest China to model tree biomass development and latex yield in rubber plantations at the tree, plot and landscape level. Plantations were analyzed at &lt;900 m above sea level (a.s.l., lowland rubber) and ≧900 m a.s.l. (highland rubber) in order to characterize the effect of elevation on rubber trees. Three planting densities: low (&lt;495 trees ha −1 ), medium (495–600 trees ha −1 ) and high (&gt;600 trees ha −1 ) were tested. Four greenhouse gas emission scenarios, with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) ranging from the lowest RCP 2.6 to the highest emission scenario RCP 8.5, were used to test rubber tree response to climate change. During a 40-year rotation under current climate, lowland rubber plantations grew faster and had larger latex yields than highland rubber. The average biomass of lowland rubber was 9% and 18% higher than those of highland rubber for aboveground and belowground biomass, respectively. High planting density rubber plantations showed 5% and 4% higher above ground biomass than those at low- and medium-planting density, but simulations suggest that the cumulative latex production decreased strongly by 26% and 14% respectively. The results of the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario suggested that during 40 years simulation mean total biomass and cumulative latex yield of highland rubber (per tree) increased by 28% and 48%, while lowland rubber increased by 8% and 10% respectively when compared to the baseline. Other rubber cultivation regions could also benefit from this modelling approach that helps in optimization of carbon stock and latex production in rubber-based system. The results could help in development of future climate change adaption and mitigation strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Land use change; Landscape modelling; Planting density; Tree plantation","Biomass; Carbon; Ecology; Economics; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Sea level; Carbon sequestration; Land-use change; Landscape modelling; Planting density; Tree plantations; Climate change; carbon sequestration; climate change; cultivation; greenhouse gas; growth response; land use change; mountain environment; plant extract; plantation forestry; population density; prediction; rubber; tree planting; yield response; Biomass; Carbon; Ecology; Economics; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; China; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan; Hevea brasiliensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062259016

However, the fact that PM 2.5 indicator in some regions often reached far higher than the official threshold since 2015 has reflected that China's current Air Quality Index system for measuring and evaluating air quality is still not perfect. Therefore, this paper extended the current air quality indicator system officially used by China. Using improved Entropy-weighted Factor Method and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) Method, we calculated the air quality scores of 26 cities in China's most economically developed region - the Yangtze River Delta region based on their daily average concentration numbers of main air pollutants from February 2015 to January 2018. Based on the air quality calculation result, we further studied the effectiveness of air pollution control policies of this region by using the Box-Jenkins Model with fuzzy strategy parameter adjustment. Our findings are: the pollution control policy is more effective to Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The air quality score of Shanghai has improved by 51.07% compared with its level before the policy. Meanwhile, the air quality improvement in Zhejiang province has shown the characteristics of “Campaign-style Governance” right before the G20 Summit, especially that in Hangzhou, the host city of the Summit. On the other hand, maybe due to late start of air pollution control programs, the cities of Anhui province haven't shown obvious improvements in air quality, and some cities have even seen deterioration in air quality scores during our study period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Assessment score; Pollution control policy; Yangtze river delta","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air quality; Deterioration; Quality control; Rivers; Air quality improvement; Air quality indices; Assessment score; Average concentration; Calculation results; Parameter adjustments; Pollution Control Project; Yangtze river delta; River pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062156714

Since the chemical fertilizer is the principal source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, we present results from a two-year (2016-2017) field experiment on a potato field to verify the general influence of water-saving irrigation on N2O emissions. A split-plot experiment was established with two irrigation systems and two fertilizer treatments, which give a total of four treatments. Two different irrigation systems were investigated: (i) flood irrigation with nitrogen fertilizer (NF-FI) combined with a control without any fertilizer (C-FI) and (ii) overhead sprinkler irrigation with a nitrogen fertilizer (NF-SI) accompanied with a control without any fertilizer (C-SI). The N2O emissions of the fertilizer treatment were greater than those of the control under each irrigation system. In plots where the fertilizers were applied, using overhead sprinkler irrigation reduced the average cumulative N2O emissions between 40.72% and 59.65% compared with flood irrigation. This was mainly due to the lower amount of water applied and the lower availability of NO3 --N and NH4 +-N of soil associated with an overhead sprinkler irrigation. This work shows that the overhead sprinkler irrigation is an effective strategy to use to save water and mitigate emissions of the atmospheric pollutants N2O in comparison to flood irrigation. © 2019 by the authors.","Emission factor; Fertilization; Greenhouse gas emissions; Irrigation","Arid regions; Floods; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Water conservation; Water pollution; Agricultural productions; Arid and semi-arid regions; Atmospheric pollutants; Emission factors; Fertilization; Nitrous oxide emissions; Split plot experiments; Water-saving irrigation; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); arid region; experiment; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; irrigation system; nitrous oxide; potato; water use efficiency; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066318647

First, the mathematical decomposition method and the logical integration method were combined to decompose the total low-carbon capability into seven single low-carbon capabilities. On the basis of the mechanism of carbon emission reduction, a comprehensive calculation model for CO2 emissions reduction of the energy internet was then established. Finally, taking the Yanqing Energy Internet Demonstration Zone in China as an example, it was calculated that the model could reduce CO2 emissions by 14,093.19 tons in 2025. The results show that the methods adopted in this paper avoided the overlap calculation reasonably well; the comprehensive calculation model of CO2 emissions reduction has strong versatility, and can quantitatively calculate the carbon emission reduction amount for any completed or planned energy internet.

As the major contributor of haze, PM 2.5 emission needs more investigation, especially its driving forces that is crucial for mitigation and pollution control. In this study, the main contributors of PM 2.5 emissions in Beijing were identified. By using the emission inventory and environmentally extended input–output framework, a structural decomposition model was employed to figure out the key drivers of the primary PM 2.5 emissions in Beijing. The results showed that measures to control air pollution (e.g., the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan (2013–2017)) have caused PM 2.5 emissions to decrease in recent years, indicating that emission mitigation strategies in Beijing are having preliminary success. Among all emission sources, due to large amounts of coke consumption, direct emission from residential energy consumption constitutes the largest proportion (31.05%–44.48%). Driven by fast urbanization and economic growth, high contribution of capital was invested to construction activities, which makes capital formation the largest driver of PM 2.5 emissions from consumption perspective. PM 2.5 emissions embodied in imports and exports also make a large proportion of consumption-based emission. Consumption volume and population growth are the main socioeconomic drivers to PM 2.5 emissions increase, while emission intensity and consumption patterns offset the increase of emissions. The results will be useful developing PM 2.5 emission mitigation measures and policies for Beijing and similar cities around the world. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Input–output analysis; PM 2.5 emission; Structural decomposition analysis","Construction industry; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Population statistics; Structural analysis; Beijing; Construction activities; Consumption patterns; Environmental problems; Output analysis; Residential energy consumption; Structural decomposition; Structural decomposition analysis; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062156437

Existing numerical studies to assess their effectiveness and cooling benefits usually assume an unrealistic 100% coverage across the entire metropolis. This study investigates the scale dependence of the absolute cooling benefits and efficiency (cooling per adapted roof area) of cool and green roofs in a typical summer when they are installed over 25% of building rooftops at local, city, or regional scales. Six major U.S. cities with active climate action plans in different geoclimatic zones are compared through high-resolution simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The results reveal that reductions in 2-m air temperature over the urban core increase non-linearly with the intervention area, and the benefits of both roof types scale similarly. This scale-dependence of urban core cooling is not universal, but is rather controlled by the shape of metropolitan areas and wind pattern. The siting of mitigation measures hence plays an important role especially under windy conditions, and some urban cores are not able to achieve a noticeable and consistent cooling by retrofitting their own rooftops. Regional-scale deployments of mitigation strategies, on the other hand, yield a more substantial temperature reduction but with a lower efficiency. The scale-dependence of regional cooling efficiency showed remarkable similarity across studied cities, yielding a potentially generalizable power law. The successful resiliency plans for cities should account for the scale dependence and geoclimatic determinants of the achievable cooling, and identify the target neighborhoods of most interest. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cool roof; Cooling efficiency; Green roof; Heat island mitigation; Urban planning","Climate models; Efficiency; Roofs; Urban planning; Weather forecasting; Cool roofs; Cooling efficiency; Green roof; Heat island; High resolution simulations; Mitigation strategy; Temperature reduction; Weather research and forecasting models; Atmospheric temperature; action plan; cooling; greenspace; heat island; metropolitan area; roof; strategic approach; urban area; urban planning; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061550316

In order to identify the driving factors of CO2 emissions from China's international shipping and find efficient mitigation strategies, this paper first estimates the CO2 emissions and presents the CO2 emissions features from 2000 to 2017. Second, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method is applied to decompose the changes in CO2 emissions. Finally, the decoupling index is introduced to quantitatively examine the decoupling relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions. The factors affecting the decoupling relationship are analyzed according to the LMDI results. The results indicate that CO2 emissions in maritime transport activities have experienced rapid growth during the study period. Economic growth appears to be the principal factor driving the CO2 emissions growth, whereas the overall effects of energy intensity and the commodity structure play a significant role in inhibiting CO2 emissions. The decoupling state over the study period has experienced four decoupling stages, with a distinct tendency towards weak decoupling. Economic activity has proven to be the most significant indicator influencing the decoupling relationship during the study period. © 2019 by the authors.","China; CO2 emissions; Decoupling analysis; LMDI method; Maritime transport sector","anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; energy intensity; growth rate; international trade; shipping; spatial distribution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066991171

In addition to hydrological regime, revegetation has also occurred in this water-level fluctuation zone. However, how the hydrological regime and revegetation regulate soil prokaryotic community remains unclear. Here, we investigated soil prokaryotic community structure, diversity and environmental parameters in different flooding zones from two soil layers (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) at 6 locations along the water-level fluctuation zone from upstream to downstream. The soil prokaryotic diversity tended to decrease from upstream to downstream, and the alpha diversity was higher in the topsoil than in the deep soil at all sites. Flooding significantly enhanced the prokaryotic diversity compared to the control (i.e., permanent dry zone). The soil prokaryotic composition underwent deterministic processes in the upstream sites and stochastic processes in the downstream sites, with stronger stochastic processes in the topsoil than in the deep soil across all sites and elevations. As expected, the soil pH, moisture, NH 4 + -N, organic carbon and nitrogen were proven to be determinants of the prokaryotic community composition. Changes in plant traits (plant biomass, richness, and carbon content) after revegetation induced by submergence also played an important role in structuring the prokaryotic community. The prokaryotic community exhibited a shorter average path distance (GD) in the flooding zones compared to the control, with the shortest average degree (avgK) and the lowest levels of stability in the longer periodic inundation zones. Overall, our results suggest that soil properties and plant functional traits are critical controls of the prokaryotic community's ability to develop at regional scales and water submergence can likewise be an important factor for variations in the prokaryotic community composition in riparian zones. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Microbial composition; Prokaryotic biodiversity; Vegetation type; Water flooding; Wetlands","Biodiversity; Floods; Organic carbon; Random processes; Revegetation; Rivers; Soil conservation; Stochastic systems; Structure (composition); Underwater soils; Water levels; Wetlands; Community composition; Community structures; Deterministic process; Environmental parameter; Microbial composition; Three gorges reservoir; Vegetation type; Water-level-fluctuation zones; Reservoirs (water); biodiversity; community composition; community structure; flooding; functional role; hydrological regime; prokaryote; revegetation; riparian zone; soil property; submergence; wetland; Article; China; community structure; flooding; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; priority journal; prokaryote; revegetation; riparian ecosystem; seasonal variation; soil property; species composition; water supply; bacterium; classification; flooding; microbiology; microflora; China; Hubei; Three Gorges Dam; Prokaryota; Bacteria; China; Floods; Microbiota; Soil Microbiology; Water Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060925466

Overall, realizing co-benefits is complicated by the fact that climate and air quality policy goals have been pursued separately from each other. In this article, we explore the current policy and legal status of black carbon emissions across the domains of air pollution prevention and control, and climate change with a view to identify synergies and opportunities for an integrated approach. We suggest three ways to strengthen the policy, legal and institutional nexus of air pollution and climate change to reduce black carbon emissions in China: improving scientific knowledge and the science-policy interface, increasing policy and legal connections between air quality and climate portfolios, and enhancing institutional linkages. For instance, we argue that more interdisciplinary cooperation and improvements to the black carbon inventory as well as a closer science-policy relationship are necessary. From a legal and policy angle, we identify clear openings through which to integrate reduction of black carbon emissions into the air pollution prevention and control agenda. Institutionally, the recent government reform brings air quality and climate portfolios under the supervision of the same ministry but their integration is still to be ensured. In addition, vertical linkages between different levels of environmental governance – central, provincial and municipal – need to be addressed. © 2019 The Authors","Air pollution law and policy; Black carbon; Climate law and policy; Short-lived climate pollutants","black carbon; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; climate; climate change; environmental policy; exhaust gas; law; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061384277

Our inversions use customized and validated high-fidelity meteorological output from Weather Research Forecasting and Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian model for South Coast Air Basin and innovatively employ a model resolution matrix-based metric to disentangle the spatiotemporal information content of observations as manifested through estimated fluxes. We partially track and constrain fluxes from the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak and detect closure of the Puente Hills landfill, with no prior information. Our annually aggregated fluxes and their uncertainty excluding the Aliso Canyon leak period lie within the uncertainty bounds of the fluxes reported by the previous studies. Spatially, major sources of CH4 emissions in the basin were correlated with CH4-emitting infrastructure. Temporally, our findings show large seasonal variations in CH4 fluxes with significantly higher fluxes in winter in comparison to summer months, which is consistent with natural gas demand and anticorrelated with air temperature. Overall, this is the first study that utilizes inversions to detect both enhancement (Aliso Canyon leak) and reduction (Puente Hills) in CH4 fluxes due to the unintended events and policy decisions and thereby demonstrates the utility of inverse modeling for identifying variations in fluxes at fine spatiotemporal resolution.

However, no studies have been done in low-income countries such as those in Africa, which have the highest incidences of pregnancy loss. In this study, we aimed to analyse the association between PM2·5 and pregnancy loss, including miscarriage and stillbirth. Methods: This self-compared case control study collected data on mothers who reported at least two births (at least one case of pregnancy loss plus at least one normal delivery)in the African Demographic and Health Surveys. Gestational exposure to PM2·5 was assessed using a state-of-the-art estimator based on satellite measurements and chemical transport model outputs. Each case of pregnancy loss was compared with the successful control deliveries in the same mother. We estimated the association between gestational exposure to PM2·5 and pregnancy loss using a conditional logistical model with multiple adjustments, and assessed it using the odds ratio (OR)derived from the regression. Findings: Between Jan 1, 1998, and Dec 31, 2016, 67 566 cases of pregnancy loss were reported across Africa in the DHS. After removal of mothers who did not report at least one successful delivery and those with missing spatial information, 42 952 were included in the study. Of these, 30 418 were categorised as miscarriages and 12 534 were stillbirths. Each increment of 10 μg/m3 PM2·5 was associated with an adjusted OR of 1·122 (95% CI 1·107–1·137)for pregnancy loss, including miscarriage (1·125; 1·109–1·142)and stillbirth (1·094; 1·051–1·138). Interpretation: Our findings from African DHS data showing that PM2·5 exposure is significantly associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss add to the existing epidemiological evidence from middle-income and high-income countries on the health impacts of poor air quality. Our results support public health interventions for reducing ambient particulate matter to improve maternal health in Africa.

Using spatial autocorrelation analysis of statistical data at the county-level, this study quantifies the change in spatial and temporal patterns of crop production in the Yangtze River Basin of China since 1990 and draws out policy implications for food security in the country. Four panel models were constructed to examine in what ways and to what extent four major factors (climate variation, sown area, fertilizer use intensity, and population size) influence the capacity for crop production. The results show that total crop production increased by 15.2% in 1990–2015, while there exists significant spatial heterogeneity in crop output across the upper, middle and lower sections of the Basin. The spatial agglomerations of crop production (hotspots) in the Basin have varied significantly over time, with the hotspots in the lower section having disappeared since 2000. Over a quarter of the total number of counties (649) in the region have experienced a high risk of food shortages, with 19.4–27.4% of counties having experienced severe or moderate shortages of per capita food availability since 1990. This percentage increased from 9.3% to 16.2% in the lower section, while it declined from 53.9% in 1990 to 41.9% in 2015 in the upper section and remained unchanged in the middle section. The variables of sown area, fertilizer use intensity, total precipitation in the growing seasons and time (Year) have significant positive effects on the growth of crop production, but mean temperature in the growing seasons of crops and total population have significant and negative relationships with crop outputs. Establishing a reliable food supply system, safeguarding high-quality cultivated land and increasing fertilizer use efficiency are suggested as imperative countermeasures to mitigate food security risks in the Yangtze River Basin. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fertilizer use intensity; Food availability; Food security; Panel model","Climate models; Crops; Fertilizers; Food supply; Population statistics; Public policy; Rivers; Watersheds; Climate variability; Fertilizer use; Food availability; Food security; Panel model; Spatial and temporal patterns; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatial heterogeneity; Cultivation; autocorrelation; climate variation; crop production; fertilizer; food availability; food security; quantitative analysis; Article; China; climate change; crop production; environmental temperature; fertilizer application; food availability; food security; population size; precipitation; priority journal; river basin; seasonal variation; spatial autocorrelation analysis; spatial soil variability; agriculture; catering service; climate; crop; crop production; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; procedures; river; season; statistics and numerical data; temperature; China; Yangtze Basin; fertilizer; Agriculture; China; Climate; Climate Change; Crop Production; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Food Supply; Rivers; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061440478

Taking Beijing as the example, this paper studies the economic value of the transition of public buses from fossil fuel-powered buses to battery electric buses from the perspective of carbon asset theory, and mainly focuses the analysis on direct carbon emissions. First, the theory and methodology of carbon asset evaluation are introduced for the transition from fossil fuel-powered buses to battery electric buses. Second, the internal determinants of the carbon assets for the transition from fossil fuel-powered buses to battery electric buses are studied. Third, the distinct impacts of the determinants of the carbon assets of the transition from fossil fuel-powered buses to battery electric buses are analysed. The results indicate that (1) the transition from fossil fuel-powered buses to battery electric buses has a carbon asset value; (2) the carbon asset value of the transition from fossil fuel-powered buses to battery electric buses is determined by the distance-specific CO2 emissions of fossil fuel-powered buses, the carbon price and the annual driving distances of the buses as well as the discounted rate of the carbon assets for buses and the termination time of the fossil fuel-powered or battery electric buses; and (3) the carbon assets contribute to the economic value of the transition from fossil fuel-powered buses to battery electric buses.

To solve this, we propose a VM scheduling algorithm based on the gravitational effect, called VMSAGE, to optimize energy efficiency of Cloud computing systems. Inspired by the physical gravitation model, we define the thermal repulsion and logical gravitation factors between physical nodes and VMs. To achieve optimized VM scheduling, we propose a gravitation function that refers to the calculation of the logical quality of each VM, host and rack through the algorithm, so as to draw the attractiveness between them. Based on the concept of dimension reduction, VMSAGE conducts the two-dimensional plane target selection twice to reduce the computational cost. Additionally, VMSAGE evaluates attributes of the computer room to carry out the VM deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution, we compare it with the Best Fit Heuristic (BFH) and the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) algorithms. The results indicate that our algorithm achieves 10% and 20% optimized energy consumption respectively. The experimental results highlight our contribution, in where VMSAGE can significantly reduce energy consumption rates and VM migration times. © 2018","Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Gravitation effect; Scheduling algorithm; Virtual machine","Carbon dioxide; Cloud computing; Cost reduction; Dynamic frequency scaling; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Gravitational effects; Heuristic algorithms; Network security; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Virtual machine; Voltage scaling; Carbon dioxide emissions; Computational costs; Dimension reduction; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; High energy consumption; Reduce energy consumption; Two dimensional plane; Virtual machine scheduling; Green computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057047756

We thus attempted to elaborate the changes of soil microbiome to different rice cultivars under the eCO2 condition. Materials and methods: Two rice cultivars, i.e., the CO2-tolerant cultivar, Wuyunjing23 (WYJ23), and the CO2-sensitive one, Yandao 6 (YD6), were grown under eCO2 and ambient CO2 (aCO2) conditions. The contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) in soil were measured. Real-time qualitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing techniques were employed to characterize the bacterial community. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis was applied to reveal the ecological interactions among bacterial taxa. Results and discussion: No significant differences were found among all treatments in terms of bacterial population, alpha-diversity indices, and bacterial community structure. However, the topological parameters of ecological networks highlighted the distinct co-occurrence patterns among treatments. YD6 under eCO2 led to more links, lower modularity, and greater centralization degree compared to that under aCO2. Opposite trends of those parameters were observed for WYJ23 under eCO2 compared to that under aCO2. Besides, more Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria served as keystone taxa in the CO2-sensitive cultivar treatments, compared to those in WYJ23, implying the different influences of rice cultivars on the microbial ecological network. Conclusions: Different rice cultivars under eCO2 did not influence the alpha- and beta-diversity of the soil bacterial community, but changed the co-occurrence network of the community. More attention should be paid to the assembly mechanisms of the soil microbial microbiome when evaluating the impacts of productive crops on the soil-plant ecosystem under the eCO2 condition. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","16S rRNA gene; Co-occurrence network; Free air carbon dioxide enrichment; Rice cultivar","carbon dioxide; community structure; concentration (composition); cultivar; dissolved organic carbon; growth; microbial community; microbial ecology; rice; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; species diversity; species occurrence; Acidobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059569345

Our study investigates the issue with the Nonlinear Auto Regressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX), a dynamic nonlinear artificial neural network that has not been applied previously to this question. The key advance over previous models is the inclusion of feedback mechanisms such as the influence of past CO2 emissions on current emissions. The results forecast that the peak of China's CO2 emissions will occur in 2029, 2031 or 2035 at the level of 10.08, 10.78 and 11.63 billion tonnes under low-growth, benchmark moderate-growth, and high-growth scenarios. Based on the methodology of the mean impact value (MIV), we differentiate and rank the importance of the influence factors on CO2 emissions whereas previous studies included but did not rank factors. We suggest that China should choose the moderate growth development road and achieve its peak target in 2031, focusing on reducing CO2 emissions as a percent of GDP, less carbon-intensive industrialization, and choosing technologies that reduce CO2 emissions from coal or increasing the use of less carbon-intensive fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions peak; Dynamic ANN; Global climate change; Mean impact value (MIV); Scenario analysis","Climate change; Neural networks; Auto regressive models; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Dynamic non-linear; Feedback mechanisms; Global climate changes; Impact value; Scenario analysis; Carbon dioxide; artificial neural network; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; emission control; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; scenario analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060922187

The mean and standard deviation of tree-ring δ 18 O at different heights do not have significant differences, and there are no significant differences in the mean and standard deviation of tree-ring δ 18 O between trees near the brook and trees at the top of moraine, indicating that we can collect samples for tree-ring δ 18 O analysis regardless of sampling heights and that the micro-environment does not affect tree-ring δ 18 O significantly. The mean inter-series correlations of cellulose δ 18 O for A. georgei/H. tibetana are 0.84/0.93, and the correlation between δ 18 O for A. georgei and H. tibetana is 0.92. The good coherence between inter-tree and inter-species cellulose δ 18 O demonstrates the possibility of using different species to develop a long chronology. Correlation analysis between tree-ring δ 18 O and climate parameters revealed that δ 18 O for A. georgei/H. tibetana had negative correlations (r = −0.62/r = −0.69) with relative humidity in July–August, and spatial correlation revealed that δ 18 O for A. georgei/H. tibetana reflected the regional Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (29°–32° N, 88°–98° E). In addition, tree-ring δ 18 O in Xincuo has a significant correlation with tree-ring δ 18 O in Bhutan.

These simulation models often have to run for a couple of months to understand the changes in the global climate over the course of decades. This long-duration simulation process creates a huge amount of data with both high temporal and spatial resolution information; however, how to effectively monitor and record the climate changes based on these large-scale simulation results that are continuously produced in real time still remains to be resolved. Due to the slow process of writing data to disk, the current practice is to save a snapshot of the simulation results at a constant, slow rate although the data generation process runs at a very high speed. This paper proposes an effective online data monitoring and saving strategy over the temporal and spatial domains with the consideration of practical storage and memory capacity constraints.

Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat-1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality. Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and follow-up with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop—justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat. © 2019","ARD; Land change science; Land cover; Landsat science team; OLI; Open data; Remote sensing science; TIRS","Application programs; Climate change; Deforestation; International cooperation; Open access; Open Data; Remote sensing; Satellites; Applications development; Climate change mitigation; High-quality measurements; Land changes; Land cover; LANDSAT; Technological advancement; TIRS; Information management; algorithm; climate change; data quality; land cover; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite constellation; satellite data; satellite imagery; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062046213

Numerous exciting achievements have proven reversed β-oxidation cycle as a promising platform to synthesize these chemicals. However, under native central carbon metabolism, energetic and redox constraints limit the efficient operation of reversed β-oxidation cycle. Current fermentative platform has to use different chemically and energetically inefficient ways for acetyl-CoA and NADH biosynthesis, respectively. The characteristics such as supplementation of additional acetate and formate or high ATP requirement makes this platform incompatible with large-scale production. Here, an artificial micro-aerobic metabolism for energy and carbon-efficient conversion of glycerol to MCFAs was constructed to present solutions towards these barriers. After evaluating numerous bacteria pathways under micro-aerobic conditions, one synthetic metabolic step enabling biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA and NADH simultaneously, without any energy cost and additional carbon requirement, and reducing loss of carbon to carbon dioxide-emitting reactions, was conceived and successfully constructed. The pyruvate dehydrogenase from Enterococcus faecalis was identified and biochemically characterized, demonstrating the most suitable characteristics. Furthermore, the carbon and energy metabolism in Escherichia coli was rewired by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference system, inhibiting native fermentation pathways outcompeting this synthetic step. The present engineered strain exhibited a 15.7-fold increase in MCFA titer compared with that of the initial strain, and produced 15.67 g/L MCFAs from the biodiesel byproduct glycerol in 3-L bioreactor without exogenous feed of acetate or formate, representing the highest MCFA titer reported to date. This work demonstrates this artificial micro-aerobic metabolism has the potential to enable the cost-effective, large-scale production of fatty acids and other value-added reduced chemicals. © 2019","ATP; Metabolic engineering; NADH; Synthetic biology; β-oxidation reversal","Adenosinetriphosphate; Aerobic bacteria; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Carbon dioxide; Chemicals; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Escherichia coli; Glycerol; Metabolic engineering; Metabolism; Oxidation; Synthetic biology; Central carbon metabolisms; Efficient synthesis; Energy metabolism; Engineered strains; Enterococcus faecalis; Large scale productions; Medium-chain fatty acids; NADH; Fatty acids; acetyl coenzyme A; biodiesel; carbon; carbon dioxide; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; fuel; glycerol; medium chain fatty acid; pyruvate dehydrogenase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; acetyl coenzyme A; bacterial protein; fatty acid; pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; aerobic metabolism; Aliivibrio fischeri; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; carbon metabolism; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; controlled study; Corynebacterium glutamicum; energy cost; energy metabolism; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; large scale production; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; promoter region; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; real time polymerase chain reaction; Salmonella enterica; synthesis; bioreactor; biosynthesis; enzymology; genetics; metabolic engineering; metabolism; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Bacterial Proteins; Bioreactors; Energy Metabolism; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; Fatty Acids; Metabolic Engineering; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060524251

Therefore, understanding the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the role of land-atmosphere feedbacks is necessary for earlier warnings, better climate projection and timely societal adaptation. However, this understanding is hampered by the difficulties of attributing cause-effect relationships from complex coupled models and the irregular space-time distribution of in situ observations of the land-atmosphere system. As such, there is a need for simple deterministic appraisals that systematically discriminate land-atmosphere interactions from observed weather phenomena over large domains and climatological time spans. Here, we present a new interactive data platform to study the behavior of the ABL and land-atmosphere interactions based on worldwide weather balloon soundings and an ABL model. This software tool - referred to as CLASS4GL (<span classCombining double low line""uri"">http://class4gl.eu, last access: 27 May 2018) - is developed with the objectives of (a) mining appropriate global observational data from g1/415 million weather balloon soundings since 1981 and combining them with satellite and reanalysis data and (b) constraining and initializing a numerical model of the daytime evolution of the ABL that serves as a tool to interpret these observations mechanistically and deterministically. As a result, it fully automizes extensive global model experiments to assess the effects of land and atmospheric conditions on the ABL evolution as observed in different climate regions around the world. The suitability of the set of observations, model formulations and global parameters employed by CLASS4GL is extensively validated. In most cases, the framework is able to realistically reproduce the observed daytime response of the mixed-layer height, potential temperature and specific humidity from the balloon soundings. In this extensive global validation exercise, a bias of 10.1mh-1, -0.036Kh-1 and 0.06gkg-1h-1 is found for the morning-to-afternoon evolution of the mixed-layer height, potential temperature and specific humidity. The virtual tool is in continuous development and aims to foster a better process understanding of the drivers of the ABL evolution and their global distribution, particularly during the onset and amplification of weather extremes. Finally, it can also be used to scrutinize the representation of land-atmosphere feedbacks and ABL dynamics in Earth system models, numerical weather prediction models, atmospheric reanalysis and satellite retrievals, with the ultimate goal of improving local climate projections, providing earlier warning of extreme weather and fostering a more effective development of climate adaptation strategies.

We develop a three-step procedure for assessing equivalence and then performance measures. To illustrate these arguments, we provide an empirical descriptive analysis of two private prisons and five structurally equivalent state-run prisons in Ohio and document heterogeneity in resources, staff climate, and inmate behaviors. Policy Implications: In our discussion and analyses, we underscore how comparability across private and public corrections should not be assumed. Comparisons should be focused on organizations with similar infrastructures and then systematically used to assess client needs and programming, client behavior, staff climate, and a diverse set of outcomes that bear directly and indirectly on clients’ well-being. In so doing, researchers can better set the bar that privatization is supposed to reach or exceed. They can also conduct more credible impact assessments. Cost-savings, for example, do not necessarily occur when contracted services do not match those offered through public corrections or when clientele differ dramatically between a private and a public organization. © 2019 American Society of Criminology","corrections; prisons; privatization; programming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065707608

Spatial distributions of water vapor, clouds, and surface ice are controlled by climate. In turn, water, in each of its thermodynamic phases, imposes significant modulations to thermal and reflected planetary spectra. Here we explore these characteristic spectral signals, based on 3D climate simulations of Earth-sized aquaplanets orbiting M dwarf stars near the habitable zone. By using 3D models, we can self-consistently predict surface temperatures and the location of water vapor, clouds, and surface ice in the climate system. Habitable zone planets in M dwarf systems are expected to be in synchronous rotation with their host star and thus present distinct differences in emitted and reflected energy fluxes depending on the observed hemisphere.

When addressing the requests for increased carbon storage in soil as well as for the reduction of nitrogen losses, integrated approaches on regional scales are required that take into account the actual changes in agricultural management and climate. This study investigated the arable land (7345 km 2 ) of Saxony (Germany) with regard to the following: (1) the trends of SOC storage and organic matter-related nitrogen fluxes, including their subregional and annual dynamics, (2) changes in the carbon input to arable soils and the turnover of organic matter, and (3) the contribution of different drivers (climate, crop production and fertilization, tillage system) to the simulated SOM changes for the period 1998–2014 on a 500 m grid. The model CANDY carbon balance (CCB) was specifically adapted for large-scale simulations of SOM turnover to link spatial data on soils and climate with regional statistics on agricultural management. This new ‘regional mode’ of CCB has been validated using data from 391 plots across different European locations. The initial SOC levels for Saxony assumed steady state conditions at the beginning of the simulation period and have been validated using data from 667 monitoring sites. The results showed an increase in the SOC stocks of the arable soils of Saxony of 785 × 10 3 t C (1.24‰ annually) during the simulation period. At the same time, the model simulated an average increase in organic nitrogen stored in SOM of approximately 7.5 kg N ha −1 a −1 , with considerable differences between individual years and subregions. Both the increase in carbon inputs to soil (+8%) and the reduction of carbon turnover rates (−10%) had positive effects on SOC storage. While the increased use of conservation tillage was the most important driver for the overall increase in SOM storage in Saxony, climate variability and crop production and fertilization had the largest effect on its annual dynamics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural management; CCB model; Organic matter-related nitrogen; Regional scale; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matter turnover","carbon; nitrogen; organic nitrogen; soil organic matter; nitrogen; agricultural land; agricultural management; assessment method; carbon sequestration; conservation tillage; integrated approach; mobilization; nitrogen fixation; numerical model; scale effect; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; turnover; agricultural management; arable land; Article; atmospheric deposition; barley; carbon balance; catch crop; cereal; climate; climate change; conservation tillage; crop production; Germany; grass; land use; nitrogen availability; nitrogen dynamics; nonhuman; rape; rye; silage; soil; soil fertilization; triticale; winter wheat; agriculture; Germany; Saxony; Agriculture; Carbon; Germany; Nitrogen; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062387398

Regulations to save these forests, including embodied DD tariffs or bans on unsustainably produced imports, are typically fragmented, permitting DD activities to find coverage gaps and create DD leakage. The forestry literature has focused on the competitiveness leakage channel, with DD implicated production shifting from strictly to laxly regulated jurisdictions. Less recognized is the market redirection channel. Production need not move. Instead, sales are rerouted to less selective markets. Using the example of palm oil, we develop a model in which one importing region imposes an embodied DD tariff. Some exporters may face transaction costs to switch to low DD production. With a common DD tariff policy across all importers being both improbable and burdensome to exporters, we investigate unilateral approaches. Contrary to a unilateral ban, or tariff, on unsustainable imports, which creates market redirection leakage, the second best optimum combines the unilateral damage based tariff with an output subsidy. The output subsidy encourages exports to the tariffed market. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Competitiveness channel; Deforestation; Embodied tariff; Forest degradation; Leakage; Market redirection channel; Output subsidy, transaction costs; Palm oil","biodiversity; competitiveness; deforestation; environmental economics; essential oil; forestry; international trade; market conditions; transaction cost",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061192059

This study aimed to investigate the long-term trends in COPD mortality in China and the U.S. using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017) and explore the age, period, and cohort effects independently by sex under the age–period–cohort (APC) framework. Taking the age group 40–44 years old, the period 1992–1996, and the birth cohort 1913–1917 as reference groups, we found that the age relative risks (RRs) of COPD mortality increased exponentially in both China and the U.S., the period RRs increased in the U.S. but decreased in China; and the cohort RRs showed an overall downward trend in both China and the U.S. with the year of birth. From 1992 to 2017, the increased RRs of COPD mortality in the U.S. was mainly attributable to the increased prevalence of smoking before 1965, while the decreased RRs of COPD mortality in China was mainly attributable to reduced air pollution as well as improvements in medical technology and more accessible health services. Reducing tobacco consumption may be the most effective and feasible way to prevent COPD in China. However, we also need to pay more attention to COPD in nonsmokers in the future. © 2019 by the authors.

We estimated the abundances, autocorrelations, and spatiotemporal associations of 4 small-mammal species from 2011–2016 using live-trapping mark-recapture methods on 9 sites across elevation and canopy openness gradients of a late-successional forest in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, on the west slope of the Oregon Cascades. We also quantified species-specific spatial variation in adult sex ratios and body mass. We used Huggins closed capture models to estimate site- and year-specific abundances of 4 target species: Humboldt's flying squirrels (Glaucomys oregonensis), Townsend's chipmunks (Neotamias townsendii), western red-backed voles (Myodes californicus), and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). We estimated the temporal autocorrelations among site- and species-specific abundance estimates and used generalized linear mixed effects models to investigate the effects of 7 spatiotemporal covariates on species-specific mean abundance estimates. Species-specific adult sex ratios, juvenile to adult ratios, and adult body masses were not widely variable among study sites. Abundance estimates varied by as much as 4-fold among years and 6-fold among sites. Humboldt's flying squirrel abundance was temporally autocorrelated at intervals of 1 and 5 years, Townsend's chipmunk abundance was temporally autocorrelated at intervals of 1–4 years, and western red-backed vole abundance was temporally autocorrelated at 1, 4, and 5 years. Mean fall abundance estimates were associated with elevation and climate and in some cases, canopy openness and berry-producing shrubs, but the direction of the association differed among species for some covariates. Our findings could provide additional management tools for small-mammal abundance objectives, and highlight the importance of careful covariate selection in studies using indices of small-mammal abundance. © 2019 The Authors.

Retrofitting is considered the most immediate, pressing, and effective mechanism for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. An environmental life cycle costing was applied to evaluate the sustainability of retrofitting existing buildings. A portfolio of environmental and economic impact results was developed for a baseline building and five alternative retrofitted building scenarios based on insulating the building wall. The results demonstrated a reduction in the environmental impacts and economic impacts by retrofitting the building. Improving the thermal performance of the building resulted in a reduction of environmental life cycle cost of 5%. Externality, which is primarily caused by energy usage, was the key source of the environmental life cycle cost. People in hot climate zones spend much of their time indoors, therefore, it is critical to keep comfortable thermal environment in buildings. This study provides strategically important evaluations for transforming existing buildings into more cost-effective and environmentally friendly sustainable buildings. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Retrofitting; Economic sustainability; Effective mechanisms; Environmental and economic impacts; Environmental life cycle; Reducing energy consumption; Sustainable building; Thermal environment; Thermal Performance; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068250672

Here we present a δ18O record analyzed in the mixed-layer dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (sensu stricto) from the northernmost Bay of Bengal (BoB). The δ18O time series provides a spatially integrated measure of monsoonal precipitation and Himalayan meltwater runoff into the northern BoB and reveals two brief episodes of anomalously low δ18O values between 16.3±0.4 and 16±0.5 and 12.6±0.4 and 12.3±0.4 thousand years before present. The timing of these events is centered at Heinrich event 1 and the Younger Dryas, well-known phases of weak northern hemisphere monsoon systems. Numerical climate model experiments, simulating Heinrich event-like conditions, suggest a surface warming over the monsoon-dominated Himalaya and foreland in response to ISM weakening. Corroborating the simulation results, our analysis of published moraine exposure ages in the monsoon-dominated Himalaya indicates enhanced glacier retreats that, considering age model uncertainties, coincide and overlap with the episodes of anomalously low δ18O values in the northernmost BoB. Our climate proxy and simulation results provide insights into past regional climate dynamics, suggesting reduced cloud cover, increased solar radiation, and air warming of the Himalaya and foreland areas and, as a result, glacier mass losses in response to weakened ISM. ©2019.

This unfortunate situation highlights the importance of the ca. 60,000-item plant collection from the recently exposed Late Bronze Age IIA palace at Tel Beth-Shemesh. Room L1505 in the palace—apparently a pantry due to its contents of foodstuffs and vessels for food preparation and consumption—contained eight deposits of carbonized crop plants. Deposits of almost pure grains and very low numbers of weed seeds were found, indicating that these stored food plants were ready to be used in food preparation.

Under steady-state conditions it is thought that glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) does not cross the chloroplast membrane. However, growth at high CO2, or disruption of starch metabolism can result in the GPT2 gene for a G6P/Pi translocator to be expressed presumably allowing G6P exchange across the chloroplast envelope. We found that after an increase in light, the transcript for GPT2 transiently increases several 100-fold within 2 h in both the Col-0 and WS ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana. The increase in transcript for GPT2 is preceded by an increase in transcript for many transcription factors including Redox Responsive Transcription Factor 1 (RRTF1). The increase in GPT2 transcript after exposure to high light is suppressed in a mutant lacking the RRTF1 transcription factor. The GPT2 response was also suppressed in a mutant with a T-DNA insert in the gene for the triose-phosphate/Pi translocator (TPT). However, plants lacking TPT still had a robust rise in RRTF1 transcript in response to high light. From this, we conclude that both RRTF1 (and possibly other transcription factors) and high amounts of cytosolic triose phosphate are required for induction of the expression of GPT2. We hypothesize that transient GPT2 expression and subsequent translation is adaptive, allowing G6P to move into the chloroplast from the cytosol. The imported G6P can be used for starch synthesis or may flow directly into the Calvin-Benson cycle via an alternative pathway (the G6P shunt), which could be important for regulating and stabilizing photosynthetic electron transport and carbon metabolism. © 2019 Weise, Liu, Childs, Preiser, Katulski, Perrin-Porzondek and Sharkey.","G6P; GAP; Glucose 6-phosphate; GPT2; PGA; Redox regulation; RRTF1; TPT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068464676

Several large energy consumption regions such as China, India, and Europe have set targets on lowering energy intensity - physical energy use per unit economic output - widely accepted as an indicator of energy efficiency. One percent reduction in energy intensity is expected to conserve one percent physical energy use from an engineer's perspective. However, the reduction in energy intensity would probably stimulate economic growth and result in more “unexpected” energy use, namely rebound effect on energy use. To convey the rebound effect consequences to policy makers, business managers, engineers, researchers and other stakeholders who take energy intensity an indicator of energy efficiency and a measure for energy conservation, the present article offers a method starting from a general form of production function to identify properties of and analyze key drivers behind the rebound effect. Different from the strict definition of rebound effect in energy economics, where energy efficiency is narrowly defined as energy-augmented or energy-specific technological change, measurable partial rebound effect of energy intensity reduction would be the most preferred output for a policy maker who pursues targets of both economic growth and energy conservation.

The key results are: (1) CO 2 emissions show significant positive autocorrelation in China, and the spatial distribution of CO 2 emissions is HH (High-High) or LL (Low-Low) clustered in most provinces; (2) new-type urbanisation has a paradoxical effect on CO 2 emissions. Energy-saving technology has a rebound effect on CO 2 emissions, but environmental technology inhibits CO 2 emissions; (3) by eliminating the rebound effect of energy-saving technology on CO 2 emissions and promoting environmental technology, new-type urbanisation indirectly inhibits CO 2 emissions; (4) new-type urbanisation exhibits a threshold effect on CO 2 emissions due to the different levels of energy-saving technology and environmental technology.

As a non-contact method, nanosecond laser can effectively avoid the occurrence of such defects. However, it is impossible to avoid the appearance of the heat affected zone (HAZ) and the macro-microscopic burrs during laser processing. Therefore, defect control of CFRP during nanosecond laser processing was investigated. The laser two-point spacing (Ds-s), and regional energy density (ED) were introduced. Taguchi method was adopted to explore the effects of laser scan speed, repetition frequency, Ds-s, and ED on machining quality. The multi-ring hole making strategy was used to reduce HAZ. According to the type of damage, the ED and Ds-s can be divided into three regions. Depending on the results, when Ds-s increased from 2 μm to 10 μm, defect decreased exponentially. In addition, it tended to be stable in the range of Ds-s from 10 μm to 35 μm. However, when Ds-s was larger than 20 μm, large roundness was liable to occur. Under a multi-ring hole making strategy, when Ds-s, the ring spacing and numbers were set as 20 μm, 50 μm and 12, respectively, the HAZ was less than 50 μm, and no obvious burrs and roundness error were observed. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","CFRP; HAZ; nanosecond laser; thermal damage","Defects; Heat affected zone; Reinforcement; Taguchi methods; Ultraviolet lasers; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Laser scan speed; Machining quality; Nanosecond lasers; Nanosecond ultraviolet laser; Noncontact methods; Repetition frequency; Thermal damage; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069532487

In this paper, a spatial econometric tool is utilized to examine to what extent CO 2 spillover depends on provinces’ bilateral geographical and economic linkages. Besides, different subgroups are built to estimate and compare the degree of spatial interactions among regions under five definitions of spatial dependency, to determine how the spatial effects of CO 2 emissions behave among our selected subgroups. The results demonstrate an N-shaped relationship, either before or after grouping, which shows a strong correlation against the effectiveness of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Additionally, the results show that economic linkage significantly outperforms all the other linkages in capturing the spatial dependencies between provinces, and the spatial dependence of CO 2 emissions in the high-energy structure group is far greater than that in the low-energy structure group. Our results suggest that even though considering the spatial aggregation effect, the economic relations behind CO 2 emissions can also capture the spatial features more accurately, providing valuable references for policymaking and carbon emission reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO 2 emission intensity; EKC; Panel threshold; Spatial aggregation effect; Spatial dependence","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Public policy; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission reductions; CO2 emissions; Environmental Kuznets curves; High energy structures; Panel threshold; Spatial aggregation; Spatial dependence; Economic and social effects",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061640703

This article describes a test of that hypothesis, involving simulations and evaluations of the economic performance of the above two systems for a model office building in five major U.S. climate zones. The cost–benefit analysis suggests that a GSHP system in climate zone 5 (Chicago-region) has the best return on investment, whereas climate zone 2 (Phoenix-region) is not economically promising. Relative to a reference HVAC system, the GSHP system has lower carbon emissions in each of the five climate zones, with the greatest reduction of carbon emissions occurring in climate zone 5 (Chicago-region). Significance: When faced with decisions about hot water supply and space heating and cooling, relative to drinking water utilities that rely on surface waters, groundwater-based utilities have ready access to groundwater source heat pumps (GSHPs) that should offer better energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. These advantages, however, will depend on regional climate conditions and the course of electrical energy.

Since thermal power generation is the main form of power generation, the large-scale development of electric vehicles is equivalent to replacing oil with coal, which will accordingly result in carbon emissions increasing if the scale of electric vehicles exceeds a certain limit. A relationship model between regional energy mix structure and electric vehicles holdings under the constraint of carbon emission reduction is established to perform a quantitative analysis of the limitation mechanism. In order to measure the scale of the future electric vehicle market under the constraint of carbon emissions reduction, a method called Extreme Learning Machine optimized by Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO-ELM) with higher precision than Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed to predict the power structure and the trend of electric vehicle development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2019-2030. The calculation results show that the maximum number of electric vehicles must not exceed 19,340,000 and 26,867,171 based on emissions reduction aims and also the predicted energy mix structure in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in 2020 and 2030. At this time, the ratio of electric vehicles to traditional car ownership is 75.6% and 78.3%. The proportion of clean energy generation should reach 0.314 and 0.323 to match a complete replacement of traditional fuel vehicles for electric vehicles. A substantial increase in clean energy generation is needed so that the large-scale promotion of electric vehicles can still achieve the goal of carbon reduction. Therefore, this article will be helpful for policy-making on electric vehicle development scale and energy mix structure in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission; Constraint model; Electric vehicle; Improved particle swarm optimization; Power production structure","car ownership; carbon emission; electric vehicle; emission control; model; optimization; policy making; power generation; prediction; thermal power; traffic emission; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067101197

Understanding the driving forces of CO 2 emissions from power generation is critical for both decarbonizing the power sector and achieving national carbon reduction targets. The objectives of this study were to identify critical driving forces behind changes in CO 2 emissions from the power sector and to propose appropriate decarbonization pathways. First, the generation and demand structures of the power sector were introduced into a CO 2 emission accounting model and decomposition analysis. Instead of traditional input–output analysis, structural decomposition analysis modified using a power transmission table was used to investigate the impacts of five driving factors of CO 2 emissions from China's power generation. The five driving factors comprised the proportion of thermal power, power generation technology, power generation structure, power demand structure and power demand, whereby the latter was divided further into nine detailed parts. Considering five regional power grids in China, the contributions of these factors were analyzed at both national and regional level. The results showed that the majority of the increase in CO 2 emissions during 2007–2012 could be attributed to electricity generation (96.2%) driven by changes in power demand, which should be the key to power sector decarbonization. By contrast, 30.7% of emissions were offset by changes in the proportion of thermal power and technology, demonstrating the obvious effects of China's policy on clean energy transition. Additionally, all power grids exhibited an increase in CO 2 emissions from electricity generation, with the east and central grids accounting for 64% of the national increase. Power transmission structure had only a small impact on CO 2 emissions from power generation. By using the electricity transmission table, we modified SDA to overcome the time lag issues and eliminate the reliance on IO data, and continuous annual data rather than aggregated five-yearly data can be used to capture the structural effects, thus providing more precise results for the driving forces of emission changes. Our case study shows that there is huge potential in extending the IO-based SDA method to other trade-related studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO 2 emission; Decomposition analysis; Power sector; Power transmission","Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Electric power utilization; Fuels; Power transmission; Structural analysis; CO2 emissions; CO2 emissions from fuel combustion; Critical driving force; Decomposition analysis; Electricity transmission; Power generation technology; Power sector; Structural decomposition analysis; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062690400

During the winter heating season, ""smog"" has become somewhat a normal phenomenon to local residents' livelihood in northern China. Based on the daily air pollution data of regional cities in China from 2014 to 2016, and using a regression discontinuity design (RDD), the study finds that winter heating makes the air quality worse in the northern part of China. With the start of the winter heating, it increases the Air Quality Index (AQI) by 10.4%, particulate matter smaller than 10 μm (PM10) by 9.77%, particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) by 17.25%, CO by 9.84%, NO2 by 5.23%, and SO2 by 17.1%. Furthermore, dynamic changes demonstrate that air quality has gradually improved due to a series of heating policy changes implemented by the central government in recent years. Specifically, from 2014 to 2016, major indicators measuring the air pollution decrease dramatically, such as AQI by 92.36%, PM10 by 91.24%, PM2.5 by 84.06%, CO by 70.97%, NO2 by 52.76%, and SO2 by 17.15%. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution; RDD analysis; Winter heating policy","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; discontinuity; heating; livelihood; nitrous oxide; particulate matter; regression analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067084485

Meanwhile, DNAzyme has significant signal amplification ability, and the gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based spherical nucleic acid (SNA) has the properties of resistance to enzymatic degradation, enhanced nucleic acid binding and excellent cellular uptake. Taking advantage of their properties, in this work, we constructed a novel SNA-based TPE fluorescent DNAzyme probe for the selective and sensitive detection of target miRNA in living cells. Briefly, AuNPs were first functionalized with the substrate sequences hybridized to two split fragments of the 8–17 DNAzyme-contained sequence. Then, numerous two-photon absorption (TPA)-dye molecules of Ethyl-4-[3,6-Bis (1-methyl-4-vinylpyridium iodine)-9H-carbazol-9-yl)] (EBMVC) were inserted into the substrate/split-DNAzyme duplexes on the surface of the AuNP to form the TPE SNA nanoprobe in the “off” fluorescence emission state. When the target miRNA is bound, the conformation of the split DNAzymes will change resulting in the activation of their catalytic ability, thus leading to cleavage of the substrate sequences and the release of the TPA-dye molecules-inserted DNAzyme motif from the surface of the AuNP. Concurrently, the released target miRNA would autonomously hybridize with another split DNAzyme motif and activate further cleavage reactions. This would induce the gradual dissociation of the TPA-dye molecules-inserted DNAzyme motifs from the surface of the AuNP through the repeated target miRNA hybridization-activated cleavage reaction and thereby trigger the cascade TPE fluorescence emission, ultimately achieving the detection of the miRNA through amplification of the fluorescence signals. The assay was successfully validated with clean buffer conditions as well as with cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNAzyme; miRNA; Signal amplification; Spherical nucleic acid (SNA); Two-photon microscopy","Amplification; Biomolecules; Fluorescence; Gold nanoparticles; Luminescence of organic solids; Photobleaching; Photons; Spheres; Two photon processes; DNAzyme; miRNA; Signal amplifications; Spherical nucleic acids; Two photon microscopy; RNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060952065

In this study, we examined the effects of sulfadimidine on nitrogen removal when added to experimental pond sediments. We found that sulfadimidine increased the number of sulfadimidine resistant bacteria and significantly increased the abundance of sul2 at the end of the incubation time (ANOVA test at Tukey HSD, P &lt; 0.05). In addition, sulfadimidine decreased the N2O reduction rate as well as the amount of nitrate reduction. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the N2O reduction rate was significantly and negatively correlated with narG (r = −0.679, P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, we found a significant positive correlation between the amount of nitrate reduction and the abundance of narG (r = 0.609, P &lt; 0.05) and nirK (r = 0.611, P &lt; 0.05). High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that Actinobacteria, Euryarchaeota, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Burkholderiaceae (a family of Proteobacteria), and Thermoanaerobaculaceae (a family of Firmicutes) decreased with sulfadimidine exposure. In sediments, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Epsilonbacteraeota, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Spirochaetesat may play key roles in nitrogen transformation.

In this study, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was used to explore the strength and direction of nexus between various factors and PM2.5 in Chinese cities. A comprehensive interpretive framework was established, composed of 18 determinants spanning the three categories of natural conditions, socioeconomic factors, and city features. Our results indicate that PM2.5 concentration levels were spatially heterogeneous and markedly higher in cities in eastern China than in cities in the west of the country. Based on the results of GWR, significant spatial heterogeneity was identified in both the direction and strength of the determinants at the local scale. Among all of the natural variables, elevation was found to be statistically significant with its effects on PM2.5 in 95.60% of the cities and it correlated negatively with PM2.5 in 99.63% cities, with its effect gradually weakening from the eastern to the western parts of China. The variable of built-up areas emerged as the strongest variable amongst the socioeconomic variables studied; it maintained a positive significant relationship in cities located in the Pearl River Delta and surrounding areas, while in other cities it exhibited a negative relationship to PM2.5. The highest coefficients were located in cities in northeast China. As the strongest variable amongst the six landscape factors, patch density maintained a positive relationship in part of cities. While in cities in the northeast regions, patch density exhibited a negative relationship with PM2.5, revealing that increasing urban fragmentation was conducive to PM2.5 reductions in those regions. These empirical results provide a basis for the formulation of targeted and differentiated air quality improvement measures in the task of regional PM2.5 governances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Geographically weighted regression; Natural conditions; PM2.5; Socioeconomic determinants; Spatial heterogeneity","Air quality; Geographically weighted regression; Natural conditions; PM2.5; Socioeconomic determinants; Spatial heterogeneity; Regression analysis; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); fragmentation; heterogeneity; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; socioeconomic status; spatial variation; targeting; urban area; urban atmosphere; article; China; city; geographically weighted regression; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; procedures; socioeconomics; spatial regression; statistics and numerical data; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors; Spatial Regression",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062715210

Given that energy-intensive industries represent ~80% of total CO 2 emissions in China and that China is a large and diverse country, this paper aims to investigate the potential contribution of regional convergence in energy-intensive industries to CO 2 emissions reduction and to meeting China 's emissions goals. To the best of our knowledge this matter has never been explored before. Using panel data from 2001 to 2015, we build three scenarios of future carbon intensities: business as usual (BAU), frontier (based on the directional distance function, in which all regions reach the efficiency frontier) and best available technology (BAT, in which all regions adopt the lowest-emitting technology). The frontier and BAT scenarios represent a weak and a strong form of regional convergence, respectively, and the BAU assumes that it develops following historical patterns. We then use the Kaya identity to estimate CO 2 emissions up to 2030 under the three scenarios. Our results are as follows: (1) Under BAU, the CO 2 emissions of energy-intensive industries increase from 7382.8 Mt in 2015 to 8127.6 Mt in 2030. Under the frontier scenario the emissions in 2030 are 44.23% lower than under business as usual, while under the BAT scenario this value becomes 84.81%. Electricity and ferrous metals are the sectors that most contribute to the reduction potential.

Mangrove sediments may serve as a nitrogen source or sink to the hydrosphere and atmosphere at both regional and global scales. However, major mechanisms controlling the connection between the mangrove and the adjacent tidal creek (nitrogen cycling in sediments and outfluxing) remain unclear. A multidisciplinary study based on intensive investigation, incorporating detailed sediment profiling, multi-isotopes analysis, sediment incubation, and microbiological identification was conducted in the Yunxiao mangrove reserve and Zhangjiang Estuary in southeast China. Here we show that mineralization and denitrification are major processes shaping mangroves as an ammonium source and nitrate sink. Enrichment of ammonium in pore water (10–40 cm in depth) likely resulted from strong ammonification with limited nitrification in the anaerobic sediments. Denitrification played a key role in nitrate removal from pore waters while producing N2O and N2. Decreasing δ15N-N2O and associated δ15N:δ18O ratio suggested that most of the outgassing N2O was derived from incomplete denitrification in sediment pore water. Overall, there was a net export of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from mangroves toward the estuary in winter and spring but a net import to mangroves in summer and fall, mainly driven by tidal pumping with seasonal variation of bio-uptake. These findings highlight the role of mangrove wetlands in regulating nutrient status and carbon budget in coastal areas. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

In most schemes, water oxidation is typically the limiting half-reaction. Here, we introduce a molecular approach to the design of a photoanode that incorporates an electron acceptor, a sensitizer, an electron donor, and a water oxidation catalyst in a single molecular assembly. The strategy mimics the key elements in Photosystem II by initiating light-driven water oxidation with integration of a light absorber, an electron acceptor, an electron donor, and a catalyst in a controlled molecular environment on the surface of a conducting oxide electrode. Visible excitation of the assembly results in the appearance of reductive equivalents at the electrode and oxidative equivalents at a catalyst that persist for seconds in aqueous solutions. Steady-state illumination of the assembly with 440 nm light with an applied bias results in photoelectrochemical water oxidation with a per-photon absorbed efficiency of 2.3%. The results are notable in demonstrating that light-driven water oxidation can be carried out at a conductive electrode in a structure with the functional elements of Photosystem II including charge separation and water oxidation. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Artificial photosynthesis; Catalysts; Electrodes; Electrons; Conducting oxide electrodes; Conductive electrodes; Functional elements; Molecular approach; Molecular environment; Photoelectrochemical water oxidation; Steady-state illumination; Water oxidation catalysts; Oxidation; water; aqueous solution; Article; catalyst; controlled study; electrochemistry; illumination; oxidation; photochemistry; photosystem II; steady state; surface property; water oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065790643

The idea for this method is that real climate records from some cities can serve as ""analogs"" that behave like potential future precipitation for other locations at small spatio-temporal scales. Extreme precipitation frequency quantiles of a 3.16 km2 catchment in the Chicago area, computed using simulations from North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) Regional Climate Models (RCMs) with L-moment method, were compared to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14 (NA14) quantiles at other cities. Variances in raw NARCCAP historical quantiles from different combinations of RCMs, General Circulation Models (GCMs), and remapping methods are much larger than those in NA14. The performance for NARCCAP quantiles tend to depend more on the RCMs than the GCMs, especially at durations less than 24-h. The uncertainties in bias-corrected future quantiles of NARCCAP are still large compared to those of NA14, and increase with rainfall duration. Results show that future 3-h and 30-day rainfall in Chicago will be similar to historical rainfall from Memphis, TN and Springfield, IL, respectively. This indicates that the spatial analog is potentially useful, but highlights the fact that the analogs may depend on the duration of the rainfall of interest. © 2019 by the authors.","Extreme precipitation; Future precipitation at urban scale; RCM uncertainty; Spatial analog","Catchments; Climate change; Method of moments; Rain; Extreme precipitation; General circulation model; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; RCM uncertainty; Regional climate changes; Regional climate models; Spatial analog; Urban scale; Climate models; catchment; general circulation model; hydrology; NOAA satellite; precipitation (chemistry); precipitation (climatology); rainfall; spatial analysis; uncertainty analysis; urban area; Chicago; Illinois; Memphis; Missouri; Springfield; Tennessee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066309282

The rationale for such coupling is that building geometry has an impact on energy demands and solar potentials on roofs and façades, thus also altering the corresponding optimal energy system. As a demonstration of this approach, we formulate bi-objective optimization problems for minimizing operational cost and carbon emissions, with decision variables for building geometry and for selection and sizing of energy system technologies. The methodology is applied to a case study in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, involving four office buildings. Different carbon emissions targets are studied to show the impact on cost, densities, sizing of the multi-energy system, and architectural design implications. Results for this case study show a clear relation between emissions targets and densities due to available solar potentials for renewable energy generation, with an optimal density in the strictest emissions target reaching only 10% of the optimal density without emissions target. This indicates that differentiated environmental targets should be defined depending on the location of a building, where rural sites could have stricter targets than dense urban sites to reflect the respective marginal costs for achieving the targets. Our study shows that coupling multiple simulators into a common optimization and design workflow brings together architectural aspects, such as geometry, with engineering aspects, such as the energy system design, and microclimate conditions, such as local solar potentials.

Vegetation reduces the LST by providing shade and absorbing radiation energy via transpiration and photosynthesis [3], [4]. A review of research on urban green spaces recommended that future research should incorporate functional, structural, and configurational parameters of urban vegetation in order to more fully assess the thermal effect of green spaces [5]. This study aims to fill this research gap by considering satellite-derived LST (Landsat 8), biotope types and 3D vegetation data in a study of LST across diurnal and seasonal temporal scales in a mid-latitude city (Berlin). Four cloud-free Landsat 8 scenes representing each season were analyzed. Day and night summer scenes with comparable air temperatures were used to assess the day/night difference in LST. Kruskall-Wallis tests and Dunn's post-hoc tests were applied to assess the significance of difference between LST of biotope classes and subclasses. Overall, LST varied significantly between the majority of biotope classes and subclasses. The relative coolness of each biotope class differed based on the season. The lowest and highest day/night LST variation could be noted for water biotope classes and dwarf shrub heaths, respectively. Vegetation height was significantly negatively correlated with LST (p-value<0.001) for all day scenes. Our results contribute to an enhanced understanding of how biotope types influence LST in an urban environment, which will be vital to urban planning in light of climate change. © 2019 IEEE.","biotope types; Land surface temperature; Landsat; SUHI; thermal imagery","Climate change; Land surface temperature; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban planning; Vegetation; biotope types; Diurnal variability; Energy and water balance; Green infrastructure; LANDSAT; SUHI; Thermal imagery; Urban green spaces; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072029364

In the Western Baltic cod stock socio-ecological links are particularly important, with many relying on cod for their livelihoods. A series of recent experiments revealed that cod populations are negatively affected by climate change, but an ecological-economic assessment of the combined effects, and advice on optimal adaptive management are still missing. For Western Baltic cod, the increase in larval mortality due to ocean acidification has experimentally been quantified. Time-series analysis allows calculating the temperature effect on recruitment. Here, we include both processes in a stock-recruitment relationship, which is part of an ecological-economic optimization model. The goal was to quantify the effects of climate change on the triple bottom line (ecological, economic, social) of the Western Baltic cod fishery. Ocean warming has an overall negative effect on cod recruitment in the Baltic. Optimal management would react by lowering fishing mortality with increasing temperature, to create a buffer against climate change impacts. The negative effects cannot be fully compensated, but even at 3 °C warming above the 2014 level, a reduced but viable fishery would be possible. However, when accounting for combined effects of ocean warming and acidification, even optimal fisheries management cannot adapt to changes beyond a warming of +1.5° above the current level. Our results highlight the need for multi-factorial climate change research, in order to provide the best available, most realistic, and precautionary advice for conservation of exploited species as well as their connected socio-economic systems. © 2019 The Authors","Atlantic cod; Climate change; Ecological-economic model; Fisheries management; Marine fisheries; Ocean acidification; Ocean warming; Profits","adaptive management; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; ecological economics; environmental assessment; experimental study; fishery management; fishing mortality; gadoid fishery; global warming; livelihood; marine ecosystem; mortality; ocean acidification; profitability; recruitment (population dynamics); stock assessment; sustainability; sustainable development; temperature effect; acidification; adult; animal experiment; Article; Atlantic cod; Baltic Sea; biomass; climate change; controlled study; economic model; environmental sustainability; fishery management; global climate; marine environment; mortality rate; nonhuman; sea; sea surface temperature; spawning; temperature dependence; temperature sensitivity; warming; animal; Baltic States; ecosystem; fishery; human; pH; sea; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Gadus callarias; Gadus morhua; sea water; Animals; Baltic States; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Gadus morhua; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Oceans and Seas; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062334847

To better constrain location and magnitude of emissions, a surface erodibility factor is typically employed in models. Several landscape-scale schemes representing surface dust emission potential for use in models have recently been proposed, but validation of such schemes has only been attempted indirectly with medium-resolution remote sensing of mineral aerosol loadings and high-resolution land surface mapping. In this study, we used dust emission source points identified in Namibia with Landsat imagery together with field-based dust emission measurements using a Portable In-situ Wind Erosion Laboratory wind tunnel to assess the performance of schemes aiming to represent erodibility in global dust cycle modeling. From analyses of the surface and samples taken at the time of wind tunnel testing, a Boosted Regression Tree analysis identified the significant factors controlling erodibility based on Portable In-situ Wind Erosion Laboratory dust flux measurements and various surface characteristics, such as soil moisture, particle size, crusting degree, and mineralogy. Despite recent attention to improving the characterization of surface dust emission potential, our assessment indicates a high level of variability in the measured fluxes within similar geomorphologic classes. This variability poses challenges to dust modeling attempts based on geomorphology and/or spectral-defined classes. Our approach using high-resolution identification of dust sources to guide ground-based testing of emissivity offers a valuable means to help constrain and validate dust emission schemes.

Until recently, the discovery of large oil accumulations in deeply buried reservoirs was considered as theoretically impossible. This work suggests that giant oil accumulations at great depths (6–10 km) should be considered important hydrocarbon exploration targets in the Russian Federation and the Eurasian Union. The first-priority oil and gas exploration targets at great depths are deeply buried horizons of the sedimentary cover of the Precaspian basin, whose subsalt hydraulic system is characterized by ubiquitous abnormally high formation pressures. The deeply buried reservoirs in the Astrakhan oil and gas accumulation zone are considered the most promising for the discovery of giant oil accumulations. Data discussed below demonstrate that hydrocarbon exploration and the discovery of giant oil accumulations at great depths require specific exploration procedures and techniques. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","abnormal formation pressure; Astrakhan arch; carbonate platform; deep horizons; hydrocarbon fields; Karpinsky range; petroleum provinces; Precaspian basin","accumulation; carbonate platform; gas production; hydrocarbon exploration; oil production; pressure; Astrakhan; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066941161

As actors interact to pursue their individual or collective interests, these struggles turn into dynamic power interplay. In this article, we aim to show how power interplay shapes local adaptation plans of action (LAPAs) in Nepal to be short-term and reactive. We use an interactional framing approach through interaction analyses and observations to analyse how actors use material and ideational resources to pursue their interests. Material and ideational resources that an actor deploys include political authority, knowledge of adaptation science and national/local policy-making processes, financial resources and strong relations with international non-governmental organizations and donor agencies. We find that facilitators and local politicians have a very prominent role in meetings relating to LAPAs, resulting in short-termism of LAPAs. Findings suggest that there is also a lack of female participation contributing to short-term orientated plans. We conclude that such power interplay analysis can help to investigate how decision making on the temporal aspects of climate adaptation policy takes place at the local level. Key policy insights Short-termism of LAPAs is attributed to the power interplay between actors during the policy design process. Improved participation of the most vulnerable, especially women, can lead to the preparation of adaptation plans and strategies focusing on both the short and long-term. It is pertinent to consider power interplay in the design and planning of adaptation policy in order to create a level-playing field between actors for inclusive decision-making. Analysis of dynamic power interplay can help in investigating climate change adaptation controversies that are marked by uncertainties and ambiguities. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Here, we show results of a controlled CO2 release experiment at the Sleipner CO2 storage site and numerical simulations that evaluate the detectability and environmental consequences of a well leaking CO2 into the Central North Sea (CNS). Our field measurements and numerical results demonstrate that the detectability and impact of a leakage of &lt;55 t yr−1 of CO2 would be limited to bottom waters and a small area around the leak, due to rapid CO2 bubble dissolution in seawater within the lower 2 m of the water column and quick dispersion of the dissolved CO2 plume by strong tidal currents. As such, the consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are found to be insignificant in terms of storage performance. Only prolonged leakage along numerous wells might compromise long-term CO2 storage and may adversely affect the local marine ecosystem. Since many abandoned wells leak natural gas into the marine environment, hydrocarbon provinces with a high density of wells may not always be the most suitable areas for CO2 storage. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon dioxide; Geological storage; Leakage; North Sea; Sleipner; Wells","Abandoned wells; Carbon capture; Climate change; Ecosystems; Leakage (fluid); Natural gas wells; Numerical models; Ocean currents; Offshore gas fields; Wells; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon dioxide removal; Climate change mitigation; Environmental consequences; Geological storage; North Sea; Sleipner; Storage performance; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; experimental study; gas well; leakage; marine environment; natural gas; numerical model; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063664391

The studies were carried out in pine forests at ten test plots near the Karabash copper smelting plant and in the Ilmen State Reserve at South Urals. The 13С/12С and 15N/14N isotopic ratios were analyzed in leaves of plants of different functional groups (with ecto-, ericoid, or arbuscular mycorrhiza; with nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, and non-mycorrhizal). The 13С/12С ratio did not change under technogenic pollution. The low isotopic 15N/14N ratio was established in ectomycorrhizal trees, while the high ratio was found in herbs with arbuscular mycorrhiza, nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, and non-mycorrhizal groups. As compared to nonpolluted habitats, the 15N content in leaves near the copper smelting plant increases by 2.7‰ in the ectomycorrhizal trees and by 3.4‰ in undershrubs with ericoid mycorrhiza, and by 2.2‰ in herbs with arbuscular mycorrhiza.

For the city of Brussels, we explore the influence of urban planning and global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) for the near (2031-2050) and far (2081-2100) future. We implemented two urban planning expansion scenarios (translated into Local Climate Zones, LCZ) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). The projections show that the influence of GHG emissions trumps urban planning measures in each of the two periods. In the near future, no large differences are noted between the RCP scenarios. In the far future on the contrary, both heat stress and risk values are twice as large for RCP 8.5 compared to RCP 4.5. Depending on the GHG scenario and the LCZ, heat stress is projected to increase with a factor of 10 by 2090 compared to the present-day climate and urban planning conditions. The imprint of vulnerability and exposure is clearly visible in the heat risk assessment, leading to very high levels of heat risk most notable for the northwestern part of the Brussels Capital Region (BCR). The results demonstrate the need for mitigation and adaptation plans at different policy levels that strive for lower GHG emissions and the development of sustainable urban areas safeguarding livability in future cities. © 2019 IEEE.","global greenhouse gas emissions; Heat risk; Local Climate Zones; urban planning; UrbClim","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Thermal stress; Brussels Capital Region; GHG emission; Local climate; Planning measures; Policy level; Rural population; Urban areas; UrbClim; Urban planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072042939

Physically, energy efficiency, water consumption and reduction of waste and carbon footprint may be affected by scale and location of production activities and potentials of industrial symbiosis. From the business perspective, novel products, new markets and new business models are expected in order for food RDM to penetrate within the established food industry. Studies on policies, through the lens of public procurement, call for solid evidence of envisioned environmental, social and economic benefits of a more localized food system.

These compounds, in fact, are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, especially in some spontaneous plants exploited as feeding resources alternative to cultivated crops and in several agro-industry by-products. Polyphenols interact with rumen microbiota, affecting carbohydrate fermentation, protein degradation, and lipid metabolism. Some of these aspects have been largely reviewed, especially for tannins; however, less information is available about the direct effect of polyphenols on the composition of rumen microbiota. In the present paper, we review the most recent literature about the effect of plant polyphenols on rumen microbiota responsible for unsaturated fatty acid biohydrogenation, fiber digestion, and methane production, taking into consideration the advances in microbiota analysis achieved in the last 10 yr. Key aspects, such as sample collection, sample storage, DNA extraction, and the main phylogenetic markers used in the reconstruction of microbial community structure, are examined. Furthermore, a summary of the new high-throughput methods based on next generation sequencing is reviewed. Several effects can be associated with dietary polyphenols. Polyphenols are able to depress or modulate the biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids by a perturbation of ruminal microbiota composition. In particular, condensed tannins have an inhibitory effect on biohydrogenation, whereas hydrolyzable tannins seem to have a modulatory effect on biohydrogenation. With regard to fiber digestion, data from literature are quite consistent about a general depressive effect of polyphenols on gram-positive fibrolytic bacteria and ciliate protozoa, resulting in a reduction of volatile fatty acid production (mostly acetate molar production). Methane production is also usually reduced when tannins are included in the diet of ruminants, probably as a consequence of the inhibition of fiber digestion. However, some evidence suggests that hydrolyzable tannins may reduce methane emission by directly interacting with rumen microbiota without affecting fiber digestion. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association","plant secondary compound; rumen microorganism; tannin; volatile fatty acid","methane; polyphenol; tannin derivative; unsaturated fatty acid; animal; chemistry; diet; dietary fiber; drug effect; fermentation; hydrogenation; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; physiology; plant; rumen; veterinary medicine; Animals; Diet; Dietary Fiber; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Fermentation; Hydrogenation; Methane; Microbiota; Plants; Polyphenols; Rumen; Tannins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063092897

In this paper, we isolate the effects of two environmental drivers, nitrogen (N) deposition and climate (temperature and precipitation) change, through an analysis of a single cohort of 24 dominant tree species. We assembled a tree database using data from U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis monitoring plots. Applying observed species-specific growth and survival responses, we simulated how forest stands in a 19-state study area would change from 2005 to 2100 under 12 different future N deposition–climate scenarios. We then estimated implications for three selected forest ecosystem services: merchantable timber, aboveground carbon sequestration, and tree diversity. Total tree biomass (for 24 species combined) was positively associated with both increased N deposition and temperatures; however, due to differences in the direction and magnitude of species-specific responses, forest composition varied across scenarios. For example, red maple (Acer rubrum) trees gained biomass under scenarios with more N deposition and more climate change, whereas biomass of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and red pine (Pinus resinosa) was negatively affected. Projections for ecosystem services also varied across scenarios. Carbon sequestration, which is positively associated with biomass accumulation, increased with N deposition and increasing climate change. Total timber values also increased with overall biomass; however, scenarios with increasing climate change tended to favor species with lower merchantable value, whereas more N deposition favored species with higher merchantable value. Tree species diversity was projected to decrease with greater changes in climate (warmer temperatures), especially in the northwestern, central, and southeastern portions of the study area. In contrast, the effects of N deposition on diversity varied greatly in magnitude and direction across the study area. This study highlights species-specific and regional effects of N deposition and climate change in northeastern U.S. forests, which can inform management decision for air quality and forests in the region, as well as climate policy. It also provides a foundation for future studies that may incorporate other important factors such as multiple cohorts, sulfur deposition, insects, and diseases. © 2019 The Authors.

The New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide harmonised Light-duty vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) were driven in the laboratory following standard and extended testing procedures (such as low temperatures, use of auxiliaries, modified speed trace). On-road tests were conducted in real traffic conditions, within and outside the boundary conditions of the regulated European Real-Driving Emissions (RDE) test. Nitrogen oxides (NOX), particle number (PN), carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission factors were developed considering the whole cycles, their sub-cycles, and the first 300 s of each test to assess the cold start effect. Despite complying with the NEDC type approval NOX limit, diesel vehicles emitted, on average, over the WLTC and the RDE 2.1 and 6.7 times more than the standard limit, respectively. Diesel vehicles equipped with only a Lean NOX trap (LNT) averaged six and two times more emissions over the WLTC and the RDE, respectively, than diesel vehicles equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst. Gasoline vehicles with direct injection (GDI) emitted eight times more NOX than those with port fuel injection (PFI) on RDE tests. Large NOX emissions on the urban section were also recorded for GDIs (122 mg/km). Diesel particle filters were mounted on all diesel vehicles, resulting in low particle number emission (∼1010 #/km) over all testing conditions including low temperature and high dynamicity. GDIs (∼1012 #/km) and PFIs (∼1011 #/km) had PN emissions that were, on average, two and one order of magnitude higher than for diesel vehicles, respectively, with significant contribution from the cold start. PFIs yielded high CO emission factors under high load operation reaching on average 2.2 g/km and 3.8 g/km on WLTC extra-high and RDE motorway, respectively. The average on-road CO2 emissions were ∼33% and 41% higher than the declared CO2 emissions at type-approval for diesel and gasoline vehicles, respectively. The use of auxiliaries (AC and lights on) over the NEDC led to an increase of ∼20% of CO2 emissions for both diesel and gasoline vehicles. Results for NOX, CO and CO2 were used to derive average on-road emission factors that are in good agreement with the emission factors proposed by the EMEP/EEA guidebook. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2; Emission factors; Light-duty vehicles; NEDC; NOX; PEMS; PN; Real Driving Emissions; WLTC","Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Direct injection; Dynamometers; Gasoline; Low temperature testing; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Selective catalytic reduction; Temperature; Vehicles; Emission factors; Light duty vehicles; NEDC; PEMS; Real drivings; WLTC; Air pollution control equipment; boundary condition; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; catalyst; emission inventory; experimental study; laboratory method; nitrogen oxides; traffic emission; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067249254

The present paper investigates the potentiality of an energy system equipped with photovoltaic thermal (PV) hybrid solar collectors, a storage tanks for the heat source and a heat pump for the space heating of a small office located in three different European cities. The behaviour of the heat pump according to the heat taken from the photovoltaic panels and stored in the tank has been analysed. An energy analysis was performed according to the efficiency of the heat pump and then the thermodynamic parameters of the system were evaluated. The analytical model of each subsystem of the thermal plant was developed in Matlab where hourly simulation during the period of heating season were performed. Therefore, a comparison between the results obtained for Rome, Milan and Cracow provided the heating energy demand covering rate for each of the cities in different subsystem efficiency conditions. When thermal and electrical efficiency of PVT are set respectively to 0.6 and 0.15 and the efficiency of storage unit heat exchanger is considered equal to 0.9 the heating demand covered for Rome is 70%, for Milan is 62%, while for Cracow is 47%.

As opposed to conventional vehicles, EVs do not entail tailpipe emission of CO2 and other ambient air pollutants and require lower operational cost. However, the benefits that EVs can bring highly depend on their charging strategy. Moreover, the ever-increasing deployment of EVs on a global scale, and their uncontrolled charging (currently predominant) requirements, can cause significant burden for national grids and local distribution networks. The solutions EV could bring depend on the adopted charging strategies, i.e. dump charging, smart charging or V2G. This paper compares various EV charging strategies at the UK national level in perspective to 2030 and 2040 targets. This study clearly shows the benefits EVs could bring if their charging is intelligently controlled, resulting in a more positive impact on electricity distribution grids, a higher integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and lower CO2 emissions. © 2019 IEEE.","CO2 emission; Electric vehicles; renewable energy; smart charging; vehicle-to-grid","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Vehicle-to-grid; Carbon footprint reductions; CO2 emissions; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity distribution; Local distribution networks; Renewable energies; Smart charging; Uncontrolled charging; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070257653

This analysis looks at 20 states in the continental United States from 2000 to 2008 that were either at or above the U.S. average for percentage of foreign-born population, or states that ranked in the top 10 percent in terms of change in foreign-born population for that time period. To examine this issue, a multivariate, regression-based difference-in-differences (DD) analysis was applied. The “treatment” group is immigrant families with a U.S. citizen child that is 130% of the federal poverty level or below in states with restrictive immigrant related legislation and the “control” group is native families meeting the same federal poverty level guidelines as well as low-income immigrant families in states without the restrictive legislation. The research findings show that there does not appear to be a chilling effect associated with restrictive state laws on participation in the food stamp program. Food insecurity is an immediate need that may override the impediments to enrollment due to immigration status, causing families to apply despite a negative climate toward immigrants. For policy makers and immigrant advocates it is important to know where chilling effects might not occur in order to work with politicians and federal agencies on crafting sound evidence-based policy. Independent of any chilling effect, the model shows that immigrant families are less likely to enroll in food stamp benefits, consistent with other literature. In addition, independent of the effects of restrictive immigration legislation, both non-citizen and naturalized mothers were less likely to be in a family with food stamp benefits compared to similar native-born mothers. This indicates that all states have a gap in food stamp program enrollment that merits further attention and research. © 2019 Sylvia E. Twersky.

This state of affairs has persisted because of the desire to have p-type hole injectors on top of the quantum well active region. Because of the internal polarization fields in nitride heterostructures, there exist four permutations of doping and polarization for the realization of such light emitters. Which permutation is the most desirable for efficient light emission? In this work, we answer this question by demonstrating a fundamentally new approach toward efficient light emission with ""bottom-tunnel junctions."" The bottom-tunnel junction design aligns the polarization fields in the desired direction in the quantum well while simultaneously eliminating the need for p-type contacts and allowing efficient current spreading. By preventing electron overshoot past quantum wells, it disables carrier recombination in undesired regions of the quantized heterostructures and opens up the possibility for new geometries of integrating and stacking multiple light emitters. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Electric fields; Heterojunctions; Light emission; Nitrides; Polarization; Quantum theory; Semiconductor doping; Tunnel junctions; Carrier recombination; Electrons and holes; Induced electric fields; Internal polarization fields; Inversion symmetry; Nitride semiconductors; Polarization control; Quantum well heterostructures; Semiconductor quantum wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066793848

Ecological problems of the contemporary economy combined with perspectives of resources exhaustion, as well as the need to follow sustainable rules of living, require the search for new fuels. Fuels which can assure their availability and good environmental performance are needed for maintaining sustainable transportation. Knowledge about the behavior of various fuels is necessary for realistic methods of technology management in transportation means and the fuel industry. This paper describes biofuels that can be an addition to petrol or can exist as standalone fuels. A simulation was carried out on an urban vehicle and the tested fuels were petrol 95, ethanol, methanol, and dimethyl ether. For the selected engine a simulation corresponding to that of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test was created using the Scilab package. Based on this simulation, values of carbon dioxide and water vapor emission were determined. The fuel demand for each fuel mixture and the amount of air for the fuels used were also calculated (and verified on the basis of laboratory tests). It was demonstrated that addition of biofuel decreases emission of carbon dioxide, simultaneously increasing emission of water vapor. Biofuel additive also caused an increase in fuel consumption. Unfortunately, in the New European Driving Cycle test being investigated, carbon dioxide emissions in all cases exceeded the permissible level of 130 g CO2/km, which is bad news in the context of the further tightening of norms and standards. The simulation tests confirmed that when using the start/stop system and applying specific additives, the carbon dioxide emission decreases and the consumption of mixtures with the activated start/stop system is smaller. The analyzed problems and results of this analysis become more important in light of the Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) standard, which became binding from September 2018 and applies to the sale of cars that had been approved prior (in accordance with the New European Driving Cycle standard). Although the NEDC standard appears obsolete the computer model simulating this type of test will be necessary in many cases. It is, however, needed and possible to develop a similar simulation procedure for WLTP tests. © 2019 by the authors.","Biofuels; Emission standards; Exhaust emission; Fuel production management; Simulation; Vehicle test","biofuel; carbon emission; engine; exhaust emission; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; management practice; operations technology; simulation; testing method; transport vehicle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067075050

These snow-rich treeless ecosystems are affected by delayed snowmelt, causing shorter growing seasons. Snow-tolerant plants occupy the centre of subarctic snowpatches, whereas black spruce trees grow at the margins. Snowpatches have shown sporadic expansion and shrinkage phases from tree establishment and mortality linked to climatic trends. Field surveys in the subarctic of eastern Canada are showing an afforestation process occurring in snowpatches. The origin and nature of this afforestation were investigated based on the hypothesis that tree colonization and growth were closely associated with recent changes in climate. Snowpatches were categorized into three types based on border trees: forested, semi-forested and tundra-like. In eight randomly selected snowpatches of each type, snowpatch borders and areas covered by deciduous shrubs or trees were mapped and chionophilous plants and frost-associated soil disturbances were recorded. Radial (tree-ring) and vertical growth were measured on stems to evaluate the impact of climate and local factors on snowpatch black spruce populations. Two waves of spruce colonization occurred in all forested and semi-forested snowpatches in the 1960s and in the 1980s to present. Spruce establishment was more frequent and abundant in recent years, near the forest margins and on moss and barren seedbeds. Expanding shrub (dwarf birch) cover inhibited spruce seedling establishment. Tree establishment and growth were positively correlated with growing season temperature and negatively correlated with annual maximum snow depth. More recently established spruce seedlings exhibited faster vertical growth than those established in the 20th century. Synthesis. Due to warmer conditions and earlier snowmelt in eastern Canada, black spruce trees and dwarf birch shrubs are racing through subarctic snowpatches. This afforestation could change biodiversity in the subarctic and affect watershed dynamics through a change in snowmelt pattern. Subarctic snowpatches are climate-sensitive ecosystems of the forest–tundra landscape, forming ideal biotopes for snow-tolerant, arctic–alpine species. Further tree encroachment in snowpatches in this century is potentially a threat to plant diversity, especially chionophilous species that have no corridors to migrate towards arctic ecosystems. © 2018 The Authors.

It was hypothesized that the carbon footprint of Finger Lakes wines would be lower than that of wines from other regions, based on winery practices and climate conditions. Primary data was collected from three wineries representing a range of production volumes, and sensitivity analyses were also performed. Bottle production contributed the most to the impacts of the wine. Impacts associated with cultivation were highest for the winery with the smallest production volume. The cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions for the three case studies ranged from 0.617 to 1.03 kg CO2eq bottle-1. These results suggest that wines from these three Finger Lakes wineries have among the lowest carbon footprints of wines globally (which range from 0.68 to 2.68 kg CO2eq bottle-1), promoting the need to assess the impacts of other wineries in this wine region. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; Finger Lakes; Life cycle assessment; New York State; Wine","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; cultivation; life cycle analysis; sensitivity analysis; wine; wine industry; Finger Lakes; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067128648

Adaptation is the predominant practice that farming communities undertake to deal with these climate-induced challenges. While significant attention has been devoted to farmers’ adaptation strategies, little is known about how innovative practices are associated with the improvement of rural livelihoods. To address this gap, the paper attempts to investigate how farmers lead the process of rural innovations that constitute successful forms of adaptation to address the mixed impacts of dyke policies and climate change in two distinct agro-ecological zones (i.e. flooding and salinity) in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Drawing on qualitative information collected from focus group discussions and interviews across the case studies, the paper argues that farmers are the key innovation actors who contribute to improving rural farming and water management practices. The study suggests that the evolution of farmer-led innovations is mainly attributed to the operation of various informal learning networks that provide important platforms for the generation and diffusion of effective innovative practices across farming communities. It also highlights how farmers contribute their innovative knowledge to local adaptation policies. From the policy perspective, this study sees the development of rural innovation systems as the best practices of farmers’ adaptation, which needs to be scaled out to better support agricultural water management in the delta. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Floods; Rural innovations; Salinity intrusion; Vietnamese Mekong Delta; Water management","Climate change; Developing countries; Floods; Rural areas; Water management; Adaptation; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural water management; Agro-ecological zones; Management practices; Mekong Delta; Qualitative information; Salinity intrusion; Agriculture; adaptive management; best management practice; climate change; developing world; empirical analysis; flood; flooding; local adaptation; management practice; saline intrusion; strategic approach; water management; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061195765

As self-identified pioneers of deep decarbonization, the CNCA members are constructing ideas about what carbon neutral means and how urban systems should be changed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, climate governance policy documents provide a window to understand how these carbon neutral imaginaries are being constructed. The analysis draws on discourse analysis and textual network analysis to unpack the sociotechnical configurations that are planned to be mobilized to constitute carbon neutral built environments. Concept map visualizations are used to scrutinize planned configurations of objects (e.g. solar photovoltaics, district energy and energy efficiency technology) and policy instruments (e.g. energy use benchmarking and urban planning tools). The analysis shows three key building and energy configurations: (1) The District Energy City, (2) The Zero Net Energy City and (3) The Natural Gas Transition City. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that urban imaginaries of carbon neutrality are incorporating complex configurations of socio-technical objects while, at the same time, distinct socio-technical configurations are being favoured in individual places. These configurations inform socio-technical imaginaries that will continue to drive policy outcomes over time. © The Author(s) 2018.","Carbon neutral; cities; climate change; governance; mitigation","carbon emission; climate change; conceptual framework; emission control; environmental policy; governance approach; greenhouse gas; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049689556

Public health professionals play an important role in prevention and control of the disease. This study aimed to explore dengue control and prevention in the context of climate change in China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 630 public health professionals in 2015. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results: More than 80% of participants from southwest and central China believed climate change would affect dengue. However, participants from northeast China were less likely to believe so (65%). Sixty-nine percent of participants in Yunnan perceived that dengue had emerged/re-emerged in recent years, compared with 40.6% in Henan and 23.8% in Liaoning. Less than 60% of participants thought current prevention and control programs had been effective. Participants believed mosquitoes in high abundance, imported cases and climate change were main risk factors for dengue in China. Conclusion: There were varying views of dengue in China. Professionals in areas susceptible to dengue were more likely to be concerned about climate change and dengue. Current prevention and control strategies need to be improved.

This study is the first to thoroughly examine publicly reported green bond proceeds allocations from 53 organizations to projects and assets throughout 96 countries from 2008 to 2017. Green bond markets are growing rapidly, and yearly proceeds allocation trends reveal increasing disbursements to renewable energy, clean water, low-carbon transportation, and other Paris Agreement and SDG-related investment categories. Circle plot analysis reveals unique allocation trends to specific green sectors at both regional and national levels. International finance institutions allocated the largest share of proceeds by both frequency and volume, and the projects and assets financed with green bonds in this study sample are associated with over 108 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in greenhouse gas emissions reductions and over 1500 gigawatts in renewable energy capacity.

In this study, temporal and spatial variations in air quality in Beijing are characterised by two aggregate indexes, the air pollution index (API) and air quality index (AQI). API is calculated from PM 10 , SO 2 , and NO 2 to indicate air quality before 2013. From then on, API was replaced with AQI, which is calculated from PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , O 3 , and CO. API decreased significantly during 2001–2017, and AQI decreased significantly during 2013–2017 (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, these two indexes were negatively correlated to tree cover ratio and positively correlated to energy consumption intensity. In terms of seasonal characteristics, API was highest in spring and lowest in summer, reflecting trends in natural emission sources. AQI was highest in winter and lowest in summer, primarily due to anthropogenic emissions resulting from heating demand and industrial production. Regarding spatial variability, air quality reflects the differences in the different functional zones in Beijing, likely due to the different land-use composition and structure as well as the energy consumption intensity. Moreover, population and automobile density also played a role in the differences in air quality status. Our results indicate that, while air quality in Beijing has improved, seasonal effects, land use, automobile density and emission intensity are major factors that continue to influence air quality. Therefore, further improvements in Beijing's air quality should take seasonality, urbanized land optimization and major pollutant sources into account when developing future emission-reduction policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions regulations; Land-use change; Particulate matters; Sustainable development; Urban air quality","Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Sustainable development; Emission reduction policies; Emissions regulations; Energy consumption intensity; Land-use change; Particulate Matter; Seasonal characteristics; Temporal and spatial variation; Urban air quality; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental issue; land use change; particulate matter; spatial variation; sustainable development; temporal variation; urban region; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060338779

This work is focused on evaluating the effects of hydrothermal aging on the TWC in a passive SCR system. Two catalysts were studied: a Pd-TWC, and a NOX storage and reduction (NSR) TWC. Samples were aged at 920 °C for 100 h using a four-mode hydrothermal aging procedure. This causes the catalyst to be oxidized and reduced, as it would in a real system. The effects of aging were evaluated using simulated exhaust under both steady state and lean-rich cycling conditions. Hydrothermal aging caused significant changes in catalyst activity, leading to a decrease in low temperature conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) and propane (C3H8) on both catalysts, and degradation of oxygen storage and NOX storage components. However, the catalysts maintained their activity for NOX conversion and NH3 production, showing sufficient activity for the operation of a passive SCR with an optimum projected fuel consumption of 92–98% compared to stoichiometric operation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrothermal aging; Passive selective catalytic reduction; Three-way catalyst","Ammonia; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Gasoline; Temperature; Cycling conditions; Gasoline exhausts; Hydrothermal aging; Hydrothermal degradation; Lean burn gasoline engine; Low temperature conversions; NOx storage and reduction; Three way catalysts; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057087238

These critically important forests are already often overexploited and could be at risk from future climate change. In order to investigate the combined effects of climate and human disturbances on the growth of pine forests, we established a new network of tree-ring sites in six Pinus wallichiana and four P. roxburghii forests across the dry inner valleys of eastern Nepal's Koshi River watershed. We produced measurements of total annual ring widths, and detrended individual tree-ring series with 67% cubic splines to produce site-level chronologies. The Koshi tree-ring chronologies were compared against local records of mean monthly temperature and total monthly rainfall to identify the main climatic factor(s) limiting pine growth. We also employed a relative growth change method to estimate growth releases and suppressions in ring-width series as indicators of disturbances. At all sites, trees are relatively young (median age was 102 years) and variations in ring-width provide estimates of tree growth over only the past century. Ring-width chronologies from the Koshi have a weak common signal strength in comparison to trees from the same species obtained from sites in the central Himalaya, and the climate-growth response of Koshi pines appears to be governed primarily by moisture balance during winter. Disturbance events evident in pine ring-width data are largely asynchronous, which suggests these forest have been historically perturbed by human influences rather than large-scale climatic or ecological influences. The sacred forest at Sikri contained the oldest living trees (118 years), had the lowest number of disturbance events, and preserved a stronger common signal, which provided additional evidence of the effects of humans on other pine forests in the Koshi basin. Based on our findings, we suggest that modeling the future growth and distribution of pine trees in eastern Nepal should consider winter moisture. Furthermore, management strategies to better conserve pine forests in eastern Nepal should incorporate the two competing influences of climate and human activities on tree growth. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Human disturbances; Koshi River watershed; Pine forests; Winter moisture","Climate change; Landforms; Moisture; Rivers; Watersheds; Annual ring width; Human disturbances; Management strategies; Moisture balance; Monthly rainfalls; Pine forest; River watersheds; Tree-ring chronologies; Forestry; anthropogenic effect; chronology; climate change; coniferous forest; detection method; disturbance; future prospect; growth response; risk assessment; tree ring; valley; watershed; Forestry; Forests; Growth; Moisture; Pinus; Rings; Rivers; Trees; Himalayas; Kosi River; Nepal; Pinus wallichiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062653890

With anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions, CO2 availability is and has been increasing since the last glacial maximum. Simultaneously water availability is expected to decrease and the frequency and severity of drought episodes to increase in large parts of the world. How plants respond to these two changes will help in understanding plants’ responses to climate of the future. Here we sought to understand how drought affects plant traits responses to CO2 and whether there are trade-offs in responsiveness to low and elevated CO2 and drought. We grew seedlings of seven C3 annuals at past low (160 μl l−1), ambient (450 μl l−1) and elevated (750 μl l−1) CO2. At each concentration plants were subjected to well-watered conditions (100% soil water availability, SWA), 40% SWA or 20% SWA. We measured biomass allocation, relative growth rate, tissue N concentration, and gas exchange. Compared to well-watered conditions plant size was an important element in the absolute response to SWA decrease, i.e. the smaller, slow growing species were unaffected by drought at low CO2. Plants allocated less mass to root tissue at low CO2 contrasting with increased root mass fraction at lower SWA at ambient CO2. Across all traits measured, we found mostly additive effects of CO2 and water. As due to climate change regions become more drought prone these results suggest CO2 fertilization will not counteract the effects of reduced water availability. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Annual C3 herbs; Biomass allocation; Drought; Elevated CO2; Gas exchange; Growth; Plant traits","biomass allocation; carbon dioxide; climate change; drought; gas exchange; growth; growth rate; herb; Last Glacial Maximum; water availability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056991422

ND's oil and gas producers can fund this black into green (BIG) transition by: first, investing a fraction of their revenues into wind energy farms; and second, reinvesting a portion of revenues from the wind-generated electricity. Over a period of 40 years, 100% of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and consumption of ND's oil and gas could be offset with an investment of 10% of both hydrocarbons’ value and a reinvestment of three cents per kilowatt-hour of wind-generated electricity. At the end of the 40-year period, the resultant 155-gigawatt wind farm would have offset 13.4 × 109 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and cost $9.90/ton of offset carbon dioxide equivalent.

Whether the relative amount of these redox-active functional groups involved in redox cycles is associated with the overall chemical structures of HS still remains poorly understood. In this study, variations in the reducing capacities (RCs) of HSs extracted from paddy soils were monitored over consecutive cycles of reduction by iron-reducing microorganisms and oxidation by O2. Our results show that about 10–40% of the microbially reduced redox-active moieties within HS, which were reoxidised by O2, cannot restore the same redox state as those before microbial reduction. The restoration extents of RCs of HSs after microbial reduction and O2 reoxidation were greatly negatively correlated with average molecular weight (AMW). The microbially reduced HSs having large AMWs (&gt;1,000 Da) were more kinetically difficult to restore by O2 from a reduced state to an oxidised state than were those having small AMWs (&lt;1,000 Da) possibly because the former, which underwent process of microbial reduction and O2 reoxidation, were more easily sheltered by other parts of HS structures than were the latter. Nevertheless, the unsheltered redox-active groups that accounted for about 50–85% in HSs can be fully reversible and sustainable to switch between a reduced state and an oxidised state over successive redox cycles. Our results can help to understand the redox dynamics of HSs in biogeochemical cycles in environments. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","humic substances; microbial reduction; molecular weight; redox cycling; reoxidation by O2","Biogeochemistry; Microorganisms; Molecular weight; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Restoration; Average molecular weight; Biogeochemical cycle; Humic substances; Microbial reduction; Molecular weight dependent; Re-oxidation; Redox active groups; Redox cycling; Hydraulic structures; anoxic conditions; biogeochemical cycle; humic substance; iron-reducing bacterium; oxic conditions; oxygen; paddy field; redox conditions; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063981221

In this study, we isolated a yellow green leaf 14 (ygl14) mutant from Xinong 1B, an indica restorer line of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which was treated with ethyl methane sulfonate. The mutant not only showed a yellow-green leaf phenotype for the entire life cycle, the flag leaf is significantly longer and the total leaf area is increased, which resulted in an increase in photosynthetic area. Leaf pigment (chlorophyll and carotenoids) contents were significantly lower in ygl14 than those in the wild type (WT). Compared with WT, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate of ygl14 were significantly reduced, whereas the intercellular CO2 concentration was significantly increased. Anatomical observation revealed that a portion of the chloroplasts in mesophyll cells of ygl14 were structurally impaired compared with those of WT. YGL14 was fine-mapped to a 70.7 kb region on chromosome 5, covered includes 15 open reading frames, no other yellow-green leaf related mutants have ever been reported within this region in rice. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of genes associated with chlorophyll metabolism and photosynthesis were significantly altered in the ygl14 mutant.

Mitigation measures to counter the exponential growth and harmful impact of these gases on the environment require techniques for the reduction and capturing of carbon. Oxy-fuel combustion is one such effective method, which is used for the carbon capture. In the present work, a numerical study was carried out to analyze characteristics of oxy-fuel combustion inside a porous plate reactor. The advantage of incorporating porous plates is to control local oxy-fuel ratio and to avoid hot spots inside the reactor. A modified two-steps reaction kinetics model was incorporated in the simulation for modeling of methane air-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion. Simulations were performed for different oxidizer ratios, mass flow rates, and reactor heights. Results showed that that oxy-combustion with an oxidizer ratio (OR) of 0.243 could have the same adiabatic flame temperature as that of air-combustion. It was found that not only does OR need to be changed, but also flow field or reactor dimensions should be changed to achieve similar combustion characteristics as that of air-combustion. Fifty percent higher mass flow rates or 40% reduction in reactor height may achieve comparable outlet temperature to air-combustion. It was concluded that not only does the oxidizer ratio of oxy-combustion need to be changed, but the velocity field is also required to be matched with air-combustion to attain similar outlet temperature. © 2019 by the authors.","CFD; Methane; Oxidizer ratio; Oxy-fuel combustion; Porous plate reactor","Adiabatic flame temperature; Air; Computational fluid dynamics; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Mass transfer; Methane; Reaction kinetics; Velocity; Combustion characteristics; Laminar combustion; Methane-air combustion; Mitigation measures; Oxidizer ratio; Oxyfuel combustion; Performance analysis; Reaction kinetics models; Porous plates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065864573

However, at higher levels it maybe toxic adversely affecting plant growth and forage quality. Plant boron concentration is affected by different parameters including boron fertilization, soil, climate, plant species, etc. A new era in the field of plant fertilization is the use of nano technology. Accordingly, a factorial field experiment on the basis of a complete block design in six replicates was conducted in a 300-hactare agro-industry area. The objectives were to investigate the effects of different boron treatments on alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.): 1) boron concentration, and 2) pigment contents including chlorophyll a, b, total, and carotenoids. Six regions with different properties were selected for the experiment; the soil samples were collected using GPS. The experimental treatments including: 1) soil type (S1-S6), 2) boron sources including boric acid (B1) and nano boron fertilization (B2), and 3) number of spraying (zero-, one-, two-, and three-time) were tested. The nano structure of boric acid-copper in an aqueous medium was produced using the chemical reduction method. The results indicated that soil type, boron source and number of spraying significantly affected (P ≤ 0.01) alfalfa boron concentration and pigment content. The mean of alfalfa boron concentration by B1 and B2 was 103.52 and 111.52% higher than control. The three-time spraying significantly increased B concentration related to the other spraying treatments (P ≤ 0.05) as it resulted in a 207.81% increase compared with the control treatment. The three-time spraying resulted in the highest increase of pigment contents (P ≤ 0.05) including chlorophyll a, b, total, and carotenoids compared with the other treatments. Although the highest boron and pigment contents were resulted by the three-time spraying, the combined use of B2 and the two-time spraying was the most optimum treatment (non-toxic) significantly increasing alfalfa boron and pigment contents (P ≤ 0.05). It would be possible to produce alfalfa at large amounts and with suitable forage quality using boron nano fertilization (synthesized and tested in this research work) under calcareous conditions. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.); Boric acid; Boron nano fertilization; Calcareous soils; Plant pigments","boric acid; boron; carotenoid; chlorophyll a; chlorophyll b; copper; nanomaterial; boron; fertilizer; nanoparticle; alfalfa; aqueous solution; Article; calcareous soil; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; fertilization; nonhuman; pigmentation; priority journal; soil; soil analysis; soil property; alfalfa; chemistry; drug effect; soil; Boron; Fertilizers; Medicago sativa; Nanoparticles; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062609109

The solutions analyzed include Stop/Start, vehicle mass reduction up to 100 kg, drag coefficient reduction, as well as SCR and Lean NO x Trap systems. For this purpose, a reference EURO 6 diesel vehicle was monitored under real-world driving conditions with a PEMS and the experimental data obtained allowed building engine maps of fuel use and NO x emission to be used on AVL Cruise software. The results obtained with Cruise were firstly validated with the experimental data (with errors up to 10,6% on fuel and 17,5% on NOx) and then the solutions implemented were tested individually and simulated on 48 real-world driving cycles. The results pointed to Stop/Start, mass reduction of 100 kg and SCR as the most effective solutions in reducing fuel consumption and NO x emission up to 14,6% and 57,5%, respectively, depending on driving context. The combination of these technologies was tested and the results showed maximum fuel savings of 17% on urban context and a maximum reduction of 58% on NO x on combined driving cycles.

The challenge lies in the optimization of the morphology to maximize the CO selectivity. We developed a 3D mass transport model utilizing the accurate electrode geometry to calculate local concentration distributions of CO2(aq), OH-, HCO3-, and CO32- by considering the buffer reactions in the electrolyte and modeling local catalytic surface reaction rates based on Butler-Volmer correlations. Validated with experimental data from the literature, the model predicted the suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction with an inverse dependency on the hydroxide concentration and the promotion of the CO evolution reaction with a proportional dependency on the carbonate concentration. In order to increase the CO selectivity, we developed design guidelines that suggest high electrode roughness per film thickness, which translates to smaller pore size in practice. Further, the shallow pores of the electrode strongly reduced the overall CO selectivity as the mass transport to the bulk was non-limiting. We demonstrated that the introduction of an additional diffusion layer on top of the silver electrode can enhance the CO selectivity from as low as 39% to more than 90%. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Inverse problems; Morphology; Pore size; Reaction rates; Surface reactions; Carbon dioxide conversions; Carbonate concentrations; Concentration distributions; Electrode geometries; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Hydroxide concentration; Mass transport model; Reaction selectivity; Catalyst selectivity; carbon dioxide; carbonate; concentration (composition); diffusion; electrode; electrolyte; film; fuel; geometry; mass transport; optimization; roughness; silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065969947

Box 14100, Aalto, 00076, Finland","Offshore wind power development is expected to play an important role in meeting the EU climate targets. To integrate offshore wind power, advanced offshore infrastructures such as meshed grids are suggested to optimise the grid development. Meshed offshore grids refer to integrated offshore infrastructure where offshore wind power hubs are interconnected to several countries as opposed to radial connection linking the wind farm to one single country and market. However, development of meshed architectures is hindered by the legal and regulatory barriers. Earlier research has identified the lack of cooperation and misalignments in national legal and regulatory frameworks as being the main risk factors in integrated offshore network investments. The purpose of this article is to investigate whether a supra-national TSO could facilitate regional cooperation and coordinated investments to develop meshed offshore grids. Several studies have discussed the case of North Seas, but the Baltic Sea region has had less attention despite the large offshore wind development potential. In this paper, a multi-disciplinary approach combining legal dogmatics and regulatory economics is used to identify the existing barriers and the possible solutions. The Baltic Sea countries are used as illustration. We suggest legal and regulatory recommendations that comply with the EU energy policy targets of sustainability, competition and reliability. © 2019 The Authors","Electricity market legislation; Meshed offshore grid; Network regulation; Offshore wind power; Supra-national TSO","Commerce; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Investments; Laws and legislation; Offshore oil well production; Development potential; Legal and regulatory frameworks; Meshed offshore grid; Multi-disciplinary approach; Network regulation; Off-shore wind power; Offshore infrastructure; Supra-national TSO; Offshore wind farms; alternative energy; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; European Union; legislation; offshore application; resource development; wind power; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061152544

Unfortunately, these services are largely undervalued, and the potential of urban areas themselves to mitigate future climate change has received little attention. In this study, we quantified and mapped city-wide aboveground carbon storage of urban green spaces in China's capital, Beijing, using field survey data of diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height from 326 field survey plots, combined with satellite-derived vegetation index at a fine resolution of 6 m. We estimated the total amount of carbon stored in the urban green spaces to be 956.3 Gg (1 Gg = 10 9 g) in 2014. There existed great spatial heterogeneity in vegetation carbon density varying from 0 to 68.1 Mg C ha -1 , with an average density of 7.8 Mg C ha −1 . As expected, carbon density tended to decrease with urban development intensity (UDI). Likely being affected by vegetation cover proportion and configuration of green space patches, large differences were presented between the 95th and 5th quantile carbon density for each UDI bin, showing great potential for carbon sequestration. However, the interquartile range of carbon density narrowed drastically when UDI reached 60%, signifying a threshold for greatly reduced carbon sequestration potentials for higher UDI. These findings suggested that urban green spaces have great potential to make contribution to mitigating against future climate change if we plan and design urban green spaces following the trajectory of high carbon density, but we should be aware that such potential will be very limited when the urban development reaches certain intensity threshold. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon stock; landscape structure; spatial distribution; threshold; urban ecosystems; urbanization intensity","aboveground production; carbon sequestration; climate change; greenspace; landscape structure; spatial distribution; threshold; urban area; urban development; urban ecosystem; urbanization; vegetation cover; Beijing [China]; China; carbon; carbon sequestration; China; climate change; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; physiology; tree; urbanization; Beijing; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environment Design; Environmental Monitoring; Trees; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060629743

Estimating the TE concentrations of these waste streams is essential to selecting pollution controls and estimating emission reduction benefits. This work introduces a generalizable mass balance model for estimating TE mass flow rates in CFPP waste streams and evaluates model accuracy for the U.S. coal fleet given current data constraints. We stochastically estimate, using a bootstrapping approach, the 2015 plant-level mass flow rates of Hg, Se, As, and Cl to solid, liquid, and gas phase waste streams by combining publicly available data for combusted coal TE concentrations with estimates of TE partitioning within installed air pollution control processes. When compared with measured and reported data on TE mass flow rates, this model generally overestimates masses by 30-50%, with larger errors for Hg. The partitioning estimates are consistent for Se, As, and Cl removal from flue gas, but tend to underestimate Hg removal. While our model is suitable for first-order estimates of TE mass flows, future work to improve model performance should focus on collecting and using new data on TE concentrations in the coal blend, where data quality is the weakest. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Chlorine; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Emission control; Flow rate; Fossil fuel power plants; Mass transfer; Trace elements; Coal-fired power plant; Current data; Data quality; Emission reduction; Mass balance model; Mass flow rate; Model accuracy; Model performance; River pollution; atmospheric pollution; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); industrial waste; mass balance; mass transport; model; partitioning; pollutant removal; pollution control; trace element; United States; coal; trace element; air pollutant; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; Air Pollutants; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Power Plants; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066125546

This study builds on these efforts by assessing the model skill score relative to a new salinity climatology. The new climatology averages the original observational data of the World Ocean Database directly onto the CESM ocean component tracer grid cells without spatial interpolation, smoothing, or other gap-filling techniques to mitigate coastal ocean salinity bias present in the World Ocean Atlas. The mean square error for coastal upper ocean salinity relative to climatology is reduced by up to 14%, and the mean square error of near-surface salinity stratification is reduced by up to 28% near major river mouths in the simulations with improved treatments of river runoff. The improvement in upper ocean bulk salinity is attributed primarily to focusing runoff as point sources thereby avoiding the artificial horizontal spreading of the control run and to applying a locally varying instead of a global constant reference salinity for riverine virtual salt fluxes. The improvements in near-surface salinity stratification are primarily attributed to adding parameterized estuarine mixing with the estuary box model. Salinity and salinity stratification skill improvements are achieved not just near large rivers but also along the global coast and skill improvements extend far offshore. Despite these improvements, many other sources of model-climatology mismatch in coastal salinity and stratification remain and merit further attention. ©2019.

Using current panel cointegration approaches, our study examines the interaction between trade and an environmental pollution proxy of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by integrating economic growth and energy usage as major potential determining factors in this relationship for 49 high-emission countries in Belt and Road regions over the period of 1991-2014. For a robust analysis, we further grouped these countries into income panels (high, middle, low) and various regions (East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, the Middle East/Africa, and Europe). The results of the panel cointegration tests revealed that the four variables were stationary in the long run. Similarly, our panel results indicated that trade openness had both positive and negative impacts on environmental pollution, but the effect varied in these different groups of nations. The results of the vector error correction model (VECM) causality also showed a long-run causal effect between trade, economic growth, energy consumption, and environmental pollution in the Belt and Road, Europe, high-income, middle-income, and low-income panels. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) results further indicated the existence of an inverted U-form relationship between trade and carbon emissions.

Herein, we prepared an electroless high-phosphorus Ni-P coating and, for the first time, systematically explored the underlying mechanism of the interfacial process in applying Ni-P coating to protect pipeline steel that transports impure SC CO 2 . It is found that, benefiting from the formation of a protective surface film, Ni-P coating significantly mitigates the corrosion effects from SC CO 2 and impurities (e.g., O 2 and NO 2 ), especially the synergistic effect of impurities. Concurrently, it effectively avoids the localized corrosion resulting from nonuniform adsorption of the aqueous phase. Although O 2 and NO 2 can degrade the coating through boosting water precipitation, deteriorating the water chemistry, and reducing the surface film protectiveness, the corrosion inhibition efficiency of Ni-P coating is invariably higher than 80%, independent of the varying causticity of SC CO 2 streams, demonstrating that the coating has a superior stability toward corrosion attack. The as-prepared Ni-P coating undoubtedly holds great potential as an alternative for corrosion control of CO 2 transport pipeline in the CCS industry.

Literature suggests that green space within 500 m of home is often used to represent neighborhood suitable for walking, air pollution and noise reduction, and natural healing. In this paper, we used satellite data of different spatial resolutions to derive normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator of surface greenness, at buffer distances of 50, 100, 250 and 500 m. Data included those of 2 m spatial resolution from WorldView2, 5 m resolution from RapidEye and 30 m resolution from Landsat. We found that, after radiometric calibrations, the RapidEye and WorldView2 sensors had similar NDVI values, while Landsat imagery tended to have greater NDVI; however, these sensors showed similar vegetation distribution: locations high in vegetation cover being high in NDVI, and vice versa. We linked the green space estimates to a health survey, and identified that higher NDVI values were significantly associated with better health outcomes. We further investigated the impacts of buffer size and sensor spatial resolution on identified associations between NDVI and health outcomes. Overall, the identified health outcomes were similar across sensors of different spatial resolutions, but a mean trend was identified in bigger buffer size being associated with greater health outcome. © 2019 The Authors","Barcelona; Buffer distance; Health outcomes; LandSat; Normalized difference vegetation index; RapidEye; Spatial resolution; WorldView2","Image resolution; Noise abatement; Remote sensing; Surveys; Vegetation; Barcelona; Buffer distance; Health outcomes; LANDSAT; Normalized difference vegetation index; Rapideye; Spatial resolution; Worldview-2; Health; greenspace; health status; Landsat; NDVI; RapidEye; remote sensing; satellite data; spatial resolution; urban area; WorldView; adult; aged; Article; behavior; calibration; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data analysis; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental parameters; female; geography; green space; health status; human; image quality; male; mental health; normalized difference vegetation index; physical activity; priority journal; radiometry; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; vegetation; adolescent; demography; environment; health survey; middle aged; public health; young adult; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Environment; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Public Health; Remote Sensing Technology; Residence Characteristics; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061783841

Samples of particulate matter (PM) were collected in the town of Napajedla (South-eastern Czech Republic) in 2016. The industrial sector of the town is represented by plastics processing and manufacturing, as well as by mechanical engineering. Analytical technique of pyrolysis chromatography with mass spectroscopy detection was employed to identify organic species in the PM 10 fraction. Two datasets (465 determined organic compounds and 50 selected organic markers) were used and compared by multivariate analysis – principal component analysis followed with hierarchical clustering on principal components incorporating compositional data approach. Three resulting clusters were observed in both cases. The cluster representing measurements near plastic processing and manufacturing plants was identical in both the analysed datasets with the same organic compounds that characterized resulting cluster Consequently, leading markers for plastic processing and manufacturing sources were suggested (bumetrizole, bis(tridecyl)phthalate, mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate). Other two clusters varied among the analysed datasets, however, dataset with selected markers showed more reliable outcomes. The results imply that concept of using only selected organic marker species with the compositional approach in multivariate statistical methods is sufficient and allows properly distinguishing the main air pollution sources between sampling locations even at a small urban scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Hierarchical clustering on principal components; Organic markers; Plastic plant; Principal component analysis","bis(tridecyl)phthalate; bumetrizole; organic compound; phthalic acid; phthalic acid 2 ethylhexyl monoester; plastic; unclassified drug; atmospheric pollution; biomarker; cluster analysis; data set; multivariate analysis; organic compound; particulate matter; plastic waste; pollution monitoring; principal component analysis; source identification; statistical analysis; air pollution; Article; city; cluster analysis; Czech Republic; engineering; hierarchical clustering on principal; mass spectrometry; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; plastic industry; principal component analysis; pyrolysis mass spectrometry; sampling; statistical analysis; urban area; air pollutant; Czech Republic; environmental monitoring; multivariate analysis; Czech Republic; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Czech Republic; Environmental Monitoring; Multivariate Analysis; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062616947

This article proposes a community-directed approach, the Resilient Communities and Livelihoods Asset Integration Model (ReCLAIM) to achieve low-carbon development in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The design of the model is outlined, along with the results of applying the first step of the model, an asset and aspirations identification workshop, with two remote Indigenous communities in Australia. The results of the first workshop indicate that residents in these communities are already applying efficiency, resource-sharing and other strategies to limit resource use. Therefore, the focus in these communities should be on assisting and enhancing outcomes of these endogenous strategies, rather than the behaviour change approach that has often been applied within low-carbon programmes. Behavioural efficiency measures alone will also provide little impact, without commensurate changes to building design and energy supply systems. Both communities had a diversity of assets to employ towards mitigation strategies and development aspirations, although deficiencies in funding, resourcing and long-term working partnerships were also identified. Selection criteria to screen potential strategies were developed from workshop responses, and the process would be applicable to similar communities, globally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aboriginal; Behaviour change; Community development; Decision-support; Participatory; Sustainable Development Goals","carbon; Article; behavior change; biodiversity; building; climate change; community; community integration; community program; decision support system; economic development; ecosystem resilience; energy resource; environmental impact; funding; government; human; human experiment; indigenous people; priority journal; productivity; public policy; resilient communities and livelihoods asset integration model; resource allocation; workshop",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061525695

Energy is the raw material needed to power the engine of economic development for any country in the world. Today it is worldwide recognized that using nonrenewable sources is changing the Earth's climate in a negative direction. Given these climate-change threats, renewable energies appear to be the wave of the future. European States, including Romania, introduced programs for limiting CO2 emissions and supporting renewable energy development. Renewable based power plants, such as photovoltaic (PV), wind and biomass have flourished all over Europe and around the world. New interconnections requirements for utility-connected power plants based on renewable sources are coming into force in European countries, responsible for supporting the grid operation and stability. This paper presents an example of technical compliance certification test procedure of non-dispatchable utility photovoltaic power plants. The mandatory technical conditions and the tests carried out in order to certify technical compliance with national regulations are describe and illustrate.

Criteria to assess governance legitimacy were compiled from scientific literature and compared with those adopted by international indigenous rights agreements. The extent to which these criteria were met and how they were implemented in two indigenous communities in the Yucatan Peninsula was assessed through documents and interviews analyses. Results show that, despite the progress that Mexico's consultation protocol represents, it did not include an intra-community representation criterion; transparency, accountability and deliberation criteria were not completely reached in practice; there was discordance between official and local participants' understanding of consultation objectives; and no agreement or consent were sought from the participants.

The management goal involved maximizing potential water availability, understood as the maximum volume of water supplied at a certain point of the river network that satisfies a defined demand, and taking into account specified reliability requirements. We focused on potential water availability for agriculture and assumed two types of demands: urban supply and irrigation. If potential water availability was not enough to satisfy all irrigation demands, management measures were applied aiming at achieving a compromise solution between resources and demands. The methodological approach consisted of estimation and comparison of runoff for current and future period under climate change effects, calculation of water availability changes due to changes in runoff, and evaluation of the adaptation choices that can modify the distribution of water availability, under climate change. Adaptation choices include modifying water allocation to agriculture, increasing the reservoir storage capacity, improving the efficiency of urban water use, and modifying water allocation to environmental flows. These management measures were evaluated at the desired points of the river network by applying the Water Availability and Adaptation Policy Analysis (WAAPA) model. We simulated the behavior of a set of reservoirs that supply water for a set of prioritized demands, complying with specified ecological flows and accounting for evaporation losses. We applied the methodology in six representative basins of southern Europe: Duero-Douro, Ebro, Guadalquivir, Po, Maritsa-Evros, and Struma-Strymon. While in some basins, such as the Ebro or Struma-Strymon, measures can significantly increase water availability and compensate for a fraction of water scarcity due to climate change, in other basins, like the Guadalquivir, water availability cannot be enhanced by applying the management measures analyzed, and irrigation water use will have to be reduced. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; Climate change; Southern Europe; WAAPA model; Water availability; Water management","Agriculture; Climate models; Irrigation; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Water management; Water supply; Climate change scenarios; Distribution of water; Methodological approach; Reliability requirements; Reservoir storage capacity; Southern Europe; Water availability; Water management strategies; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; river basin; strategic approach; water availability; water demand; water management; water supply; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066312037

Existing pheromone-based vehicle routing randomly assigns an alternative route to vehicles based on global distance and local pheromone intensity. Although urban congestion is reduced as vehicles are assigned paths with lower pheromone intensity, frequent stops due to numerous red signalized intersections within the paths can lead to high fuel consumption. To address this issue, a proactive Eco-friendly Pheromone-based Green Vehicle Routing (E-PGVR) strategy is proposed to prioritize the greener aspects of routing by reducing fuel consumption in addition to traffic congestion. First, paths with multiple green signalized intersections are assigned to increase the chance for vehicles to traverse multiple intersections with fewer stops, marking down fuel consumption. Second, the application of local dynamic information namely traffic light time, mean road speed, and predicted pheromone intensity encourages the implementation of a decentralized Hierarchical Multi-Agent Pheromone-based System (HMAPS). Third, a modified dynamic k-shortest path algorithm is proposed in the path assignment to reduce computational effort. Forth, Singapore traffic data that incorporates heterogeneous vehicle type is employed in the microscopic simulator (SUMO) to model real-world traffic scenario. Experiment results show that the proposed E-PGVR outperforms other approaches in reducing fuel consumption and CO2 by 21.2%, mean waiting time by 30.0%, number of congested roads by 56.9%, mean travel time by 26.3%, and increasing number of arrived vehicles by 45.5%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Green vehicle routing; Heterogeneous vehicle; Hierarchical multi-agent pheromone-based systems; Pheromone","Environmental protection; Fuels; Hierarchical systems; Motor transportation; Multi agent systems; Routing algorithms; Street traffic control; Traffic signs; Travel time; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Alternative routes; Computational effort; Heterogeneous vehicles; K-shortest path algorithms; Mean waiting time; Multi agent; Pheromone; Signalized intersection; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058968379

However, the contributions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission sources to NO3− in PM2.5 remain poorly constrained. This study measured nitrogen (N) isotopes of NO3− (hereafter as δ15N-NO3-) in PM2.5 collected at Beijing in 2014. We observed that δ15N-NO3- values in PM2.5 (−2.3‰ − 19.7‰; 7.3 ± 5.4‰ annually) were significantly higher in winter (11.9 ± 4.4‰) than in summer (2.2 ± 2.5‰). The δ15N differences between source NOx and NO3− in PM2.5 (hereafter as Δ values) were estimated by a computation module as 7.8 ± 2.2‰ − 10.4 ± 1.6‰ (8.8 ± 2.4‰). Using the Δ values and δ15N values of NOx from major fossil (coal combustion, vehicle exhausts) and non-fossil sources (biomass burning, microbial N cycle), contributions of major NOx sources to NO3− in PM2.5 were further estimated by the SIAR model. We found that seasonal variations of δ15N-NO3- values in PM2.5 of Beijing were mainly caused by those of NOx contributions from coal combustion (38 ± 10% in winter, 20 ± 9% in summer). Annually, NOx from coal combustion, vehicle exhausts, biomass burning, and microbial N cycle contributed 28 ± 12%, 29 ± 17%, 27 ± 15%, and 16 ± 7% to NO3− in PM2.5, respectively, showing actually comparable contributions between non-fossil NOx (43 ± 16%) and fossil NOx (57 ± 21%).

Here, ZIF-incorporated hybrid polymeric fibres have been fabricated by using a dual-phase electrospinning method. These are then transformed into Co3O4-nanoparticle-decorated porous N-doped carbon fibres (ZIF-Co3O4/NCF) through multi-step annealing treatment. The resultant ZIF-Co3O4/NCF is interweaved into a self-supported film and can be used as a bi-functional catalyst for catalysing oxygen reduction in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that ZIF-Co3O4/NCF displays a high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.813 V (vs. RHE) and an almost favourable four-electron reduction pathway in alkaline medium. ZIF-Co3O4/NCF catalyst only shows 4 mV negative shift of E1/2 after 5000 continuous CV cycles. In addition, the ZIF-Co3O4/NCF can be applied as the cathode catalyst of non-aqueous Li–O2 battery, exhibiting a remarkable ORR activity in LiPF6 contained 1,2-dimethoxyethane electrolyte.

The aim of this study was to characterize and compare soils from a mature Mediterranean olive (Olea europaea L.) orchard subjected to two different soil management systems (sustainable, S mng , and conventional, C mng ) for 18 years. Composite soil samples were analyzed qualitatively (pedological determinations) and quantitatively (soil C, N and pH). Bacterial metabolic activity and diversity were evaluated spectrophometrically by the Biolog® assay, while 16S-based metagenomics analysis was used to analyse the abundance of N-cycling bacteria. From the general analysis of the data obtained by the study of soil profiles and litter, C and N dynamics, and the genetic and functional diversity of soil bacteria, it emerged that the S mng system caused an improvement in soil organic matter in the topsoil layers, compared to the C mng system, with consequent increases in the abundance of soil N-cycling bacteria but without affecting the indices related to total bacterial metabolic activity and diversity. The results obtained could promote the development of new approaches for optimizing soil carbon cycling, managing nutrient transport, and sustaining and improving olive yield and quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","16S-based metagenomics analysis; Biolog® assay; C/N ratios; Soil bacterial communities; Soil profiles and litter; Sustainable soil management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060858458

In Myanmar, poor regulation and unsustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is affecting millions of hectares of natural forests; overexploitation of forest resources is one of the main drivers of forest degradation. Although evidence shows that the extraction of NTFPs results in forest degradation, there have been few studies on what drives rural people to depend on NTFPs and how to address these drivers in terms of policies and measures. Policies and measures are nationally enacted policies and actions that countries undertake to address the causes of deforestation and forest degradation. This study identifies which factors determine the dependence on NTFPs in forest-dependent communities. From these factors, we derived policy implications for the main causes of overexploitation of NTFPs to provide suggestions for developing policies and measures in the design of national Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) strategies. Focusing on the Taungoo District as a case of dependence on NTFPs by local communities, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative data collection procedure based on interviewing households in the local communities. NTFPs contributed the most to total household income and the main types of NTFPs exploited were charcoal making and bamboo selling. Households with lower education level, less agricultural land, less income from off-farm activities, lived under the poverty line or used only charcoal were more dependent on NTFPs in the study areas. Poverty and fuelwood usage were factors affecting NTFPs dependence for landowners while rice insufficiency, off-farm income and fuelwood usage most affected the NTFPs dependence for landless people. The results suggested that national strategies for REDD+ should take into account local features such as income opportunities and land tenure in order to make local people cooperate with the government to avoid deforestation and forest degradation. © 2019 by the authors.","Livelihood dependency; Myanmar; Non-timber forest products; Policy; REDD+","Charcoal; Deforestation; Digital storage; Extraction; Timber; Wood products; Forest-dependent communities; Livelihood dependency; Myanmars; National strategies; Non-timber forest products; Policies and measures; Policy implications; REDD; Public policy; deforestation; emission control; exploitation; fuelwood; household income; livelihood; nontimber forest product; policy development; Charcoal; Deforestation; Degradation; Extraction; Forest Products; Land; Utilization; Wood Products; Bago; Myanmar; Taungoo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066240790

Many greening initiatives include goals to increase urban canopy cover through tree planting, however, our understanding of street tree ecosystem dynamics is limited and our understanding of vegetation structure and function based on intact, rural forests does not apply well to urban ecosystems. In this study, we estimate size-specific growth, mortality, and planting rates in trees under municipal control, use a box model to forecast short-term changes in street tree aboveground carbon pools under several planting and management scenarios, and compare our findings to rural, forested systems. We find accelerated rates of carbon cycling in street trees with mean diameter growth rates nearly four times faster in Boston, MA, USA (0.78 ± 0.02 cm yr-1) than in rural forest stands of MA (0.21 ± 0.02 cm yr-1) and mean mortality rates more than double rural forested rates (3.06 ± 0.25% yr-1 in street trees; 1.41 ± 0.04% yr-1 in rural trees). Despite the enhanced growth of urban trees, high mortality losses result in a net loss of street tree carbon storage over time (-0.15 ± 0.09 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). Planting initiatives alone may not be sufficient to maintain or enhance canopy cover and biomass due to the unique demographics of urban ecosystems. Initiatives to aid in the establishment and preservation of tree health are central for increasing street tree canopy cover and maintaining/increasing carbon storage in vegetation. Strategic combinations of planting and maintenance will maximize the viability of greening initiatives as an effective climate mitigation tool. © 2019 Smith et al.

However, in the Global South, the usefulness of the concept may be questioned, as spatial patterns of urban structure types are typically highly heterogeneous (e.g., a mix of commercial, formal residential and slum/informal areas). With the increased and reasonable availability of (very) high-resolution imagery, however, the concept of LCZ may also prove meaningful to investigate land use dependent thermal patterns in Global South cities, which is the main research question investigated in this paper. We compared LCZs based on very-high-resolution imagery (using Pleiades and SPOT-6) with the standard method using Landsat imagery, and we analyzed their relationship with land surface temperature (Landsat TIR) in Bandung, Indonesia. Two different methods of image classification are employed to extract the LCZs, i.e., the random forest algorithm on Landsat imagery and the object-based image analysis (OBIA) on very-high-resolution images. The result shows that the OBIA provides higher accuracy, reaching 89% for the object-based analysis on Pleiades imagery compared to 69% for the pixel-based analysis of Landsat imagery. In addition, the results of our analysis show that not only the type of LCZs but also composition and configuration patterns (i.e., density and aggregation of LCZs) significantly affect land surface temperature. To conclude, VHR imagery and OBIA allow mapping the complex patterns of LCZs in cities of the Global South, in support of developing mitigation strategies for the urban heat island effect via urban and landscape planning. © 2019","Local climate zones; Spatial metrics; Urban heat islands; Urban structure types; VHR image","algorithm; heat island; image analysis; image classification; land use; Pleiades; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; SPOT; urban climate; Bandung; Indonesia; West Java",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063939838

Therefore, biomass estimation allows to assess forest productivity and control carbon budgets. In Ecuador, biomass and carbon sequestration studies are scarce. Thus, we estimated and forecasted changes in biomass of Ecuadorian forests through the Mathematical Spatial Model of Global Carbon Cycle and the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index. The mathematical model describes the processes of growth and decay of vegetation in terms of carbon exchange between the atmosphere, plants and soil under anthropogenic impacts. The vegetation map and the biomass of 2017 (4,86 Gt) were developed with remote sensing methodology in ENVI 5.3 and ArcGIS 10.3 programs. The observed biomass decrease between 2000 and 2010 was due to the high deforestation rate. Thanks to conservation and reforestation policies and the compensatory effect between the atmosphere and forests, a biomass increase is expected until 2060. According to the vegetation map, Amazon region has a better plant vigor, followed by Andean and Coast regions, where scattered vegetation predominates. This information is useful for planning environmental practices such as forest conservation and reforestation in order to increase carbon storage. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences 2019.",,"Biomass; Budget control; Climate change; Conservation; Deforestation; Estimation; Pollution control; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic impacts; Carbon sequestration; Compensatory effects; Environmental practices; Global carbon cycle; Normalized differential vegetation indices; Reforestation policy; Scattered vegetation; Vegetation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067480977

If vegetation is ‘azonal’ however, local stresses are assumed to have an overwhelming influence on plant performance and climatic influences will be minimal; typically, this vegetation occurs only in small patches in the landscape. In this study I ask whether wetland plant communities, as they are described for South Africa, are evenly distributed among different terrestrial vegetation types, to test whether they are zonal or azonal. Three contingency tables were construed based on the counts of wetland vegetation records, defined on three hierarchical levels (Main Clusters, Community Groups and Community) and their occurrence in the country (at the level of Biome, Bioregion and terrestrial vegetation type). An ‘azonality index’ was calculated as the sum of all Chi-square values for each wetland vegetation type divided by the total number of records. The overall correlation between hydroperiod and the azonality index was very weak. At the finest level, terrestrial vegetation types were clustered on the basis of having similar combinations of wetland community types. Eighteen different ‘wetland ecoregions’ have been defined, on the basis of wetland vegetation types occurring within them. Instead of regarding wetland vegetation as azonal, it should rather be regarded as ‘intrazonal’, meaning that climate does have an impact but many vegetation types are widespread across climatic regions. The reason why community types in wetlands are widespread is due to the monodominance of a single widespread, often clonal, species. The different wetland ecoregions do not correspond to terrestrial biomes, so it is expected that wetland vegetation responds differently to climate than terrestrial vegetation. © 2018 Ecological Society of Australia","azonal; biomes; bioregions; hydroperiod; intrazonal; wetland ecoregions; wetland vegetation; wetness","biome; ecoregion; environmental factor; hydroperiod; landscape ecology; plant community; spatial distribution; vegetation cover; vegetation type; wetland; zonal flow; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057050610

Lithium gadolinium oxide and oxy-fluoride phosphate glasses doped with Sm 3+ ions were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique. Subsequently the physical and luminescence properties were investigated systematically to understand their behavior. The density of the prepared glass samples show high in oxide glasses as compared to oxy-fluoride glasses, and the density of both glass samples increase with increase in the Sm 2 O 3 concentrations. In total, ten signature Sm 3+ ion peaks were observed in the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra. In photoluminescence spectra the oxy-fluoride glass samples show higher excitation and emissions intensity than oxide glasses. The emission intensity increases up to 1mol% concentration of Sm 3+ ions and then decreases due to non-radiative energy transfers. The same is observed in case of radioluminescence emission spectra. The calculated J-O intensity parameters show Ω 2 &gt; Ω 4 &gt; Ω 6 trend. From Judd-Ofelt analysis, these glasses exhibit high potential for using as laser host medium. The life time recorded at the excitation and emission wavelength 401 nm and 598 nm respectively and it is observed that the life time decreases with increase in the Sm 3+ ions concentration. The CIE coordinates positioned in the orange region of CIE diagram. The properties evaluated in the present work indicate that these glasses can be a good candidate of orange LEDs applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CIE chromaticity; Judd-Ofelt theory; Oxy-fluoride glasses; Radioluminescence","Citrus fruits; Emission spectroscopy; Energy transfer; Fluorine compounds; Gadolinium compounds; Glass; Ions; Judd-Ofelt theory; Lithium compounds; Luminescence of inorganic solids; Photoluminescence; CIE chromaticity; Fluoride phosphate glass; Luminescence properties; Melt quenching techniques; Nonradiative energy transfer; Oxy-fluoride glass; Photoluminescence spectrum; Radio-luminescence; Samarium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063640466

In this study, we analyzed determinants for smallholder farmer adoption of adaptation strategies in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted 291 surveys with landowners in eight coffee farming communities. Farmers were asked which of 21 adaptation strategies they had engaged in, within five categories: migration, storage, land use diversification, community investment, and market exchange. We found the most frequent strategies included planting shade coffee, diversifying crop varieties, shifting sow date, building living walls, reforesting, or engaging in soil conservation. Although many farmers have experienced natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, they were most concerned by long-term threats to crops like coffee rust and higher temperatures, that require costly adaptive investments. We find farmers adapt to climate events because of their vulnerability context (i.e., experience with disasters and distance to markets). Land holdings (i.e., natural capital), farm equipment (i.e., physical capital), and group membership (i.e., social capital), were also key factors influencing adaptation. Finally, farmers with strong perceptions of drought and temperature change were most likely to adapt. These results suggest policy makers should have a multi-pronged approach to: improve farmers’ resource base through explicitly promoting adaptation strategies like crop and income diversification; inform climate perceptions through workshops on climate and weather; and strengthen participation in community and producer organizations to increase smallholder adaptation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive capacity; Agriculture; Climate change; Latin America; Sustainable livelihoods framework; Vulnerability","Agriculture; Commerce; Crops; Disasters; Historic preservation; Investments; Land use; Soil conservation; Adaptation strategies; Adaptive capacity; Farming communities; Latin America; Smallholder farmers; Sustainable livelihood; Temperature changes; Vulnerability; Climate change; adaptive management; adoption behavior; agricultural worker; agriculture; alternative agriculture; climate change; investment; livelihood; perception; smallholder; vulnerability; adoption; agricultural worker; article; Chiapas; climate change; coffee; crop; drought; earthquake; human; hurricane; investment; land use; major clinical study; market; natural disaster; nonhuman; organization; perception; rust (plant disease); shade; social capital; soil; South and Central America; storage; agricultural land; agriculture; animal; female; Mexico; pig; Chiapas; Latin America; Mexico [North America]; Agriculture; Animals; Climate Change; Farmers; Farms; Female; Humans; Mexico; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062725079

Eutrophication has become a common trophic state of inland waters throughout the world, but how the elevated CO 2 affects N cycles in such eutrophic water with algal bloom, and how vegetative restoration helps to mitigate N 2 O emission remains unknown. We conducted the experiments to investigate the effects of ambient and elevated atmospheric CO 2 (a[CO 2 ], e[CO 2 ]; 400, 800 μmol﹒mol −1 ) with and without the floating aquatic plant, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, on N-transformation in eutrophic water using the 15 N tracer method. The nitrification could be slightly inhibited by e[CO 2 ], due mainly to the competition for dissolved inorganic carbon between algae and nitrifiers. The e[CO 2 ] promoted denitrification and N 2 O emissions from eutrophic water without growth of plants, leading to aggravation of greenhouse effect and forming a vicious cycle. However, growth of the aquatic plant, Eichhornia crassipes, slightly promoted nitrification, but reduced N 2 O emissions from eutrophic water under e[CO 2 ] conditions, thereby attenuating the negative effect of e[CO 2 ] on N 2 O emissions. In the experiment, the N transformation was influenced by many factors such as pH, DO and algae density, except e[CO 2 ] and plant presence. The pH could be regulated through diurnal photosynthesis and respiration of algae and mitigated the acidification of water caused by e[CO 2 ], leading to an appropriate pH range for both nitrifying and denitrifying microbes. Algal respiration at night could consume DO and enhance abundance of denitrifying functional genes (nirK, nosZ) in water, which was also supposed to be a critical factor affecting denitrification and N 2 O emissions. This study clarifies how the greenhouse effect caused by e[CO 2 ] mediates N biogeochemical cycle in the aquatic ecosystem, and how vegetative restoration mitigates greenhouse gas emission. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO 2 concentration; Eutrophication; Microorganism; N-transformation; Regulation by plant","Algae; Aquatic ecosystems; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Denitrification; Eutrophication; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Microorganisms; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Restoration; Biogeochemical cycle; CO2 concentration; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Eichhornia crassipes; Floating aquatic plants; Microbial activities; N transformation; Regulation by plant; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; nitrogen 15; organic carbon; carbon dioxide; fresh water; nitrogen; Nitrogen-15; biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); eutrophication; microbial activity; microorganism; nitrogen cycle; acidification; alga; algal community; aquatic environment; Article; carbon footprint; denitrification; denitrifyer; ecosystem restoration; Eichhornia crassipes; environmental impact; eutrophication; gene function; greenhouse effect; microbial gene; microbial respiration; nitrification; nitrifyer; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; nosZ gene; pH; photosynthesis; plant growth; priority journal; species cultivation; analysis; atmosphere; bacterium; chemistry; Eichhornia; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microalga; algae; Eichhornia crassipes; Atmosphere; Bacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Eichhornia; Eutrophication; Fresh Water; Microalgae; Nitrogen Cycle; Nitrogen Isotopes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061777805

However, for wastewater plants where inland disposal of RO reject streams is the only choice, nitrate and phosphate-laden RO reject streams warrant near-complete removal prior to disposal to avoid eutrophication effects. In addition, hardness removal prior to RO allows maximum recovery without scaling/fouling of the RO membrane. In this study, we present a hybrid ion exchange pretreatment process that (i) allows near-complete recovery of nitrogen and phosphate, (ii) removes hardness, and (iii) uses CO2 as the only regenerant chemical that is sequestered finally as CaCO3(s). One shallow shell weak-acid cation exchanger (SS-WAC) and a hybrid anion exchanger (HAIX-NanoZr) with specific affinity toward nitrate and phosphate form the heart of HIX-NP recovery process. Studies were conducted using secondary wastewater from the Bethlehem, PA plant and CO2 was the only regenerant used replacing the need for other mineral acids. HIX-NP accomplished near-complete removal of phosphate and nitrate and their recovery in high purity. Thus, feed to subsequent RO is free of N and P posing no major reject disposal for inland treatment.

The approach is effective for the global, thermodynamic aspects of climate change, but is ineffective when it comes to aspects of climate change related to atmospheric circulation, which are highly uncertain. Yet, atmospheric circulation strongly mediates climate impacts at the regional scale. In this way, the confidence framework, which focuses on avoiding type 1 errors (false alarms), raises the prospect of committing type 2 errors (missed warnings). This has ethical implications. At the regional scale, however, where information on climate change has to be combined with many other factors affecting vulnerability and exposure-most of which are highly uncertain-the societally relevant question is not 'What will happen?' but rather 'What is the impact of particular actions under an uncertain regional climate change?' This reframing of the question can cut the Gordian knot of regional climate change information, provided one distinguishes between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties-something that is generally not done in climate projections. It is argued that the storyline approach to climate change-the identification of physically self-consistent, plausible pathways-has the potential to accomplish precisely this. © 2019 The Authors.

In recent years, wind power generation in China has developed very quickly, but its overall use ratio is very low and there are still many obstacles impeding further development of wind power. Firstly, this paper systematically analyzes the relationship between different influencing factors of wind power growth, including the level of government regulation and the impact of vested interest groups, based on the private interest theory of government regulation. Secondly, we use panel data from 31 Chinese provinces to examine the theoretical assumptions. The results show that the delegation of approval authority led to the growth of regional wind power installed capacity. The influence on local government by the local thermal power industry exerted a negative impact on the development of local wind power when the local government held the approval authority. However, this influence relation disappeared when the central government held the approval power. Thus, the government needs to make a trade-off between different levels of approval authority. The paper concludes with several suggestions to promote China's wind power development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Government regulation; Interest groups; The level of approval authority; Wind power","Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Environmental protection; Central government; Government regulation; Interest groups; Local government; Renewable energies; The level of approval authority; Wind power development; Wind power installed capacities; Wind power; authoritarianism; economic theory; local government; panel data; regulatory approach; resource development; wind power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060202812

Specifically, we assess the platform's potential to enable greater representation and participation of Indigenous peoples (IPs) within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). An analytical framework based on the extensive TEK and environmental management literature is developed, with a set of criteria identified against which to evaluate the platform. We find that although the process of designing the platform appears to be inclusive of Indigenous views, the structure itself does not recognize the roles that unequal power relations and colonialism play in marginalizing IPs. Limited attention is paid to the institutional barriers within the UNFCCC and the drawbacks of pursuing knowledge “integration” as an end in itself. Based on this, recommendations for improving the platform structure are put forward including using a rights-based framing, giving greater decision-making power to IPs, and developing mechanisms to ensure the holistic integrity of TEK and build the overall resilience of climate mitigation and adaptation systems.

This has become a substantial drag of sustainable development in some cities. Shanghai is the economic center of China, and it is also a typical energy import-dependent mega-city. Investigating the evolution of Shanghai's energy-saving performance and the energy rebound effect is significant for the implementation of energy-saving policies in other similar cities of China and other developing countries. Using the state space model with time-varying parameters and based on the IPAT identity and the Solow residual approach, this paper is the first study to present a specific estimation on Shanghai's energy rebound effect caused by technological progress. The results show that, during the period of 1991–2016, the average energy rebound effect of overall economy and secondary industry in Shanghai was 93.96% and 73.10%, respectively, indicating a high partial rebound effect. Most of expected energy saving caused by improved energy efficiency is offset by extra energy consumption caused by technological progress. Regarding tertiary industry, the average rebound effect was 146.61%, indicating a backfire effect. However, the average energy rebound amount of tertiary industry is less than that of secondary industry. In particular, there is an increasingly negative impact of the rebound effect of tertiary industry on energy conservation in recent years, with the sector's rapid expansion and corresponding increase in energy demand. Furthermore, we estimate the carbon rebound amount (i.e., carbon emissions caused by the energy rebound effect) and find that, on average, the energy rebound effect caused 13.1% and 0.41% increases in carbon emissions in Shanghai and China, respectively. Therefore, mitigating the energy rebound effect can significantly reduce carbon emissions. Due to the substantial impact of the rebound effect, technological progress and energy efficiency improvement should not be the only way to achieve energy-saving target, especially in energy import-dependent mega-cities like Shanghai. Some supporting policies should be implemented to ensure that the expected outcome of energy-saving effort can be realized as far as possible. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Energy efficiency; Energy import-dependent mega-city; Rebound effect; State space model; Technological progress","Carbon; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; State space methods; Carbon emissions; Megacities; Rebound effect; State - space models; Technological progress; Industrial economics; carbon emission; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; environmental economics; environmental policy; implementation process; megacity; numerical model; sustainable development; technological change; urbanization; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062703365

Local bus driving cycles have a significant influence on bus emissions under the different traffic conditions. This study investigated the operation mode distributions and emission characteristics for urban buses based on localized MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) using sparse Global Position System (GPS) data in Shanghai, China. Sparse GPS data from forty-three buses were prepared, and then bus trajectories were reconstructed to calculate local bus driving cycles, including model description, model calibration, and trajectory reconstruction. MOVES localization was conducted for emission estimation mainly focusing on the bus emission inventory comparison between US and China. Bus emission factors were estimated based on the localized MOVES from the aspect of different driving conditions. Results show that with the increase in average traveling speed, the proportion of idling operation mode showed a decreasing trend. Four typical vehicle operation mode distributions were identified with different average speeds to show the impact of traffic conditions.

It is unclear to what extent each vehicle category contributes to the production of pollution during a pollution event. For this purpose, a combination of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) modeling systems was used to simulate the distributions of pollutant concentrations over Tehran in a pollution episode from December 3 to 23, 2017. First, the performance of the modeling system was evaluated with respect to the simulation outputs against observations. Results showed satisfactory performance by the models in predicting meteorological parameters and pollutant concentrations. There were some discrepancies between measured and simulated pollutant levels that might have several causes, including, for example, not considering dust emissions in the system. The second step focused on the assessment of different emission scenarios to quantify the impact of each vehicle fleet in producing pollution during such severe episodes. For this reason, eight different scenarios were considered in which the emissions of each vehicle category were entirely eliminated from the corresponding scenario. The results show that the removal of passenger cars and motorcycles could have the most significant impact on PM2.5 reduction, with a maximum drop of 32% and 30%, respectively. In addition, the NO2 concentrations could be reduced by about 20% and 10% as a result of the removal of passenger cars and motorcycles, respectively. Finally, two traffic schemes with a main focus on the role of motorcycles on the degradation of Tehran’s air quality were also examined for the same episode. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",,"Air quality; Automobiles; Emission control; Motorcycles; Weather forecasting; Air pollution episodes; Comprehensive air quality model with extensions; Emission reduction; Meteorological parameters; Pollutant concentration; Pollution episodes; Simulated pollutant; Weather research and forecasting; Fleet operations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064547658

Despite its significant values biodiversity in Pakistan is being lost at a significant rate particularly due to agriculture intensification. The intensive agriculture system leading to serious environmental damages including biodiversity loss, water pollution, soil degradation, disruption of carbon sink and increase in GHG emissions. There is a growing recognition of promoting Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) strategies in smallholder agriculture; however, there is limited information about the existing EbA strategies by smallholder farmers and factors that influence the adoption of these practices. This article addresses research gap by using a survey data of 360 households from three districts of Pakistan. We explored existing EbA practices used by farmers and factors associated with the use of these practices. The list of ecosystem-based adaptation practices (EbA) was created on the basis of literature review and with the assistance of expert opinions. This study identified a number of risks associated with ecosystem degradation as perceived by smallholder farmers such as salinization, water pollution, soil erosion and decline in crop productivity. Due to overexploitation of underground water and extensive use of external inputs for agriculture use, the majority of farmers reported decline in water quality and depth of the underground water table. We used a double hurdle model for adoption and intensity of adaptation practices. The results show that farmers' social capital and institutional access increase the probability and intensity of adoption of EbA practices. The study suggests that a majority of smallholder farmers in Pakistan are already using certain EbA strategies, but there is still scope for larger implementation. Institutional policies and non-government organizations (NGOs) can increase broader use of EbA strategies by facilitating farmers’ access to subsidized tree nurseries, farmer-to-farmer information and promoting EbA policies in different socioeconomic and agro-ecological context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture intensification; Ecosystem-based adaptation; GHG emissions; Pakistan; Smallholder","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Soil pollution; Water pollution; Water quality; Agriculture intensifications; GHG emission; Institutional policies; Intensive agriculture systems; Non government organizations; Pakistan; Smallholder; Underground water table; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061656561

The extracted phases with a low gross content are scattered over the vast occupied area. Large deposits of Kazakhstan are related to this type of ore-bearing formations. Studies of the natural objects are complicated manyfold by heterogeneity of substances and the staging of the ongoing processes. In our studies, as reference matter we adopt the solid natural carbon substances, synthetised in various chemical processes running in compliance with strict rules of chemical reactions under given thermodynamic conditions. The natural carbon substance, as a rule, exists in a whole range of probable phases, often having the filmplanar structure habit. Rock transformation (squeezing) results in curving film-lamellar carbon-bearing layers, present also within the nanopipes and fullerens; they often break, with obvious formation of a planar structure. Respective alternation of layers may lead to local formation of graphite, which is witnessed in photographies, made using the transmission electron microscopy. Particles, seized by folding, can be trapped in hollows (a trap trench system) and start accumulating clusters. The only method so far fixing the newly formed carbon layers is the Raman spectroscopy.

The oxidation property of biodiesel results in the degradation of its quality. This problem can be solved by the addition of suitable antioxidants which improves the oxidation stability of the fuel. Usage of natural antioxidants offsets the defects in synthetic antioxidants, because they are renewable, nontoxic as well as cost effective. In the present investigation the effects of commercially available and cheap natural leaf extract additive such as Albizia Lebbeck (AL), Melia Azedarach (MA) and Psidium Guajava (PG) have mixed with jamun biodiesel blend (JOME20) at various concentrations like 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm to accelerated oxidation stability of the biodiesel blend. Characterization of biodiesel oxidation variability regarding different antioxidants is evaluated using Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy by analyzing the FTIR spectrum regions of C[sbnd]H bonds of the respective antioxidants/biodiesel blends. The AL dosed with 20% of jamun biodiesel (JOME20) enhances the oxidation stability by 25.27%, when compared to those of JOME20 without any antioxidant. The order of effectiveness of antioxidants at 1000 ppm concentration with JOME20 is obtained as AL &gt; MA &gt; PG. Further, the experiment is conducted with jamun oil methyl ester (JOME) as a fuel in CI engine are studied. Engine tests are performed using the blends of 20% Jamun Oil Methyl Ester (JOME20) and 100% Jamun Oil Methyl Ester (JOME100) with diesel as fuel. The performance results revealed that improved brake thermal efficiency and marginally lowered specific fuel consumption for JOME20 blend compared to diesel. The emission parameters such as CO, CO2, HC and smoke are decreased considerably. But, the NOx is increased by 10.6% compared to diesel. Therefore, in the present study aims to control the NOx emission by using natural leaf extract additives mixed with JOME20 blend. Finally, it is concluded that JOME20 with 1000 ppm of AL is showed reduction of NOx emission up to 8.67% compared to diesel.

These responses may have important implications for human and economic development and women's empowerment. Drawing on the literature linking climate conditions to rice cultivation in Indonesia, we use longitudinal household survey and high-resolution climate data to explore changes in childbearing intentions, family planning use, and births following community-level climate shocks from 1993 to 2015. We find that fertility intentions increase and family planning use declines in response to delays in monsoon onset occurring within the previous year, particularly for wealthier populations. However, women on farms are significantly more likely to use family planning and less likely to give birth following abnormally high temperatures during the previous five years. We also measure parallel shifts in household well-being as measured by rice, food, and non-food consumption expenditures. Our findings advance the environmental fertility literature by showing that longer duration environmental shocks can have impacts on fertility behaviors and outcomes.

Research is needed that helps destinations become more climate ready, including studies of decision factors that influence trip-taking behaviors. This paper presents findings from a discrete choice experiment to determine how physical and economic changes could affect visitation behaviors to a vulnerable coastal destination, the Outer Banks region of North Carolina, USA. We embedded our experiment within an on-site visitor survey to reveal thresholds of negative changes to coastal attributes that tourists are willing to tolerate, and also examined tourists’ willingness to substitute their future trips to the region. Transportation-related changes had the highest relative importance among the four selected attributes. The likelihood of three types of spatial substitution, spurred by not being able to access the destination, were consistently related to residency but less consistently related to place meanings, visitation history, and other demographic variables. Study results can inform climate change planning within coastal zones to minimize negative impacts to tourism demand, such as the need to develop creative revenue streams to maintain resilience in communities that rely on occupancy taxes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; coastal impacts; discrete choice experiment; resilience; substitution behaviours; tourism constraints","climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; discrete choice analysis; ecotourism; tourism economics; tourist destination; North Carolina; Outer Banks; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064275059

Here we apply a piecewise multivariate quantile mapping approach to temperature and humidity projections from a subset of models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and analyze the resulting climatology of extreme heat days (EHDs) with explicit consideration of the prevailing humidity. The piecewise multivariate bias correction method shows good fidelity in reproducing the frequency of different types of extreme heat events in the historical period. Projections for U.S. regions and individual cities for both the middle and end of the century are characterized by increases in the frequency of EHDs, and especially those characterized by high humidity. For many regions and individual cities, there is no overlap between the frequency of high-humidity EHDs in general circulation model ensembles from the historical and future periods, indicating that increases in extreme heat are robust. Analysis of 500-mb height, sea-level pressure, and low-level circulation composites for historical and future periods indicates that the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models reproduce basic large-scale circulation features associated with EHDs in U.S. regions and that future changes in extreme heat are related primarily to large-scale warming rather than enhancement of regional circulation anomalies. ©2019.

In this respect, recent developments show a strong trend towards battery electric vehicles (BEVs). However, as-yet-unresolved disadvantages such as high battery costs and limited driving ranges have prevented customers from buying BEVs. Another potential vehicle concept with zero local emissions are fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) or alternatively, due to their battery which is used as a second power source, better called fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs). In order to efficiently compare BEVs and FCHVs for different potential deployment scenarios, accurate simulation models are needed. Based on a previously published model for BEVs, this paper presents a longitudinal simulation model for FCHVs. In this context, the focus lies on the power supply for the drivetrain containing the fuel cell (as its main power source), the battery (as a buffer storage), and the operating strategy (managing the power splitting during a load request). In order to enable the parametrization and validation of the simulation model, a particular fuel cell production car, a Hyundai ix35 FC, is extensively examined on a chassis dynamometer and in real driving tests.

We estimate that consumption changes make environmental impacts increase by a factor of 1.6 (for Russia's water footprint) to a factor of 7.0 (for Nigeria's carbon footprint). This rise is mostly driven by GDP growth, but often also by population growth. Changes in consumption patterns due to income growth, however, attenuate the effect. The attenuation appeared to be much stronger for water (for India and Indonesia over 50%) than for land or carbon footprints. It is hence important that forward-looking modelling exercises account for different income categories and related expenditure patterns. The results further indicate how much our technologies must improve to compensate for impact increases induced by rising consumption. To cope with that, not only established economies, but also some BRIC and MINT countries, especially Russia and China, must increase their efforts towards environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Demand-side projections; Household consumption; Land degradation; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Water scarcity","Climate change; Economic analysis; Emission control; Mints; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Demand-side; Household Consumption; Input output analysis; Land degradation; Water scarcity; Carbon footprint; carbon; climate change; consumption behavior; environmental impact; household expenditure; input-output analysis; land degradation; resource scarcity; water resource; Article; Brazil; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; economic development; environmental impact; gross national product; household; income; India; Indonesia; land use; mathematical model; Mexico; Nigeria; population growth; priority journal; Russian Federation; Turkey (republic); Brazil; China; India; Indonesia; Mexico [North America]; Nigeria; Russian Federation; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061384441

The alloying of Pt with non-noble metals is a potential strategy for reducing Pt use because interactions between Pt and non-noble metals can modify the catalyst structure and electronic properties. Here, a γ-Al2O3-supported bimetallic catalyst [Pt(0.1)Co(1)/Al2O3] was prepared which contained 0.1 wt % Pt and 1 wt % Co and thus featured an extremely low Pt : Co ratio (&lt;1 : 30 mol/mol). The Pt and Co in this catalyst formed alloy nanoparticles in which isolated electron-rich Pt atoms were present on the nanoparticle surface. The activity of this Pt(0.1)Co(1)/Al2O3 catalyst for the purification of automotive exhaust was comparable to the activities of 0.3 and 0.5 wt % Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Electron-rich Pt and metallic Co promoted activation of NOx and oxidization of CO and hydrocarbons, respectively. This strategy of tuning the surrounding structure and electronic state of a noble metal by alloying it with an excess of a non-noble metal will enable reduced noble metal use in catalysts for exhaust purification and other environmentally important reactions. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We used fine resolution vegetation and environmental data (soil, elevation and slope) from two large-scale surveys (320 × 1000 m2 plots in two 10 km × 10 km blocks) in the Upper Mekong to quantify (1) the role of abiotic and biotic (species interactions) factors in community assembly processes and (2) the effect of biodiversity, environmental factors and forest succession on above-ground biomass (AGB). We found strong correlation between soil fertility and community structure in the early successional seres, while species interactions played an increasingly important role in older seres, presumably due to species complementary. We detected a significant relationship between AGB and phylogenetic diversity, elevation and soil fertility across successional gradients. Within successional stages, soil fertility was not significantly associated with AGB, while elevation was significantly associated with AGB only in forest &lt;100 years old. Phylogenetic diversity was positively correlated with AGB in the young secondary forest (&lt; 15 years old) but not significantly associated with AGB in older seres. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that abiotic filtering influences species assembly in the initial stages of forest succession, while biotic interactions dominate community assembly processes in older seres. We found that phylogenetic diversity, soil fertility and elevation gradients were strongly predictive of AGB in a secondary tropical montane forest in Southeast Asia. However, elevation may reflect other underlying abiotic gradients, such as water availability. Phylogenetic diversity was significantly associated with AGB only in youngest seres (&lt;15 years old). Considering phylogenetic diversity in restoration plantings and the management of forests younger than 15 years old could enhance forest biomass and the climate mitigation function forest landscape restoration. © 2018 The Authors.

Forest soils amended with biochar have potential to sequester carbon (C), improve soil quality, and alter greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions without depleting nutrient stocks. Yet, few studies have examined the effects of biochar on GHG emissions and tree growth in temperate forest soils. We measured GHG emissions, soil C content, and tree growth at managed forest sites in Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. We applied biochar amendments of 0, 2.5, or 25 Mg/ha to the forest soil surface. Flux of carbon dioxide and methane varied by season; however, neither were affected by biochar amendment. Flux of nitrous oxide was not detected at these nitrogen-limited and unfertilized forest sites. Biochar amendment increased soil C content by 41% but did not affect tree growth. Overall, biochar had no detrimental effects on forest trees or soils. We conclude that biochar can be used harmlessly for climate change mitigation in forests by sequestering C in the soil. © 2018 The Authors.

One such market-based mechanisms is the agri-environment-climate schemes (AES) in the European Union (EU). AES compensate farmers for reducing land-use intensity and maintaining or introducing biodiversity-rich habitats. Despite their high costs, impacts of AES vary by measure, region and taxonomic group considered, and have rarely been studied over large areas covering an entire country. Here we assess the country-wide impact of several AES measures on bird abundance using citizen science data on birds and detailed information on AES take up from across Finland. We report a positive impact of organic animal farming on abundance of all farmland associated birds. This effect was particularly strong for insectivorous species, species that are associated to farmyards and long-distance species. None of the other AES measures considered for study did show any relationship with bird abundance. Overall, these findings highlight the potential positive impact that some compensatory measures, such as organic animal farming, may have on wildlife. Traditional animal husbandry is based on grazing of animals and restriction on external inputs, similarly to what is stipulated under organic production contract. As such, traditional animal husbandry may represent an effective landscape management tool for restoring or maintaining threatened species and ecosystems in rural areas of the EU. Ultimately, the apparent lack of a measurable effect of the other AES considered here supports the current move towards evidence-based regional targeting of compensatory measures, so as to concentrate scarce resources to where they can yield the highest ecological benefits. © 2019 Santangeli et al.

The different existing standards for vehicular ad-hoc networks, such as dedicate short range communication (DSRC), wireless access for vehicular environment (WAVE)/IEEE802.11p, have given to the research community the possibility of developing new medium access control (MAC) and routing schemes, in order to enhance the quality and the comfort of mobile users who are driving their vehicles. In this paper, we focus our attention on the optimization of traffic flowing in a vehicular environment with vehicle-2-roadside capability. As shown later, the proposed idea exploits the information that is gathered by road-side units to redirect traffic flows (in terms of vehicles) to less congested roads, with an overall system optimization, also in terms of carbon dioxide emissions reduction.

Focusing on negotiation practices helps to provide a nuanced understanding of land use change processes over time. We examine negotiations within a concession model for land development in the southern tropical peatlands of Central Kalimantan province in Indonesia. This region can be described as a ‘resource frontier’ where historical landscape transformations from large development projects and oil palm plantations intersect with state models of forest conservation and recent Reducing Emissions from Degradation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) projects. The study drew on actor-network theory (ANT) and combined an ethnographic approach with document analysis for understanding how these landscape transformations and land allocation for large concessions has left a legacy of continuing uncertainty and conflict over land. There is considerable gaming between actors to achieve their desired outcome. Increased competition for land and contested legal arrangements mean that the negotiations are virtually never-ending. ‘Winning’ at one stage of a negotiation may mean that those who feel they have lost will organise and use the system to challenge the outcomes. These findings show that attempts to implement pre-determined plans or apply global environmental goals at resource frontiers will become entangled in fluid and messy negotiations over land, rather than achieving any desired new status quo. © 2019 The Authors","Conservation; Frontier; Indonesia; Negotiation; Oil palm; REDD+","frontier region; land use change; landscape change; nature conservation; negotiation process; peatland; transformation; Central Kalimantan; Indonesia; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060860363

One approach in widespread populations is to study how individuals from different parts of the distribution area respond to climate, thereby testing for potential resilience in terms of local adaptions against environmental change. In this study, we collated extensive survey data on size-at-age for Northeast Arctic saithe (Pollachius virens) (1992–2013; 62–70 °N; ages 0–3 years) and detailed hydrographic information from three fixed, coastal stations along the Norwegian coast (at ≈63, 68 and 71 °N). Dedicated ad libitum feeding experiments were additionally performed to further strengthen the insight in saithe growth dynamics, also including adults (≥4 years). Likely temperature-mediated effects on whole body weight (W), total length, Fulton's K, and specific growth rate (SGR) of wild saithe were explored using generalized linear models with age and region as fixed factors. A positive relationship with temperature was found, as evidenced by the before-mentioned body metrics of saithe age 2–3 years all becoming higher at positive local annual temperature anomalies, i.e. the deviation from the long-term mean temperature. The direct use of corresponding, absolute temperature instead of temperature anomalies gave comparable results. Hence, acclimatization to local temperatures per se was likely minor. Furthermore, examination of GLM interaction terms indicated that dissimilar feeding conditions in part of the study area, using K as a proxy, were not a confounding factor. Taken together, the present material provided an excellent opportunity to scrutinize temperature-mediated effects on growth dynamics across age classes, regions, and years. However, data sets pooled over years turned out to be more informative: SGR from age 0 to 1 year was clearly highest in the warmer, southern region but individuals in the colder, northern region gradually caught up and thereby showed higher W at age 3 years. This pattern mechanistically speaks for a gradual displacement of response curves for growth towards lower temperatures as saithe become larger or older. Although the present feeding experiments evidenced steady declines in SGR with W for younger individuals while this size effect faded away in the adults, the results also implied that saithe in the field show far from optimal growth performance, according to standard physiological principles. Thus, the term “optimal growth” should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, further studies are merited in this research area, potentially aiding body growth predictions and thereby management routines of this productive stock. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Fish growth; Latitudinal clines; NEA saithe; Temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060228043

In order to supply such customers the required cooling load, a huge capital and operation investment in district cooling network is a necessity if the cooling network is separated from the heating production units. One solution scheme is to take advantage of the heating generation units, which are off during summer to drive the cooling equipment. However, among various design parameters, the most important one is the desirable configuration of the district of interest: best selection and combination of the heating and cooling generation equipment. A least-annualized-cost mathematical approach based on the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is described in this paper to determine the optimal integration as well as the optimal control of the flow and the storage. The test case study showed that the methodology was effective to give a huge savings in both total annual cost and emission for a wide range of designs.

By focusing on air temperature and precipitation, the present study compares local-scale climate regimes at two sites in Central Italy (urban Rome and a peri-urban cropland 10 km west of Rome), using descriptive and inferential statistics on both variables and a drought index (the Standardized Precipitation Index, hereafter SPI) recorded over the last 60 years (1958-2017). The present work assumes the importance of urban-rural gradients shaping local-scale climate regimes and spatial variability, with differential impacts on individual variables depending on territorial background and intrinsic biophysical characteristics. Considering together precipitations and minimum/maximum air temperature at month and year scale, the analysis developed here illustrates two coexisting climatic trends at distinctive spatial scales: A general trend toward warming-specifically influencing temperature regimes-and a more specific pattern evidencing changes in local-scale climate regime along the urban gradient, with a more subtle impact on both precipitations and temperatures. Empirical results indicate that climate variability increased over the study period, outlining the low predictability of dry spells typical of Mediterranean climate especially in the drier season (spring/summer). On average, absolute annual differences between the two sites amounted to 70 mm (more rainfall in the peri-urban site) and 0.9 °C (higher temperature in the urban site). A similar trend toward warming was observed for air temperature in both sites. No significant trends were observed for annual and seasonal rainfalls. SPI long-term trends indicate high variability in dry spells, with more frequent (and severe) drought episodes in urban Rome. Considering together trends in temperature and precipitation, the ‘urban heat’ effect was more evident, indicating a clearer trend toward climate aridity in urban Rome. These findings support the adoption of integrated strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation in both agricultural systems and relict natural ecosystems surrounding urban areas. © 2019, MDPI AG.

An aqueous 13C-enriched solution was infused into stems of Populus tremula L. trees, and real-time measurements of 13C-CO2 and 12C-CO2 in EA were performed via Cavity Ring Down Laser Spectroscopy (CRDS). The contribution of locally respired CO2 (LCO2) and xylem-transported CO2 (TCO2) to EA was estimated from their different isotopic composition. Mean daily values of TCO2/EA ranged from 13% to 38%, evidencing the notable role that xylem CO2 transport plays in the assessment of stem respiration. Mean daily TCO2/ EA did not differ between treatments of drought stress and light exclusion of woody tissues, but they showed different TCO2/EA dynamics on a sub-daily time scale. Sub-daily CO2 diffusion patterns were explained by a light-induced axial CO2 gradient ascribed to woody tissue photosynthesis, and the resistance to radial CO2 diffusion determined by bark water content. Here, we demonstrate the outstanding potential of CRDS paired with 13C-CO2 labelling to advance in the understanding of CO2 movement at the plant−atmosphere interface and the respiratory physiology in woody tissues. © The Author(s) 2019.

To better constrain the emission fluxes, we designed flights in a cylindrical pattern and computed the emission fluxes from two flights using a kriging method and Gauss's divergence theorem. Differences in wind treatment and assumptions about background concentrations affect the emission estimates by a factor of 1.5 to 7. The uncertainty is also impacted by meteorological conditions and distance from the emission sources. The vertical layer averaging affects the flux estimate, but the choice of raw wind or mass-balanced wind is more important than the thickness of the vertical averaging for mass-balanced wind for both urban and local scales. The importance of vertical mass transfer for flux estimates is examined, and the difference in the total emission estimate with and without vertical mass transfer is found to be small, especially at the local scale. The total flux estimates accounting for the entire circumference are larger than those based solely on measurements made in the downwind region. This indicates that a closed-shape flight profile can better contain total emissions relative to a one-sided curtain flight because most cities have more than one point source and wind direction can change with time and altitude. To reduce the uncertainty of the emission estimate, it is important that the sampling strategy account not only for known source locations but also possible unidentified sources around the city. Our results highlight that aircraft-based measurements using a closed-shape flight pattern are an efficient and useful strategy for identifying emission sources and estimating local- and city-scale greenhouse gas emission fluxes. © Author(s) 2019.",,"airborne survey; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); divergence; greenhouse gas; kriging; methane; point source pollution; quantitative analysis; wind field; California; Sacramento; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066621377

MVIRI has flown onboard Meteosat First Generation (MFG) satellites between 1982 and 2017. It has served the weather forecasting community with measurements of ""visible"", ""infra-red"" and ""water vapour"" radiance in near real-time. The precision of the pre-launch sensor spectral response function (SRF) characterisation, particularly of the visible band of this sensor type, improved considerably with time, resulting in higher quality radiances towards the end of the MFG program. Despite these improvements, the correction of the degradation of this sensor has remained a challenging task and previous studies have found the SRF degradation to be faster in the blue than in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. With these limitations, the dataset cannot be immediately applied in climate science. In order to provide a data record that is suited for climate studies, the Horizon 2020 project ""FIDelity and Uncertainty in Climate-data records from Earth Observation"" (FIDUCEO) conducted (1) a thorough metrological uncertainty analysis for each instrument, and (2) a recalibration using enhanced input data such as reconstructed SRFs. In this paper, we present the metrological analysis, the recalibration results and the resulting consolidated FCDR. In the course of this study we were able to trace-back the remaining uncertainties in the calibrated MVIRI reflectances to underlying effiects that have distinct physical root-causes and spatial/temporal correlation patterns. SEVIRI and SCIAMACHY reflectances have been used for a validation of the harmonised dataset. The resulting new FCDR is publicly available for climate studies and for the production of climate data records (CDRs) spanning about 35 years. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate data record; Earth observation; Error budget; Error propagation; Essential climate variable; Fundamental climate data record; Metrology; Radiance; Remote sensing; Uncertainty","Budget control; Earth (planet); Errors; Infrared devices; Measurement; Observatories; Reflection; Remote sensing; Weather forecasting; Weather satellites; Climate data records; Climate variables; Earth observations; Error budgets; Error propagation; Radiance; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066733326

These renovations require improvements in aspects such as structural integrity, accessibility, and the updating of deteriorated or obsolescent installations. This reveals that building renovations constitute a key factor in the future of the European building sector and must be included in strategies both for the reduction of this sector's environmental impact and for climate change mitigation. In order to determine the effectiveness of renovations and their impact, the HEREVEA (Huella Ecológica de la Rehabilitacion de Viviendas en Andalucia or Ecological Footprint of the Renovation of Dwellings in Andalusia) model is proposed on data obtained from the project's bill of quantities, its ecological footprint is assessed, and the economic-environmental feasibility of different proposals are evaluated simultaneously. The resulting model is integrated into a geographic information system, which allows georeferenced results. The tool can be used for sustainable and resilient planning policy-making at all government levels, and for the decision-making processes. In this paper, economic and environmental indicators are, for the first time, simultaneously assessed through statistical normalization obtained from 50 cases analyzed in the city of Seville. Furthermore, five case studies are assessed in detail in order to determine the sensitivity of the model. These renovations represent less than 30% of the cost and 6% of the ecological footprint of a new construction project. During the subsequent 25 years, the energy efficiency improvements could significantly reduce the CO2 emissions that are due to direct consumption. © 2019 by the authors.","Building renovation; Ecological footprint; Economic-environmental assessment; Geographic Information Systems (GIS); Planning policy","building construction; decision making; ecological footprint; economic impact; energy efficiency; environmental impact assessment; European Union; GIS; housing management; sustainable development; Andalucia; Sevilla; Seville; Spain; Andalucia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067100068

Policy networks are considered a crucial ingredient for the learning and cooperation needed to effectively implement agricultural development projects and increase community resiliency, yet very little comparative empirical data has been collected to assess where and how these networks operate. We contribute to filling this gap by characterizing the governance and leadership patterns within agricultural development policy networks that connect organizations working on climate resilience and food security activities in 14 smallholder farming communities across 11 countries in East Africa, West Africa and South Asia. We integrate theories of network governance and leadership in international development settings with social network analysis methods to analyze network structures and understand the roles of various actors working collaboratively toward agricultural development goals. We present two critical findings that advance our theoretical understanding of network governance and have implications for agricultural development policy globally. First, we find evidence for three distinct network types: shared and brokered networks, as predicted by the network governance literature, as well as a class of fragmented networks that exhibit extremely low levels of coordination at their core. Additionally, we find that while the presence of international development organizations is associated with greater overall network coordination, it is local and regional organizations that fill central network leadership positions most frequently. These findings suggest that resources may be an important factor in overcoming the cost of coordination, but social capital among local actors may be more important for developing network leadership. © 2018","Agricultural development; Climate change; Food security; Global comparative data; Policy networks; Smallholders","agricultural development; agricultural policy; climate change; comparative study; food security; governance approach; leadership; smallholder; East Africa; South Asia; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060200300

Previous studies, however, have generally revealed a non-threshold concentration-response relationship between air pollution and health, making it difficult to determine a concentration, below which no obvious health effects can be observed. Here we proposed a novel approach based on the concept of “number needed to treat” specifically, we calculated the reduction in air pollution concentrations needed to avoid one death corresponding to different hypothetical concentration standards; the one with the smallest value would be the most practical concentration standard. As an example, we applied this approach to the daily standard of ambient PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) in four Chinese cities. The calculation was based on the association between daily mortality and ambient PM2.5, which was examined by a generalized additive model with adjustment of important covariates. Significant associations were observed between PM2.5 and mortality. Our analyses suggested that it is appropriate to have 50 μg/m3 as the daily standard of ambient PM2.5 for the study area, compared to the current standard of which were directly adopted from the national standard of 75 μg/m3.

Moreover, the currently available climate models do not directly simulate some of the hydro-climatic parameters (e.g., effective rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, irrigation requirements), which are of interest in irrigation sector. Modeling crop-water demands under changing climate involves several step-by-step approaches that are tedious and time-consuming for many water users. This study developed a water management tool, hereafter called Climate-Smart Decision-Support System (CSDSS), for modeling water demand of rice irrigation schemes under climate change impacts. The CSDSS is a user-friendly interactive program consisting of three main modules integrated in MATLAB and a graphical user interface development environment (GUIDE). The model runs with ten Global Climate Models (GCMs) and three emission scenarios (RCP 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). It can generate several hydro-climatic parameters based on a daily water balance model, with input data from GCMs projections, crop, soil and field conditions. The model allows water managers to make fast decision for paddy water management. The generated outputs can be obtained through individual GCMs as well as through multi-models (ensemble) projection and can be converted into excel format for further analysis. The model was applied to evaluate the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand and other key hydro-climatic parameters in Tanjung Karang Rice Irrigation Scheme in Malaysia for the period 2010–2099 with reference to the baseline period of 1976–2005. The results show that irrigation water demand will increase during the off-season (January–June) but decrease during the main season (July–December) due to significant contribution from effective rainfall in the latter season. The CSDSS tool can be used for managing water resources under changing climate and would, therefore, be helpful in promoting appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies that can lead to more sustainable water use at farm level. Some future improvements of the tool, due to methodological limitations of the study, will however improve its performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Climate-smart DSS; Global climate models; Irrigation water demand; Rice cultivation","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Crops; Decision making; Decision support systems; Graphical user interfaces; Irrigation; MATLAB; Rain; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Climate-smart DSS; Global climate model; Graphical user interface development environments; Irrigation requirements; Irrigation waters; Reference evapotranspiration; Rice cultivation; Step-by-step approach; Climate models; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; cultivation; decision support system; global climate; hydrometeorology; irrigation system; modeling; rice; water demand; water management; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061379059

In an era of rapid climatic change and continuous widespread clearing, revegetation projects need to focus on producing resilient and long-term self-sustaining populations. Restore and Renew expands current knowledge of genetic provenance via genome-scan data, environmental niche modeling (ENM), and site-specific climate information. The sampling strategy is to obtain leaf tissue representing the distributions of over 100 species commonly used in restoration. We apply generalized dissimilarity modeling to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism datasets from hundreds of samples. Species-specific local provenances are obtained using a model that represents observed patterns of genetic variation across the landscape. Climate modeling is implemented to interpret genetic provenance boundaries in the context of current and future climatic conditions at the specified site. Results are presented in an easy-to-use webtool (www.restore-and-renew.org.au), where the user simply selects their site of interest and a target species to obtain the size and distribution of local genetic provenance. Although Restore and Renew is not prescriptive, it allows restoration practitioners to make informed decisions on where to source material from, to fulfill their restoration scenario of choice. Two examples, Westringia fruticosa and Acacia suaveolens, are presented to demonstrate how the analytical pipeline responds to different ecological and evolutionary patterns. The webtool has multiple applications for biodiversity management and will continue to evolve with new species and analytical/interpretative outputs. © 2018 Royal Botanic Garden and Domain Trust.

This suggests that reduction occurs by more than one pathway. The solid-phase reduction of metals by carbon in complex and lean iron ores from different sources and also in individual oxides of silicon, chromium, and aluminum is investigated. The electrical characteristics of ores and individual oxides are studied in order to refine theoretical concepts regarding reduction. In all cases, the reduction of metals is found to involve the conversion of the oxide’s crystal lattice into the crystal lattice of the metal. On the basis of quantum mechanics and solid-state physics and chemistry, new fundamental principles are identified in the electronic theory of the reduction of metals. Reduction consists in electron exchange between the reducing agent and the metal cations in the oxide. As a result, anionic vacancies with free electrons are formed at the oxide surface. Depending on the concentration of the cations to be reduced, the conversion of the ionic bond of the oxide’s cations to the metallic bond of the metal’s cations involves the coalescence of charged anionic vacancies at the surface of the oxide or at greater depth. This process does not require motion of the cations over considerable distances or the formation of metal atoms; the thermodynamic constraints associated with the formation of new-phase nuclei do not apply. This theory is able to explain all the known experimental results regarding the solid-phase reduction of metals in oxides: the formation of continuous metallic shells at the surface of pieces of rich iron ore; the deposition of metal particles within lean and complex ores; and the formation and sublimation of suboxides. In the deposition of metallic phase within the complex oxide, there is no direct contact between the metal and reducing agent; therefore, in the reduction of iron in complex or lean ores by carbon, no sulfur or carbon is transferred to the metallic phase from the reducing agent. In the reduction of such ore, fuel coal may be used as the reducing agent. The product is a metal–oxide composite containing pure iron and valuable oxides of magnesium, titanium, and vanadium. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.","anionic vacancies; directly reduced iron (DRI); electronic theory of reduction; ionic bonds; lean ore; metal oxides; metallic bonds; metals; metal–oxide composites; ore processing; oxide lattice; reduction by carbon; selective reduction; siderite ore; solid-phase reduction; titanomagnetite ore","Crystal lattices; Deposition; Economic geology; Extraction; Iron ores; Iron oxides; Lattice theory; Metals; Ore treatment; Positive ions; Quantum theory; Reducing agents; Titanium oxides; Anionic vacancies; Directly reduced irons; Ionic bonds; Metal oxides; Metallic bonds; Oxide composites; Oxide lattices; Selective reduction; Solid-phase; Titanomagnetites; Iron ore reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073225938

In order to provide a comfortable and healthy indoor environment, bioclimatic design recommendations during early design stages were revised, including during the two periods of 1986–2015 and 2020–2050. A modified Givoni's bioclimatic chart was used to visualize the climate variation and to inform designers about accurate and climate-proof bioclimatic design recommendations. The second-generation Canadian Earth System Model was used to predict changes in the maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity components of future decades. Based on Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 for the greenhouse gas emission section of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the effects of climate change on different cooling and heating strategies were examined. The findings of this study showed that for all the studied stations, apart from Abadan, the trend in temperature increase over the coming decades is not unforeseen. The use of heating strategies will decrease, and the use of cooling strategies will increase. Finally, this study presents an adjusted bioclimatic chart of Iran and quantifies the adaptation measures to climate change to reduce energy use and avoid overheating. © 2019","Bioclimatic chart; Bioclimatic design; Energy consumption; Future climate; Thermal comfort","Architectural design; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Structural design; Thermal comfort; Bio-climatic designs; Bioclimatic chart; Design recommendations; Existing residential buildings; Future climate; Healthy indoor environments; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Climate change; air temperature; architectural design; climate change; climate effect; energy use; future prospect; heating; relative humidity; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063728279

However, until now, few studies have performed a comprehensive quantification of the long-term variability of aerosol species in this region. In this study, the speciation, variability, and distribution of aerosol optical depth over the Arabian Peninsula during 2005-2015 is analyzed by using the modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) model together with satellite retrieved data and AERONET observations and focusing on nine large cities in the region (Dammam, Doha, Dubai, Jeddah, Kuwait, Manama, Muscat, Riyadh, and Sanaa). Over the past decade, the mean annual aerosol optical thickness (AOT) values were in the range of 0.3-0.5, which is attributed to both mineral dust (60-70%) and anthropogenic activities (20-30%). An increase in AOT values between 2005 and 2009 is attributed to increased dust generation from the Sahel region in Northern Africa, and the Fertile Crescent (Syria, Iraq, Jordan) due to an extended dry period. Reductions in local urban emissions are still considered to be efficient measures to improve air quality in these population centers despite the significant contribution of desert dust in the total particulate matter levels in the region. © 2019 by the authors.","AERONET; Aerosol optical depth; Arabian Peninsula; MERRA-2; Mineral dust; Transport","Aerosols; Air quality; Minerals; Optical properties; AERONET; Aerosol optical depths; Arabian Peninsula; MERRA-2; Mineral dust; Transport; Dust; AERONET; aerosol property; dust; human activity; mineral; optical depth; spatial distribution; speciation (chemistry); transport process; urban atmosphere; Arabian Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066310175

It is well known that including an electromagnetic bandgap around the qubit operating frequency improves coherence for superconducting circuits. However, investigations of bandgaps to other environmental coupling mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a method to enhance the coherence of superconducting circuits by introducing a phononic bandgap around the device operating frequency. The phononic bandgaps block resonant decay of defect states within the gapped frequency range, removing the electromagnetic coupling to phonons at the gap frequencies. We construct a multiscale model that derives the decrease in the density of states due to the bandgap and the resulting increase in defect state T1 times. We demonstrate that emission rates from in-plane defect states can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude. We combine these simulations with theory for resonators operating in the continuous-wave regime and show that improvements in quality factors are expected by up to the enhancement in defect T1 times. Furthermore, we use full master equation simulation to demonstrate the suppression of qubit energy relaxation even when interacting with 200 defect states. We conclude with an exploration of device implementation including tradeoffs between fabrication complexity and qubit performance. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Defects; Energy gap; Phonons; Quantum optics; Coupling mechanism; Electromagnetic band gaps; Multi-scale Modeling; Operating frequency; Orders of magnitude; Quantum Computing; Superconducting circuit; Superconducting qubits; Qubits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066028836

To minimise the effect of these cold temperatures, they stop their growth over the coldest months of the year, a state called dormancy. In particular, endodormancy requires accumulating chilling temperatures to finish this sort of dormancy. The accumulation of cool temperatures according to specific rules is called chilling accumulation, and each tree species and variety has specific chilling requirements for correct plant development. Under global warming, it is expected that the fulfilment of the chilling requirements to break dormancy in fruit trees could be compromised. In this study, the impact of climate change on the chilling accumulation over peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands was assessed. For this purpose, bias-adjusted results of 10 regional climate models (RCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 were used as inputs of four different models for calculating chilling accumulation, and the results for each model were individually compared for the 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 future periods under both RCPs. These results project a generalised reduction in chilling accumulation regardless of the RCP, future period or chilling calculation model used, with higher reductions for the 2071-2100 period and the RCP8.5 scenario. The projected winter chill decrease may threaten the viability of some tree crops and varieties in some areas where the crop is currently grown, but also shows scope for varieties with lower chilling requirements. The results are relevant for planning future tree plantations under climate change, supporting adaptation of spatial distribution of tree crops and varieties in Spain. © 2019 Author(s).",,"climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; dormancy; fruit; fruit production; global warming; growth response; low temperature; regional climate; spatial distribution; temperature effect; Balearic Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066818248

Observations at CO2 seeps around the world find that geological structures at a local and regional scale control the location, distribution and style of CO2 emission. Bedrock-hosted natural CO2 seepage is found in the Daylesford region in Victoria, Australia, where many natural springs contain high concentrations of dissolved CO2. Within a few meters of the natural Tipperary Mineral Spring, small CO2 bubble streams are emitted from bedrock into an ephemeral creek. We examine the relationship between structures in the exposed adjacent outcropping rocks and characteristics of CO2 gas leakage in the stream, including CO2 flux and the distribution of gas emissions. We find that degassing is clustered within ˜1 m of a shale-sandstone geological contact. CO2 emission points are localised along bedding and fracture planes, and concentrated where these features intersect. The bubble streams were intermittent, which posed difficulties in quantifying total emitted CO2. Counterintuitively, the number of bubble streams and CO2 flux was greatest from shale dominated rather than the sandstone dominated features, which forms the regional aquifer. Shallow processes must be increasing the shale permeability, thus influencing the CO2 flow pathway and emission locations. CO2 seepage is not limited to the pool; leakage was detected in subaerial rock exposures, at the intersection of bedding and orthogonal fractures. These insights show the range of spatial scales of the geological features that control CO2 flow. Microscale features and near surface processes can have significant effect on the style and location and rates of CO2 leakage. The intermittency of the bubble streams highlights challenges around characterising and monitoring CO2 stores where seepage is spatially and temporally variable. CCS monitoring programmes must therefore be informed by understanding of shallow crustal processes and not simply the processes and pathways governing CO2 fluid flow at depth. Understanding how the CO2 fluids leaked by deep pathways might be affected by shallow processes will inform the design of appropriate monitoring tools and monitoring locations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 flux; CO2 leakage; CO2 storage; Mineral springs; Natural analogues","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Emission control; Flow of fluids; Gas emissions; Geology; Location; Mineral springs; Sandstone; Seepage; Shale; Structural dynamics; Capture and storage technologies; CO2 fluxes; CO2 storage; Geological structures; Monitoring locations; Monitoring programmes; Natural analogues; Victoria , Australia; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; spring (hydrology); structural control; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062817648

Previous works showed that accounting for TSPO endothelial binding improves PET quantification for [11C]PBR28, [18F]DPA714 and [11C]-R-PK11195. It is still unclear, however, whether the vascular signal is tracer-dependent. This work aims to explore the relationship between the TSPO vascular and tissue components for PET tracers with varying affinity, also assessing the impact of affinity towards the differentiability amongst kinetics and the ensuing ligand amenability to cluster analysis for the extraction of a reference region. First, we applied the compartmental model accounting for vascular binding to [11C]-R-PK11195 data from six healthy subjects. Then, we compared the [11C]-R-PK11195 vascular binding estimates with previously published values for [18F]DPA714 and [11C]PBR28. Finally, we determined the suitability for reference region extraction by calculating the angle between grey and white matter kinetics. Our results showed that endothelial binding is common to all TSPO tracers and proportional to their affinity. By consequence, grey and white matter kinetics were most similar for the radioligand with the highest affinity (i.e. [11C]PBR28), hence poorly suited for the extraction of a reference region using supervised clustering. © The Author(s) 2017.","clustering; endothelium; kinetic modelling; microglia; neuroinflammation; reference region; Translocator protein; [11C]-R-PK11195; [11C]PBR28; [18F]DPA714","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; n sec butyl 1 (2 chlorophenyl) n methyl 3 isoquinolinecarboxamide c 11; radioligand; tracer; transcription factor; translocator protein; unclassified drug; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor; carbon; ligand; N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide; pyrazole derivative; pyrimidine derivative; TSPO protein, human; amygdala; artery blood flow; Article; binding affinity; brain blood flow; clinical article; cluster analysis; endothelial binding; gray matter; head movement; hemodynamics; hippocampus; human; human tissue; image analysis; image segmentation; kinetics; multiple sclerosis; nervous system inflammation; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; radial artery; radioactivity; tissue distribution; tracer affinity; vascular binding; volume of distribution ratio; white matter; biological model; blood; endothelium cell; metabolism; positron emission tomography; procedures; vascularization; Carbon Radioisotopes; Endothelial Cells; Gray Matter; Humans; Kinetics; Ligands; Models, Biological; Positron-Emission Tomography; Pyrazoles; Pyrimidines; Receptors, GABA; White Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044783456

The exposure to air pollutants was estimated daily for years 2010 and 2011 by combining three simulation models at the national and regional scale (CHIMERE) and at the local urban scale (ADMS-Urban or SIRANE). The spatial resolution was 4 km for the national scale model, 3–4 km for regional models and from 10 to 200 m for urban-scale models. We developed a confidence index (from 0 to 10) based on the target plot to identify the best model to estimate exposure for a given address, year and pollutant. Air pollution exposure during pregnancy was then estimated using each modeling scale for the 17,427 women participating in the ELFE cohort. We described the exposure of the women during different time windows of pregnancy using each of the three models and using the most suitable model as estimated by the confidence index. The exposure estimates obtained from the three models were quite similar and highly correlated (spearman correlation between 0.64 and 0.96), especially for the national and regional models. For NO2 and PM10 predicted by the urban models, the minimum values were lower and the maximum values and the variability were higher, compared to the regional and national models. The averaged confidence indexes were comprised between 5.6 and 8 depending on the pollutant, year and exposure model considered. The best confidence index was observed for urban modeling (10) and the lowest for the regional modeling (0). In average during pregnancy, using the most suitable model, women were exposed to 21 μg/m3 for NO2, 16 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and 24 μg/m3 for PM10. To our knowledge, this is the first study combining three modeling tools available at different scales to estimate NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at a fine spatial and temporal resolution over a large geographical area.

The effect of these schemes on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux is critical in understanding peatland carbon budgets as well as the implications for drinking water treatment. In many catchments, however, peatland areas are not the only source of DOC, meaning that their significance at the full catchment scale is unclear. In this paper we have evaluated the importance of different land uses as sources of DOC by combining three datasets obtained from the Exe catchment, UK. The first dataset comprises a weekly monitoring record at three sites for six years, the second, a monthly monitoring record of 25 sites in the same catchment for one year, and the third, an assessment of DOC export from litter and soil carbon stocks. Our results suggest that DOC concentration significantly increased from the peaty headwaters to the mixed land-use areas (ANOVA F = 12.52, p < 0.001, df = 2), leading to higher flux estimates at the downstream sites. We present evidence for three possible explanations: firstly, that poor sampling of high flows may lead to underestimation of DOC flux, second, that there are significant sources of DOC besides the peatland headwaters, and finally, that biological- and photo-degradation decreases the influence of upstream DOC sources. Our results provide evidence both for the targeting of catchment management in peatland areas as well as the need to consider DOC from agricultural and forested areas of the catchment. © 2019","Catchment management; Dissolved organic carbon (DOC); Flux estimates","Biodiversity; Budget control; Dissolution; Ecosystems; Land use; Potable water; Rivers; Runoff; Stream flow; Water quality; Water treatment; Wetlands; Carbon sequestration; Catchment management; Catchment scale; Dissolved organic carbon; DOC concentrations; Ecosystem services; Mixed land use; Soil carbon stock; Organic carbon; dissolved organic carbon; organic carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; carbon budget; catchment; dissolved organic carbon; flux measurement; headwater; land use change; peatland; soil carbon; Article; biodegradation; catchment; environmental monitoring; flow kinetics; land use; peatland; photodegradation; priority journal; United Kingdom; water flow; agriculture; carbon cycle; chemistry; city; England; environmental monitoring; forest; soil; water management; wetland; England; Exe River; United Kingdom; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Cities; England; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Soil; Water Purification; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061657638

Climate change may reduce the function of this stock as a C sink in the future due to increasing temperature. However, current knowledge on the drivers of wood decomposition is inadequate for detailed predictions. To define the factors that control wood respiration rate of Norway spruce and to produce a model that adequately describes the decomposition process of this species as a function of time, we used an unprecedentedly diverse analytical approach, which included measurements of respiration, fungal community sequencing, N 2 fixation rate, nifH copy number, 14 C-dating as well as N%, δ 13 C and C% values of wood. Our results suggest that climate change will accelerate C flux from deadwood in boreal conditions, due to the observed strong temperature dependency of deadwood respiration. At the research site, the annual C flux from deadwood would increase by 27% from the current 117 g C/kg wood with the projected climate warming (RCP4.5). The second most important control on respiration rate was the stage of wood decomposition; at early stages of decomposition low nitrogen content and low wood moisture limited fungal activity while reduced wood resource quality decreased the respiration rate at the final stages of decomposition. Wood decomposition process was best described by a Sigmoidal model, where after 116 years of wood decomposition mass loss of 95% was reached. Our results on deadwood decomposition are important for C budget calculations in ecosystem and climate change models. We observed for the first time that the temperature dependency of N 2 fixation, which has a major role at providing N for wood-inhabiting fungi, was not constant but varied between wood density classes due to source supply and wood quality. This has significant consequences on projecting N 2 fixation rates for deadwood in changing climate. © 2019 The Authors.

The islands of the Outermost Regions are also being affected by this phenomenon. When these islands have a higher level of functional complexity, climate change increases the difficulty of defining their urban and regional planning tools. A comparative analysis of the characteristics of these islands (comparing land use and demographic density) and a review of the efficacy of planning tools for incorporating climate change adaptation has been developed in order to understand the transformations produced in the regulatory frameworks. Through the case studies of Gran Canaria (Spain) and Reunion Island (France), which show high levels of urban and peri-urban land use pressure, the paper focuses on analysing the degree of mainstreaming adaptation strategies, as key elements for land use planning in a context of climate change. Results show a dysfunction between adaptation needs and the incorporation of the climatic issue in land use management. Insular planning tools do not generally consider climate change adaptation and excessive top-down management is observed in the decision-making process.

The latter launches two oppositely directed jets that precess with a period of 162 days. The system has been detected at different spatial scales in frequencies ranging from radio to gamma rays, and has long been considered as a potential neutrino source which has been observed by AMANDA in the past, and later IceCube, leading to more restrictive upper bounds on the neutrino flux. In this work, we explore the possibilities that neutrinos could be produced in the jets of this source at levels consistent, or at least, not incompatible with any current data on electromagnetic emission available. In order to do so, we consider the injection of both electrons and protons at different positions in the jets, and we compute their broadband photon emission by synchrotron and interactions with ambient photons and matter. After correcting the high energy photon flux by the effect of γγ and γN absorption, we obtain the surviving flux that arrive on Earth and compare it with observational data by gamma-ray detectors. The flux of high energy neutrinos is consistently computed and we find that if they are eventually detected with IceCube, production must take place at the inner jets, where gamma-ray absorption is important, in order to avoid current VHE constraints form HESS and MAGIC. Additionally, we find that if the flux of 25 TeV gamma-rays recently detected with HAWC and which corresponds to the jet termination region were produced mainly by pp interactions, this would lead to a too faint neutrino flux that is beyond the reach of IceCube in its present configuration. © 2019","Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal – Neutrinos; X-rays: binaries – X-rays: individual: SS433","Neutrons; Photons; Tellurium compounds; X rays; Electromagnetic emissions; Gamma ray absorption; Gamma ray detector; High energy neutrinos; High energy photons; Observational data; Radiation mechanisms: non thermal; X-rays: individual; Gamma rays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061796305

Don) is native to California and widely planted in Mediterranean climates around the world. Pitch canker, a disease caused by Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg and O'Donnell, is a serious threat to P. radiata in native forests and in plantations. Because of its economic importance worldwide, conservation of P. radiata native populations is a high priority. We developed a demographic matrix projection model to simulate dynamics of naturally occurring P. radiata populations in California in the presence of the disease. Tree demography data for the model were collected from seven sites in a native forest on the Monterey Peninsula. Height and stem diameter were recorded for all trees, which were divided into five size classes based on these data. Transition probabilities were calculated for each size class; cone production, seed release, and seed transition probability were estimated using an iterative search process. In the model, pitch canker influences state-specific fecundity and survival probabilities. Five different approaches to include these effects were compared. Populations were projected over 50 decades from three specified initial population sizes. Elasticity analysis indicated that facilitating survival of all size classes is vital to maintaining the structure of the forest. © 2019 by the authors.","Disease; Forest modeling; Growth and yield; Monterey pine; Pitch canker","Diseases; Fungi; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Probability; Forest modeling; Growth and yield; Mediterranean climates; Monterey pine; Pitch canker; Pitch canker disease; Survival probabilities; Transition probabilities; Forestry; coniferous tree; demography; fungal disease; fungus; growth rate; modeling; native species; population dynamics; population size; yield response; California; Diseases; Forestry; Fungi; Pinus Radiata; Probability; California; Monterey Peninsula; United States; Gibberella circinata; Pinus radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066245442

This compound is present in sludge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and because of its bactericidal characteristics, it can inhibit the methanogenic activity in anaerobic digestion (AD) technology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic effects of TCS on the methanogenic activity. Results: Batch anaerobic reactors were used with TCS concentrations of 7.8, 15.7, 23.5, and 31.4 mg/L. These assays consisted in three successive feedings (I, II, and III), wherein the sludge was exposed to each TCS concentration and volatile fatty acid (VFA) substrate. For evaluation of the residual sludge activity during feeding III, only VFA was used. The results showed that the increase in TCS concentrations correlated with the reduction in methane (CH 4 ) production. In this case, the minimum values were achieved for TCS concentration of 31.4 mg/L with CH 4 levels between 101.9 and 245.3 during feedings I, II, and III. Regarding the effect of TCS on VFA consumption, an inhibitory effect was detected for TCS concentrations of 23.5 and 31.4 mg/L, with concentrations of acetic, butyric, and propionic acids at the end of the assay (37 d) between 153.6 and 206.8, 62.5 and 60.1, and 93.4 and 110 mg/L, respectively. Regarding the removal of TCS during AD, these values were above 47%. Conclusion: TCS is an inhibitor of methanogenic activity with a decrease between 63 and 70% during the different feedings. The CH 4 production was not recovered during feeding III, with inhibition percentages of 21–72%. How to cite: Reyes-Contreras C, Leiva AM, Vidal G.

The case studies were carried out for two house types with different sizes and construction materials, under two typical occupancy patterns (occupied full day and evening only), in seven cities chosen to be representative of a broad range of climates. The study examined three operational scenarios: off-grid operation using PV and batteries; off-grid operation with PV, battery and petrol generator; and grid-connected net zero energy operation. Results show that for the houses being powered by electricity only in warm and moderate climates, large PV battery systems are required to achieve off-grid housing using PV and batteries only, and that payback periods are longer than 15.8 years under current and projected future climates considering replacement cost of battery storage, and projected inflation, discount rate and electricity price escalation rate. Off-grid operation with PV and batteries is economically unviable in heating dominated regions. The study shows that when a PV battery system is hybridized with an on-site petrol generator, the payback periods can be reduced significantly, and it may become economically feasible to operate off-grid with PV, battery and generator for both house types under most occupancy scenarios in moderate and warmer climates, but may still not be economically viable in colder climates. The case study also demonstrates that a grid-connected net zero energy home is economically feasible for all seven cities studied, and more economically attractive than a fully off-grid house under both current and projected future climates, even without subsidies for solar feed-in tariffs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Future global warming climate; Off-grid housing; PV battery system; Residential building simulation","Building materials; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Gasoline; Global warming; Heating; Houses; Investments; Battery systems; Building simulation; Economically viable; Electricity prices; Off-grids; Operational scenario; Residential building; Warming climate; Electric power transmission networks; building; discount rate; energy market; feasibility study; global warming; housing; photovoltaic system; residential energy; simulation; smart grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062614108

Despite the lack of evidence, a common public health recommendation is to remain indoors, assuming that the home provides a protective barrier against ambient PM2.5. The study aimed to assess to what extent houses provide protection against peak concentrations of outdoor PM2.5 and whether remaining indoors is an effective way of reducing exposure to PM2.5. The effectiveness of this strategy was evaluated by conducting simultaneous week-long indoor and outdoor measurements of PM2.5 at 21 residences in regional areas of Victoria, Australia. During smoke plume events, remaining indoors protected residents from peak outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, but the level of protection was highly variable, ranging from 12% to 76%. Housing stock (e.g., age of the house) and ventilation (e.g., having windows/doors open or closed) played a significant role in the infiltration of outdoor PM2.5 indoors. The results also showed that leaving windows and doors closed once the smoke plume abates trapped PM2.5 indoors and increased indoor exposure to PM2.5. Furthermore, for approximately 50% of households, indoor sources such as cooking activities, smoking, and burning candles or incense contributed significantly to indoor PM2.5. Implications: Smoke from biomass burning sources can significantly impact on communities. Remaining indoors with windows and doors closed is a common recommendation by health authorities to minimize exposures to peak concentrations of fine particles during smoke plume events. Findings from this study have shown that the protection from fine particles in biomass burning smoke is highly variable among houses, with information on housing age and ventilation status providing an approximate assessment on the protection of a house. Leaving windows closed once a smoke plume abates traps particles indoors and increases exposures. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Biomass; Health; Houses; Smoke; Ventilation; Aerodynamic diameters; Biomass burning smokes; Fine particulate matter; Outdoor measurements; Peak concentrations; PM2.5 concentration; Residential wood burning; Victoria , Australia; Indoor air pollution; air conditioning; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; housing; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; Victoria; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Monitoring; Housing; Particulate Matter; Ventilation; Victoria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062357649

In this study, the cooling potential of all green spaces in Lisbon was estimated. For that, several mobile measurements of air temperature data were made in a single park (Gulbenkian's Garden). These measurements were used for the interpolation of air temperature. Furthermore, urban biomass was estimated using remote sensing products, namely Landsat satellite images. Ultimately, a linear regression model was built from the relation between vegetation density and air temperature. Results regarding the estimation of biomass (AGB) in the city of Lisbon were higher in winter than in summer. The urban green spaces cooling potential model showed that for every decrease of 1 °C in air temperature between a measuring point and a reference station we need to increase the area covered by vegetation by 50 m2 (planar measure). This methodology can be applied in other urban areas for the quantification of the cooling effect provided by vegetation in order to improve urban climate thermal conditions and human well-being and, consequently, to mitigate some consequences of future climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Above Ground Biomass (AGB); Cooling Park Effect; Lisbon; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Urban Heat Island (UHI); Vegetation cooling potential","aboveground biomass; climate change; cooling; greenspace; heat island; heating; Landsat; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite imagery; urban climate; urban ecosystem; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066933839

Epoxy resin was reinforced with 1-D and 2-D nanomaterials in a wide range of load for a detailed study: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.0 wt. %. It is observed that carbon nanomaterials’ dimensionality influences its ability to transfer their unique properties to the nanocomposites. In this work, carbon nanotubes are more suitable than reduced graphene oxide to improve some properties, even though graphene-related materials have outperformed 1-D nanomaterials in other research. Tensile tests of nanocomposites show the best increment, with loads of 0.7 and 0.1 wt. % carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide, respectively. Tensile strength at these loads is ∼120 % higher than epoxy resin, but the load for obtaining the best mechanical performance is different for each nanomaterial. Electrical conductivity measurements show that 1-D nanostructures are able to form conductive paths better than nanosheets. In this work, carbon nanotubes yield up to three magnitude orders higher than reduced graphene oxide. The highest initial storage modulus is achieved by employing 1-D nanomaterials and contributes to improving the thermomechanical stability. Therefore, the dimensionality of carbon nanomaterials impacts the properties of nanocomposites, and each nanostructure is able to improve the matrix at different regions of the load. © 2019 by ASTM International.","Carbon nanotubes; Electrical properties; Epoxy resin; Graphene; Mechanical properties; Polymer nanocomposites","Carbon nanotubes; Electric properties; Epoxy resins; Mechanical properties; Nanocomposites; Nanosheets; Nanostructured materials; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Thermosets; Yarn; 1-D nanostructures; Carbon nano-materials; Electrical conductivity measurements; Mechanical performance; Polymer nanocomposite; Reduced graphene oxides; Thermo-mechanical; Thermomechanical stability; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066606372

Umm Al-Zaytun village in As-Suwayda province was chosen as a location of the plant, because it is characterized by the high annual solar irradiance on the horizontal surface of about 1900 kW h/m2. Technical performance analysis, system configuration, detailed losses and energy yield simulation for a proposed PV plant were performed, using the PVsyst software. The simulation results show, that the annual optimal tilt angle of PV modules is 25°, energy production is 493 MWh/yr, the annual average performance ratio is 0.799 and the capacity factor is 18.7%. In addition, by considering, that the electric power consumption per capita in Syria is 2232 kW h/yr, so the proposed solar power plant with 493 MW h/yr can provide energy to 220 capita/yr and save about 42.4 tons of oil equivalent yearly with carbon emission reduction of about 320.45 tCO2/yr. The economic evaluation of the proposed PV plant was carried out by Excel software with consideration, that the discount rate is 9%, the lifetime of the project is 25 years and the selling price of electricity to Syrian electricity distribution establishment is 0.119 $/kW h. The results of economic calculations show, that levelized cost of electricity is 0.094 $/kW h, the discounted payback period is about 11 years, the internal rate of return is 14%, profitability index is 1.46 and the net present value is 190587.3 $. As a result, the proposed grid-connected PV solar plant is considered economically, technically and environmentally feasible in Syria. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.","economic; energy; IRR; irradiance; LOCE; loss; NPV; perfomance; plant; PV module; PVsyst; solar; technical","Computer software; Earnings; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric utilities; Emission control; Investments; Losses; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; energy; irradiance; LOCE; Perfomance; plant; PV modules; PVsyst; solar; technical; Aluminum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074188547

Previous studies have examined the theoretical frameworks that have shaped the concept development of resilience. However, little is known about the theoretical approaches adopted by building professionals in their climate change resilience work. A literature review identified climate change resilience across four academic domains: ecology, engineering, disaster risk reduction, and the social sciences. To better understand how resilience is defined in the building sector, we examined eighteen climate change resilience documents developed to provide guidance to building sector professionals in the United States. Our analysis of these documents helps to understand how professionals are framing and possibly incorporating these strategies in their work, though we did not measure the adoption rate of each of the documents. We find that resilience is mostly a discourse on bouncing-back, preserving the status quo, and/or developing emergency responses to major hazards. Fewer documents incorporated an ecological or social science-based logic.

Public acceptance, which favors or deters the utilization of biomass, could be impacted by feedstock supply logistics. Feedstock requirement of district heating plants depends on the heat demand from the consumer and biomass quality characteristics, which vary over time. Previous studies on utilizing biomass for district heating mostly assumed average feedstock quality characteristics and aggregated heat demand values without considering their daily variations. While using average quality characteristics provides the average feedstock requirement of the plant, the actual requirement may vary significantly from the average value when daily variations in quality characteristics are considered. Not including these variations could lead to infeasibilities in meeting the heat demand of the plant. This study assesses the feedstock requirement of expanding a district heating plant considering daily variations in biomass quality characteristics and heat demand. A Microsoft Excel-based simulation model with one-year planning horizon and daily time steps is developed for the assessment. The costs and CO2-eq emissions of using different feedstock types are evaluated with and without trucking limitations. The developed model is applied to a real biomass-fed district heating plant at the University of British Columbia, Canada. The capacity of the heating plant is planned to be expanded from 6 MW to 18 MW. Three feedstock types, namely, wood residues, pellets and briquettes, and a mix of them are assessed. The results suggest that when enough trucking capacity is available, the plant would receive 2–9 truckloads of wood residues or 1–3 truckloads of pellets/briquettes. The expansion could reduce the total CO2 emissions by about 11,000 tonnes compared to those emitted by the 6 MW (current) biomass-fed heating capacity and natural gas (for a total of 18 MW) when sufficient biomass is available to the plant. However, when trucking is limited, using only wood residues could cause biomass shortage for almost half of the year and result in more emissions due to natural gas consumption. Utilizing energy dense feedstock, such as pellets and briquettes, could mitigate the effects of limited trucking, though, the total fuel cost could increase by 76% and 58%, respectively, compared to using only wood residues. Using a mix of wood residues and pellets/briquettes could achieve a reasonable trade-off between emission reduction and unit fuel cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Cost and emission assessment; District heating system; Logistics; Scenario analysis; Simulation","Biomass; Briquets; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; District heating; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Expansion; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Heating equipment; Logistics; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Pelletizing; Plant expansion; Space heating; Trucks; Wood; Zoning; District heating system; District-heating plants; Emission reduction; Natural gas consumption; Quality characteristic; Scenario analysis; Simulation; University of British Columbia; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063209979

Differences between the CAMD and EIA emission tallies show that the amount of CO2 produced by an individual power plant is less certain than might be imagined or desired. These differences are attributed to systematic error and random measurement error. Random error cannot be retroactively corrected, whereas systematic error can be corrected where relevant data are available. Accordingly, this study identified and, where possible, corrected systematic error affecting the CAMD and EIA CO2 emission tallies for 1065 power plants that emitted more than 25,000 tons of CO2 during 2013. The EIA tallies were corrected by accounting for emission factor error, acid-gas sorbent consumption, and combustion of biogenic fuel. The CAMD tallies were likewise corrected by accounting for unreported unit emissions. It was not possible to objectively correct systematic error affecting about 11% of the power plants, and subjective corrections were not attempted. At these plants, the CAMD and EIA emission tallies sometimes differed by more than 20% due to missing unit error, plant identification error, temporal measurement error, or inferred reporting error. Comparisons of the CAMD and EIA emission tallies before and after correction for systematic error show the effectiveness of these corrections. The comparisons also show the persistence of random measurement error. Implications: Understanding the uncertainty of CO2 emission tallies for USA power plants might inform emission inventories, atmospheric flow models or inversions, and emission reduction policies. Knowing the cause and size of measurement errors that contribute to this uncertainty might also help to identify ways to improve the measurement methods and reporting protocols that these CO2 emission tallies are based on. © 2019, © 2019 Utah Geological Survey.",,"Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Global warming; Measurement errors; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Emission inventories; Emission reduction policies; Plant identification; Random measurement errors; Temporal measurements; U.s. energy information administrations; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; air pollutant; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; procedures; uncertainty; United States; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Power Plants; Uncertainty; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063142871

This paper is a rapid review of the evidence behind air quality strategies and technologies. It was conducted according to the principles of a systematic review, and includes both academic and ""grey"" literature sources. It focuses on road transport in urban areas, because air pollution tends to be worse in cities, and the main source is fossil fuel vehicles. It draws on the environmental science and policy literature to provide interdisciplinary insight into the most effective air quality policy measures. The most promising initiatives include active travel infrastructure, roadside barriers, low emission zones, and low speed limits. Technologies which remove pollution from the air largely remain unproven, especially at the scale needed to make a significant impact. The combinations of policies from three cities which rank highly for air quality are reviewed; one important finding is that policies are most effective when they are a part of a mutually reinforcing suite of measures. Policies consistent across the cities studied are good public transport coverage, a good cycle network, and financial incentives for electric vehicle purchase. © 2019 by the authors.","Active travel; Air pollution; Air pollution policies; Air quality; Behavioural change; Electric vehicles; Emissions; Private vehicles; Public transport; Urban transport","air quality; atmospheric pollution; behavioral response; electric vehicle; emission; interdisciplinary approach; public health; public transport; road transport; strategic approach; traffic emission",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067091837

Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) water management is effective and saves water. However, practical examples of AWD at the district or on-farm level are limited. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of AWD in experimental block units (conventional, weak-dry, and strong-dry) in paddy fields of about 44 ha in the Red River Delta area of Vietnam by examining the effects of intermittent irrigation (i.e., AWD) on the ponding depth, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions, and rice yield in blocked experimental plots. Intermittent irrigation was expected to be achieved through the operation of irrigation pumps and sluice gates of water division works by the water management organization (water user group) of the district. However, the ponding depth was not controlled as initially planned because of frequent rainfall and low rate of decrease of the ponding depth in the study area. It was, however, confirmed that the period during which the ponding depth decreased below the soil surface was mostly (but not always) longer in the dry-type blocks. CH 4 emissions decreased with an increase in drying period and this reduction was large in the summer-autumn season. There appeared to be no relationship between N 2 O emissions and water management. Rice yield decreased due to extreme drying in the summer-autumn season but was not affected by drying in the winter-spring season. This study demonstrated that CH 4 emissions can be reduced and rice yield can be maintained by achieving a maximum drying index (i.e., ratio of the period during which the ponding depth is below the soil surface) of 0.6 in the summer-autumn season in the paddy fields of the target area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alternate wetting and drying; Greenhouse gas; On-farm water management; Water management organization","Drying; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Nitrogen oxides; Ponding; Wetting; Experimental plots; Intermittent irrigations; Nitrous oxide emissions; Rice cultivation; Water management systems; Water shortages; Water user groups; WETTING AND DRYING; Water management; agricultural emission; crop yield; cultivation; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; paddy field; rice; seasonal variation; soil surface; water management; wetting-drying cycle; Red River Delta; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062399850

To satisfy the target tracking requirement and control the whole system emission, we propose a nonmyopic sensor scheduling to minimize the emission cost while maintaining a desired tracking accuracy. The processes of target tracking and emission control are formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process. Then, we translate our scheduling problem to a discrete unconstrained optimization problem, which consists of multistep emission cost and multistep tracking accuracy cost. Furthermore, the cubature Kalman filter is utilized to update the target belief state and predict the multistep tracking accuracy cost, whereas the multistep emission cost is obtained by hidden Markov model filter. Scheduling is implemented efficiently by constructing a decision tree and using a search algorithm, which combines uniform cost search with augmented branch and bound technique.

This paper focuses on the simulation-based nationwide energy savings analysis of different energy conservation measures (ECMs) to enhance building energy performance. The study includes 44 different ECMs, which were simulated in 16 different climate zones for 11 different commercial building types in the U.S. Simulations were conducted using a whole building simulation program, EnergyPlus. Commercial prototype building models from the U.S. Department of Energy [1] were used as the baselines. Model input files were automatically modified to incorporate with 44 different ECMs using scripts. The baselines were based on American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) [2] Standard 90.1 and International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). A total of 15,488 simulations were conducted to study the nationwide energy savings potentials. The details of these 44 proposed ECMs and their corresponding nationwide saving potentials are presented and discussed in this paper. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy conservation measure; EnergyPlus; Large scale simulation; Nationwide energy savings","Air conditioning; Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Office buildings; Building efficiency; Building energy performance; Commercial building; Energy conservation measures; Energy savings potential; EnergyPlus; Large scale simulations; U.S. Department of Energy; Historic preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063225204

However, few studies have characterized the spatial distribution of WTP, explored its “hypothetical bias” or analyzed its relationship with air pollutant concentrations. To address this gap in knowledge, a nationwide empirical study (N = 9744) was conducted from December 2016 to February 2017 in China. The contingent valuation method (CVM) was adopted to assess WTP based on a scenario, and air purifier costs (APCs) incurred by the public were used as an indicator of WTP in the real-life scenario. The results show that the mean value of APCs (243.81 CNY(year⋅person) −1 ) is lower than WTP (275.39 CNY(year⋅person) −1 ), which means that the Chinese public may not pay as much money for clean air in the actual scenario as in the WTP scenario. This result is important for predicting and evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of air pollution economic policies. We also observed significant spatial differences in APCs: the public in more heavily polluted areas such as the eastern coastal region, northern coastal region, Middle Yellow River region and northeast region have higher APCs than the public in other regions, the proportion of people who purchased air purifiers and the distribution of APCs positively correlated with concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 (PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O 3 ), while no significant spatial difference or correlation relationship was observed for WTP. This result indicates that pollutant concentration is not the main driving factor of WTP but they are driving factors for APCs, which may provide new evidence for the driving factors of WTP and APCs. Finally, the policy implications behind these results are discussed, providing references and scientific support for policy makers and subsequent research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Air purifier; Contingent valuation method; Hypothetical bias; Risk perception; Willingness to pay","Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Coastal zones; Economics; Nitrogen oxides; Public policy; Risk perception; River pollution; Aerodynamic diameters; Air pollutant concentrations; Contingent valuation methods; Hypothetical bias; Pollutant concentration; Pollution mitigation; Spatial differences; Willingness to pay; Air cleaners",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061306406

Interventions that promote positive school climate may reduce the risk of victimization and adverse mental health outcomes in SMY. This study explored whether lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ)–inclusive sex education is associated with adverse mental health and school-based victimization in U.S. youth. Methods: Data analysis of representative data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the 2014 School Health Profiles was conducted using multilevel logistic models testing whether youth in states with higher proportions of schools teaching LGBTQ-inclusive sex education had lower odds of reporting being bullied in school and experiencing adverse mental health outcomes, including depressive symptoms and suicidality. Results: After controlling for covariates, protective effects for all youth were found for suicidal thoughts (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]:.89–.93) and making a suicide plan (AOR:.79; 95% CI:.77–.80). Lesbian and gay youth had lower odds of experiencing bullying in school as the proportion of schools within a state teaching LGBTQ-inclusive sex education increased (AOR:.83; CI:.71–.97). Bisexual youth had significantly lower odds of reporting depressive symptoms (AOR:.92; 95% CI:.87–.98). Conclusions: Students in states with a greater proportion of LGBTQ-inclusive sex education have lower odds of experiencing school-based victimization and adverse mental health. These findings can be used to guide intervention development at the school and state levels. © 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Bullying; Inclusive sex education; Mental health; School climate; Sexual minority youth","adolescent depression; adolescent health; adolescent sexual behavior; Article; bisexuality; bullying; female; health survey; heterosexuality; high school student; homophobia; homosexual female; homosexual male; human; male; mental health; outcome assessment; priority journal; risk factor; sexual and gender minority; sexual education; suicide; transgender; United States; adolescent; crime victim; mental disease; psychology; questionnaire; school; student; suicidal ideation; Adolescent; Bullying; Crime Victims; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Schools; Sex Education; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Students; Suicidal Ideation; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060448208

There is also a need to identify the major mesoscale influences on the distributions of types of saltmarsh, obligate saltmarsh plants and salt pans, and evaluate possible responses to macroclimatic changes. Tidal saltmarshes of Tasmania and its offshore islands (coastline of 4,882 km, spanning latitudes 39°40′ to 43°40′S), off south-eastern Australia, were mapped at a high spatial resolution of 1 : 500–1 : 3,000. The distributions of types of saltmarsh, obligate plant taxa and salt pans were related to climatic, geomorphic and land-use variation. The future distribution of climatically controlled species and communities was determined for two climate change scenarios. There was 58.6 km2 of tidal saltmarsh in Tasmania in 61 mesoscale complexes. The complexes were classified into three broad saltmarsh groups, which together offer a more ecologically relevant planning unit for saltmarsh conservation than macroscale bioregions. The small median patch size of 0.2 ha demonstrates the effectiveness of the manual interpretation and mapping with extensive field checking. Mapping of these smaller saltmarshes provides them recognition within the land use planning and approvals process. Climatic, but not geomorphic and land-use, factors have strong effects on the distribution of saltmarsh plant communities, species and salt pans in Tasmania. Mean annual rainfall was most significant in predicting saltmarsh extent, range, plant community composition, salt pans and the three saltmarsh groups. Mean annual daily minimum temperature and saltmarsh area best predicted obligate plant distributions. Projected wetter and drier climatic change by 2100 is not expected to substantially alter macroscale plant community patterns but may reduce the range of the rare herb Wilsonia humilis R.Br. However, stochastic disturbances may continue to play an important role at local scales. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","agriculture; biogeography; climate change; coastal; distribution; habitat mapping; intertidal; urban development; vegetation; wetland","biogeography; climate change; coastal zone; community composition; conservation status; geographical distribution; intertidal environment; land use planning; mapping method; patch size; plant community; saltmarsh; species inventory; urban development; wetland; Australia; Tasmania; Wilsonia humilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065286744

The advantage of target loads over critical loads is that one can define the deposition and the point in time (target year) when the critical (chemical) limit is no longer violated. This information on the timing of recovery requires dynamic modeling. Using a well-documented dynamic model, target loads for acidic deposition were determined for 848 surface waters across Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom for the target year 2050. In the majority of sites (n = 675), the critical ANC-limit was predicted to be achieved by 2050; however, for 127 sites, target loads were determined. In addition, 46 sites were infeasible, i.e., even a reduction of anthropogenic deposition to zero would not achieve the limit by 2050. The average maximum target load for sulfur was 38% lower than the respective critical load across the study lakes (n = 127).

Changes in patterns of outdoor aeroallergens caused by increasing temperatures and amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are major factors linked to increased duration of pollen seasons, increased pollen production, and possibly increased allergenicity of pollen. Indoor air pollution threats anticipated from climate changes include microbial and mold growth secondary to flooding, resulting in displacement of persons and need for respiratory protection of exposed workers. Air pollution from indoor burning of mosquito repellants is a potential anticipatory result of an increase in habitat regions. Air pollution from fossil fuel burning and traffic-related emissions can alter respiratory defense mechanisms and work synergistically with specific allergens to enhance immunogenicity to worsen asthma in susceptible subjects. Community efforts can significantly reduce air pollution, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emission and improving air quality.

This study used a spatial logistic regression model to estimate the probability that mills in the southern United States will be willing to use additional logging residues based on their geographical location and proximity to existing transportation networks, other mills, forested areas, and city centers. Information on mill willingness to use logging residues was collected through a mail survey, whereas data on geospatial factors were obtained from public online databases. Mills were more likely to use additional logging residues if they were close to a major road; a sawmill; a pulp, paper, and paperboard mill; and a post mill. Mills close to a major river, a mill classified as producing other forest products, a forest, and a city center were less likely to use additional logging residues. Results will be helpful in identifying mills and outlying geographic locations best suited for electricity production using logging residues as well as prioritizing bioenergy investments.

This study in particular seeks to identify to what extent livelihoods have been either positively or negatively affected by relocation, and whether these relocations have successfully reduced exposure to climate-related hazards. This study shows that planned climate-induced relocations have the potential to improve the livelihoods of affected communities, yet if these relocations are not managed and undertaken carefully, they can lead to unintended negative impacts, including exposure to other hazards. We find that inclusive community involvement in the planning process, regular and intentional monitoring and evaluation, and improving livelihoods through targeted livelihood planning should be accounted for in future relocations to ensure outcomes are beneficial and sustainable. © 2019 by the authors.","Exposure; Livelihoods; Migration; Pacific Islands; Relocation; Resettlement; SIDS; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067276671

Accumulating climate impacts are putting an increased burden on the service provision of already stressed health care systems in many regions of the world. At the same time, the Paris agreement requires rapid emission reductions in all sectors of the global economy to stay well below the 2 C target. This study shows that in OECD countries, China, and India, health care on average accounts for 5% of the national CO2 footprint making the sector comparable in importance to the food sector. Some countries have seen reduced CO2 emissions related to health care despite growing expenditures since 2000, mirroring their economy wide emission trends. The average per capita health carbon footprint across the country sample in 2014 was 0.6 tCO2, varying between 1.51 tCO2/cap in the US and 0.06 tCO2/cap in India. A statistical analysis shows that the carbon intensity of the domestic energy system, the energy intensity of the domestic economy, and health care expenditure together explain half of the variance in per capita health carbon footprints. Our results indicate that important leverage points exist inside and outside the health sector. We discuss our findings in the context of the existing literature on the potentials and challenges of reducing GHG emissions in the health and energy sector. © 2019 The Author(s).

Three flow-through experiments were performed at a temperature of 185 °C and a total pressure of 22.5 ± 2.5 MPa. They consisted in injecting a hydrothermal fluid with different concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2 = 6.26, 62.6 and 659.7 mmol·L −1 i.e. pCO 2 = 0.1, 1 and 10 MPa, respectively) into cylinders of sintered San Carlos (Arizona, USA) olivine grains. The results show that for low pCO 2 conditions (from 0.1 to 1 MPa), olivine is mainly altered into hematite and Mg(Fe)-rich phyllosilicates. Such iddingsitic-type assemblages may clog most of the rock flow paths, resulting in a strong decrease in permeability. Rare Ca-Fe-carbonate minerals also precipitated under these conditions despite the initial Mg-rich system. For higher pCO 2 conditions (∼10 MPa), olivine is more efficiently altered. A greater amount of poorly crystallized Fe(Mg)-rich phyllosilicates and magnesite is produced, and the carbonation rate of olivine is 3–11 times higher than when the pCO 2 is 10–100 times lower. Interestingly, the changes in porosity caused by the formation of carbonated and hydrous minerals are small while a strong decrease in permeability is measured during the experiments. The formation of reduced carbon is also observed. It is located preferentially at the inlet, where pH is the lowest. This testifies to a competition between reduction (probably associated with the oxidation of ferrous iron) and carbonation; two processes involved in the fixation of CO 2 in a mineral form. One may speculate that the formation of reduced carbon can also be a significant mechanism of CO 2 sequestration in olivine-dominated basements. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonation; Fluid flow; Olivine; Permeability; Porosity; Reactive-percolation experiments; Reduced carbon","basement rock; carbon dioxide; experimental study; fluid flow; hydrothermal alteration; mass transfer; olivine; peridotite; permeability; porosity; reduction; Arizona; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062507064

The monitoring activities for abiotic parameters regard air and soil temperatures, rainfall, snowfall and snow cover persistence. A comparative analysis of changes in species composition, life forms, life strategies and morpho-functional types allowed recognition of dynamical processes (fluctuation and degeneration) and an increase in stress- and drought-tolerant and ruderal species, probably linked to a general process of climate change. A trend of variation forced by increasing drought was recorded in high-mountain plant communities, normally within a dynamic fluctuation process. There has been a 50–80% change in species composition with respect to the total number of species observed over the years. Whereas the total number of species has increased in all communities, in high-mountain mesic grassland 20% of sensitive species have completely disappeared. Early signs of a degeneration process were already discernible after seven years: such signs are more evident in snow-dependent communities, with a quantitative increase in more thermophilic and drought-tolerant species and a parallel decrease in more mesic, cryophilic and competitive species. In particular, the following phenomena have been recorded in high-mountain mesic grassland, in agreement with predicted or observed phenomena in other Alpine or Arctic areas: (a) coverage increase (or appearance) of ruderal and stress- and drought-tolerant species; (b) coverage decrease (or disappearance) of cryophilic, mesic and competitive species. These short-term changes could lead, in the medium- or long-term, to a disgregation process affecting the high elevation plant communities of the Apennines (including the local extinction of most of the cold-adapted species), due to their very low resilience. The phenomena described may be linked to the observed climate change which occurred during the last century (in particular in the last 50 years) in the Apennines, consisting mainly, in the mountains, of a strong reduction in the duration of snow-cover and an increase in mean and minimum annual temperatures.

This new edition pushes the frontier of the biodiversity/agriculture debate further, making an even stronger case for the need to transform agriculture and support small- and medium-scale agroecology and food sovereignty. In the first edition, the authors set out a radical new approach to the conservation of biodiversity. This is based on the concept of a landscape as a matrix of diverse, small-scale agricultural ecosystems, providing opportunities to enhance conservation under the stewardship of local farmers. This contrasts with the alternative view of industrial-scale farms and large protected areas which exclude local people. However, since then the debate around conservation and agriculture has developed significantly and this is reflected in this updated second edition. The text is thoroughly revised, including: a reorganization of chapters with new and timely topics introduced, updates to the discussion of agroecology and food sovereignty, bringing it in line with the current debates, greater coverage of the role of agroecology, in particular agroforestry, as an important component of climate change adaptation and mitigation, highlighting recent studies on the role of intensive agriculture in climate change and loss of biodiversity, and more attention given to the discussion of land sparing versus land sharing. By integrating the ecological aspects of agriculture and conservation biology, with a political and social analysis as well as historical perspective, the book continues to set a progressive agenda and appeals to a wide range of students and professionals. © 2019 Ivette Perfecto, John Vandermeer and Angus Wright.

Emissions trading as a market measure is internationally acceptable because of its cost-effectiveness. Traditional emissions trading research has usually ignored the effect of exchange rates and has adopted top-down methods to analyze how transactions proceed. These transactions may lead to environmental quality deterioration and cannot clearly reflect the transaction processes. Based on these two points, an agent-based model was used to study three regions' SO 2 emissions trading processes in China, and the cost-effectiveness was analyzed by the three policy scenarios of Emissions Trading with the Exchange rate (ETE), Emissions Trading without the exchange rate (ET), and Command and Control regulations (C&amp;C). The results show that the ETE system was more cost-effective than the ET and C&amp;C systems. The average total SO 2 emissions of all three scenarios satisfied the cap's requirement, but the average SO 2 abatement cost in the ETE system can save 0.76 and 25.04 CNY/ton compared with the ET and C&amp;C systems, respectively. Additionally, the ET system may lead to the “hot spots” issue, which means that during the process of emissions trading, the pollutant transaction may focus on some fixed regions (or firms) and cause their emissions to be higher. The ETE system can effectively avoid the problem of “hot spots” to a certain extent. Thus, it is suggested that the exchange rate should be considered in the future trading policy designs of China's pilot programs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based model; Cost-effectiveness; Discrete pollutant abatement cost function; Emissions trading; Exchange rate","Air quality; Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost functions; Deterioration; Emission control; Environmental protection; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Command and control; Emissions Trading; Environmental quality; Exchange rates; Pollutant abatement; Reducing emissions; Transaction process; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062144533

Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are sensitive to the length (depth) scale over which respiration converts POC back to inorganic carbon, because shallower waters exchange with the atmosphere more rapidly than deeper ones. However, estimates of this carbon regeneration length scale and its spatiotemporal variability are limited, hindering the ability to characterize its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we present a zonal section of POC fluxes at high vertical and spatial resolution from the GEOTRACES GP16 transect in the eastern tropical South Pacific, based on normalization to the radiogenic thorium isotope 230Th. We find shallower carbon regeneration length scales than previous estimates for the oligotrophic South Pacific gyre, indicating less efficient carbon transfer to the deep ocean. Carbon regeneration is strongly inhibited within suboxic waters near the Peru coast. Canonical Martin curve power laws inadequately capture POC flux profiles at suboxic stations. We instead fit these profiles using an exponential function with flux preserved at depth, finding shallow regeneration but high POC sequestration below 1,000 m. Both regeneration length scales and POC flux at depth closely track the depths at which oxygen concentrations approach zero. Our findings imply that climate warming will result in reduced ocean carbon storage due to expanding oligotrophic gyres, but opposing effects on ocean carbon storage from expanding suboxic waters will require modeling and future work to disentangle. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Due to its exponential increase in the atmosphere and its implications in climate change there is the need to develop strategies to mitigate its emissions and to reduce it to the inert dinitrogen gas. Only three enzymes have been reported to be able to reduce nitrous oxide, namely nitrogenase, one multicopper oxidase and nitrous oxide reductase, with the latter being the only one with a relevant physiological activity. In this enzyme, reduction of nitrous oxide occurs in a unique catalytic tetranuclear sulfide center, named “CuZ” center, a complex center required to overcome the high activation barrier of this reaction. Nitrous oxide reductase can be isolated with “CuZ” center in two forms, CuZ*(4Cu1S) and CuZ(4Cu2S), that differ in their catalytic and spectroscopic properties. Recently, another step towards a better understanding of the catalytic and activation mechanism of this enzyme was taken by identifying and spectroscopically characterizing an intermediate species of its catalytic cycle, CuZ 0 . A different approach for N 2 O reduction can be attained using model compounds. The unique structural motif present in “CuZ” center, a Cu 4 (µ 4 -S), has been a challenge for inorganic synthesis but several synthetic clusters that mimic different forms of “CuZ” center have been reported. Model compounds for the oxidation states involved in N 2 O reduction are also available. The advances in this area will be discussed in light of the recent data, with structural and functional model compounds of N 2 OR active site. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CuA center; CuZ center; Denitrification, CuZ model compounds; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide reductase",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062717693

The transition metal oxide semiconductors (e.g. TiO2, WO3, ZnO, and ZrO2)are have been widely used as photocatalysts for the hydrogen generation. Because of safety, low cost, chemical inertness, photostability and other characteristics (bandgap, corrosion resistance, thermal and environmental stability), TiO2 is considered as a most potential catalyst of the semiconductors being investigated and developed. However, the extensive applications of TiO2 are hampered by its inability to exploit the solar energy of visible region. Other demerits are lesser absorbance under visible light, and recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In this review, we focus on the all the possible reactions taking place at the catalyst during photo-induced H2 from water splitting reaction, which is green and promising technology. Various parameter affecting the photocatalytic water splitting reactions are also studied. Predominantly, this review is focussed on bandgap engineering of TiO2 such as the upward shift of valence band and downward shift of conduction bands by doping process to extend its light absorption property into the visible region. Furthermore, the recent advances in this direction including various new strategies of synthesis, multiple doping, hetero-junction, functionalization, perspective and future opportunities of non-metals-doped TiO2-based nanostructured photocatalysts for various photocatalytic applications such as efficient hydrogen production, air purification and CO2 reduction to valuable chemicals have been discussed. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Bandgap engineering; CO2 reduction; Hydrogen production; Metal and non-metal dopants; Photocatalytic air purification; TiO2 nanostructures","Air cleaners; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Chemical stability; Corrosion resistance; Energy gap; II-VI semiconductors; Light; Light absorption; Magnetic semiconductors; MOS devices; Nanostructures; Oxide semiconductors; Photocatalytic activity; Semiconductor doping; Solar energy; Titanium dioxide; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Wide band gap semiconductors; Zinc oxide; Zirconia; Band gap engineering; CO2 reduction; Environmental stability; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic application; Photocatalytic water splitting; Photogenerated electrons; Water splitting reactions; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064211362

Among others, the “Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy” is the most acknowledged, providing local governments with the opportunity to overcome the mitigation-adaptation dichotomy and enhance urban resilience. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the synergy between adaptation and mitigation actions in some European Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans at an urban level. We will do this through: (1) the proposal of a novel classification model of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, which will be capable of classifying, in a common way, the best practices carried out at an urban level; and (2) a comparison of the best climate change management practices carried out by two European countries (Italy and Spain). The classification model is based on three urban sectors: (1) Urban Adaptation and Health (UA&H), (2) Transport & Infrastructure (T&I), and (3) Energy (NRG). Urban management measures have been classified as soft (more focused on environmental information), gray (more focused on buildings), and green (more focused on nature-based solutions). The overall comparative analysis between Italy and Spain shows that in large and medium-sized Italian cities, mainly soft (52%) and green (28%) adaptation measures have been integrated into local energy-environmental planning in combination with mitigation actions. However, in both countries, decisions regarding the type of measures to be implemented are taken independently of the size of the city. This paper, in line with other research, highlights the importance of nature-based solutions as a first step in the integration process between adaptation and mitigation strategies at an urban level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation strategies; Mitigation strategies; SECAPs; Urban adaptive capacity; Urban resilience","article; city; climate change; environmental planning; Italy; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061539352

Biophilic design has recently been developed to overcome the adverse effects of the built environment and to improve human well-being by redefining the human-nature relationship. Yet, biophilic design should be adapted to extreme cold climates in order to meet the biological needs of people in northern territories. This issue becomes more important when considering the availability of natural light due to the strong seasonal photoperiod and its effects on human well-being in such regions. The present paper critically reviews biophilic design patterns and identifies their main shortcomings. These shortcomings include the lack of (1) recommendations applicable to extreme cold climates (2) adaptation to the local photoperiods, and (3) a systemic framework integrated into the design process. The paper draws attention to the image-forming and non-image-forming effects of light as a basis of the human-nature design approach. In this regard, photobiological outcomes have been reviewed. Then, the paper discusses the existing lighting standards and guidelines in North America and how they have mainly been developed to fulfil the image-forming demands for light. Further efforts are needed to revise these standards with respect to the non-image-forming effects of light and the biophilic design requirements. Finally, adaptive building envelopes are presented as a hypothetical solution to optimize the biophilic qualities of buildings and address the biological needs of people living and working in extreme cold climates in northern territories. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive building envelope; Biophilic design; Image-forming effects; Light; Non-image-forming effects; Northern territories","Cold working; Design; Light; Solar buildings; Building envelopes; Built environment; Design approaches; Extreme climates; Image forming; Northern territories; Standards and guidelines; Systemic frameworks; Availability; building; climate; light; light availability; photoperiod; seasonal variation; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063258841

The paper critically reviews the knowledge of the UHI and UCMs to identify the major shortcomings in the production of action plans. The shortcomings are identified in three aspects including (1) active involvement in UDP/AP (2) urban managerial and governmental actions, and (3) public engagement and participation. More specifically, it is first discussed that the current synthesizing paradigm of UCMs and UHI studies only considers the physical aspects of the problem/solution. Second, climate recommendations have paid a little attention to the imperative role, capacities and motivations of urban governance and managerial organizations. Third, mitigation strategies have been proposed without considering public needs and willingness. To overcome these challenges, a collaborative platform of UCM systems should be developed through a holistic approach. Such platform should provide a ground for efficient interventions in UDP/AP as well as interactions of all actors and indicators. To this end, the technical challenges of the UHI studies and UCM systems to link with UDP/AP are discussed. Second, UCMs should explicitly define the role of urban climate governance, prioritize the actions and state the policy agendas with regard to local government capacities and motivational elements. Finally, local communities’ needs’ and stockholders’ opinions should be involved in the synthesizing process. As a potential solution, need-base approaches and weighing systems should be further developed to consider all urban actors’ perspectives. © 2019","Action plan; Policy; Urban climate map; Urban development; Urban heat island; Urban planning",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062337529

However, the issue of climate change has failed to make any political breakthrough in spite of many conferences taking place and agreements being signed. Negotiations take place like clockwork but still there is a lack of any concrete step being taken. With the rate with which climate change is taking place, it becomes very important for leaders and policy-makers to come up with certain solutions and measures at both multilateral and regional level to lessen the impact of climate change. Based upon this view, Bhutan has many opportunities to work at a bilateral level in a number of areas to reduce the impact of climate change.

The proposed research paper aims to explore whether the viable use of existing natural resources will help in achieving economic and sustainable development in Bhutan. The paper also attempts to see whether bilateral cooperation between Bhutan and other countries would lessen the impact of climate change and whether the issue will provide scope for greater cooperation on the sharing of technology and information between Bhutan and neighboring South Asian countries. © Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering & Sciences Publication.","Bhutan; Climate change; Energy security; Environment; Environmental security; South Asia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070832187

While energy system retrofits have been found to reduce buildings' carbon footprint substantially, these measures are often hindered by financial, regulatory or design constraints. Recent research sheds light on energy management approaches to energy conservation such as energy-efficient settings of HVAC temperature setpoints. While existing case studies confirm the significant energy saving potential of efficient HVAC operation, there is scarcity of studies quantifying energy savings from optimal HVAC temperature setpoints comprehensively, while controlling for important factors, such as guaranteeing tenant thermal comfort levels and the impact of different climate conditions on the results. In this work, we apply simulation-based multi-objective optimization to fine-tune heating and cooling setpoints of large “typical” office buildings with respect to energy consumption and occupant thermal comfort. We apply the framework in seven climate zones across the US in an effort to examine spatial variations in the energy savings potential due to different climate conditions and propose targeted energy-saving strategies and policies. We show that locations with mild climates, such as San Francisco, CA, can realize up to 60% of annual HVAC-related energy savings without compromising the occupants' thermal comfort. This untapped potential to simultaneously improve building performance and occupants’ comfort drives the discussion on revisiting HVAC setpoint configuration standards in commercial buildings, either as part of individual building retrofit planning or as part of energy policy regulations. © 2019","Energy savings; Human-based retrofits; HVAC; Multi-objective optimization; Thermal comfort; Thermostat setpoints","Air conditioning; Carbon footprint; Costs; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Multiobjective optimization; Office buildings; Retrofitting; Thermal comfort; Zero energy buildings; Building performance; Energy saving potential; Energy savings potential; Energy-saving strategies; Human-based retrofits; Setpoints; Temperature setpoints; Thermal comfort level; HVAC; air conditioning; air temperature; building; climate conditions; energy conservation; energy efficiency; heating; optimization; ventilation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063771034

A particular strength of this passive measurement approach is its insensitivity to clouds and aerosols due to its direct sun pointing and narrow field of view (0.2°). Developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), these portable, low-cost mini-LHR instruments were designed to operate in tandem with the sun photometers used by the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). This partnership allows us to leverage the existing framework of AERONET's global ground network of more than 500 sites as well as providing simultaneous measurements of aerosols that are known to be a major source of error in retrievals of XCO2 from passive nadir-viewing satellite observations. We show, using the global 3-D GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model, that a deployment of 50 mini-LHRs at strategic (but not optimized) AERONET sites significantly improves our knowledge of global and regional land-based CO2 fluxes. This improvement varies seasonally and ranges 58 %-81 % over southern lands, 47 %-76 % over tropical lands, 71 %-92 % over northern lands, and 64 %-91 % globally. We also show significant added value from combining mini-LHR instruments with the existing ground-based NOAA flask network. Collectively, these data result in improved a posteriori CO2 flux estimates on spatial scales of ∼10 km2, especially over North America and Europe, where the ground-based networks are densest. Our studies suggest that the mini-LHR network could also play a substantive role in reducing carbon flux uncertainty in Arctic and tropical systems by filling in geographical gaps in measurements left by ground-based networks and space-based observations. A realized network would also provide necessary data for the quinquennial global stocktakes that form part of the Paris Agreement. © 2019 Author(s).",,"AERONET; atmospheric transport; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; chemical analysis; EOS; error analysis; field of view; global perspective; laser method; NOAA satellite; radiometric survey; Arctic; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065200828

This research was conducted to determine the dynamics of carbon stocks in gofasa plantation community forests and compared to other land use systems in South Sulawesi. The research used sample plots 20 m x 50 m to measure tree biomass and 1 m x 1 m sub plots for undergrowth and litter. The results of the study indicated that there were variations of potential carbon stocks in plantation community forests and agroforestry. Carbon stocks in plantation community forest were varied according to the condition and age of forest stand. The total aboveground carbon stocks in homogenous gofasa stand ranged from 22.34 to 52.65 ton/ha by the difference in stand ages, while in mixed community forest was 77.60 ton/ha. As for agroforestry system, the carbon stocks ranged from 46.40 to 65.89 ton/ha. The dynamics of variations in carbon stocks in plantation community forest and agroforestry were determined by several variables such as species composition, stand age, and stand density. Therefore, a good management of community forests and agroforestry systems will ensure the mitigation of climate changes and environmental preservation through effective carbon storage. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biodiversity; Climate change; Dynamics; Land use; Above-ground carbons; Agroforestry system; Climate change mitigation; Community forest; Environmental preservation; Land-use systems; Several variables; Stand densities; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068326086

Design/methodology/approach: Faculty were motivated to seek partnerships with public and private entities in the local area for the purposes of realising mutually beneficial outcomes. The educational programmes of future engineers, when sustainability is considered, are analysed. Education for sustainable development has to include multidisciplinary active learning as a desirable competence. Active learning can be obtained when problems are based on real life because they are most motivating for students. Constructive alignment component is obtained because learning objectives are linked with learning activities related to the needs of public and private entities. Findings: Through the provision of technical expertise, the adoption and success of renewable energy projects was facilitated on the one hand, while final year undergraduate students benefited in terms of hands-on experience in helping to bring these projects to life, drawing on the knowledge and skills they had acquired throughout their degree programmes. These works are addressed to students by faculty members with the aim of developing and promoting renewable energies. Outcomes from partnerships surpassed expectations; not only were different benefits realised as were initially hoped for, but this success led to partnerships being sustained over time. Originality/value: Fossil fuel-based energy systems are associated with a myriad of negative environmental and social externalities. It is difficult to overstate the importance of transitioning towards alternative low carbon energy sources for climate change mitigation which are less centralised compared to the status-quo for energy security and energy independence. By actively facilitating the development of decentralised renewable energy sources in Catalonia, the projects reported herein are of significant value in social environmental and educational terms. © 2019, Lluís Pacheco, Luo Ningsu, Toni Pujol, Jose Ramon Gonzalez and Inès Ferrer.","Catalonia; Climate change; Collaboration; Energy; Engineering curricula; Higher education; Partnerships; Renewables; Spain; Sustainability; Wind power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066913505

In this study, Khartoum's climate data from 1981 to 2015 was analyzed and compared to identify trends in temperature, precipitation, and sand-dust storm intensification. Metronome Company created Khartoum's hourly weather file from averages of basic climate parameters available for 1996 to 2015 and Meteonorm 7.2.1 calculated an hourly climate file for Khartoum in 2070.

To counter 2070 climate conditions, resilient design strategies were evaluated to optimize thermal comfort for building users and minimize energy usage today and in the future. A comparison of design strategies from the year 2015 to those for 2070 discovered that strategies must shift to more active-cooling by the year 2070 when natural ventilation and active heating will no longer be beneficial design strategies during all seasons. While two-stage evaporative cooling is the most strategic for all of Khartoum's seasons, more resilient passive-design strategies should be adapted for use with Khartoum's underutilized renewable resources to reduce future active-cooling demand and optimize thermal comfort. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Design strategies; Khartoum region climate data; Thermal comfort","Architectural design; Evaporative cooling systems; Storms; Thermal comfort; Ventilation; Climate data; Climate responsive buildings; Design characteristics; Design strategies; Evaporative cooling; Natural ventilation; Passive design strategies; Renewable resource; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062325208

However, owing to sparse measurements before satellite monitoring in the twenty-first century, the long-term response of planktonic stocks to climate forcing is unknown. Here, using a continuous, multi-century record of subarctic Atlantic marine productivity, we show that a marked 10 ± 7% decline in net primary productivity has occurred across this highly productive ocean basin over the past two centuries. We support this conclusion by the application of a marine-productivity proxy, established using the signal of the planktonic-derived aerosol methanesulfonic acid, which is commonly identified across an array of Greenlandic ice cores. Using contemporaneous satellite-era observations, we demonstrate the use of this signal as a robust and high-resolution proxy for past variations in spatially integrated marine productivity. We show that the initiation of declining subarctic Atlantic productivity broadly coincides with the onset of Arctic surface warming4, and that productivity strongly covaries with regional sea-surface temperatures and basin-wide gyre circulation strength over recent decades. Taken together, our results suggest that the decline in industrial-era productivity may be evidence of the predicted5 collapse of northern Atlantic planktonic stocks in response to a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation6–8. Continued weakening of this Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, as projected for the twenty-first century9,10, may therefore result in further productivity declines across this globally relevant region. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"mesylic acid; sea water; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; basin wide gyre circulation; controlled study; Greenland; Letter; nonhuman; ocean current; plankton; population productivity; priority journal; sea surface temperature; sea surface waters; warming; animal; aquatic species; atmosphere; chemistry; fishery; food chain; greenhouse effect; history; metabolism; phytoplankton; water flow; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Arctic Regions; Atlantic Ocean; Atmosphere; Fisheries; Food Chain; Global Warming; Greenland; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Phytoplankton; Seawater; Water Movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065302370

However, unpacking the contribution of different environmental stressors remains elusive in large-scale observational settings in part because of the lack of an extensive long-term network of soil moisture measurements and the common seasonal concurrence of droughts and heat waves. In this study, we link state-of-the-art land surface model data and fine-scale weather information with a long panel of county-level yields for six major US crops (1981-2017) to unpack their historical and future climatic drivers. To this end, we develop a statistical approach that flexibly characterizes the distinct intra-seasonal yield sensitivities to high-frequency fluctuations of soil moisture and temperature. In contrast with previous statistical evidence, we directly elicit an important role of water stress in explaining historical yields. However, our models project the direct effect of temperature - which we interpret as heat stress - remains the primary climatic driver of future yields under climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).

The MCA approach used a set of objectives and criteria (O&C) to address the complexity of the decision problem in a transparent and understandable way, which also facilitated the active participation by diverse professionals, experts, and interest groups. The management strategies were developed to fulfill the key components of MKFRNP management and the current situation in the study area. The seven management strategies focused on climate change mitigation, protection of water catchments, education and research, stakeholder involvement, biodiversity conservation, timber production, and community interests. Forest stations with differing fire danger levels (very high, high, moderate, and low) were selected to compare the performance of the management strategies. The strategies were assessed qualitatively on their potential to improve the current situation according to the entire set of O&C. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to identify the best management strategy according to the overall preferences of all stakeholder groups. The AHP indicated that a strategy focusing on community interests provided the best option to address the current management challenges in all the seven forest stations independently of their fire danger levels. Biodiversity conservation should also be considered by resource managers in order to reduce fire danger and increase the benefits obtained by different stakeholders in MKFRNP. © 2019 by the authors.","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Benefits; Community forest associations (CFAs); Fire danger; Forest managers; Management strategies (MS); Multi-criteria analysis (MCA); Objectives and criteria (O&C); Stakeholders; Wildlife managers","Analytic hierarchy process; Biodiversity; Catchments; Climate change; Conservation; Fires; Hierarchical systems; Managers; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Benefits; Community forest; Fire danger; Forest managers; Management strategies; Multi-criteria analysis; Stakeholders; Forestry; analytical hierarchy process; best management practice; biodiversity; fire management; forest management; multicriteria analysis; national park; stakeholder; strategic approach; wildlife management; Biodiversity; Conservation; Fires; Forestry; Hierarchical Systems; Kenya; Kenya; Mount Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066866653

One approach that can be used to adapt to changing climatic pattern is in-field water harvesting. This study evaluated the soil profile water content and maize yields of 3 infield water harvesting technologies namely infiltration pits (IF), fanya juus (FJ) and contour ridges with cross ties (CRCT) in comparison to standard contour ridges (SC). The three systems are currently the focus of extension recommendations for water conservation in semi-arid regions of the country. Soil water content was measured on a regular basis using gravimetric methods at locations upslope and down slope of each structure. The average volumetric water content was signifcantly different between treatments, and it varied with increasing distance from the water harvesting structures. The average profile soil moisture content, over the three seasons were 8.3, 8.2, 8.1 and 7.8% for CRCT, FJ, IF and SC repectively. CRCT, FJ and IF retained more water for a greater distance from the harvesting structures compared to the SC. Maize yields were significantly higher in the water harvesting technologies compared to SC. Maize yields were 1196, 1164, 1250 and 749 kg ha −1 for CRCT, FJ, IF and SC respectively. There as a good correlation between water content and maize yields (R 2 = 0.80). It was concluded that improved water harvesting structures when compared to SC have the potential to increase maize yields in areas with water shortages, hence they can be a useful strategy for climate change adaptation. © 2019","Droughts; Dry land cropping; Margional lands; Water conservation","Arid regions; Crops; Cultivation; Drought; Harvesting; Runoff; Soil moisture; Water conservation; Water supply; Agricultural crops; Climate change adaptation; Dry land; Good correlations; Gravimetric methods; Semi-arid region; Soil water content; Volumetric water content; Climate change; agricultural technology; arid region; climate change; comparative study; crop production; crop yield; cropping practice; drought stress; dryland farming; farming system; field method; gravimetry; harvesting; maize; rainwater; semiarid region; smallholder; soil moisture; soil water; water content; water management; Zimbabwe; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061526381

Using meltwater from glaciers, snow, and permafrost, mountain dwellers have developed sophisticated techniques to cope with recurrent water scarcity caused by glacier retreat, glacier thinning, and seasonal snow-cover dynamics. Based on case studies from the Nanga Parbat region, Hunza-Karakoram, and Ladakh, this paper seeks to identify general patterns and site-specific characteristics of agrarian practices and adaptation strategies in the face of climate change. The comparative case study approach reveals differing responses to water scarcity, which depend on local conditions and include the construction of new irrigation channels, installation of pipes, and building of artificial ice reservoirs. The biophysical investigation is supplemented by an exploration of socioeconomic factors and is based on long-term research in the 3 study areas. The methods used include multitemporal remote sensing analysis, mapping of natural water storage components and irrigation infrastructure, and interviews. Taking into consideration social factors such as the expansion of off-farm income opportunities and market integration, we identify key variables that affect the sustainability and resilience of land use systems. Outcomes are diverse, ranging from the intensification and extension of irrigated mountain agriculture to the abandonment of irrigated areas, depending on local sociohydrological settings. © 2019 Nüsser et al.","Adaptation strategies.; Cryosphere dynamics.; Himalaya.; India.; Irrigation networks.; Pakistan; Sociohydrology.","adaptive management; agricultural production; climate change; cryosphere; glacier dynamics; installation; irrigation system; livelihood; sociobiology; water storage; water stress; Gilgit-Baltistan; Himalayas; Hindu Kush; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Karakoram; Ladakh; Nanga Parbat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077188707

Our results show that: (i) Indigenous peoples are observing modifications to their country due to climate change, and are doing so in both ancient and colonial time scales; (ii) the ways that climate change terminology is discursively understood and used is fundamental to achieving deep engagement and effective adaptive governance; (iii) Indigenous peoples in Australia exhibit a high level of agency via diverse approaches to climate adaptation; and (iv) humour is perceived as an important cultural component of engagement about climate change and adaptation. However, wider governance regimes consistently attempt to “upscale” Indigenous initiatives into their own culturally governed frameworks - or ignore them totally as they “don't fit” within neoliberal policy regimes. We argue that an opportunity exists to acknowledge the ways in which Indigenous peoples are agents of their own change, and to support the strategic localism of Indigenous adaptation approaches through tailored and place-based adaptation for traditional country. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

We report on a year-long qualitative social science study of academic plane travel at the University of Adelaide, South Australia where we investigated the tension between academic requirements to travel and the institution's formal commitment to sustainability within the Campus Sustainability Plan. We found that, while many academics were worried about climate change, very few were willing to change their current practice and travel less because they are not institutionally incentivized to do so. There is a fear of not flying: plane travel is perceived as a key driver for career progression and this is an ongoing barrier to pro-environmental behavior.

However, recent increases in the frequency of floods and landslides has enhanced local awareness of ecosystem restoration. This study confirms that community participation is an important factor for protecting forests, among others through involvement in ecotourism activities at Gunung Rinjani National Park and participation in agroforestry program in the park's buffer zone. Since 2010, Community Forestry Program in Central Lombok has been integrated with a scheme of reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Although Community Forestry has been successfully implemented in several areas of production forests and protection forests, this scheme is a newly introduced government policy for reforming the management of conservation areas in Indonesia. Through this scheme, local communities have a bundle of rights to manage a parcel of forestland around Gunung Rinjani National Park. In addition to giving access to manage forestland, this scheme also supports the empowerment of local communities to manage forests in more sustainable ways, e.g. through the utilization of non-timber forest products, the cultivation of crops on land under the forest stand, and the rehabilitation of degraded forest lands.

Attention is paid to the process of creating a balance between the active aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in the compost mass, which allows nitrogen to be preserved in the finished compost and the cost of aeration to be reduced. It has been shown that the addition of natural minerals, in particular, zeolite, has a positive effect on the composting process and improves the quality of the compost, ensures the content of silicon in a bioavailable form in the compost, prevents ammonia emissions, and reduces the concentration of heavy metals.

Meanwhile, the performance of low-temperature SCR of NO with NH3 over the designed catalysts was tested under various gas hourly space velocities (GHSVs), NH3/NO molar ratios, and contents of NO, NH3, O2, H2O, and SO2 in a lab-scale reactor. Overall, the Mn(0.3)Ce(0.1)/Ti catalyst, which had high NO-reduction efficiency and selectivity (low N2O formation), was recommended, with the following preparation methods: ultrasonic impregnation; manganese acetate precursor; and incineration at 500 °C. Appropriate textural properties (high surface area and small pore and crystallite sizes), well-dispersed amorphous manganese (rather than crystalline) on the anatase surface (rather than rutile), abundant active sites, and long residence time are essential for high NO-reduction efficiency. In practice, NO-reduction efficiency decreased with increasing GHSV and the NH3 and NO contents; however, it initially increased and then became saturated with an increasing NH3/NO molar ratio and O2 content. Water deactivated the catalyst to a recoverable state, whereas SO2 resulted in unrecoverable deactivation. © 2018 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering","low-temperature SCR; MnOx/Ti; N2O; NH3; NO","Ammonia; Catalyst selectivity; Efficiency; Incineration; Molar ratio; Nobelium; Oxide minerals; Reduction; Temperature; Titanium dioxide; Catalyst preparation methods; Gas hourly space velocities; Low temperature SCR; MnOx/Ti; Performance of low temperatures; Preparation method; Textural properties; Ultrasonic impregnation; Manganese compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061057610

However, current approaches to informing communities of future climate risk are problematic. The predominant focus on end-of-century projections neglects more pressing development concerns, which relate to the management of shorter-term risks and climate variability, and constitutes a substantial opportunity cost for the limited financial and human resources available to tackle development challenges. When a long-term view genuinely is relevant to decision-making, much of the information available is not fit for purpose. Climate model projections are able to capture many aspects of the climate system and so can be relied upon to guide mitigation plans and broad adaptation strategies, but the use of these models to guide local, practical adaptation actions is unwarranted. Climate models are unable to represent future conditions at the degree of spatial, temporal, and probabilistic precision with which projections are often provided, which gives a false impression of confidence to users of climate change information. In this article, we outline these issues, review their history, and provide a set of practical steps for both the development and climate scientist communities to consider. Solutions to mobilize the best available science include a focus on decision-relevant timescales, an increased role for model evaluation and expert judgment and the integration of climate variability into climate change services.

Here, we provide predictions of the impacts of a changing climate on species’ geographical ranges within high-latitude mountain flora on a sub-continental scale. We then examined the forecasted changes in relation to species’ biogeographic histories. Location: Fennoscandia, Northern Europe (55–72°N). Methods: We examined the sensitivity of 164 high-latitude mountain species to changing climate by modelling their distributions in regard to climate, local topography and geology at a 1 km2 resolution. Using an ensemble of six statistical modelling techniques and data on current (1981–2010) and future (2070–2099) climate based on three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 8.5), we developed projections of current and future ranges. Results: The average species richness of the mountain flora is predicted to decrease by 15%–47% per 1 km2 cell, depending on the climate scenario considered. Arctic flora is projected to undergo severe range loss along with non-poleward range contractions, while alpine flora is forecasted to find suitable habitat in a warmer North. A substantial majority (71%–92%) of the studied species are projected to lose more than half of their present range by the year 2100. Species predicted to lose all suitable habitat had ranges centred in the northernmost (&gt;68°N) part of continental Europe. Main conclusions: Climate change is predicted to substantially diminish the extent and richness of Europe's high-latitude mountain flora. Interestingly, species' biogeographic histories affect their vulnerability to climate change. The vulnerability of true Arctic and endemic species marks them as highly important for conservation decisions. © 2019 The Authors.

This study first uses the method of the IPCC to estimate the CO 2 emissions of provinces and municipalities in the eastern, central and western regions of China from 1995 to 2014. Based on these estimations, the study uses the PSTR model to represent the features of non-linear mechanisms to analyze the relationship between CO 2 emissions and per capita GDP in the three regions during this period. Thus, this model derives the influences of population elasticity and the energy consumption on CO 2 emissions in the three regions. The effect of economic development on CO 2 emissions was heterogeneous across the regions. We found that in the eastern region, the correlation between CO 2 emissions and per capita GDP is positive. As the economic mechanism transitions rapidly in the eastern region and the economic scale reaches the threshold value (after 1995), every 1% increase in per capita GDP causes a 0.28% rise in CO 2 emissions; in the central and western regions, the transformation of the economic mechanism occurred in approximately 2005, and the correlation between CO 2 emissions and per capita GDP turns out to be weakly negative. The population elasticity is −0.0948 in the central region and −0.2283 in the western region. Because of the regional disparities in economic impact on the environment, specific region-tailored energy saving and emission reduction strategies are of great importance so as to provide a more effective approach to achieving sustainable development in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO 2 emissions; Non-linear; Per capita GDP; Smooth transition regression","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Elasticity; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Planning; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Effective approaches; Energy saving and emission reductions; Non linear; Per capita; Regional disparities; Smooth transition regressions; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061657890

In this paper, two irrigation modes, controlled irrigation (CI) and flood irrigation (FI), and four nitrogen fertilizer levels (N0: 0, N1:,85, N2:,110, and N3:,135 kg·hm-2) were set to study the effect of different irrigation modes and N fertilizer amount on greenhouse-gas emissions of paddy fields in cold region by using the static chamber-gas chromatograph method; yield and water consumption were also analyzed. The results showed that, compared with FI, CI significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 19.42~46.94%, but increased N2O emissions by 5.66~11.85%. Under the two irrigation modes, N fertilizers could significantly increase N2O emissions, but the CH4 emissions of each N treatment showed few differences. Compared with FI, appropriate N application under CI could significantly increase grain number per spike, seed-setting rate, and 1000-grain weight, thus increasing yield. Under the two irrigation modes, water consumption increased with the increase of N application rate, and the total water consumption of CI was significantly lower than that of FI. The global warming potential (GWP) of CI was significantly smaller than that of FI. The trend of GWP in each treatment was similar to that of CH4. Through comprehensive comparison and analysis of water productivity (WP), gas emission intensity (GHGI), and the yield of each treatment, we found that CI+N2 treatment had the highest WP (2.05 kg·m-3) and lowest GHGI (0.37 kg CO2-eq·kg-1), while maintaining high yield (10224.4 kg·hm-2). The results of this study provide an important basis for guiding high yield, water-savings, and emission reduction of paddy fields in cold regions. © 2019 by the authors.

Two optimal strategies of BESS cost minimization are proposed for long-term planning and operation planning, where the utility is the BESS owner. As for the long-term planning, a strategy for siting and sizing of BESS is formulated based on the characteristics of the network, typical load, and PV generation profiles. Then, for the operation planning, schedules of BESSs and their cost estimation are provided based on the load and PV generation forecasts of 1 day ahead.

After a surge in spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, they are an even larger component but now face increased scrutiny. Given their lasting presence, how does one design these subsidies to be as cost-effective as possible? Surprisingly, the conceptual framework and empirical evidence available to help policymakers identify which subsidies generate the most “bang for the buck” are limited. To help answer this question, we begin with an overview of the justifications for, and the arguments against, subsidizing clean energy technologies. Next, we briefly describe major subsidies. Finally, we summarize key design choices, suggesting an increased focus on upfront cash payments for physical outcomes such as capacity. This contrasts with the considerable focus on tax credits, loan guarantees, production, and cost-based subsidies which have been more prominent to date. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Clean energy; Energy subsidies; Loan guarantees; Renewable energy; Tax credits","Cost effectiveness; Investments; Taxation; Clean energy; Energy subsidies; Loan guarantees; Renewable energies; Tax credits; Public policy; alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; design; energy planning; energy policy; energy resource; governance approach; policy making; tax system; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062907118

However, there is a lack of evidence at the micro level on the realistic, empirically derived potential of walking and cycling to displace motorized travel and thus reduce GHG emissions. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for GHG emissions savings from replacing short car trips with walking and cycling and the extent to which high quality infrastructure for walking and cycling may influence day-to-day travel decisions, change the spatial and temporal nature of local journeys and impact on overall GHG emissions from motorised travel. To achieve this aim this study conducted an in-depth observational study of a purposively selected cohort of 50 residents in Cardiff, Wales. Using a mixed-method approach detailed quantitative and qualitative data were collected for each participant using personal Global Position System (GPS) devices, 7-day travel diaries and contextual interviews over two seasonally matching 7-day time periods in 2011 and 2012. GHG emissions for motorized travel modes were derived using journey distance, vehicle technology details and average speeds obtained from the GPS data. The spatial and contextual data provided new insights into the complexities of walking behaviour and factors influencing cycling for everyday travel or recreation, including route choice decisions, activity destinations and the role of the new infrastructure to enable change. We found significant potential of active travel to substitute short car trips, with sizeable impacts on carbon emissions from personal travel. Half of all car trips were less than 3 miles long. Taking into account individual travel patterns and constraints, walking or cycling could realistically substitute for 41% of short car trips, saving nearly 5% of CO2e emissions from car travel. This was on top of 5% of ‘avoided’ emissions from cars due to existing walking and cycling. The evolving high quality walking and cycling infrastructure in the case study area was unlikely to promote a significant reduction in carbon emissions from (displaced) car journeys on its own. The study contributes to the debate on how to achieve stringent low carbon targets in urban transport. The combination of methods for data collection developed and employed in this study also helps to inform future research on the wider environmental impacts of active travel, including ‘co-benefits’ of improved air quality, reduced noise and reduced fossil fuel use. © 2018 The Authors","Active travel; CO2e; GPS; Short car trips; Spatial analysis; Walking and cycling","Air quality; Carbon; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global positioning system; Urban transportation; Active travel; CO2e; Short car trips; Spatial analysis; Walking and cycling; Greenhouse gases; car use; carbon emission; cohort analysis; cycle transport; GPS; spatiotemporal analysis; travel behavior; urban transport; walking; Cardiff [Wales]; United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052817390

Its complex topography harbors an aquaculture industry that is among the top exporters of salmon and mussels worldwide. However, little is known about the scales of environmental variability of this region and how climate-related changes can alter the current conditions. This study provides a baseline understanding of the dominant scales of subtidal variability in meteorological forcing and water properties along and across the region that encompasses northern Patagonia and specifically the Inner Sea of Chiloé (ISC). We examined multiple datasets spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. Reanalysis wind time series were combined with satellite-derived data (MODIS-Aqua) and in situ hydrographic records from the mussel farming industry as well as from instruments moored at various locations in the ISC. We assessed the influence of large-scale forcing on the variability of local conditions and used the assembled datasets to find modes of variability at interannual, seasonal and intraseasonal scales. The patterns of atmospheric and oceanographic variability along northern Patagonia are heterogeneous both in time and space. Long-term sea surface temperature (SST) averages revealed two areas with colder temperatures and attenuated seasonal variability that can be associated with stronger vertical mixing. These areas have been previously related to hotspots for whale sightings and might be important as bottom-up controls of Patagonian food webs. Northern Patagonia is strongly affected by large-scale processes at the South Pacific basin scale. Long-term wind data show a poleward displacement of the transition between upwelling and downwelling favorable conditions during spring-summer months for the last decade. The intraseasonal time scale was dominated by a band centered at 30 days that can be attributed to atmospheric variability driven by the Baroclinic Annular Mode (BAM), which induces the periodic mixing of the water column, but with substantial interannual variability. Variability in local conditions was found to closely track the large-scale variability, even in the small channels and bays. These findings highlight the strong connection between large-scale processes and the conditions faced by aquaculture in the ISC, and the need to consider such scales of variability - as well as climate trends - in planning and management decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chile; Coastal oceanography; Ekman transport; Inner Sea of Chiloé; Patagonia; Spatial variations; Temporal variations","Aquaculture; Large dataset; Mixing; Molluscs; Surface waters; Chile; Coastal oceanography; Ekman transport; Patagonia; Spatial variations; Temporal variation; Oceanography; annual variation; Aqua (satellite); aquaculture industry; bivalve; coastal zone; Ekman transport; MODIS; oceanography; salmonid; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; spatial variation; subtidal environment; temporal variation; Chile; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Pacific Ocean (Southeast); Patagonia; Chilo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060875321

The analysis emphasises the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Reasons for Concern (e.g., threatened systems, extreme events, aggregated impacts, and critical thresholds), particularly on sea-level rise, degradation of mangroves, and invasive alien species in Central and South America focusing on case studies from Uruguay and Venezuela. Despite recent advances in coastal adaptation planning in Central and South America, there is an adaptation deficit in the implementation of measures and strategies against climate-related hazards, such as sea-level rise. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, resource allocation, lack of political will, and lack of early warning systems for climate-related hazards. Non-structural adaptation measures such as community-based adaptation and ecosystem-based adaptation are not fully mainstreamed into national plans yet. Government-level initiatives (e.g. National Adaptation Programmes of Action) are being developed, but a few are already implemented.

During the last decade this association has been questioned because: a) there may be compensatory behaviors (more energy consumption and more GHG emissions in mobility and housing during weekends and holidays, and b) the fact of not considering the effects of the endogeneity associated with self-selection. In this paper, we analyze population density as a determinant of mobility and residential GHG emissions in Gran Concepción (Chile) using multivariate regression models. The results obtained indicate that density does not exert a significant impact on GHG emissions in mobility and housing. It is income differences that mostly explain individual GHG emissions variability. This calls into question the possible effectiveness of compactness policies in regional, cultural and climatic contexts different from those of the US and Europe and are excessively oriented towards the maintenance and increase of density in urban centers and slowing down the expansion of suburban neighborhoods. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Compact city approach; GHG emissions; Latin-American cities; Population density","Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Housing; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Structure (composition); Compact city; Compensatory behavior; GHG emission; Latin americans; Multivariate regression models; Population densities; Spatial structure; Urban sustainability; Greenhouse gases; emission; emission control; endogenous cue; greenhouse gas; neighborhood; population density; residential location; social mobility; spatial analysis; suburban area; sustainability; urban area; urban planning; Chile; Europe; Latin America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061566338

This study presents the case of Ontario where the role of complementing policies in transitioning electricity systems is assessed. The policy cost to incentivize surplus low emission electricity via an established mechanism for the transportation sector has been estimated (Electric and Hydrogen Vehicle Incentive Program). It is estimated that the 9056 (4760 battery and 4296 plug-in hybrid) electric vehicles that qualified for incentives from the provincial government at the end of 2016 vehicles cost $732.5-$883.9 to reduce a tonne of CO2,e emissions over an eight year lifetime. This is then compared with the potential cost incurred by two power to gas energy hubs that utilize clean surplus electricity from the province to offset emissions within the natural gas sector. The use of hydrogen-enriched natural gas and synthetic natural gas (SNG) offsets emissions at $87.8 and $228.7 per tonne of CO2,e in the natural gas sector.

Many calls have been made to at least partially offset climate change impacts through local conservation management. However, a mechanistic understanding of the interactions of multiple stressors is generally lacking for habitat-forming species; preventing the development of sound conservation strategies. We examined the effectiveness of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) at enhancing structural complexity and resilience to climate change on populations of an overexploited and long-lived octocoral. We used long-term data over eight populations, subjected to varying levels of disturbances, and Integral Projection Models to understand how the overfishing and mass-mortality events shape the stochastic dynamics of the Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum. Marine protected areas largely reduced colony partial mortality (i.e. shrinkage), enhancing the structural complexity of coral populations. However, there were no significant differences in individual mortality or population growth rates between protected and exploited populations. In contrast, warming had detrimental consequences for the long-term viability of red coral populations, driving steady declines and potential local extinctions due to sharp effects in survival rates. Stochastic demographic models revealed only a weak compensatory effect of MPAs on the impacts of warming. Policy implications. Our results suggest that marine protected areas (MPAs) are an effective local conservation tool for enhancing the structural complexity of red coral populations. However, MPAs may not be enough to ensure red coral's persistence under future increases in thermal stress. Accordingly, conservation strategies aiming to ensure the persistence and functional role of red coral populations should include management actions at both local (well-enforced MPAs) and global scales (reductions in greenhouse gas emissions). Finally, this study unravels the divergent demographic consequences that can arise from multiple stressors and highlights the key role of demography in better understanding and predicting the consequences of combined impacts for vulnerable ecosystems. © 2018 The Authors.

This study is focused on understanding the behavior of the wettability alteration from a liquid-wet state to gas-wettability by SiO2 nanoparticles functionalized with 20 wt % of a commercial fluorocarbon surfactant Silnyl FSJ (SY) using molecular dynamics simulations and experimental approaches. The SY-functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by an incipient wetness method. Then, three nanofluids were obtained by dispersing the modified SiO2 nanoparticles at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 wt % in a KCl brine (2 wt %) and were employed for wettability alteration of the oil-wet sandstone samples under room conditions. Changes of the samples' wettability were estimated by experimental contact angle measurements in brine/rock/air and n-decane/rock/air systems. The theoretical evaluation was made using molecular dynamics for reproducing the coating of the sandstone samples with the SY-functionalized nanoparticles and the contact angles measured experimentally. Further, the wettability alteration to a gas-wet system is described from a physical insight based on the thermodynamic analysis of the interaction energies of nanoparticles-liquid, surfactant-liquid, and liquid-liquid. The molecular model developed in this study allows predictive calculations of the contact angle of liquid droplets, with deviations lower than 7% regarding the experimental value. The theoretical approach allows optimizing the use of surfactant-functionalized nanoparticles for promoting the wettability alteration from liquid-wet to gas-wet state, which can lead to cost savings and increase the performance of improved and enhanced oil recovery processes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Chlorine compounds; Contact angle; Enhanced recovery; Gases; Liquids; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Paraffins; Potassium compounds; Sandstone; Silica; Silica nanoparticles; Surface active agents; Synthesis (chemical); Thermoanalysis; Wetting; Dynamic molecular modeling; Experimental approaches; Fluorocarbon surfactant; Functionalized nanoparticles; Incipient wetness method; Molecular dynamics simulations; Theoretical evaluation; Thermo dynamic analysis; SiO2 nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065604100

In the present paper, a test rig built to carry out experimental studies on different refrigerant in a drop-in application is described and first results for the set-up commissioning are commented. The experimental campaign was carried out in typical water-to-water heat pump operating conditions, varying the cold water temperature at evaporator inlet from 10 °C to 20 °C, with a step of 2.5 °C, and hot water temperature at condenser inlet from 30 °C to 50 °C, with a step of 10 °C and the compressor shaft rotational frequency from 30 Hz to 80 Hz, with a step of 10 Hz. The first findings demonstrate that the experimental results of some key performance parameters, namely heating capacity, COP and compressor volumetric efficiency, agree well with open literature trends, allowing to state that the experimental facility was correctly designed and can be used to deep the analysis on performance assessment of new refrigerants in a drop-in application. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Hence, fire impacts assessment could become very important in forest areas according to its environmental and landscape values. This paper suggests an approach to identify fire effects on biomass, in consonance with the potential carbon storage of each area used, and its biomass consumption based on fire behavior. Dense mature forests were the most vulnerable landscapes based on its aboveground biomass, mainly tree stem biomass. A significant correlation was found between fire intensity and biomass consumption. Biomass consumption ranged from 16.59% to 98.75% from the two studied wildfires. It is necessary to provide a scenario analysis according to the uncertain CO 2 market. As an example, carbon storage impacts in one fire were between 100,340.66 € (using the minimum price of CO 2 ) and 741,057.44 € (using the maximum price of CO 2 ). Differences between scenarios ranged from 35.30% to 46.51% of the total carbon storage impacts.

In the MRB, bioelectrochemical CO2 reduction and subsequent product oxidation has successfully been combined in one integrated system. However, finding a suitable counter electrode is hindering its further development. In this work, we have tested two alternative counter electrodes in duplicate-namely, i) oxygen/water and ii) a capacitive electrode-for use in the MRB platform. During daily charge/discharge cycling over periods of 11 to 15 days, experimentally obtained energy efficiencies of 25 and 3.7 % were reported when using the capacitive and the oxygen/water electrodes, respectively. Large overpotentials, resulting in a voltage efficiency of 15 % and oxygen crossover leading to coulombic efficiencies of 25 % caused the considerably lower efficiency for the oxygen/water systems, despite the theoretical higher voltage efficiency. Although the capacitive electrode equipped systems performed better, energy density is limited by the operational potential window within which capacitive systems can operate reliably. Microbial community analysis revealed dominant presence of Geobacter in the bioanode and Selenomonadales in the biocathode. These results do not necessarily bring practical application of the MRB closer, but they do provide new insights in the working principle of this new technology. ©2019 The Authors.

Generally, carbon fibers are aspirated into glass capillaries, pulled to a fine taper, and then sealed using an epoxy to create electrode materials that are used for fast scan cyclic voltammetry testing. The use of bare CFMEs has several limitations, though. First and foremost, the carbon fiber contains mostly basal plane carbon, which has a relatively low surface area and yields lower sensitivities than other nanomaterials. Furthermore, the graphitic carbon is limited by its temporal resolution, and its relatively low conductivity. Lastly, neurochemicals and macromolecules have been known to foul at the surface of carbon electrodes where they form non-conductive polymers that block further neurotransmitter adsorption. For this study, we modify CFMEs with gold nanoparticles to enhance neurochemical testing with fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Au3+ was electrodeposited or dipcoated from a colloidal solution onto the surface of CFMEs. Since gold is a stable and relatively inert metal, it is an ideal electrode material for analytical measurements of neurochemicals. Gold nanoparticle modified (AuNP-CFMEs) had a stability to dopamine response for over 4 h. Moreover, AuNP-CFMEs exhibit an increased sensitivity (higher peak oxidative current of the cyclic voltammograms) and faster electron transfer kinetics (lower ?EP or peak separation) than bare unmodified CFMEs. The development of AuNP-CFMEs provides the creation of novel electrochemical sensors for detecting fast changes in dopamine concentration and other neurochemicals at lower limits of detection.

The aim of the transformation is to accommodate population and economic growth and at the same time enable a system which is environmentally sustainable and resilient to future challenges such as climate change. These approaches have increasingly entered mainstream dialogue over the last ten years as knowledge on the approaches has developed, and there is an acceptance that there needs to be a change to how urban water systems are designed and operated. However, there are still a range of aspects of these approaches that are maturing and require further research to realize the objectives of SUWM. The issue explored supply-side interventions, such as rainwater harvesting and stormwater harvesting, demand-side interventions, and water storage solutions that have the potential to enable a range of recycling technologies. The issue also highlighted a novel method for better managing the integrity of a conventional sewer system. Furthermore, there are articles that explore methods for integrated assessments, integrated decision making and an exploration of what factors may promote community adoption of technology. © 2019 by the authors.","Hybrid water supply systems; Managed aquifer recharge; Rainwater harvesting; Soil moisture investigation; Spatial planning; Sustainable urban water management; Urban flooding; Water conservation",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066318270

We apply rigorous quasi-experimental methods and detailed geospatial data to assess the role of tenure regimes—communally held lands (specifically, ejidos), private property, and their impact on the effectiveness of protected areas, in reducing forest loss in a biodiversity hotspot- the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. We find evidence that, while protected areas are effective on average, their impact depends on the underlying type of tenure regime and forest, proxied by biomass levels and biome. Protecting communally held land may reduce deforestation, specifically the loss of medium- and high-biomass forests, compared to forests under private property regimes. Our results have important policy implications for the conservation and climate change mitigation efforts on the Yucatan. However, the high variance in forest loss rates among ejidos indicates that other characteristics of ejidos may be central to understanding community-based forest conservation opportunities. © 2019 Miteva et al.

The study aimed to determine whether metal pollution hotspots identified in the area in 2016 had been successfully mitigated by baghouse installation, or whether industrial sources continued to dominate local particulate matter. Particulate matter was filter-collected nearly continuously in 24-hour intervals between October 2017 and March 2018 (101 total filters). Filters were analyzed for 30 elements by x-ray fluorescence; black carbon was measured continuously during filter sampling using an aethalometer. EPA's Positive Matrix Factorization 5.0 was used for source apportionment modeling, yielding a 5-factor optimal solution. The source identities were resolved to be diesel and fuel emissions, sea salt, soil dust, secondary sulfates, and metals industry. The metals industry source was much less significant than expected, suggesting effective emissions reductions from the local factory. The source profiles' correlation with wind direction and speed using bivariate polar plots was examined to give further insight into the source identities and their locations. The NOAA HYSPLIT model was also used for air flow back-trajectory analysis. The results of the HYSPLIT and bivariate polar plots suggest that the coal power plant in eastern Oregon is a significant source of sulfates and mercury emissions. Using PMF on particulate matter data from a second industrial location in Southeast Portland (98 filters) revealed the same major sources except for the metals industry source, supporting the conclusion that regional sources dominate particulate matter metals composition, despite measurements made in an industrial urban location. © 2019","Black carbon; Coal; Diesel; Fuel emissions; Oregon; Particulate matter; Portland; Positive matrix factorization; Source apportionment; Trace elements; Urban air quality; X-ray fluorescence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059629963

In this study the CO2 balance of a boreal peatland in the Komi Republic was determined using the eddy covariance method, for the summer periods (10 June to 10 September) of 2012 and 2013. Monthly totals of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) varied significantly over the two years. The total net CO2 flux from the atmosphere to the peatland was 30 % greater in June 2013 than during the same month in 2012. The difference for July was smaller. In 2012 the total CO2 flux in August was 29 % higher, and in September it was 2.4 times lower, than in 2013. Despite the differences in seasonal dynamics of NEE between 2012 and 2013, the mean monthly indicators of gas exchange in the peatland ecosystem were mostly similar. Maximum values of gross photosynthesis (Pgross) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) were observed in July, which is the period of maximum development of the green biomass of plants. The CO2 fluxes were constrained by the precipitation and temperature regimes. During the drought of 2013, Pgross and Reco were mostly influenced by the incidence of precipitation. The peatland was a CO2 sink during both growing seasons and, in June–September 2012, it sequestered 317.66 g m-2 of CO2, which is 10.5 % more than during the same period in 2013.

The emission factors of the fleet of Euro 6 vehicles show high variability, irrespective of the NOx control technology. This comprehensive study focused on the events of high instantaneous NOx emissions produced under real driving, to assess their impact on emission factors. Additionally, the relationships of these events with different parameters measured using portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) were determined. Three Euro 6b diesel passenger cars with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), lean-burn NOx trap (LNT) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) were tested based on the real driving emissions (RDE) regulation. The results show that high instantaneous NOx emissions represent a large amount of total NOx emissions, although they are produced in a small percentage of driving time. A theoretical constraint of these high NOx emissions could reduce emission factors by 30–82%. The emission of high instantaneous NOx emissions are related to characteristic speed modes of urban, rural and motorway sections, and are primarily produced in a narrow engine speed range of approximately 700 rpm. In general, the probability of producing high instantaneous NOx emissions increases as the engine speed, the exhaust gas temperature or the vehicle speed is increased. Finally, regarding driving severity, speed per positive acceleration (v⋅a+) observations above the maximum values of the new European driving cycle (NEDC) and the world-harmonized light-duty vehicle test cycle (WLTC), have a strong probability to yield high instantaneous NOx emissions. These findings could be useful in the design of low emission policies, optimization of NOx control strategies, and the improvement of micro/meso emission models. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel exhaust after-treatment; NOx; Passenger cars; Portable emissions measurement system (PEMS); Real driving emissions (RDE) test","Air pollution control equipment; Automobile engines; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Passenger cars; Selective catalytic reduction; Speed; Diesel exhaust after treatments; Diesel passenger cars; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Exhaust gas temperatures; New european driving cycles; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Real drivings; Real-world drivings; Exhaust gas recirculation; automobile; diesel engine; exhaust emission; measurement method; motorway; nitrogen oxides; optimization; probability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063209320

The fact that air pollutants are still posing a risk in some areas is a consequence of spatial differences. For this reason, the spatial distribution and temporal change of air pollutant parameters (SO2, PM10, NO and NO2) in the Marmara Region between March 2013-December 2015 were aimed to demonstrate in this study. For this purpose, SO2, PM10, NO and NO2 data measured by Marmara Clean Air Center Directorate by means of approximately 39 stations in 11 provinces in the Marmara Region were used. The Ordinary Kriging method was used to create spatial distribution maps in the study. The bivariate correlation analysis was applied by considering the independent variable of time to indicate how air pollutants change in terms of years and months. It has been found that all pollutants being studied are at higher levels in winter although NO2 is not very obvious. Both in SO2 and PM10, it was determined that the concentration levels in the southwest (Canakkale and Edirne) of the study area were usually at higher levels. The highest NO concentration levels were observed in Istanbul and Bursa, where the population and traffic were the highest.

This increased responsibilisation of citizens has implications for the roles of governments. The degree of government involvement does not necessarily decline, but government roles may need to shift: from a regulating and steering government towards a more collaborative and responsive government that enables and facilitates community initiatives that are self-governed by citizens. However, we lack a conceptual understanding of such new government roles, as well as empirical insights into how local governments participate in citizens' initiatives and how they take up such new roles. In this paper, a “ladder of government participation” is introduced, which is used to explore the roles of local governments in citizens' initiatives for climate change adaptation in the Netherlands. The results show that local governments are slowly but gradually shifting towards more networking, stimulating, and facilitating roles. Key concerns of local practitioners are (a) a lack of flexibility and support of their own municipal organisation to facilitate citizens' initiatives, (b) uncertainty about the continuity of citizens' initiatives over time, and (c) a potential increase of inequity among citizen groups resulting from facilitating citizens' initiatives. An important finding is that the roles of local governments tend to be flexible, in that they can move from one role to the other over time for one and the same citizens' initiative depending on its stage of development, as well as take up several roles simultaneously for different citizens' initiatives. © 2019 The Authors.

Household questionnaires (n=412) were used on Laamu Atoll to ascertain locals’ perceptions of vulnerability based on livelihood resources, financial security, and climate-change experiences. Results show that peripherality, as a notion that describes the disparities between ‘core’ and ‘peripheral’ islands, is a key factor shaping vulnerability variables on Laamu Atoll.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) study shows the formation of CaZrO3 crystal with orthorhombic phase. The Tm3+, Yb3+ co-doped CaZrO3 phosphor emits intense upconversion emission in blue (474 nm) and NIR (799 nm) regions due to 1G4 → 3H6 and 3H4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions, respectively on excitation with 980 nm radiation. The emission intensity is significantly enhanced in the presence of alkali ions due to charge compensation and asymmetry in the crystal field. The emission intensity in the case of Na+ co-doped phosphor is maximum and at 1 W pump power, it is increased by ∼44 and ∼31 times in blue and NIR regions, respectively as compared to without alkali ions co-doped phosphor. The downshifting emission in blue region has been observed due to oxygen vacancy and Tm3+ ions on excitation with 277 and 360 nm radiations which is enhanced significantly in the presence of alkali ions.

Energy retrofitting of existing buildings is a central strategy in climate mitigation and has often been highlighted as a cost-effective strategy. However, decisions on these strategies are often hampered by modeling assessments that are limited by contextual, methodological, parametric, input, or output constraints. Here, we present a novel methodology to investigate the solid economic feasibility in building retrofit evaluations with mitigation measures. We first calculate the variations in the energy saving potentials and costs for 13 energy saving measures and five climate change scenarios. We then compare the obtained uncertainty due to a changing climate to other uncertainties, such as the boundaries for emission inventories and energy system development. Four cities in Sweden are modeled, which are responsible for half of the country's residential energy use. We find that the profitability of the retrofitting actions is primarily determined based on the annualized investments and energy saving potentials. Future climate has a less determinant role, with uncertainties similar to those of future consumer price development and fuel emission factors. Retrofits that only affect the energy need for space heating are more robust than changes in electricity usage. We conclude that strategies for building retrofitting should focus on prioritizing energy savings and mobilizing investments that may not be profitable based on the current techno-economic perspective. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building stock modelling; Climate change; CO2 mitigation; Cost-efficient renovation; Swedish residential buildings; Uncertainty","Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Housing; Investments; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Uncertainty analysis; Building stocks; CO2 mitigation; Cost-efficient; Residential building; Uncertainty; Climate change; alternative energy; building; carbon dioxide; climate change; cost analysis; economic activity; economic conditions; electricity; emission inventory; energy resource; feasibility study; heating; price determination; profitability; residential energy; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; urban area; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063188979

Hotter temperatures can detrimentally affect workers’ health and their economic productivity and livelihoods, especially in rural areas in industrializing countries that may be more vulnerable and less resilient. A growing literature has examined these factors at large spatial scales, yet few studies have done so at finer scales. Micro-level data from developing regions is needed to understand the extent of heat exposure, as well as current and future adaptation strategies of working, healthy, and rural populations. We fill this gap using objective environmental measurements from 3M TM Questemp TM 46 Heat Stress Monitors, as well as survey data from working, healthy, and rural communities in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our data contain two groups: those who work in only open areas, and those who work in both forests and open areas. We document workers’ livelihood strategies, work schedules, perceptions of how temperatures impact their work, and future adaptation strategies for even hotter days. Ambient temperatures are 2.6–8.3 °C cooler in forests compared to open areas, indicating the temperature effects of deforestation can be immediate and significant. Those working only in open areas face up to 6.5 h of exposure to temperatures above the accepted Threshold Limit Value for worker well-being. Workers adapt to hotter temperatures by altering the timing of their work shifts and breaks, indicating our sample is already adapting to increasing temperatures from climate and land use change. We also find differential adaptation strategies between those working only in open areas compared to those working in both forests and open areas, suggesting current acclimatization may be a factor in how people adapt. Our results suggest the need for adaptation and mitigation policies tailored to the unique constraints of rural workers that specifically incorporate extant adaptation strategies. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptation; Climate change; Deforestation; Heat exposure; Human well-being; Livelihoods","adaptive management; climate change; deforestation; environmental policy; high temperature; land use change; livelihood; mitigation; public health; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; temperature effect; tropical environment; vulnerability; working conditions; East Kalimantan; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063759422

The results concerning the Bunimovich stadium and rectangular billiards are given. The quantum billiard with an electron in a micron-sized quantum dot is assumed. Then the quantum dot in the kicking electric field is considered. The reflection symmetry of billiards is crucial for the emergence of harmonics. The harmonics can have different forms from an ideal δ-spike to a barely recognizable form. For the Bunimovich stadium with fully chaotic dynamics, emission peaks in the spectrum can have such a barely recognizable shape for some initial states and this may depend on the electric field orientation. In the case of rectangular quantum billiard with regular dynamics, emission peaks in the form of ideal δ-spikes always appear. Thus, it would be a new experimentally verifiable signature of quantum chaos. The same problem is also but strictly classically considered. It has been shown that the emission spectrum with high-order harmonics exists in this case as well. Comparison of intensities of harmonics for Bunimovich stadium, circular and rectangular billiards is given. It is highlighted that the harmonic peaks for the Bunimovich stadium are lower than for the other two regular billiards.

Secondly, many of the solutions to climate change, both mitigation and adaptation, will be through the life sciences, everything from massive reforestation and sustainable agriculture to preventing the spread of disease and protecting individual human health. Anthropogenic climate change is, therefore, one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, along with poverty alleviation, environmental degradation and global security. Climate change is no longer just a scientific concern but encompasses economics, sociology, geopolitics, national and local politics, law and health to name a few. Hence, to understand climate change fully then not only does one have to review the science but also the politics and geopolitics, which have created the issue and can provide the solutions.

Although the PTS is centrally involved in regulation of carbon metabolism in different bacteria, little is known about localization and putative oligomerization of the permease subunits (EII). Here, we analyzed localization of the fructose specific PtsF and the glucose specific PtsG transporters, as well as the general components EI and HPr from Corynebacterium glutamicum using widefield and single molecule localization microscopy. PtsF and PtsG form membrane embedded clusters that localize in a punctate pattern. Size, number and fluorescence of the membrane clusters change upon presence or absence of the transported substrate, and a direct influence of EI and HPr was not observed. In presence of the transport substrate, EII clusters significantly increased in size. Photo-activated localization microscopy data revealed that, in presence of different carbon sources, the number of EII proteins per cluster remains the same, however, the density of these clusters reduces. Our work reveals a simple mechanism for efficient membrane occupancy regulation. Clusters of PTS EII transporters are densely packed in absence of a suitable substrate.

However, its impact on the distribution network is troublesome due the uncontrollable bidirectional transfers and might lead to the reduction in various forms of support for development of distributed PV systems in the future. This could be avoided by shifting from selling to self-consumption of PV energy, so the owner of PV would benefit mostly from reductions in energy purchase. This would also reduce overall power demand and transfer losses in the energy network, for the benefit of the climate. In order to achieve this goal, the PV system must be carefully adjusted to the local consumption profile and annual energy demand. The paper investigates the adjustment opportunities for the PV system with various local consumption scenarios and optional short-term energy buffering, with view of lowering the interaction with the utility grid.

However, it remains unclear how thermokarst formation modifies soil N processes in permafrost ecosystems. Here 15N pool dilution techniques were used to evaluate changes in topsoil gross N transformations during various thaw stages (early, middle, and late stages) along a thermo-erosion gully on the Tibetan Plateau. Structural equation modeling was then conducted to explore the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in affecting soil gross N transformations. The results showed that topsoil gross N mineralization (GNM) decreased at the three stages, reflecting declined inorganic N production after permafrost collapse. In contrast, topsoil gross nitrification increased only during the early stage. Additionally, the ratio of microbial N immobilization to GNM was enhanced during the middle and late stages, indicating a stronger microbial N limitation after thermokarst formation. The structural equation modeling analysis revealed that soil moisture played an important role in modulating gross N transformations. For GNM, decreased soil moisture had inhibiting effects via regulating the microbial biomass, microbial community, and enzyme activities along the thaw sequence. For gross nitrification, declined soil moisture exerted facilitating effects directly by improving oxygen availability and indirectly by modulating the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria during the early stage. Overall, these results demonstrated that thermokarst formation altered soil N processes, potentially triggering interactions between ecosystem N and carbon cycles after permafrost thaw. ©2019.

In this context, assessment of air pollution tolerance index (APTI) offers simple tool for screening and identifying plants that tolerate air pollution. Six plants commonly growing in the polluted regions of Bengaluru were selected for assessing the air pollution tolerance response. APTI indices of Ocimum sanctum, Ricinus communis, Leucas aspera, Lantana camara, Bougainvillea spectabilis, and Vinca rosea were assessed and compared with the plants grown in non-polluted sites of Bengaluru to analyze the response to air pollution. APTI correlations with the biochemical and physicochemical parameters were analyzed to identify the important determinants of air pollution tolerance. Among the parameters assessed ascorbic acid content correlated with APTI scores of plants (R2 0.88).

In this study, we used a combination of species distribution modelling (SDM) and spatial hierarchical systematic conservation planning technique to delineate and prioritize areas for endemic plant species conservation under current and future (2050s, 2070s) climate conditions in Sikkim Himalaya. Data on endemic plant species occurrence were sourced from our already published studies and their potential suitable habitats under current and future climates were modelled using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) SDM. The MaxEnt habitat suitability projections of species were used in Zonation software to identify priority conservation areas in Sikkim Himalaya. We found that the existing PA network in the region was inadequate in conserving the endemic plant diversity either in the current or future climate scenarios. Based on our results, we propose addition of 896 square kilometres (sq km) to the existing PA network in the study area to ensure meaningful conservation goals. Additionally, we propose creation of 3 new PAs (Yumsedong, Lachen and Chungthang) and the need for expanding the boundaries of existing PAs (Maenam, Fambong Lho and Barsey) in the study area. Our analyses show that to mitigate the effects of ensuing climate change, a single large PA with wide geographic and elevational extents instead of several smaller PAs would be a more prudent strategy for conserving the plant diversity in the Himalaya. © 2019","Climate change; Conservation; Endemic plants; Himalaya; Protected areas","biodiversity; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; conservation management; conservation planning; ecological modeling; ecosystem function; endemic species; future prospect; identification method; plant; prioritization; protected area; species conservation; Himalayas; India; Lachen; Sikkim; Sikkim Himalayas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062279966

An authoritative introspection for the sustainability of agro-economic policy in consistence with the increasing population becomes the cry of the hour of the country. Sensitivity-variance of different crops to warming though confines the scopes and preferences of territoriality of productivity however, the complexity of impact of climate-change on agricultural productivity necessitates the appraisal and interrelations of physical, economic and social factors as well changing ecological imbalances. The attempt to bring structural reforms in the farming practices in weather variability context in the country requires financial support for the marginal and small-scale farmers as farming practices are predominantly adapted to local climates. The global character of atmospheric circulation and the impact of ecological and climate-changes encourage combined use of climate, crop, and economic models for sustaining growth of supply chain to market. In addition, the increasing deterioration of agricultural production due to the eventuality of climate-change and eventual ecological imbalance considerably would affect the trade balance of the country for the legislative mandate of food security. To transform the progressive move of LPG (Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization) into secured and sustainable agro-economy to save our planet from the ravages of climate change, a comprehensive schematic approach involves configuration of legal and policy tools containing thereof: a) ‘spillover costs’ of agricultural productivity due to increased ecological and climate changes; b) coherent assessment of the modalities of agriculture to harmonize the present-day water-stressed; c) coherent financing mechanism for the farmers, in particular the small-scale and marginal ones who are not only being affected disproportionately rather the changes warrant them to be displaced internally.

The deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (bio-CCS) could significantly reduce their emission intensities. In detail, the results demonstrate that CO 2 emission reduction targets of up to 20% can be met entirely by biomass deployment. A slow CCS technology introduction on top of biomass deployment is expected, as the requirement for emission reduction increases further. Bio-CCS could then be a key technology, particularly in terms of meeting targets above 50%, with CO 2 avoidance costs ranging between €60 and €100 t CO2 −1 at full-scale deployment. The future of bio-CCS and its utilisation on a larger scale would therefore only be viable if such CO 2 avoidance cost were to become economically appealing. Small and medium plants in particular, would economically benefit from sharing CO 2 pipeline networks. CO 2 transport, however, makes a relatively small contribution to the total CO 2 avoidance cost. In the future, the role of bio-CCS in the European iron and steelmaking industry will also be influenced by non-economic conditions, such as regulations, public acceptance, realistic CO 2 storage capacity, and the progress of other mitigation technologies. © 2019 The Authors","BECCS; Bio-CCS; Blast furnace; CCS; Charcoal; Industry","Biomass; Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Charcoal; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Industrial economics; Industry; Iron; Steelmaking; BECCS; Bio-CCS; CO2 emission reduction; Economic condition; Emission intensity; Emission reduction; Public acceptance; Steel-making industries; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061317532

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate dynamic problems in mitigation strategies at a container seaport. As a result, a system dynamics model for CO2 mitigation strategies at a container seaport was established. Three methods were combined to construct the system dynamics model: the activity-based method to estimate CO2 emissions; the representation of a container seaport as a system with several sub-systems; the system dynamics modeling for strategic decision-making in CO2 mitigation strategies. The key model component was the amount of CO2 emissions produced by container seaport activities. The other components represented container seaport operations and the main spots of CO2 concentration at berth, yard, gates, and region areas. Several CO2 mitigation strategies were included in the model to be simulated. The real case of Qingdao Port in China was used to simulate the scenarios of the current situation with CO2 emission amounts and the increasing container throughput. The other scenarios demonstrate the effects from CO2 mitigation strategies, such as operating time optimization, spatial measures, equipment modernization, and modal shift. The obtained results enable container seaport executives to evaluate which mitigation scenario is more effective for every container seaport area. The system dynamics model serves as a useful decision-making mechanism providing flexibility and variability in strategic planning. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Container seaport; Decision-making mechanism; Mitigation strategies; Scenarios simulation; System dynamics","carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); decision making; optimization; pollution control; port operation; shipping; China; Qingdao Bay; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067067928

The primary supply of PGMs is currently the mining industry. However, legislative, operational, and environmental challenges faced by many mining operations result in erratic supply patterns and deficits for these three metals. Naturally, recycling scrap material to recover Pt, Pd, and Rh has therefore aroused research interest in the scientific and engineering communities. Given that the majority of the global demand for these three metals is driven by emission control devices, autocatalytic converters are therefore a significant source of already processed and beneficiated PGMs for recycling. Although pyrometallurgical processes dominate the recycling industry, hydrometallurgical processes may offer certain advantages, chief among these being lower emissions and reduced energy consumption. In this investigation, scrap converter material was leached in acidic chloride media and the leach liquor subjected to solvent extraction and cloud point extraction (CPE) to recover the PGMs. The recoveries for Pt and Pd using Alamine 308® dissolved in kerosene with decanol as a modifier were 95% and 81%, respectively. The maximum recoveries using CPE after complexation with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT) in the presence of Triton X-100 and tin (II) chloride dihydrate as a reductant were 97% for Pd, 96% for Pt, and 91% for Rh. This demonstrates that CPE, although relatively new, may have some potential as a breakthrough PGM recovery technology. © 2019 South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Microstructural variability (at cm to m length scales) of vegetation canopies and geomorphic features may modulate the response of FTE vegetation to regional climate changes. Understanding the influence of microstructure on tree function at the FTE is particularly relevant during vulnerable early growth stages. During these stages, individual trees are tightly coupled to conditions of the surface boundary layer, which can be more conducive to growth than the conditions above the boundary layer. Until recently, however, it has been difficult to characterize microstructure in a replicable, transferable manner. This study builds upon substantial research on ecological responses of trees at the FTE to growth environment conditions by integrating high-resolution terrestrial lidar scanning (TLS) to characterize microstructure. Our main goal was to use TLS technology to understand the effects of microstructure on photosynthetic functioning (i.e., chlorophyll fluorescence) of small-stature white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) trees at the FTE. Our specific objectives were to: 1) determine how much variance in photosynthetic functioning is explained by microstructure; 2) identify microstructural metrics that most strongly control variance in photosynthetic functioning; and 3) determine the scales at which microstructural metrics most strongly drive variance in photosynthetic functioning. Random Forest modeling demonstrated that 28% of variance in photosynthetic functioning can be explained through variation in fine-scale environmental conditions that are modulated by microstructure alone. Insolation and canopy roughness were the most important predictors of photosynthetic functioning, and the sensitivity of photosynthetic functioning to canopy roughness was scale-dependent. This suggests that microstructure affects spatial heterogeneity in the boundary layer that may influence carbon assimilation of small-stature spruce trees. This research emphasizes the importance of quantifying microstructure in study systems where fine-scale heterogeneity of the growth environment may modulate plant responses to regional climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Forest-tundra ecotone; Lidar; Microstructure; Microtopography; Northern treeline","boundary layer; chlorophyll; ecotone; fluorescence; forest; insolation; lidar; microstructure; photosynthesis; roughness; topography; treeline; tundra; Picea; Picea glauca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061526683

Renewable energies play a fundamental role in achieving this objective. In this context, the policies of the main industrialized countries of the world are being oriented towards increasing the shares of electricity produced from renewable energy sources (RES). In recent years, the production of renewable energy has increased considerably, but given the availability of these sources, there is a mismatch between production and demand. This raises some issues as balancing the electricity grid and, in particular, the use of surplus energy, as well as the need to strengthen the electricity network. Among the various new solutions that are being evaluated, there are: the accumulation in batteries, the use of compressed air energy storage (CAES) and the production of hydrogen that appears to be the most suitable to associate with the water storage (pumped hydro). Concerning hydrogen, a recent study highlights that the efficiencies of hydrogen storage technologies are lower compared to advanced lead acid batteries on a DC-to-DC basis, but “in contrast […] the cost of hydrogen storage is competitive with batteries and could be competitive with CAES and pumped hydro in locations that are not favourable for these technologies” (Moliner et al., 2016) [1]. This shows that, once the optimal efficiency rate is reached, the technologies concerning the production of hydrogen from renewable sources will be a viable and competitive solution. But, what will be the impact on the energy and fuel markets? The production of hydrogen through electrolysis will certainly have an important economic impact, especially in the transport sector, leading to the creation of a new market and a new supply chain that will change the physiognomy of the entire energy market. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Energy market; Fuel market; Hydrogen; Hydrogen economy; Renewable energy sources (RES)","Commerce; Compressed air; Compressed air energy storage; Electric energy storage; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Lead acid batteries; Natural resources; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Supply chains; Compressed air energy storages (CAES); Energy markets; Fuel markets; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage technologies; Industrialized countries; International community; Renewable energy source; Hydrogen production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063951869

China has implemented strict air pollution control policies since the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP). There is still a lack of overall evaluation of the effects of air pollution control policies on PM2.5 pollution improvement in China since the 11th FYP. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of air pollution control policies from 2005 to 2017 on PM2.5 using satellite remote sensing. We used the satellite-derived PM2.5 of 2005-2013 from one of our previous studies. For the data of 2014-2017, we developed a two-stage statistical model to retrieve satellite PM2.5 data using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol optical depth (AOD), assimilated meteorology, and land use data. The first stage is a day-specific linear mixed effects (LME) model and the second stage is a generalized additive model (GAM). Results show that the Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction (ECER) policy, implemented in the 11th FYP period and focused on SO2 emissions control, had co-benefits with PM2.5 reductions. The increasing trends of PM2.5 pollution (1.88 and 3.14 μgm-3 year-1 for all of China and the Jingjinji region in 2004-2007, p&lt;0.005) were suppressed after 2007. The overall PM2.5 trend for all of China was -0.56 μgm-3 year-1 with marginal significance (p= 0.053) and PM2.5 concentrations in the Pearl River Delta region had a big drop (-4.81 μgm-3 year-1, p&lt;0.001) in 2007-2010. The ECER policy during the 12th FYP period was basically an extension of the 11th FYP policy. PM2.5 is a kind of composite pollutant which comprises primary particles and secondary particles such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, elemental carbon, etc. Since the ECER policy focused on single-pollutant control, it had shown great limitation for PM2.5 reductions. The PM2.5 concentrations did not decrease from 2010 to 2013 in polluted areas (p values of the trends were greater than 0.05). Therefore, China implemented two stricter policies. the 12th FYP on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions (APPC-KR) in 2012, and the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) in 2013. The goal of air quality improvement (especially PM2.5 concentration improvement) and measures for multi-pollutant control were proposed. These policies led to dramatic decreases in PM2.5 after 2013 (-4.27 μgm-3 year-1 for all of China in 2013- 2017, p&lt;0.001). © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol; atmospheric pollution; MODIS; optical depth; particulate matter; policy making; pollution control; pollution policy; remote sensing; satellite imagery; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066022328

However, the reported PL spectral characteristics lack consistency and remain controversial. Here we report that ""defect-emission free"" PL spectra can even be obtained in thin films composed of as-synthesized ZnO NPs. It is found that both the PL spectral line-shape and intensity are extremely sensitive to nitrogen and oxygen. By conducting time-dependent PL (t-PL) and photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) measurements under vacuum and different gases, it is proposed that both inert (N 2 ) and reactive (O 2 ) molecules can be absorbed on the ZnO NP surface and induce charge transfer (CT). The CT states induced by N 2 are non-radiative which significantly reduces the band emission. Whereas the CT states induced by O 2 are radiative at the visible region, and the exciton transfer is efficient which increases the overall PL quantum yield. Owing to such effects, the previously reported correlation between defects and PL emission becomes questionable and needs to be revisited. Particularly, the visible emission from the ZnO NPs is proved to be facilitated by external effects, instead of direct recombination from defect states. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Charge transfer; II-VI semiconductors; Nanoparticles; Photoluminescence; Quantum theory; Zinc oxide; Direct recombination; Nanoparticle (NPs); Photothermal deflection spectroscopy; PL quantum yield; Quality of solution; Spectral characteristics; Spectral line shape; Visible emissions; ZnO nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065570763

In light of the Paris Agreement, it is essential to identify the regional impacts of 0.5 °C of additional global warming to inform climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Using the modified Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) and Advection-Aridity (AA) models with global warming values of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C above preindustrial levels from Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b) datasets, we conducted a new set of climate simulations to assess the effects of climate on WUE (the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to actual evapotranspiration (ETa)) in different sandy land types (mobile sandy land, MSL; semimobile/semifixed sandy land, SMSF; and fixed sandy land, FSL) during the period of baseline (1986–2005) and future (2006–2100). The spatiotemporal patterns of ETa, NPP, and WUE mostly showed increasing trends; the value of WUE decreased (6.40%) only in MSL with an additional 0.5 °C of warming. Meteorological and vegetation factors determined the variations in WUE. With warming, only the correlation between precipitation and WUE decreased in the three sandy land types, and the leaf area index (LAI) increased with an additional 0.5 °C of warming. The desertification degree comprehensively reflects the linkages among the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), LAI and WUE. Simulation results indicated the sandy area extent could potential increase by 20 × 10 4 km 2 per decade on average during 2016–2047 and that the increase could be gradual (2.60 × 10 4 km 2 per decade) after 2050 (2050–2100). These results highlight the benefits of limiting the global mean temperature change to 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels and can help identify the risk of desertification with an additional 0.5 °C of warming. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","1.5 °C warming; 2.0 °C warming; Desertification; Northern China; WUE","Ecosystems; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Tantalum compounds; Water supply; Actual evapotranspiration; Advection-aridity models; Carnegie-ames-stanford approach (CASA); Desertification; Global-mean temperature; Net primary productivity; Northern China; Spatiotemporal patterns; Climate models; carbon cycle; climate change; climate effect; desertification; evapotranspiration; global warming; hydrometeorology; net primary production; water use efficiency; advection; article; China; climate; desertification; evapotranspiration; greenhouse effect; leaf area; plant water use; precipitation; simulation; vegetation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061085097

This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of labile C levels on soil N mineralization under different simulated N deposition rates. Materials and methods: Soils at 0–15-cm depth were collected from two contrasting subtropical forests, a coniferous fir forest (CFF) and an evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF); both soils had been subjected to 3 years of artificial NH4NO3 input or deposition (no-N control, N0; low N (30 kg N ha−1 year−1; N30), and high N (100 kg N ha−1 year−1); N100). The impacts of external glucose-C (G) on N mineralization of these N-deposited soils were investigated by the addition of six C rates (mg C kg−1 dry weight soil—0, G0; 100, G100; 300, G300; 1000, G1000; 2000, G2000; and 5000, G5000), at a temperature of 25 °C, and a 60% water-holding capacity for 21 days. Results and discussion: The results showed that, after 21 days of incubation, concentrations of inorganic N (NH4+–N and NO3−–N) decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) with increasing C rates and reached a minimum value when the added C rate was ≥ G1000. The lowest NH4+–N under G1000 was 9.2 mg kg−1 in all of these three N-deposited soils at the CFF site while 11.6 mg kg−1 in the N30 soil at the EBF site. The concentration of NO3−–N was decreased to 0 under G1000 and G2000 in the CFF and EBF soils, respectively. These results revealed that the higher the soil NO3−–N concentration was, the greater the NO3−–N reduced, with a maximum decrease of 80 mg NO3−–N kg−1 in the N100 soil from the EBF site. In addition, the soil mineralization and nitrification rates were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in soils from the EBF than from the CFF site and increased with N in soils subjected to simulated N deposition. However, the net N transformation rates also decreased with C addition and had the minimum value at G1000. Conclusions: Our results suggested that there could be a critical C level at which N transformation being altered in certain soils, based on their N status, and that the impacts of C on soil N mineralization were independent of soil N availability. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon level; Forest soil; Nitrate immobilization; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen transformation","concentration (composition); forest ecosystem; forest soil; glucose; mineralization; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil nitrogen; subtropical region; transformation; tropical forest; Abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059629306

Beside integrating more decentralized generations into existing systems, an efficient system operation is equally important toward achieving a sustainable energy system. In order to keep track of upcoming changes regarding system efficiency, an accurate determination of energy losses in distribution system is the prominent step. Especially in the distribution systems with high penetration of the renewable energy resources, the installed distributed generations can significantly affect energy losses and influence grid efficiency in power distribution systems. To address this issue, this paper investigates the impact of distributed generations on the annual energy losses in low voltage distribution grids. Based on an analytical study on grid losses and the relevant features, which are used to describe the grid integration of distributed generators in diverse scenarios, an annual energy loss indicator is proposed in this work. This new indicator is capable to estimate the energy losses of low voltage grids for a wide range of scenarios concerning both the installation of distributed generators and grid structures. Also, the formulation of this new indicator is largely simplified in comparison to other state-of-the-art indicators presented by previous studies. The effectiveness and the performance of the proposed methodology is first demonstrated in two typical low voltage grids, in which high amount of photovoltaic units already exist today. Further, this indicator is applied on a set of grids in extended tests on readability and robustness. Comparison of the estimations using the proposed indicator against the exhaustive power flow calculations shows that the proposed indicator gives a reliable and sufficiently accurate estimation of grid energy losses under influences of distributed generations. Fast evaluations of the system losses, enabled by the proposed indicator, provide assessments on energy efficiency of distribution systems in future development stages of distributed generations. Accordingly, distribution system operators are able to select optimal locations for new generation units, adjust their grid reinforcement plans to improve the total energy efficiency on the whole system scales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed generation; Grid losses; Low-voltage grids; Sensitivity analysis; System efficiency","Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Energy dissipation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Voltage distribution measurement; Decentralized generation; Grid loss; Low-voltage distributions; Low-voltage grid; Power distribution system; Power flow calculations; Sustainable energy systems; System efficiency; Energy efficiency; alternative energy; control system; distribution system; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy planning; greenhouse gas; installation; power plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063042562

It has been shown that novel weapons aid invasion but it is unclear whether native species co-occurring with invaders have adapted to tolerate these novel weapons. Those resident species which are able to adapt to new selective agents can co-occur with an invader while others face a risk of local extinction. We ran a factorial common garden experiment to study whether a native plant species, Anthriscus sylvestris, has been able to evolve a greater tolerance to the allelochemicals exerted by the invader, Lupinus polyphyllus. Lupinus polyphyllus produces allelochemicals which potentially act as a novel, strong selective agent on A. sylvestris. We grew A. sylvestris seedlings collected from uninvaded (naïve) and invaded (experienced) sites growing alone and in competition with L. polyphyllus in pots filled with soil with and without activated carbon. Because activated carbon absorbs allelochemicals, its addition should improve especially naïve A. sylvestris performance in the presence of the invader. To distinguish the allelochemicals absorption and fertilizing effects of activated carbon, we grew plants also in a mixture of soil and fertilizer. A common garden experiment indicated that the performances of naïve and experienced A. sylvestris seedlings did not differ when grown with L. polyphyllus. The addition of activated carbon, which reduces interference by allelochemicals, did not induce differences in their performances although it had a positive effect on the aboveground biomass of A. sylvestris. Together, these results suggest that naïve and experienced A. sylvestris plants tolerated equally the invader L. polyphyllus and thus the tolerance has not occurred over the course of invasion. © 2019 The Authors.

The results suggested that (1) the coupled model can predict carbon storage change with urbanization in a high accuracy (relative error within ±5% for 94.6% of the whole area); (2) carbon storage of Shizuishan experienced a loss of 2.70 Tg in 1989–2015, and would continue to experience a loss of 6.18 Tg, 5.27 Tg, 3.76 Tg and 2.47 Tg under historical growth scenario (HGS), decrease socioeconomic scenario (DSS), compact growth scenario (CGS) and ecological protection scenario (EPS) in 2015–2035, respectively; (3) compact urban growth pattern and ecological protection policy can both decrease the negative effects of urbanization on carbon storage. Multiple ecosystem services should be integrated into urban planning to achieve a balance of socioeconomic development and environment protection. © 2019 The Ecological Society of Japan","carbon storage; InVEST model; multi-scenario comparison; SLEUTH-3r model; urbanization","carbon sequestration; comparative study; ecosystem service; global warming; land use change; prediction; scenario analysis; software; urban growth; urban planning; urbanization; China; Ningxia Huizu; Shizuishan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064515262

Camelina sativa is an oilseed crop which has received increasing attention due to its short life cycle, broader adaptation regions, high oil content, high level of omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids, and low-input requirements in agriculture practices. To expand its Camelina production areas into arid regions, there is a need to breed for new drought-tolerant cultivars. Leaf cuticular wax is known to facilitate plant development and growth under water-limited conditions. Dissecting the genetic loci underlying leaf cuticular waxes is important to breed for cultivars with improved drought tolerance. Results: Here we combined phenotypic data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a spring C. sativa diversity panel using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technology, to perform a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) on leaf wax compositions. A total of 42 SNP markers were significantly associated with 15 leaf wax traits including major wax components such as total primary alcohols, total alkanes, and total wax esters as well as their constituents. The vast majority of significant SNPs were associated with long-chain carbon monomers (carbon chain length longer than C28), indicating the important effects of long-chain carbon monomers on leaf total wax biosynthesis. These SNP markers are located on genes directly or indirectly related to wax biosynthesis such as maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology and enabling normal wax secretion from ER to plasma membrane or Golgi network-mediated transport. Conclusions: These loci could potentially serve as candidates for the genetic control involved in intracellular wax transport that might directly or indirectly facilitate leaf wax accumulation in C. sativa and can be used in future marker-assisted selection (MAS) to breed for the cultivars with high wax content to improve drought tolerance. © 2019 The Author(s).","Camelina sativa; Genome-wide association studies (GWAS); Intracellular wax transport; Leaf cuticular wax","alcohol derivative; aldehyde; alkane; wax; algorithm; Brassicaceae; chemistry; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetics; genome-wide association study; metabolism; phenotype; plant leaf; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; transport at the cellular level; Alcohols; Aldehydes; Algorithms; Alkanes; Biological Transport; Brassicaceae; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; Linkage Disequilibrium; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Waxes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065477097

How to effectively use energy to achieve economic growth on the premise of environmental friendliness is an important topic on which to focus in the new century. China is the largest developing country in the world in terms of population. Its subtropical population is close to one half of its total population. The subtropical region is representative of China’s regions with delayed economic development. However, the region has a small share of energy resources, including coal, oil, and gas. At the same time, the rapid economic growth of the region in the past three decades has deviated from the theory of resource endowment. Therefore, it is necessary to study the relationship among energy consumption, environmental pollution, and economic growth in China’s subtropical regions. The study should be conducive to healthy economic development in China and in the world as a whole. This article calculates the degree of correlation among energy consumption, environmental pollution, and economic growth by means of a gray correlation analysis. The results show that energy consumption drives the development of the economy and causes environmental pollution. Environmental pollution also has negative effects on economic development. With regard to reconciling energy consumption, environmental pollution, and economic growth, technology can be used to improve energy use efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions. Energy consumption structure should be optimized to achieve clean, high-quality energy consumption. Policies should be established to encourage green production, and laws should be enacted to support these policies. © The Author(s) 2019.","association analysis; economic growth; energy consumption; environmental pollution; gray relational analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070246406

Here, a low-cost porous Zn electrocatalyst is synthesized using a facile electrodeposition method to boost the performance of CO2 electrocatalytic reaction (CO2RR). In an H-cell reactor, the porous Zn catalyst can convert CO2 to CO at a remarkably high faradaic efficiency (FE, ∼95%) and current density (27 mA cm-2) at -0.95 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Detailed electrokinetic studies demonstrate that instead of the enhanced intrinsic activity, the dramatically increased active sites play a decisive role in improving the catalytic activity. In addition, the high local pH induced by the highly porous structure of Zn results in enhanced CO selectivity because of the suppressed H2 evolution. Furthermore, we present a straightforward strategy to transform the porous Zn electrode into a gas diffusion electrode. This way, the CO2RR current density can be boosted to 200 mA cm-2 with ∼84% FE for CO at -0.64 V in a flow-cell reactor, which is, to date, the best performance observed over non-noble CO2RR catalysts. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","catalytic mechanism; CO2 electrochemical reduction; gas diffusion electrode; local pH effect; Zn catalyst","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Diffusion in gases; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; pH effects; Selective catalytic reduction; Catalytic mechanisms; Electrocatalytic reactions; Electrochemical reductions; Electrodeposition methods; Gas diffusion electrodes; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Straightforward strategy; Zn-catalysts; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064339049

Nevertheless, the present integration levels are still far from the targets. The main reason being the technical barriers arising from their non-manageable features. Photovoltaic and wind sources are the widest spread, as their maturity allows generation with a high-efficiency degree. A deep understanding of facilities’ performance and how they can match the energy demand is mandatory to reduce costs and extend the technical limits and facilitate their penetration. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to evaluate how photovoltaic–wind hybrid facilities, placed in an urban environment can give generation patterns which will be able to match the demand profiles better than facilities installed individually. This methodology has been applied to a broad number of locations spread over the whole planet. The results show that with high homogeneity in terms of site weather characteristics, the hybrid facilities improve the matching up to 15% over photovoltaic plants and up to 35% over wind. © 2019 by the authors.","Complementarity; Grid integration; Photovoltaic; Wind energy","Emission control; Global warming; Wind power; Complementarity; Generation patterns; Greenhouse emissions; Grid integration; Integration levels; Integration of renewable energies; Photovoltaic; Urban environments; Urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065867700

This study developed a combined method to investigate source types of PM2.5 and its source regions during winter 2016 in Beijing, which include the receptor model (positive matrix factorization, PMF), footprint and an air quality model. The PMF model was performed with high-time-resolution measurements of trace elements, water soluble ions, organic carbon and elemental carbon using online instruments during the wintertime campaign of the Air Pollution and Human Health in a Chinese Megacity-Beijing (APHH-Beijing) program in 2016. Source types and their contributions estimated by PMF model using online measurements were linked with source regions identified by the footprint model, and the regional transport contribution was estimated by an air quality model (the Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System, NAQPMS) to analyze the specific sources and source regions during haze episodes. Our results show that secondary and biomass-burning sources were dominated by regional transport, while the coal combustion source increased with local contribution, suggesting that strict control strategies for local coal combustion in Beijing and a reduction of biomass-burning and gaseous precursor emissions in surrounding areas were essential to improve air quality in Beijing. The combination of PMF with footprint results revealed that secondary sources were mainly associated with southern footprints (53 %). The northern footprint was characterized by a high dust source contribution (11 %), while industrial sources increased with the eastern footprint (10 %). The results demonstrated the power of combining receptor model-based source apportionment with other models in understanding the formation of haze episodes and identifying specific sources from different source regions affecting air quality in Beijing. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon footprint; emission; particulate matter; pollutant transport; source apportionment; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065877006

In this process, the expression of cold-responsive (COR) genes is activated and the genes undergo physiological changes in response to the exposure to low, non-freezing temperatures and other environmental signals. The C-repeat-binding factors (CBFs) have been demonstrated to regulate the expression of many COR genes. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of how plants transmit cold signals from the plasma membrane to the CBFs and the results have indicated that COR genes are also regulated through CBF-independent pathways. Climate change is expected to have a major impact on cold acclimation and freezing tolerance of plants. However, how climate change affects plant cold acclimation at the molecular level remains unclear. This mini-review focuses on recent advances in cold acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana and discusses how signaling can be potentially impacted by climate change. Understanding how plants acquire cold acclimation is valuable for the improvement of the freezing tolerance in plants and for predicting the effects of climate change on plant distribution and agricultural yield. © 2019, The Author(s).","Abiotic stress; CAMTAs; CBFs; Cold-responsive gene; Local adaptation; Protein kinase","Arabidopsis protein; protein kinase; acclimatization; Arabidopsis; cold; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; physiology; Acclimatization; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Cold Temperature; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Protein Kinases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060124891

The result confirms that around 40% of the samples installed home energy management system (HEMS) as the visualisation tool, and many households received low-carbon subsidies; however, few of them have utilised the low-interest loan from the government of Hyogo. Household lifestyle efforts are less associated with the policy measures and some differ due to family characteristics, i.e., the age of head of the household. Replacing household equipment with low-carbon items is largely determined by the visualisation approach and availability of economic incentives. As an example, the installation of HEMS would increase the probability of replacement with an electric heat pump water heater by 25.6% and the introduction of solar PV system by 55.9%.

Accurate urban extent datasets at large spatial scales are essential for researchers and policymakers to better understand urbanization dynamics and its socioeconomic drivers and impacts. While high-resolution urban extent data products - including the Global Human Settlements Layer (GHSL), the Global Man-Made Impervious Surface (GMIS), the Global Human Built-Up and Settlement Extent (HBASE), and the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) - have recently become available, intermediate-resolution urban extent data products including the 1 km SEDAC's Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), MODIS 1km, and MODIS 500 m still have many users and have been demonstrated in a recent study to be more appropriate in urbanization process analysis (around 500 m resolution) than those at higher resolutions (30 m). The objective of this study is to improve large-scale urban extent mapping at an intermediate resolution (500 m) using machine learning methods through combining the complementary nighttime Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and daytime Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, taking the conterminous United States (CONUS) as the study area. The effectiveness of commonly-used machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), neural network (NN), and their ensemble (ESB), has been explored. Our results show that these machine learning methods can achieve similar high accuracies across all accuracy metrics ( > 95% overall accuracy, > 98% producer's accuracy, and > 92% user's accuracy) with Kappa coeffcients greater than 0.90, which have not been achieved in the existing data products or by previous studies; the ESB is not able to produce significantly better accuracies than individual machine learning methods; the total misclassifications generated by GBM are more than those generated by RF, NN, and ESB by 14%, 16%, and 11%, respectively, with NN having the least total misclassifications.

The calculation results indicate that while a selenium atom generally cannot be stably adsorbed on the surface, it can bond to a surface carbon atom on the surface with one open radical site (1ORS), with an adsorption energy of 2.74 eV. Moreover, selenium atoms can combine with two surface C atoms, with adsorption energies from 4.10 eV to 4.67 eV. The migration activation energy of the selenium atoms on the surface is approximately 1.34 eV. A density of states examination presents an interesting result. On the surface of the 2ORS slabs, after bonding with two surface C atoms, the selenium atom no longer has any unpaired electrons, and its magnetic moment becomes 0 μ B . In this case, a deposited carbon atom can combine with the selenium atom by a triple bond, and then the C–Se molecule is desorbed from the surface. This outcome implies that the direct selenium doping method can only fabricate Se-doped diamond films with very low selenium incorporation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption and migration; C–Se molecule; First-principles calculations; Se-doped diamond films","Activation energy; Adsorption; Calculations; Diamond films; Hydrogen; Magnetic moments; Molecules; Selenium; Semiconductor doping; Adsorption energies; Biomaterial application; Calculation results; Doped-diamond films; First-principles calculation; First-principles study; Hydrogen-terminated diamond; Unpaired electrons; Atoms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062397545

In this study, a disaggregated ecologically-extended input-output (DECEIO) model is developed to investigate integrated GHG emissions and the emission relationships of various industries. A special case study for the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, is conducted to illustrate the potential benefits of its use in the formulation of industrially related legislation. A disaggregated analysis that contains three GHG types and four emission sources is conducted to gain more insight into the complicated interactions between different industries. It is found that all kinds of emission sources and GHG types should be considered to comprehensively identify the characteristics of emission flows in the socio-economic system. The competitive relationships reflect good interactions in the GHG emission flows and a mutualism relationship reveals effective pathways to mitigate carbon emissions in two sectors simultaneously. In the Province of Saskatchewan, the Agriculture and Forestry sector, Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution sector, Construction sector and Household Consumption sector all rank at the top for GHG emissions and their relationships are mutualistic. Thus, it is vital to propose effective industrial legislation for these industries to realize GHG emission reduction targets. © 2019","Canada; Climate change; Disaggregated Ecologically-extended Input-Output model; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Industrial legislation formulation","Climate change; Climate models; Construction industry; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Emission control; Forestry; Industrial economics; Canada; Environmental challenges; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Household Consumption; Industrial legislation formulation; Input output model; Socio-economic systems; Transmission and distribution; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062415196

The populated megacity represents the most complex anthropogenic BC emissions where the sources and related impacts are very uncertain. This study provides source attribution and characterization of BC in the Beijing urban environment during the joint UK-China APHH (Air Pollution and Human Health) project, in both winter (November-December 2016) and summer (May-June 2017). The size-resolved mixing state of BCcontaining particles was characterized by a single-particle soot photometer (SP2) and their mass spectra was measured by a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS). The refractory BC (rBC) mass loading was around a factor of 2 higher in winter relative to summer, and more variable coatings were present, likely as a result of additional surface emissions from the residential sector and favourable condensation in the cold season. The characteristics of the BC were relatively independent of air mass direction in summer, whereas in winter air masses from the Northern Plateau were considerably cleaner and contained less-coated and smaller BC, but the BC from the Southern Plateau had the largest core size and coatings. We compare two online source apportionment methods using simultaneous measurements made by the SP2, which measures physical properties of BC, and the chemical approach using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) of mass spectra from the SP-AMS for the first time. A method is proposed to isolate the BC from the transportation sector using a mode of small BC particles (core diameter Dc &lt; 0:18 μm and coating thickness ct &lt; 50 nm). This mode of BC highly correlated with NOx concentration in both seasons (∼ 14 ng m-3 BC ppb-1 NOx) and corresponded with the morning traffic rush hour, contributing about 30 % and 40 % of the total rBC mass (35 % and 55 % in number) in winter and summer respectively. The BC from coal burning or biomass burning was characterized by moderate coatings (ct D 50-200 nm) contributing ∼ 20 %-25 % of rBC mass. Large uncoated BC particles (Dc &gt; 0:18 μm and ct &lt; 50 nm) were more likely to be contributed by coal combustion, as these particles were not present in urban London. This mode was present in Beijing in both winter (∼ 30 %-40 % rBC mass) and summer (∼ 40 % rBC mass) but may be dominated by the residential and industrial sector respectively. The contribution of BC thickly coated with secondary species (ct &gt; 200 nm) to the total rBC mass increased with pollution level in winter but was minor in summer. These large BC particles importantly enhanced the absorption efficiency at high pollution levels-in winter when PM1 &gt; 100 μg m-3 or BC &gt; 2 μg m-3, the absorption efficiency of BC increased by 25 %-70 %. The reduction of emissions of these large BC particles and the precursors of the associated secondary coating will be an effective way of mitigating the heating effect of BC in urban environments. © 2019 Author(s).",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; emission inventory; photometer; pollution monitoring; soot; source apportionment; summer; urban atmosphere; winter; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066090137

Air pollution is one of the basic environmental causes of premature deaths in the world. The main source of air pollution in cities is the low emission associated with fuel combustion to generate heat for buildings heating, communication and industry. The existing buildings in Poland are characterized by high energy and, consequently, ecological potential. The aim is to estimate predicted energetic and ecological effects of activities that adapt existing residential buildings to the requirements for the thermal protection of buildings in Poland and presenting the possibility of using renewable energy sources. The energy demand for heating buildings at 60-70 kWh/(m2rok) has been adopted. The calculations show that as a result of this adjustment, the energy demand for heating in residential buildings may decrease by an average of around 67% compared to 2011. Such actions will reduce the overall emissions of air pollution from households by reducing the energy requirement for heating apartments from about 30% to about 67%, depending on the type of pollutant. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Energy management; Fuels; Heating; Housing; Renewable energy resources; Ecological effect; Energy requirements; Existing residential buildings; Premature death; Renewable energy source; Residential building; Thermal protection; Urban environments; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067301589

The water depletion index (WDI) is one water stress indicator used to estimate the impacts of water consumption. A dynamic WDI was constructed and employed in this study under climate change scenarios with weather and streamflow modeling. To demonstrate whether adaptation measures can reduce water depletion and to demonstrate how dynamic WDI affects assessment results, Taipei, a highly developed and populated city in Taiwan, was selected as a case study site. Decreased WDI from July to August and increased WDI from September to October were simulated under climate change. This approach implied that when measuring water consumption impacts, the WDI should be applied according to the corresponding time period. Additionally, by substituting 70% of potable water with rainwater in a four-story building, 17.9–159.3 m 3 of the freshwater depletion risk might be reduced every month. As adaptation measures can be long-term strategies and long-lasting infrastructures, a dynamic WDI could provide policy makers with a method to accurately and effectively assess the impacts of applying water-related adaptation measures in response to climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic characterization factors; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); Urban water system; Water consumption impacts","Decision making; Environmental impact; Potable water; Water management; Waterworks; Climate change scenarios; Dynamic characterization; Environmental benefits; Four-story buildings; Rainwater harvesting system; Soil and water assessment tool; Urban water systems; Water consumption; Climate change; adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; comparative study; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; freshwater; rainwater; resource depletion; risk assessment; soil and water assessment tool; strategic approach; streamflow; urban area; water planning; water stress; water use; Taipei; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062356513

Based on the “National Comprehensive demonstration of Energy Saving and Emission Reduction Fiscal Policy” (“ESER” policy) proposed by the Chinese government in 2011, this paper analyzes the impact of such policy on emissions reduction and economic growth. Under the framework of Differences-in-differences (DID) method, this paper first identifies the implementation conditions of “ESER” policy. Then we adopt three specifications to control the endogenous problem for the selection of demonstration cities. The robustness test verifies the reliability of our findings, and the spillover effect analysis reveals the deficiency of this policy. We reach the following conclusions: (1) Different from the previous studies, we find that the “ESER” policy can effectively reduce the pollutant emissions while ensuring a stable economic growth. (2) However, the event study reveals that the reduction effect is only existing in the demonstration period, which means that this policy is not sustainable. (3) Furthermore, we find no spillover effect of “ESER” policy on the non-policy targeted pollutant, suggesting that the local government only cares about the reduction of policy targeted pollutants. Based on these findings, we propose that the future energy saving and emissions reduction policy formulation should focus on the policy sustainability and overall environmental performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Differences-in-differences method; Economic growth; Emissions reduction; Policy evaluation","Demonstrations; Economics; Energy conservation; Environmental management; Reliability analysis; Sustainable development; Chinese Government; Differences-in-differences; Economic growths; Emissions reduction; Energy saving and emission reductions; Environmental performance; Policy evaluation; Pollutant emission; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062718482

However, the selectivity for ethanol, a globally significant commodity chemical, is still low compared to the selectivity for products such as ethylene. Here we introduce diverse binding sites to a Cu catalyst, an approach that destabilizes the ethylene reaction intermediates and thereby promotes ethanol production. We develop a bimetallic Ag/Cu catalyst that implements the proposed design toward an improved ethanol catalyst. It achieves a record Faradaic efficiency of 41% toward ethanol at 250 mA/cm2 and -0.67 V vs RHE, leading to a cathodic-side (half-cell) energy efficiency of 24.7%. The new catalysts exhibit an in situ Raman spectrum, in the region associated with CO stretching, that is much broader than that of pure Cu controls, a finding we account for via the diversity of binding configurations.

A ‘bottom-up’ engineering approach for building stock energy modeling is attractive to built environment energy researchers because of its capacity for detailed energy analysis. However, such studies in China have been very limited to date. The aim of this research is to develop a modeling approach to residential building stock energy consumption for space heating and cooling. A holistic four-step approach of archetype configurations; building performance simulation; stock floor area estimation and local weather adjustment is presented. The Chongqing municipality was chosen to demonstrate the approach. The results show that adopting the northern China standard pattern of central space heating for Chongqing's urban residential stock is not feasible because it dramatically increases primary energy consumption and therefore carbon dioxide emissions from space heating usage. By applying energy conservation retrofit measures to the Chongqing urban residential stock, the total energy consumption for space heating and cooling and resulting carbon dioxide emissions can be significantly reduced, with estimated reductions of 57.6%–60.7% in 2020 and 55.3%–57.2% in 2050.

This paper analyzes the policy system of the APPC measures and its impact on regional short-term electricity demand, and determines the regional short-term load impact factors considering the impact of APPC measures. On this basis, this paper proposes a similar day selection method based on the best and worst method and grey relational analysis (BWM-GRA) in order to construct the training sample set, which considers the difference in the influence degree of characteristic indicators on daily power load. Further, a short-term load forecasting method based on least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) optimized by salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is developed. By forecasting the load of a city affected by air pollution in Northern China, and comparing the results with several selected models, it reveals that the impact of APPC measures on regional short-term load is significant. Moreover, by considering the influence of APPC measures and avoiding the subjectivity of model parameter settings, the proposed load forecasting model can improve the accuracy of, and provide an effective tool for short-term load forecasting.

Fabricated carbon nanomaterials, owing to their outstanding physicochemical properties, are increasingly considered as additives to manipulate the hydrate formation, whereas little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism. Here, we investigate the methane hydrate formation in the presence of graphene nanosheets (GNs) using molecular dynamics simulations. Particular attention is placed on the effects of size, aggregation, and oxidation of GNs. Individual GNs are found to play roles in a size-dependent manner, as sharp corners of GNs are preferentially anchored into cavities at the hydrate surface, exposing other segment in a solvent to disturb the local hydrate structure. Once GNs form aggregates exceeding a critical size, methane molecules can be recruited to promote formation of nanobubbles, thus retarding the hydrate formation due to depletion of methane in the aqueous phase. Graphene oxide forms hydrogen bonds with water both in the aqueous phase and at the hydrate surface, thus reducing the water activity to obstruct the hydrate growth. Our results have important consequences for regulating the methane hydrate formation and open up new avenues for the energy application of graphene family nanomaterials. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Additives; Graphene; Hydration; Hydrogen bonds; Methane; Molecular dynamics; Nanosheets; Nanostructured materials; Natural gas transportation; Physicochemical properties; Carbon nano-materials; Energy applications; Graphene nanosheets; Hydrate formation; Hydrate structures; Methane molecules; Molecular dynamics simulations; Molecular mechanism; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066155118

We now know that global warming, a result of carbon dioxide emissions, severely threatens the sustainability of human society. It is therefore of significant theoretical and practical implications that the scientific community more thoroughly investigate the impacts of modernization on CO 2 emissions. Surprisingly, only a limited number of studies have addressed this topic previously. As the world's largest developing economy and carbon emitter, China faces the dual challenge of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 while realizing basic modernization by 2035. With the purpose of identifying the implications of China's 2035 modernization goal for its 2030 emission peak goal, this study explored the effects of modernization on carbon dioxide emissions in China. Using a comprehensive indicator system, five modernization indexes—addressing industrialization, agricultural modernization, informatization, urbanization, and ecological modernization—were estimated, along with carbon dioxide emissions, for the period 1997–2016, for 30 Chinese provinces. Panel data modeling was then used to examine the impacts of the five modernization indexes on CO 2 emissions in China. The results demonstrate that industrialization, agricultural modernization, informatization, and urbanization exerted positive effects on CO 2 emissions during the study period, suggesting these aspects of modernization led to increased carbon dioxide emissions. A negative correlation between ecological modernization and carbon dioxide emission was identified, indicating that ecological modernization helped to abate CO 2 emissions. The findings emerging from this study hold significant implications for China's policy makers in promoting decarbonization, suggesting the utility of pursuing new-type industrialization, developing organic agriculture and eco-agriculture, popularizing electronic equipment with low power dissipation, building low-carbon cities, and promoting the ecology-oriented transformation of the modernization model. © 2019","Carbon dioxide emission; China; Climate change; Modernization; Panel data","Agriculture; Climate change; Ecology; Global warming; Information analysis; Modernization; Oscillators (electronic); Agricultural modernizations; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Developing economies; Ecological modernizations; Low-power dissipation; Panel data; Scientific community; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; industrialization; modernization; panel data; urbanization; agricultural management; Article; carbon footprint; China; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; environmental sustainability; greenhouse effect; industrialization; priority journal; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060869773

In this study, an integrated hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) model for multiple regions of China is presented to evaluate the life cycle CO2 emission, energy consumption, and energy payback time of a 10-MW power tower CSP plant located in China. Over its life cycle of 25 years, the CSP plant is estimated to have CO2 emissions of 35 g/kWh, consume 514 kJ/kWh of energy, and have an energy payback time close to four years. Using the proposed hybrid model, a significant advantage is the ability to compare the life cycle impact sourced from each sector in input-output economic background. Based on the regionalization of economic background at the province level, the most noteworthy impact is from Hubei province; besides, the CO2 emission from the electricity sector in each province is the largest contributor. The majority (54%) of the life cycle CO2 emission of the CSP plant is contributed by the northern region of China due to the higher utilization of coal in the economy of that region, yet most of the energy consumption comes from the southern part of China because of the concentration of manufacturing there. For the life cycle impact of a CSP plant, thermal energy storage using molten salt, and solar collection demanding lots of steel are the two most significant contributors to CO2 emission and energy consumption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emission; CSP; Energy payback time; Integrated hybrid LCA","Carbon dioxide; Electric energy storage; Energy utilization; Global warming; Heat storage; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Carbon dioxide emissions; Concentrated solar power; Concentrating solar; Contribution analysis; Energy pay back time; Hybrid LCA; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle assessment model; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic conditions; electricity industry; energy storage; environmental economics; input-output analysis; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; power plant; solar power; China; Hubei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062701098

However, the reaction is usually limited by both high energy consumption and strict reaction condition. Here, we report, for the first time, photoinduced efficient ethylene (C2H4) and CO production by OCM over TiO2-supported Ag nanoparticles at mild conditions. The success relies on a synergy coupling visible-light-induced strong surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect localized on Ag(0), ultraviolet-light-induced photoelectric effect on TiO2, and the separated adsorption of CO2 and CH4 on TiO2 and Ag.

X-ray diffraction patterns and Rietveld refinements for several representative samples indicated the pure phase of as-prepared samples. The Yb3+,Er3+ codoped (N/L)BMO presented bright green luminescence under 975 nm laser excitation with UCL spectra showing two main green bands around 529 nm (Er3+, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 551 nm (Er3+, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2), in addition to a very weak one at 655 nm (Er3+, 4F9/2 → 4I15/2). The (N/L)BMO:Yb3+,Ho3+ mainly showed a green band around 544 nm (5S2,5F4 → 5I8) and a red band around 654 nm (5F5 → 5I8) upon 975 nm laser excitation. With increasing Yb3+ concentrations in (N/L)BMO:Yb3+,0.01Ho3+, the red/green ratios decreased monotonously corresponding to the emission color variation from light red to light yellow. Both UCL mechanisms of Yb3+,Er3+ and Yb3+,Ho3+ were determined to be two-phonons absorption processes in (N/L)BMO:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+. The Ce3+ ions were introduced into Yb3+,Ho3+ codoped (N/L)BMO to show the color tuning from light yellow to light red originating from the cross relaxation processes of (CR1) Ho3+ (5F4,5S2) + Ce3+ (2F5/2) → Ho3+ (5F5) + Ce3+ (2F7/2) and (CR2) Ho3+(5I6) + Ce3+ (2F5/2) → Ho3+ (5I7) + Ce3+ (2F7/2), which is based on the energy matching of Ce3+2F7/2-2F5/2 level pairs with Ho3+5I6-5I7 and 5F4,5S2-5F5 level pairs and confirmed by the decay times. These results suggest good UCL properties of (N/L)BMO:Yb3+, Er3+ and (N/L)BMO:Yb3+, Ho3+, Ce3+ materials, and color modulation is easily controlled by varying Yb3+ concentration and a cross relaxation process between Ce3+ and Ho3+, which provides efficient methods to regulate the emission color of UCL phosphors. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065794569

In this study, we established an emission inventory of anthropogenic VOCs in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China for 2015 based on the emission factor (EF) method. Online ambient VOC observations were conducted in one urban area of Beijing in January, April, July, and October, which, respectively, represented winter, spring, summer, and autumn in 2015. Furthermore, the developed emission inventory was evaluated by a comprehensive verification system based on the measurements and satellite retrieval results. Firstly, emissions of the individual species of the emission inventory were evaluated according to the ambient measurements and emission ratios versus carbon monoxide (CO). Secondly, the source structure of the emission inventory was evaluated using source appointment with the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model. Thirdly, the spatial and temporal distribution of the developed emission inventory was evaluated by a satellite-derived emission inventory. According to the results of the emission inventory, the total anthropogenic VOC emissions in the BTH region were 3277.66&thinsp;Gg in 2015. Online measurements showed that the average mixing ratio of VOCs in Beijing was approximately 49.94&thinsp;ppbv in 2015, ranging from 10.67 to 245.54&thinsp;ppbv. The annual emissions for 51 of 56 kinds of non-methane hydrocarbon species derived from the measurements agreed within <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">±100</span>&thinsp;% with the results of the emission inventory. Based on the PMF results and the emission inventory, it is evident that vehicle-related emissions dominate the composition of anthropogenic VOCs in Beijing. The spatial correlation between the emission inventory and satellite inversion result was significant (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>p</i>&lt;0.01</span>) with a correlation coefficient of 0.75. However, there were discrepancies between the relative contributions of fuel combustion, emissions of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), and halocarbons from the measurements and inventory. To obtain a more accurate emission inventory, we propose the investigation of the household coal consumption, the adjustment of EFs based on the latest pollution control policies, and the verification of the source profiles of OVOCs and halocarbons. © Author(s) 2019.

SPPDs were defined as those with observed daily mean PM2.5 concentrations larger than 150 μg m−3. Observations showed that northern China had the highest number of SPPDs during the studied period. Since 2015, the number of SPPDs in northwestern China is comparable to or even higher than that observed in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH). The highest numbers of SPPDs observed within BTH and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) were 122 (33), 95 (17), 57 (15), 78 (18), and 31 (25) days in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, indicating a general decreasing trend as a result of emission reduction measures. SPPDs occurred mainly from November to February in BTH and in December and January in the YRD. The major circulation patterns associated with large-scale SPPDs were analyzed by using principal component analysis. Five typical synoptic weather patterns were identified for BTH. The most dominant weather type (a cold high centered over the Xinjiang and Mongolian regions) for BTH was also responsible for most of the SPPDs in the YRD. These results have important implications for emission control strategies during SPPDs. Emission control measures can be applied once the dominant circulation patterns have been predicted.

According to our results, the 2–3 ring PAHs have higher emission factors (EFs) than those of the 4–6 ring PAHs during waste incineration. The EFs of individual HPAHs are comparable in all incineration products. Overall, the EFs of Ʃ 16 PAH and Ʃ 3 ClPAH decreased in the order of gas &gt; bottom ash &gt; particle &gt; fine particle while the EF order for Ʃ 6 BrPAH is bottom ash &gt; particle &gt; gas &gt; fine particle. Based on qualitative observation, the size distributions of Σ 16 PAH, Σ 3 ClPAH, and Σ 6 BrPAH were characterized by trimodal peaks. Coagulation of fine particles in air may lead to enrichment of target compounds in the coarse particle fraction. The gas-particle partition did not reach theoretical equilibrium and most PAHs and HPAHs were absorbed inside the organic carbon. Estimated mass emission of target compounds in Shenzhen suggests that the gaseous phase from MSW incineration is the major contributor to the urban environment. However, automotive emissions contribute more to urban air pollution than MSW incineration in Shenzhen. Generally, compared with other real waste treatment, waste incineration is a more efficient method for waste-to-energy recovery and produces fewer pollutants, although the resultant carcinogenic substances are never truly harmless. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emission factor; Gas-particle partition; Incineration; Municipal solid waste; PAHs and HPAHs; Size distribution","Air pollution; Ash handling; Ashes; Halogenation; Incineration; Municipal solid waste; Organic carbon; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Size distribution; Waste treatment; Automotive emissions; Emission characteristics; Emission factors; Gas-particle partitions; Qualitative observations; Simulated municipal solid waste; Urban air pollution; Urban environments; Waste incineration; halogenated hydrocarbon; organic carbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; bottom ash; coagulation; emission; incineration; municipal solid waste; organic carbon; PAH; size distribution; absorption; air pollution; Article; bottom ash; chemical parameters; China; controlled study; energy recovery; exhaust gas; incineration; municipal solid waste; particle size; particulate matter; physical parameters; physical phase; priority journal; qualitative analysis; simulation; urban area; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061375322

The tropical NWP anomalies persist until the following summer, with major effects on the Asian summer monsoons. Based on the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) multi-model ensemble, this study finds that climate models commonly underestimate this El Niño-NWP teleconnection with too weak tropical NWP anticyclone and rainfall anomalies in post-El Niño summers, potentially limiting the models’ skill in seasonal prediction of the Asian summer monsoons. The analyses show that such underestimated NWP anomalies in post-El Niño summers in CMIP5 models can be traced back to the well-known excessive equatorial Pacific cold tongue error in the mean. Models with an excessive westward extension of Pacific cold tongue tend to displace westward the simulated pattern of El Niño-related warm SST anomalies along the equator. The warm SST biases over the western Pacific in CMIP5 models would enhance the local atmospheric convection/rainfall and induce low-level cyclonic circulation anomalies over the tropical NWP with a Gill-type Rossby wave response, resulting in the commonly underestimated NWP anticyclone and rainfall anomalies during post-El Niño summers. The present results, along with our previous finding that the equatorial cold tongue bias would distort the projections of tropical Pacific warming pattern under increased greenhouse gas scenario, imply that reducing equatorial cold tongue bias in models can substantially improve climate simulation and prediction/projection for the tropical Pacific and Asian monsoons. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asian summer monsoons; El Niño; Equatorial Pacific cold tongue; Matsuno-Gill dynamics; Model error; Tropical Northwest Pacific anticyclone","anticyclone; atmospheric dynamics; climate modeling; computer simulation; El Nino; ensemble forecasting; error analysis; monsoon; summer; troposphere; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Pacific Ocean (Northwest); Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056718407

However, established equilibrium and optimisation models tend to radically simplify their depiction of societal and political/institutional actors. This can make them difficult to use for implementing specific energy and climate policies in the near term and aligning these with long term targets. Most energy systems analysis continues to pair such techno-economic models with entirely qualitative narratives about future political and societal developments. The result is that these critical factors often fade into the background in subsequent discourse. In this paper, we utilise BLUE – a leading socio-technical energy transition (STET) model of the United Kingdom's (UK) energy system – to capture elements of the heterogeneity, consistency and co-evolution of societal and political drivers. We focus specifically on exploring government-led and societally-led energy transitions and investigating the differences in their decarbonisation pathways and end states. Our modelling exercise finds that it is not who leads per se that is the most critical, but rather the level of the initial effort and subsequent commitment from both leader and follower actors that appears to regulate the pace at which decarbonisation pathways unfold. However, systemic inertia in all cases means that the deepest decarbonisation targets continue to appear very difficult to achieve. © 2018","Behaviour; Climate policy; Energy modelling; Socio-technical transitions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059964034

After estimating the carbon emissions of transportation in China's 341 cities, this study analyzed the spatial pattern evolution of transportation carbon emissions (TCEs) in China from 2005 to 2015. The results revealed that TCEs by roads, water, and aviation increased by 6.6%, 6.2%, and 9.3%, respectively, each year, but those by railways decreased. Moreover, total TCE distribution was found to vary greatly spatially, being significantly lower in central and western cities than in eastern cities. Increases in TCEs in the studied period were primarily from eastern and southwest regions and mainly from roads, although aviation TCE increased significantly in large cities. Based on index decomposition analysis of major cities from the perspectives of population, per capita GDP, TCEs per GDP and TCEs structure, per capita GDP was the most important factor influencing emission growth, followed by population growth; however, TCEs per GDP were a determinant of emission reduction. Finally, all cities were classified into five types based on TCEs’ determinants. The results highlight the significant regional disparity and inequity in TCEs at the city level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; City level; LMDI; Spatial pattern; Transportation","Carbon; Emission control; Transportation; Carbon emissions; City level; Emission reduction; Index decomposition analysis; LMDI; Population growth; Regional disparities; Spatial patterns; Population statistics; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; emission control; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; index method; policy making; population growth; spatial analysis; traffic emission; transportation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063112218

In this study, the No. 5 coal of the Shanxi Formation of the Lower Permian in the Daning-Jixian region was selected for analysis. The influences of structures on coalbed methane content and permeability of coalbed methane reservoirs in the Daning-Jixian region were discussed and the favorable target areas for coalbed methane development were determined based on the analysis of tectonic characteristics and evolution. The results indicate that the main structures in this region extend in the NE–NNE direction with distinct E-W-trending zoning, which can be specifically divided into, from the east to the west, the fault depression zone in basin margins, the gentle fold zone in basin slopes, and the gentle slope zone. The formation and evolution of the structures in this area are primarily formed during the Indosinian, the Yanshanian, and the Himalayan movement, and the tectonic movement during the Middle Yanshan Period is critical for the formation of the structural frameworks. The coalbed methane contents in the No. 5 coal increase from the east to the west; therefore, low gas contents are found in the eastern margin zone, while the Yaoqu-Wucheng zone of middle slope belt displays high coalbed methane contents. The permeability is relatively high in the eastern margin zone and in the Mingti-Yangjiahe region of the middle slope zone, where there exist relatively strong structural deformations. The Guyi and Mingzhu blocks are selected as the favorable target areas for coalbed methane exploitation by a comprehensive analysis of burial depth, coalbed methane content, and the permeability. © The Author(s) 2018.","coalbed methane; Daning-Jixian region; exploration and development; permeability; Tectonic deformation","Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Deformation; Firedamp; Mechanical permeability; Metamorphic rocks; Methanation; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Tectonics; Coalbed methane reservoir; Comprehensive analysis; Daning-Jixian region; Exploration and development; Formation and evolutions; Structural deformation; Structural frameworks; Tectonic deformations; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065063405

As the global climate agenda more thoroughly integrates the CSA framework, policy makers often search for “triple wins”—practices that can mitigate emissions, increase resilience or adaptation, and increase productivity. Agriculture and food systems however, are complex systems with many agroecological and sociopolitical interdependencies. In many cases, there are necessary tradeoffs among the three CSA objectives, as advancement in one area may negatively impact another. A major challenge to implementing CSA across multiple geographies thus lies in the coordination of policies and programs that recognize these tradeoffs and allow for prioritization or reconciliation among the three objectives when there are conflicts. This paper describes California's adoption of CSA principles to illustrate how synergies and trade-offs are addressed in a policy framework that spans regulatory measures, incentive programs, research, and technological development, that is both climate specific and arising from other simultaneous environmental and economic priorities. We provide specific examples where agriculture has benefited and where it is constrained due to the balancing of CSA objectives, and discuss how the policy environment has evolved over time in attempts to deal with the complexity of the agriculture-climate nexus. This case serves to summarize and analyze the implemented CSA initiatives in one of most productive and well-resourced agricultural regions of the world; however, lessons learned from California can serve as transferable knowledge for other regions around the globe who are currently developing CSA policies and plans. Our findings suggest that cross-sectoral collaboration, policy coordination, and inclusion of a diverse set of stakeholders are fundamental to the efficacy of CSA strategies in complex and ever-evolving environmental and sociopolitical conditions. © Copyright © 2019 Lewis and Rudnick.","climate smart agriculture; enabling environment; policy tools; synergies; tradeoffs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077570430

For fuel cell electric transit buses, the U.S. government has set the fuel economy target at 8 miles per diesel gallon equivalent (MPDGE). However, life-cycle environmental implications of the 8 MPDGE target are currently lacking in the literature. In addition, no comparable target exists for fuel cell electric school buses. This study shows that achieving the fuel economy target (8 MPDGE) for fuel cell electric transit buses is likely to result in reductions of overall energy consumption and air emissions on a well-to-wheel basis, in comparison with diesel buses. For fuel cell electric school buses, 13 MPDGE fuel economy is expected to bring comparable benefits to those of their transit bus counterparts, in terms of well-to-wheel energy use and air emissions reductions. When it comes to the life-cycle environmental performance of fuel cell electric school/transit buses, it is critical to acknowledge that results can vary significantly depending on duty cycles, geographical factors, hydrogen fuel production pathways, and regional electric grids. All of these factors introduce nested (multilayered) variations in comparisons of diesel and fuel cell electric buses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air emissions; Bus electrification; Duty cycles; Environmental life-cycle analysis; Hydrogen; Local climate","Air pollution; Bus transportation; Buses; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Life cycle; Vehicle-to-grid; Wheels; Air emissions; Duty cycles; Electric transit bus; Environmental implications; Environmental life cycle analysis; Environmental performance; Fuel production; Local climate; Fuel economy; bus transport; diesel; electric vehicle; energy use; fuel cell; hydrogen; life cycle analysis; traffic emission; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060530991

The long-term NO 2 data have been used for trend analysis and evaluated to find the extent of the effects of NO x emission reduction and related environmental regulations on the NO 2 trend. Desirable policies and strategies for further reducing NO x emission have been also discussed. The corresponding reductions are 15–37% for the five city areas and 24% for the entire Taiwan over the 10-yr span. Clearly, the governmental policies/measures enacted during this 10-yr period are responsible for the reduction of tropospheric NO 2 column values. The OMI NO 2 column values of four cities (i.e., Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Douliu) are relatively highly correlated (r = 0.70–0.95), indicating the cities have similar emission sources. Furthermore, the correlations between observed OMI NO 2 columns and their emission NO x are all significant in the three metropolitan cities and the entire Taiwan (r = 0.66–0.89).

This study evaluated the microclimatic conditions and subjective perception of the thermal environment in eight LCZs in Hong Kong, using questionnaire surveys and field measurements. An ANOVA test showed that the microclimatic conditions were significantly different across eight LCZs, and this could be attributed to the urban morphology and the geometry of the outdoor urban spaces. This does not only affect the critical conditions but also the variations in the thermal environment. The highest maximum temperature (38.9 °C) was found in LCZ 1, and the lowest maximum temperature (29.9 °C) was observed in land cover LCZs. Subjective assessment showed that compact or high-rise settings were associated with warmer thermal sensations reported by the respondents. The relationship between the level of thermal stress and subjective thermal sensation changed across LCZs. This study demonstrated that the LCZ classification provides a characterisation of both the physical and thermal environment. It is also one of the first attempts to examine the relationship between the thermal environment and subjective perceptions using the LCZ classification system.

Primary data used for the study were obtained using a multi stage sampling technique. A structured questionnaire was administered to a sample of 150 randomly selected cassava and yam farmers in 12 villages in the study area. Descriptive statistics, a logit model, and the STATA computer program were used to analyze the data. The results showed that farmers have adopted diverse strategies such as changing planting dates, planting early maturing varieties and drought-tolerant varieties to deal with the impact of climate change. The results of the binary logit analysis showed that age of household head, household size, level of formal education, farm size, amount of rainfall, length of rainy season, awareness of climate change, member of farmers association, access to weather information, access to credit facilities, and number of strategies used, influenced the choice of at least two adaptation strategies. The study, therefore, recommended that government policies should be geared toward creating revenue-generating channels, strengthening the institutions that provide access to farm credit, making improved seed readily available, and providing extension services. © 2019 Kasetsart University.","Adaptation strategies; Cassava farmers; Climate change; Logit regression; Yam farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073281795

In this article, we analyse policy and curriculum documents relating to upper secondary education from the 1970s to the 2010s in two Nordic countries. Drawing on Nancy Fraser’s theorisation of different forms of injustice, we focus on the aims and goals that are attached to the concept of educational equality, analysing how ideas about society and educational equality have changed over these decades. Our analysis suggests that over this period there have been quite dramatic shifts in how equality is conceptualised, inter alia shifting from a focus on economic inequalities to questions of sexuality and ethnicity. Furthermore, ambitions about tackling economic inequality have largely been replaced with ambitions about promoting employability, which is particularly visible in the curriculum of vocational upper secondary education. The Finnish general upper secondary education (GUS) curriculum has gone against the tide. In the 1970s the GUS curriculum had the most conservative tone in terms of equality, whereas the current curriculum requires an agentic stance against discrimination and a critical stance towards marketisation. © The Author(s) 2018.","curriculum analysis; Educational equality; Nordic countries; welfare state",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058664875

We propose a subtype of ‘design-policy entrepreneurs’ who use the spatial and visual tools of planning and design to advocate for preferred policies. By analysing the rhetoric and visual representations made by planners and designers from 1945 to 1965, we examine how they repurposed long-standing ideas about urban deconcentration into ‘dispersal for defence’ proposals. Such proposals for dispersing urban settlements into separated and ‘self-contained’ units received a dysfunctional partial acceptance: housing and transportation legislation embraced the dispersal part but resisted the complementary elements aimed at limiting damages from nuclear attack by concentrating development into distinct nodes. We conclude by asking how the perils of such partial policy-making success might play out on the terrain of climate change adaptation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","civil defence; climate change; Dispersal planning; nuclear war; policy entrepreneur","Cold War; design; entrepreneur; environmental planning; global warming; nuclear weapon; urban population; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038121065

Such conceptions can be problematic, generally assuming adaptation as an entirely positive and non-conflictual process. The purpose of this paper is to challenge such uncritical views, drawing attention to the conflictual nature of adaptation, and propose a theoretical framework facilitating the identification and analysis of conflicts in adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on case study research using first-hand narratives of adaptation in Nepal and the Maldives collected using qualitative interviews, participant observation and document analysis. Findings: The findings identify conflicts between actors in, and around, communities that are adapting to changes. These conflicts can be categorized along three dimensions: qualitative differences in the type of conflict, the relative position of conflicting actors and the degree of manifestation of the conflict. Originality/value: The three-dimensional Adaptation Conflict Framework facilitate analysis of conflicts in adaptation, allowing for a critical examination of subjectivities inherent in the adaptation discourses embedded in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation research and policy. Such an inquiry is crucial for interventions supporting community adaptation to reduce disaster risk. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Conflict; Nepal; The Maldives",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063798390

These initiatives are soil-centric and based on adoption of soil-restorative and improved agricultural practices. The objective of this article is to discuss the merits and challenges of South–South Cooperation (SSC) in promoting the adoption of best management practices (BMPs) such as conservation agriculture (CA) and sustainable intensification (SI). Basic principles of CA are: retention of crop residue mulch, incorporation of cover crops and complex rotations, integrated nutrient management and elimination of soil disturbance. The strategy of SI is to produce more from less by enhancing the eco-efficiency, reducing waste, and restoring soil health. Whereas CA has been successfully adopted in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and other regions of South America, its potential of harnessing agronomic and ecologic benefits has not been realized in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and elsewhere in The Global South. The strategy of SSC is pertinent because of the ten basic principles or tenets: lack of hierarchy, equal participation in all decision-making processes along with transparency, trust, mutual respect, and accountability. However, several concerns have been raised regarding issues such as land grab, and access to resources etc. Based on the scientific concepts of SI, producing more from less, even a triangular cooperation (TAC) or South-South-North (SSNC) cooperation can be developed to achieve adaptation and mitigation of climate change, advance food security, improve degraded soils and restore soil health through soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the U.N. A widespread adoption of CA and SI through SSC, TAC or SSNC can advance SDGs including #1 (end poverty), #2 (eliminate hunger), #6 (clean water), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Of the global cropland area under CA estimated at ∼180 million hectare (Mha) in 2015–16, land area under CA is only 2.7 Mha in Africa and 13.2 Mha in Asia.

Climate change constitutes a source of vulnerability, raising the importance of implementing actions to mitigate it. Within this, the water and wastewater sector represents an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, during both the construction and operation phase. The scope of this study is to analyze the GHG emissions from the current and future water supply scheme, as well as to draw a comparison between possible water reclamation with resource recovery scenarios in the town Leh in India: a centralized scheme, a partly centralized combined with a decentralized scheme, and a household level approach. Precise values of emission factors, based on the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, previous studies, and Ecoinvent database, have been adopted to quantify the different emissions. Potential sources of reduction of GHG emissions through sludge and biogas utilization have been identified and quantified to seize their ability to mitigate the carbon footprint of the water and wastewater sector. The results show that the future water supply scheme will lead to a significant increase of the GHG emissions during its operation. Further, it is shown that decentralizing wastewater management in Leh town has the least carbon footprint during both construction and operation phases. These results have implications for cities worldwide. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; Decentralized water reclamation with resource recovery; Greenhouse gas emissions; Water-Energy-Food Nexus","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Wastewater reclamation; Water resources; Water supply; Biogas utilization; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gas inventory; Resource recovery; Wastewater management; Water and wastewater; Water energy; Water supply schemes; Greenhouse gases; carbon footprint; centralization; climate change; decentralization; emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; implementation process; mitigation; recovery plan; strategic approach; urbanization; vulnerability; water supply; water treatment; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Ladakh; Leh Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066327612

Cities must cope with poor air quality, heat island effects, increased flood risk and the frequency/severity of extreme events (e.g., droughts and heat waves), increasing crime and social inequity, poverty and degraded urban environments, amongst other negative consequences. Climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as sustainable management are therefore key challenges for cities in Europe and around the world. What must be developed therefore is a robust, wide evidence-base and reference framework of nature-based solutions (NBS) – measures that mimic the complex features and processes of natural ecosystems – for local/regional city authorities and other policy and decision makers to increase climate resilience and address inclusive urban regeneration in cities. In response to this need, we propose an applicative framework for NBS using the structure of the DPSIR (Driving force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response) model, in conformity with European Community standards. Indeed, under the umbrella of the EC's Framework Program – Horizon 2020 – international institutions, scientific experts and policy makers worldwide are seeking to increase collaboration with cities to enhance ecosystem services and develop the evidence-base for the economic, social and environmental benefits of nature-based solutions. They are eager to exchange knowledge and inspire positive action for nature in urban areas to meet their growing social and environmental challenges. The time has come to acknowledge NBS as the most fitting response to the numerous challenges posed by our changing climate and for the realization of sustainable and healthy cities. It is hoped that this article will pioneer others in settling the issue for NBS as the undisputable answer to challenged urban landscapes and societies globally. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; DPSIR framework; Ecosystem services; Environmental policy implementation; Nature-based solutions; Sustainable urbanization","air quality; ecosystem service; environmental change; European Union; flood damage; heat island; risk assessment; socioeconomic status; sustainability; urban area; urban planning; urbanization; air quality; article; city; climate change; crime; drought; ecosystem; environmental policy; Europe; European Union; heat; human; landscape; poverty; regeneration; urban area; urbanization; climate change; Cities; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Europe; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062087500

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these associations. Epigenetics may be one plausible biologic link. Here, we sought to identify site-specific and global DNA methylation (DNAm) changes, in developmentally relevant tissues, associated with prenatal exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). Additionally, we assessed whether sex-specific changes in methylation exist and whether DNAm changes are consistently observed across tissues. Methods: Genome-scale DNAm measurements were obtained using the Infinium HumanMethylation450k platform for 133 placenta and 175 cord blood specimens from Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) neonates. Ambient NO2 and O3 exposure levels were based on prenatal address locations of EARLI mothers and the Environmental Protection Agency's AirNOW monitoring network using inverse distance weighting. We computed sample-level aggregate methylation measures for each of 5 types of genomic regions including genome-wide, open sea, shelf, shore, and island regions. Linear regression was performed for each genomic region; per-sample aggregate methylation measures were modeled as a function of quantitative exposure level with covariate adjustment. In addition, bumphunting was performed to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with prenatal O3 and NO2 exposures in each tissue and by sex, with adjustment for technical and biological sources of variation. Results: We identified global and locus-specific changes in DNA methylation related to prenatal exposure to NO2 and O3 in 2 developmentally relevant tissues. Neonates with increased prenatal O3 exposure had lower aggregate levels of DNAm at CpGs located in open sea and shelf regions of the genome. We identified 6 DMRs associated with prenatal NO2 exposure, including 3 sex-specific. An additional 3 sex-specific DMRs were associated with prenatal O3 exposure levels. DMRs initially detected in cord blood samples (n = 4) showed consistent exposure-related changes in DNAm in placenta. However, the DMRs initially detected in placenta (n = 5) did not show DNAm differences in cord blood and, thus, they appear to be tissue-specific. Conclusions: We observed global, locus, and sex-specific methylation changes associated with prenatal NO2 and O3 exposures. Our findings support DNAm is a biologic target of prenatal air pollutant exposures and highlight epigenetic involvement in sex-specific differential susceptibility to environmental exposure effects in 2 developmentally relevant tissues. © 2019 The Authors","DNA methylation; Epigenetic; Genome-scale; Placenta; Prenatal air pollution exposure; Sex differences","Aggregates; Air pollution; Alkylation; Blood; DNA; Environmental Protection Agency; Histology; Methylation; Nitrogen oxides; Air pollution exposures; DNA Methylation; Epigenetic; Placenta; Sex difference; Tissue; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; child health; DNA; genome; methylation; pollution exposure; air pollution; Article; child; child health; CpG island; DNA methylation; environmental exposure; epigenetics; ethnicity; female; gene locus; genetic variation; genome analysis; human; human tissue; male; newborn; placenta tissue; prenatal exposure; priority journal; umbilical cord blood; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; child health; DNA methylation; epigenetics; fetomaternal transfusion; maternal exposure; placenta; pregnancy; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child Health; DNA Methylation; Epigenomics; Female; Humans; Infant Health; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Placenta; Pregnancy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062094165

New policies have been applied to regulate anthropogenic pollutant emissions, leading to changes in atmospheric composition and in particulate matter (PM) production. Increasing levels of atmospheric ammonia columns have been observed by satellite during recent years. In particular, observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) reveal an increase of these columns by 15% and 65% from 2011 to 2013 and 2015, respectively, over eastern China. In this paper we performed model simulations for 2011, 2013 and 2015 in order to understand the origin of this increase and to quantify the link between ammonia and the inorganic components of particles: NHC+4(p)/SO2-4(p)/NO-3(p). Interannual change of meteorology can be excluded as a reason: year 2015 meteorology leads to enhanced sulfate production over eastern China, which increases the ammonium and decreases the ammonia content, which is contrary to satellite observations. Reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from 2011 to 2015 of 37.5% and 21% respectively, as constrained from satellite data, lead to decreased inorganic matter (by 14% for NH+4(p) +SO2-4(p) + NO-3(p)). This in turn leads to increased gaseous NH3(g) tropospheric columns by as much as 24% and 49% (sampled corresponding to IASI data availability) from 2011 to 2013 and 2015 respectively and thus can explain most of the observed increase. © Author(s) 2019.",,"ammonia; ammonium; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065977749

By implication, leaf traits of fossil dicotyledonous plants can be used as proxies for reconstructions of palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions. Herein, a Paleogene leaf flora, the Profen-Süd LC assemblage from central Germany, is introduced and its leaf traits are outlined. Based on a preliminary phytosociological analysis, a floristic evaluation with respect to modern comparative vegetation refers to azonal communities predominated by a Rhodomyrtophyllum-Steinhauera riparian association. It mirrors local rather but species-divers vegetation. Morphological (shape; margin; venation) and morphometrical (area; leaf mass per area) leaf parameters are determined on a representative subsample and applied to the Trait Combination Type (TCT) analysis for gross-morphological characterization of fossil leaf assemblages, and to quantitative methods for estimation of palaeoclimate parameters: Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program, Coexistence Approach and Leaf Margin Analysis. As a result the assemblage contains only four out of 16 TCTs. Morphological diversity is assumed to be characteristically low as the TCT pattern is not fundamentally distinct from that of the coeval hinterland flora of Kučlin (Czechia). Leaf size is overwhelmingly microphyll, and leaf mass per area values are in accordance with present-day evergreen forests. Main results refer to a sclerophyllous evergreen broad-leaved forest. All palaeoclimate calculations deliver similar estimates for subtropical climate with frost-free winters and humid conditions but certain seasonality in precipitation. Results are briefly discussed in context to depositional environment and taphonomic aspects. Moreover, traces of insect herbivory on the fossil leaves are treated as additional traits beyond classical parameters.

The objectives of this research were to evaluate the effects of combining BC and RS on (1) CH 4 and CO 2 production from paddy soil, (2) archaeal and bacterial abundance, and (3) rice grain yield. The experiments consisted of a pot trial and an incubation trial, which had a completely randomized design. The experiments included five treatments with three replications: (a) the control (without BC, RS, and chemical fertilizer (CF)); (b) CF; (c) BC 12.50 t ha −1 ; (d) RS 12.50 t ha −1 ; and (e) combined BC 6.25 t ha −1 + RS 6.25 t ha −1 + CF. In the sole RS treatment, CH 4 production (0.0347 mg m −2 season −1 ) and the archaeal and bacterial abundance (5.81 × 10 8 and 4.94 × 10 10 copies g −1 soil dry weight (DW)) were higher than outcomes in the sole BC treatment (i.e., 0.0233 mg m −2 season −1 for CH 4 production, and 8.51 × 10 7 and 1.76 × 10 10 copies g −1 soil DW for archaeal and bacterial abundance, respectively). CH 4 production (0.0235 mg m −2 season −1 ) decreased significantly in the combined BC + RS + CF treated soil compared to the soil treated with RS alone, indicating that BC lessened CH 4 production via CH 4 adsorption, methanogenic activity inhibition, and microbial CH 4 oxidation through bacterial methanotrophs. However, the archaeal abundance (3.79–5.81 × 10 8 copies g −1 soil DW) and bacterial abundance (4.94–5.82 × 10 10 copies g −1 soil DW) in the combined BC+ RS + CF treated soil and the RS treated soil were found to increase relative to the treatments without RS. The increase was due to the easily decomposable RS and the volatile matter (VM) constituent of the BC. Nevertheless, the resultant CO 2 production was relatively similar amongst the BC, RS, and BC + RS treated soils, which was indicative of several processes, e.g., the CO 2 production and reduction that occurred simultaneously but in different directions. Moreover, the highest yield of rice grains was obtained from a combined BC + RS + CF treated soil and it was 53.47 g pot −1 (8.48 t ha −1 ). Over time, the addition of BC to RS soil enhanced the archaeal and bacterial abundance, thereby improving yields and reducing CH 4 emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Archaeal 16S rRNA gene; Bacterial 16S rRNA gene; Global warming; QPCR; Rice yields; Soil amendments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065860394

These capabilities have important implications for the role of these species in natural and engineered carbon processing. However, the metabolic phenotypes enabling Pseudomonas to utilize mixed substrates remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a multi-omics approach involving stable isotope tracers, metabolomics, fluxomics, and proteomics in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to investigate the constitutive metabolic network that achieves co-utilization of glucose and benzoate, respectively a monomer of carbohydrate polymers and a derivative of lignin monomers. Despite nearly equal consumption of both substrates, metabolite isotopologues revealed nonuniform assimilation throughout the metabolic network. Gluconeogenic flux of benzoate-derived carbons from the tricarboxylic acid cycle did not reach the upper Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway nor the pentose-phosphate pathway. These latter two pathways were populated exclusively by glucose-derived carbons through a cyclic connection with the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. We integrated the 13C-metabolomics data with physiological parameters for quantitative flux analysis, demonstrating that the metabolic segregation of the substrate carbons optimally sustained biosynthetic flux demands and redox balance. Changes in protein abundance partially predicted the metabolic flux changes in cells grown on the glucose:benzoate mixture versus on glucose alone. Notably, flux magnitude and directionality were also maintained by metabolite levels and regulation of phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes. These findings provide new insights into the metabolic architecture that affords adaptability of P. putida to divergent carbon substrates and highlight regulatory points at different metabolic nodes that may underlie the high nutritional flexibility of Pseudomonas species. © 2019 American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc..

Transport operators, planners and policymakers are constantly searching for low-cost solutions to such transport issues. Therefore, it is critical to developing an environmentally sustainable and economically viable efficient traffic network to relieve traffic pressure (i.e., traffic congestion, transport infrastructure investment needs). The objective of this research is to propose a “Soft Traffic Management (STM)” concept to proactively analyse the traffic impact of transport planning strategy before implementation. This study investigates the effectiveness of a STM for easing the traffic pressure by carrying out a pilot research project on the proposed South East Busway extension in Logan City, Australia, by employing a stepwise process consisting of a multi-stage analysis and stakeholder-based modelling approach. The results indicate that the extended busway can significantly relieve traffic congestion. In addition, the proposed strategy has significantly positive impacts on the environment since it aims to reduce air pollution and fuel consumption as well as to improve the safety and efficiency of the whole transport system. This study confirms the effects of STM on improving the use of existing infrastructure more efficiently and deferring future transport infrastructure investments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Soft traffic management; Traffic congestion; Transport planning; Visum","economic conditions; fuel consumption; policy making; public transport; strategic approach; sustainability; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; air pollution; article; Australia; human; investment; air pollution; city; forecasting; traffic and transport; Australia; Logan; United States; Utah; Air Pollution; Australia; Cities; Forecasting; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062733619

Diurnal air temperature range (DTRa) of rocklike buildings is commonsensically regarded as higher due to no latent heat from evapotranspiration and its smaller thermal inertia compared to wet soil. Therefore, the building DTRa is supposed to be higher than that of parks due to its building fabric. However, we found an opposite phenomenon (smaller building DTRa than that of parks), and the underlying mechanisms explaining this phenomenon are unclear. Here we conducted, in Beijing (China), a long-term observational campaign of standard meteorological variables and radiation/energy fluxes to provide a new valuable evidence (a part of external energy) to explain this phenomenon. The observations indicated external heat energies from horizontal advection and anthropogenic heat sources. We found a significantly lower building DTRa than that of parks (ΔDTRa =2.53±1.93 °C), with a maximum difference of 3.54±1.96 °C in autumn; which was mainly attributed to higher daily minimum air temperature. We also found the large differences in air temperature contribution between the buildings and the parks happened mainly at night. The external heat sources of the building contributed 16.71% to the nighttime air temperature, which was higher than that of the parks (8.39%). The more indoor and outdoor anthropogenic heat sources in the building footprints were the major cause of the slower decrease in Tmin. The comparison between buildings and parks can be extensively applied to analyzing the effects of urbanization on climate. ©2019.

To provide evidence on both effect from humidity on people's thermal comfort and their humidity adaptation, a comparative study has been conducted in a controlled climate chamber. During the experiment, the air temperature was set as 25 °C and 28 °C respectively and the relative humidity was changing between 20% and 90%. There were twenty four participants involved in this experiment, with half living in High Humidity (HH) regions of China, such as Chongqing, for over 20 years, and another half recently moved to Chongqing from Low Humidity (LH) regions in northwestern China. During the experiment, mean skin temperature was measured as an objective important parameter and subjective questionnaires were used to subjectively collect people's sensations with respect to heat, humidity and sweating. The data collected demonstrated that people living in HH regions showed a better adaptive ability to humidity changes than those came from LH regions. Climate adaptation also reduced the sensitivity of HH subjects' thermal responses. When air humidity was over 70%, subjects started to show stronger thermal responses. Based on these results, an upper limit of humidity of 17 g/kg has been proposed for Chongqing, China. The results from this study will help to broaden the adaptive thermal comfort theory and can provide important references regarding to humidity control for buildings. © 2019","Air humidity; Climate adaptation; Humidity limits; Humidity responses; Thermal sensitivity","Surveys; Thermal comfort; Adaptive thermal comfort; Air humidity; Climate adaptation; Comparative studies; Humidity response; Mean skin temperature; Northwestern China; Thermal sensitivity; Humidity control; adaptive management; air temperature; building; climate change; humidity; indoor air; temperature effect; China; Chongqing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063756075

Steady state 13C-MFA has been established as a routine method for analysis of fluxes in plant primary metabolism. However, the experimental system needs to be improved for continuous carbon enrichment from labelled sugars into metabolites for longer periods until complex secondary metabolism reaches steady state. Results: We developed an in vitro plant culture strategy by using peppermint as a model plant with minimizing unlabelled carbon fixation where growing shoot tip was strongly dependent on labelled glucose for their carbon necessity. We optimized the light condition and detected the satisfactory phenotypical growth under the lower light intensity. Total volatile terpenes were also highest at the same light. Analysis of label incorporation into pulegone monoterpene after continuous U-13C6 glucose feeding revealed nearly 100% 13C, even at 15 days after first leaf visibility (DALV). Label enrichment was gradually scrambled with increasing light intensity and leaf age. This study was validated by showing similar levels of label enrichment in proteinogenic amino acids. The efficiency of this method was also verified in oregano. Conclusions: Our shoot tip culture depicted a method in achieving long term, stable and a high percentage of label accumulation in secondary metabolites within a fully functional growing plant system. It recommends the potential application for the investigations of various facets of plant metabolism by steady state 13C-MFA.

Coastal wetlands are, however, often subject to disturbance by diking and drainage for agricultural use and can turn to potent methane sources when rewetted for remediation. This suggests that preceding land use measures can suspend the sulfate-related methane suppressing mechanisms. Here, we unravel the hydrological relocation and biogeochemical S and C transformation processes that induced high methane emissions in a disturbed and rewetted peatland despite former brackish impact. The underlying processes were investigated along a transect of increasing distance to the coastline using a combination of concentration patterns, stable isotope partitioning, and analysis of the microbial community structure. We found that diking and freshwater rewetting caused a distinct freshening and an efficient depletion of the brackish sulfate reservoir by dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR). Despite some legacy effects of brackish impact expressed as high amounts of sedimentary S and elevated electrical conductivities, contemporary metabolic processes operated mainly under sulfate-limited conditions. This opened up favorable conditions for the establishment of a prospering methanogenic community in the top 30-40cm of peat, the structure and physiology of which resemble those of terrestrial organic-rich environments. Locally, high amounts of sulfate persisted in deeper peat layers through the inhibition of DSR, probably by competitive electron acceptors of terrestrial origin, for example Fe(III). However, as sulfate occurred only in peat layers below 30-40cm, it did not interfere with high methane emissions on an ecosystem scale. Our results indicate that the climate effect of disturbed and remediated coastal wetlands cannot simply be derived by analogy with their natural counterparts. From a greenhouse gas perspective, the re-exposure of diked wetlands to natural coastal dynamics would literally open up the floodgates for a replenishment of the marine sulfate pool and therefore constitute an efficient measure to reduce methane emissions. © 2019 Author(s).",,"biogeochemistry; climate effect; coastal wetland; community structure; disturbance; greenhouse gas; methane; methanogenesis; peatland; pollutant removal; sulfate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065907732

Transportation is a key component of that system, as it accounts for a significant portion of the delivered cost. One of the most critical factors affecting transportation cost is the interrelationship between feedstock sources and facility locations, including plant and off-plant transfer / storage facilities. At the same time, biomass energy sustainability is sensitive to the performance of each component in the entire process. The main goal of this study is to build a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that uses region-specific data to minimize sustainable transportation costs. This consists of economic, environmental, and societal factors. The upstream air emissions as a result of residues collection at the forest, transloading, and transportation by truck or multimodally (truck and rail), which include greenhouse gases (GHG), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are calculated and included in the analysis. The model was tested on a case study that evaluated transportation costs for nine alternative plant locations in the state of Wisconsin. The results revealed that when equally weighed, external (social and environmental) costs accounted for a considerable portion of total transportation cost (approximately 26–37%). The study also shows that total upstream GHG and air emissions increased as the plant capacity increased, due to the longer transportation distances, but per unit emissions decreased. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","air emissions; biomass; external costs; transportation","Air pollution; Biomass; Chemical industry; Costs; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Location; Nitrogen oxides; Sustainable development; Transportation; Truck transportation; Trucks; Air emissions; Alternative plant locations; Biomass transportations; External costs; Mixed integer linear programming model; Social and environmental; Sustainable transportation; Transportation analysis; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059587946

Statistical downscaling methods that condition precipitation on GCM-based, synoptic-scale climate features have shown promise in the reproduction of local precipitation. However, current approaches to climate-state-informed downscaling impose some limitations on the skill of precipitation reproduction, including hard clustering of climate modes into a discrete set of states, utilization of numerical clustering methodologies poorly suited to nonnormal data, and a tendency to focus on relationships to a limited set of large-scale climate modes. This study presents a methodology based on emerging machine learning techniques to develop global approximators of regional precipitation and discharge extremes given a suite of synoptic-scale climate state variables. Archetypal analysis is first used to define regional modes of winter and summer extreme precipitation and discharge across the eastern contiguous United States. A 2D convolution neural network (NN) is then used to predict the co-occurrence of the archetypes using 300- and 700-hPa geopotential heights, 300- and 700-hPa specific humidity, and IVT. Results suggest that 300-hPa geopotential height, 700-hPa specific humidity, and IVT yield the most reliable predictions, although with some important differences by season and region. Finally, we demonstrate that the trained activations of NN convolutional layers can be used to infer the causal pathways between synoptic-scale climate features and regional extremes. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","Classification; Flood events; Land surface model; Neural networks; North America; Reanalysis data","artificial neural network; climate classification; climate modeling; data assimilation; discharge; extreme event; flood; geopotential; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; synoptic meteorology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066243400

A growing number of studies have analyzed various aspects of GHG emissions from the use of private vehicles, emphasizing the significant share they represent of overall emissions, and also exploring measures to reduce these emissions. Commuting to and from work is a significant form of urban travel. Most existing analyses have focused on urban transportation-related emissions at the overall urban scale. Much less research has been published concerning fine-scale emissions analysis of urban commute patterns and specific commuting routes. This manuscript presents a detailed analysis of commute related GHG emissions from private vehicles used by the city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa (Israel) residents. The analysis found that 60% of the overall urban private vehicles related emissions can be attributed to commuting, emitting ~215,000 t CO 2 e annually. We analyzed GHG emissions related to 257 inter-city and 64 commute routes within the city, ranging between 100 and 5600 t CO 2 e annually. Potential scenarios for GHG mitigation are also presented showing that relatively mild technological, behavioral and policy changes can potentially save 10–51% of emissions related to commute within the city, amounting to 3000–17,000 t CO 2 e annually. Findings show that commute-route-specific carbon quantification can be used as a tool for socio-spatial tailored policies, advancing urban GHG mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Commute route; GHG mitigation; Model scenario; Urban carbon footprint","Carbon footprint; Greenhouse gases; Vehicles; Commute patterns; Commute route; GHG mitigation; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Mitigation measures; Private vehicles; Route specifics; Urban sustainability; Urban transportation; carbon footprint; commuting; greenhouse gas; mitigation; policy making; pollution policy; traffic emission; urban planning; Israel; Tel Aviv; Tel Aviv-Jaffa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060349551

In contrast to theory-based optimal pricing strategies, real-world policy setting often follows so-called “backcasting” approaches where certain targets are set, and policy measures are implemented in order to reach those targets. An example for the latter approach is the EU goal to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector by 20% until 2020 with respect to 1990 levels. This article aims to (i) compare optimal pricing and backcasting approaches for a specific case study in a simulation environment by identifying the contribution of each approach in EU’s 2020 emission reduction target, and (ii) to determine the costs required to reach the desired targets. For this purpose, an optimal emission pricing strategy is applied to a real-world scenario of the Munich metropolitan area in Germany. The highly differentiated tolls relate to individual exhaust emissions, i.e. they are calculated using damage cost estimates from the literature and vary over time of day, with traffic situation, and with vehicle type. The results indicate that the desired reduction in CO 2 emissions is not reached for optimal pricing approach, and that the initial damage costs estimates need to be multiplied by a factor of 5 in order to reach the target, yielding a price of 350 EUR=ton CO 2 . When aiming at a decrease of the overall emission costs by 20% (CO 2 and local pollutants), the initial cost estimates need to be multiplied by a factor of 10. Furthermore, it is shown that the major contribution to the overall emission reduction stems from behavioral changes of commuters and reverse commuters rather than from urban travelers; under some circumstances, urban travelers even increase their CO 2 emission levels. Hence, the study rises awareness that conflicting trends for different types of pollutants and different types of individuals are very likely: an increase in non-methane hydrocarbon levels for urban travelers and freight depicts that pricing emissions does not necessarily result in a reduction of all pollutants or of the emissions levels of all travelers. It is shown how agent-based simulations can be used to provide valuable insights and decision support in such possibly counter-intuitive situations. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agent-based modeling; air pollution; backcasting; emissions; optimal pricing; sustainable transport","Air pollution; Autonomous agents; Carbon dioxide; Computational methods; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Decision support systems; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Urban transportation; Agent based simulation; Agent-based model; Backcasting; Emission reduction targets; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Optimal pricing; Simulation environment; Sustainable transport; Cost estimating; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; European Union; optimization; pricing policy; traffic emission; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052076474

The system-generalized method of moments (GMM) was adopted due to the presence of endogeneity. The results indicate that poverty and logistical operations have significant and positive relationship with greater environmental degradation. Because poor people are not skilled, they have to consume natural resources in original and unsustainable way for their survival and profits, which results in greater level of deforestation. On another hand, lacking fuel-efficient/green vehicles and green practices in logistical operations of ASEAN countries, logistics activities mainly depend on fossil fuel consumption, which generates greater carbon emission, methane, and greenhouse emissions that can directly damage the environment and become a primary source of climate change. Therefore, reduction in environmental degradation can be achieved through reduction in poverty and encouraging renewable energy and green practices in logistical operations.

Natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel has made significant inroads in the light and heavy duty vehicles market over the last fifteen years. In a sustainable development view, both vehicle emissions and energy supply chain analysis from well-to-wheel must be addressed. The aim of this research is to provide a Well-to-Wheel (WtW) assessment of energy consumptions and GHG emissions for 25 combinations of automotive fuel and matching powertrain systems, with a special focus on the natural gas pathways. Although several well-to-wheel studies available in literature are comprehensive in relation to developed countries’ conditions, it is problematic to apply the results to developing countries fuel markets, since the local fuel conditions and respective vehicle powertrain technologies are considerably different. This study deal with a comparative well-to-wheel analysis of natural gas, diesel and gasoline fuels looking at the Pakistanis situation but the models and approaches for this study can be applied to other countries having similar characteristics, as long as all the assumptions are well defined and modified to find a substitute automotive energy source and establish an energy policy in a specific region. The well-to-tank step was made using the GREET model, developed by the U.S. Argonne National Laboratory while tank-to-wheel analysis was performed using AVL Cruise, a commercially-available backward vehicle simulator. Later both stages were integrated in a well-to-wheel stage where relevant indexes were proposed and discussed. The results indicate that natural gas vehicles are 5–17% and 23–36% less fuel efficient, depending on the engine technology employed as compared to gasoline and diesel powertrain, respectively. Natural gas appears as an environmental efficient pathway regarding GHG emissions, especially compared to gasoline. In addition, using 20-year GWPs instead of 100-year GWPs increases WtW GHG emissions by 19–26% for natural gas pathways. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive fuels; GHG emissions; Natural gas vehicles; Well-to-wheel","Automotive fuels; Commerce; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural gas transportation; Natural gas wells; Powertrains; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Tanks (containers); Vehicle wheels; Argonne National Laboratory; Conventional gasoline; Energy supply chains; Environmental assessment; GHG emission; Impact on the environment; Well-to-wheel; Well-to-wheel analysis; Natural gas vehicles; alternative fuel; developing world; diesel engine; energy policy; energy resource; environmental assessment; gas transport; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; natural gas; sustainable development; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063565203

Upland rice reduced 90% of soil CH4 emission as compared to paddy conditions. Soil CH4 emission decreased by 45% and 39% with dolomite, and it reduced by 35% and 33% with lime treatment both in upland and paddy conditions, respectively. Soil N2O emission decreased by 44% and 52% with dolomite, and with the lime application, it was reduced by 37% and 44% for both upland and paddy conditions respectively. Reduction in soil DTPA-extractable Cd was between 37-53% and 43–80% with dolomite and 16–37% and 24–72% Cd decreased with lime application in upland and paddy conditions respectively. Soil DTPA-extractable Pb reduced by 27–44% and 25–53% with dolomite and 16–40% and 11–42% with soil-applied lime in upland and paddy conditions, respectively. Cd accumulation in rice grain was decreased by 47–88% and 62–79% with dolomite and 31–86% and 45–52% reduction by lime application in upland and paddy rice respectively. Rice grain Pb reduced by 58–91% and 66–78% with dolomite application and 32–71% and 44–71% with lime in upland and paddy rice, respectively. Our results showed that soil liming significantly reduced soil N2O and CH4 emission and Cd, Pb accumulation in rice grain, but dolomite was more effective as compared to lime. Altogether, results of this study suggest that upland rice can be cultivated in Cd[sbnd]Pb polluted soils with least soil CH4 emission. Cd and Pb toxicity, accumulation, and N2O emission in upland rice can be minimized by soil liming of 3 g kg−1 and optimizing the nutrients composition of the soil. Upland rice has the capacity to decline CH4 emission and soil liming can reduce N2O emission in upland rice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; LA-ICP-MS; Soil liming; Upland rice","Biochemistry; Cadmium; Cultivation; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; Inclusions; Irrigation; Landforms; Lime; Nitrogen oxides; Plants (botany); Soils; Water pollution; Water resources; Cd accumulation; Environmental pollutions; Irrigation waters; La-ICP-MS; Lime treatment; Pot experiment; Soil liming; Upland rice; Soil pollution; cadmium; calcium oxide; carbonic acid; dolomite; lead; methane; nitrous oxide; pentetic acid; unclassified drug; cadmium; calcium derivative; lead; methane; nitrous oxide; oxide; bioaccumulation; cadmium; emission; greenhouse gas; inductively coupled plasma method; laser method; lead; liming; methane; nitrous oxide; paddy field; rice; upland region; Article; bioaccumulation; biomass production; carbon footprint; comparative study; controlled study; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; nutrient; plant yield; rice; soil acidity; soil liming; soil pollution; analysis; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; food grain; greenhouse gas; metabolism; Oryza; pollution; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; Cadmium; Calcium Compounds; Edible Grain; Environmental Pollution; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Greenhouse Gases; Lead; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Oxides; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062211300

It typically utilizes corn grain as feedstock in bio-refineries in many countries such as the United States. However, the use of edible matter of crops like corn may lead to a food-versus-fuel competition. To address such an issue, second generation biofuel manufacturing technology using the non-edible matter of crops has been developed. In this paper, the economic viability and environmental sustainability are analyzed and quantified, when restructuring the biofuel supply chain from employing first generation manufacturing technology to the one utilizing second generation technology considering the existing supply chain infrastructure. Two supply chain restructuring strategies, i.e., distributed and centralized preprocessing deployment, are modeled for implementing biomass preprocessing for second generation biofuel manufacturing. Bi-objective optimization formulations for the corn stover-sourced biofuel (a typical second generation biofuel) supply chain considering both economic and environmental aspects are proposed under both strategies. Different decision variables such as the locations selected for constructing preprocessing centers and the corresponding corn stover handling capacities of such centers, as well as the material flows between farms, preprocessing centers, and bio-refinery plants are identified. A case study based on the state of Missouri in the United States is implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and analyze the performance of different strategies. The results of the case study show that when corn stover is used as feedstock in bio-refineries, the unit cost of bioethanol production can be reduced, while the unit emission is increased compared to the corn-sourced supply chain under both supply chain restructuring strategies. Specifically, in Missouri where the daily stover handling amount per bio-refinery plant is relatively low and the stover collection radius is relatively small, the centralized strategy outperforms the distributed one with a higher cost reduction and a smaller increase in emissions. It reduces the unit cost by 27.39%, while increasing the unit emission by 24.42%, compared to the corn-sourced supply chain. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel supply chain; Biomass preprocessing; Cellulosic biofuel manufacturing; Corn stover; Greenhouse gas emission","Cellulosic ethanol; Chemical contamination; Cost reduction; Crops; Environmental technology; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Materials handling; Refining; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Bi-objective optimization; Bio-ethanol production; Biofuel supply chains; Cellulosic biofuels; Corn stover; Environmental sustainability; Generation technologies; Manufacturing technologies; Bioethanol; biofuel; biomass; cost analysis; crop residue; economic conditions; emission; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; manufacturing; strategic approach; supply chain management; sustainability; Missouri; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063374853

Health systems need to be prepared and gradually adapt to the effects of climate change, including extreme weather events. Fossil fuel combustion as the driver of climate change poses a tremendous burden of disease. In turn, cutting greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors will achieve health co-benefits. If all countries meet the Paris Agreement by 2030, the annual number of avoidable premature deaths could total 138,000 across the entire European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO). Several international frameworks promote a stronger commitment by countries to implementing the necessary adaptations in the health sector and to addressing health considerations in adaptation measures in other sectors. The WHO has a mandate from its member states to identify solutions and help prevent or reduce health impacts, including those from climate change. National governments are continuing to establish public health adaptation measures, which provide a rationale for and trigger action on climate change by the health community. Effective national responses to climate risks require strategic analyses of current and anticipated threats. Health professionals need to play a proactive role in promoting health arguments and evidence in the formulation of national climate change adaptation and mitigation responses. To this end, country capacities need to be further strengthened to identify and address local health risks posed by climate change and to develop, implement and evaluate health-focused interventions through integrated approaches.

Despite the scientific evidence of the degrees of BC exposure, there is still a lack of understanding on how the severe levels of BC pollution affect human health in these regions. We consider information on the respiratory tract deposition dose (DD) of BC to be essential in understanding the link between personal exposure to air pollutants and corresponding health effects. In this work, we combine data on fine and ultrafine refractory particle number concentrations (BC proxy), and activity patterns to derive the respiratory tract deposited amounts of BC particles for the population of the highly polluted metropolitan area of Manila, Philippines. We calculated the total DD of refractory particles based on three metrics: refractory particle number, surface area, and mass concentrations. The calculated DD of total refractory particle number in Metro Manila was found to be 1.6 to 17 times higher than average values reported from Europe and the U.S. In the case of Manila, ultrafine particles smaller than 100 nm accounted for more than 90% of the total deposited refractory particle dose in terms of particle number. This work is a first attempt to quantitatively evaluate the DD of refractory particles and raise awareness in assessing pollution-related health effects in developing megacities. We demonstrate that the majority of the population may be highly affected by BC pollution, which is known to have negative health outcomes if no actions are taken to mitigate its emission. For the governments of such metropolitan areas, we suggest to revise currently existing environmental legislation, raise public awareness, and to establish supplementary monitoring of black carbon in parallel to already existing PM 10 and PM 2.5 measures. © 2019","Air pollution; Black carbon; Exposure; Lung-particle interaction; Respiratory tract deposition","Air pollution; Carbon; Deposition; Health; Population statistics; Black carbon; Environmental legislations; Exposure; Particle number concentration; Respiratory tract; Scientific evidence; Ultrafine particle; World Health Organization; Refractory materials; black carbon; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; deposition; health impact; megacity; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; respiratory disease; World Health Organization; aerosol; air pollution; Article; awareness; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; Europe; particle size; Philippines; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Southeast Asia; surface area; United States; urban area; adolescent; adult; air pollutant; analysis; child; city; environmental monitoring; exposure; female; human; male; middle aged; particle size; particulate matter; young adult; Manila; National Capital Region; Philippines; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Child; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Middle Aged; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Philippines; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060750230

In most of the current studies, CO2 emissions were calculated assuming that the region where the vehicles were used, the lifetime driving distance in that region and the CO2 emission from the battery production were fixed. However, in this paper, the life cycle CO2 emissions in each region were calculated taking into consideration the vehicle's lifetime driving distance in each region and the deviations in CO2 emissions for battery production. For this paper, the US, European Union (EU), Japan, China, and Australia were selected as the reference regions for vehicle operation. The calculated results showed that CO2 emission from the assembly of BEV was larger than that of ICV due to the added CO2 emissions from battery production. However, in regions where renewable energy sources and low CO2 emitting forms of electric power generation are widely used, as vehicle lifetime driving distance increase, the total operating CO2 emissions of BEV become less than that of ICV. But for BEV, the CO2 emissions for replacing the battery with a new one should be added when the lifetime driving distance is over 160,000 km. Moreover, it was shown that the life cycle CO2 emission of ICV was apt to be smaller than that of BEV when the CO2 emissions for battery production were very large. © 2019 by the authors.","Battery electric vehicle; Carbon dioxide; Internal combustion engine vehicle; Life-cycle assessment; Passenger car","carbon dioxide; combustion; electric vehicle; estimation method; European Union; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; power generation; traffic emission; Australia; China; Japan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067047422

Enterococcus faecalis, a GI commensal and opportunistic pathogen, contains approximately 20 ethanolamine utilization (eut) genes encoding the necessary regulatory, enzymatic, and structural proteins for this process. Here, using a chemically defined medium, two regulatory factors that affect EA utilization were examined. First, the functional consequences of loss of the small RNA (sRNA) EutX on the efficacy of EA utilization were investigated. One effect observed, as loss of this negative regulator causes an increase in eut gene expression, was a concomitant increase in the number of catabolic bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) formed. However, despite this increase, the growth of the strain was repressed, suggesting that the overall efficacy of EA utilization was negatively affected. Second, utilizing a deletion mutant and a complement, carbon catabolite control protein A (CcpA) was shown to be responsible for the repression of EA utilization in the presence of glucose. A predicted cre site in one of the three EA-inducible promoters, PeutS, was identified as the target of CcpA. However, CcpA was shown to affect the activation of all the promoters indirectly through the two-component system EutV and EutW, whose genes are under the control of the PeutS promoter. Moreover, a bioinformatics analysis of bacteria predicted to contain CcpA and cre sites revealed that a preponderance of BMC-containing operons are likely regulated by carbon catabolite repression (CCR). IMPORTANCE Ethanolamine (EA) is a compound commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that can affect the behavior of human pathogens that can sense and utilize it, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella. Therefore, it is important to understand how the genes that govern EA utilization are regulated. In this work, we investigated two regulatory factors that control this process. One factor, a small RNA (sRNA), is shown to be important for generating the right levels of gene expression for maximum efficiency. The second factor, a transcriptional repressor, is important for preventing expression when other preferred sources of energy are available. Furthermore, a global bioinformatics analysis revealed that this second mechanism of transcriptional regulation likely operates on similar genes in related bacteria.

Since walking is often involved to access transit stops, this helps account for a healthy lifestyle. Using PT also reduces traffic congestion, which subsequently can reduce air pollution. Past studies suggest that improving the influencing factors like availability and quality of walkways and connectivity of road networks help in achieving more patronage.1 People prefer walking to transit stops if it is in the radius of 400 meters (m) (1,300 feet [ft.]) for transit access stops.2 People may also be encouraged to walk to transit stops if both the sidewalk quality and connectivity are improved.

Exhaust emissions from ship traffic into the atmosphere do not only enhance air pollution, they also affect the Baltic Sea environment through acidification and eutrophication of marine waters and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. As part of the European BONUS project SHEBA (Sustainable Shipping and Environment of the Baltic Sea region), the transport, chemical transformation and fate of atmospheric pollutants in the Baltic Sea region were simulated with three regional chemistry transport model (CTM) systems, CMAQ, EMEP/MSC-W and SILAM, with grid resolutions between 4 and 11km. The main goal was to quantify the effect that shipping emissions have on the regional air quality in the Baltic Sea region when the same shipping emission dataset but different CTMs are used in their typical set-ups. The performance of these models and the shipping contribution to the results of the individual models were evaluated for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM2.5). Model results from the three CTMs for total air pollutant concentrations were compared to observations from rural and urban background stations of the AirBase monitoring network in the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea region. Observed PM2.5 in summer was underestimated strongly by CMAQ and to some extent by EMEP/MSC-W. Observed PM2.5 in winter was underestimated by SILAM. In autumn all models were in better agreement with observed PM2.5. The spatial average of the annual mean O3 in the EMEP/MSC-W simulation was ca. 20% higher compared to the other two simulations, which is mainly the consequence of using a different set of boundary conditions for the European model domain. There are significant differences in the calculated ship contributions to the levels of air pollutants among the three models. EMEP/MSC-W, with the coarsest grid, predicted weaker ozone depletion through NO emissions in the proximity of the main shipping routes than the other two models. The average contribution of ships to PM2.5 levels in coastal land areas is in the range of 3.1%-5.7% for the three CTMs. Differences in ship-related PM2.5 between the models are mainly attributed to differences in the schemes for inorganic aerosol formation. Differences in the ship-related elemental carbon (EC) among the CTMs can be explained by differences in the meteorological conditions, atmospheric transport processes and the applied wet-scavenging parameterizations. Overall, results from the present study show the sensitivity of the ship contribution to combined uncertainties in boundary conditions, meteorological data and aerosol formation and deposition schemes. This is an important step towards a more reliable evaluation of policy options regarding emission regulations for ship traffic and the planned introduction of a nitrogen emission control area (NECA) in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea in 2021. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; concentration (composition); emission inventory; environmental fate; exhaust emission; marine atmosphere; marine pollution; maritime transportation; numerical model; policy approach; policy making; pollutant transport; pollution policy; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066154312

Soil parent material is one of the important factors affecting SOC and N dynamics. The aim of this research was to explore C and N dynamics of a soil lithosequence with parent materials ranging from sedimentary to metamorphic and plutonic bedrock in the eastern Kurdistan province, in western Iran. We examined the hypothesis that SOC and N accumulation potential and turnover vary significantly with soil bedrock lithology. To test our hypothesis, we collected soil samples at three depth intervals (0–5, 5–25 and 25–50 cm) as well as aboveground plant materials in six geological contexts: clastic carbonate sedimentary (CCS), foliated metamorphic (FM), non-foliated metamorphic (NFM), intermediate plutonic (IP), felsic plutonic (FP) and intermediate felsic plutonic (IFP). Soil characteristics (SOC, total N, δ 13 C, δ 15 N, soil texture, pH, EC, carbonates, available P) and plant material properties (C and N contents and their stable isotopic signatures) were determined in 45 soil samples and 18 plant materials, respectively. Results showed that both geology and soil depth strongly influenced the SOC and total N concentrations as well as their stable C and N isotopic composition. Both SOC and total N were highest per site/lithology in the soils over FM geology (5.42 and 0.51 g kg −1 soil for SOC and total N, respectively) and least in the soils forming on FP parent material (0.97 and 0.12 g kg −1 soil for SOC and total N, respectively). In the case of stable C and N isotopic composition, the highest mean value per lithology was found in the NFM soils (−23.68‰ for δ 13 C) and FP soils (13.74‰ for δ 15 N), while the lowest mean signature was observed in the soils developed over FM geology (−25.41‰ and 7.88‰ for δ 13 C and δ 15 N, respectively). Vertical distribution of both δ 13 C and δ 15 N signatures in the studied soils showed an increasing trend by depth. The main controlling factors for organic C and N concentrations across the lithosequence were explored using PLSR and PCA analyses. Results indicated that different soil properties controlled the SOC and total N contents at the different depths. Soil stable C and N isotopic compositions and pH were the factors that influenced negatively the organic C and N contents across the studied lithosequence. Differently, soil C/N ratio was strongly positively associated with SOC and TN contents. Clay- and silt-size fractions had no substantial influence on the organic C and N concentrations, although importance of silt particles for SOC and TN storage increased with increasing soil depth. These findings provide evidence that geology, as soil parent material, can control both SOC and N accumulation and turnover. However, a more in-depth study is required to understand the mechanisms by which parent lithology affects the organic C and N dynamics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Geology; Lithosequence; Soil organic carbon; Stable isotope","bedrock; carbon sequestration; geology; hypothesis testing; isotopic composition; isotopic ratio; lithostratigraphy; nutrient cycling; organic carbon; organic nitrogen; rangeland; soil carbon; soil depth; Iran; Kordestan [Iran]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060291540

Elemental emissions of hydrogen Balmer-alpha line (H α ), nitrogen (N 746 ) and oxygen (O 777 ) were experimentally observed in the vicinity of the electrode gap, using a lens-coupled spectrometer and an intensified camera. After optimization of the gating strategy, the spectral emission features, i.e. line intensity ratios and peaks width (full width at half maximum) ratios were analyzed and their relation with the local fuel-air equivalence ratio at the spark plug was discussed, for operating pressures ranging from 10 to 20 bar. Results showed that a change in pressure and temperature did not affect the spectral emissions’ atomic peaks ratios, as long as the density was kept constant. For tests at constant temperature and at constant pressure, the peaks intensity ratios showed a linear correlation with local fuel-air equivalence ratio, while peaks width did not show noticeable changes. When pressure was varied, while keeping temperature and fuel-air equivalence ratio constant, a different behavior was observed: peaks intensity ratio were only slightly affected by pressure change, more prominently at fuel-rich conditions, while a peak broadening was clearly recognizable, as the peak width linearly increased with pressure. Moreover, an additional optical setup involving a fiber-optic spark plug was implemented with the aim to adapt the proposed diagnostic tool to engines in operando. Comparisons with the lens setup showed that the developed technique is promising as a compact and versatile tool for applications involving local fuel-air equivalence ratio measurements at different ambient conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fuel-air equivalence ratio; Inductive discharge ignition; Methane/air mixtures; Natural gas engines; Spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy","Equivalence classes; Fuels; Methane; Mixtures; Natural gas; Spectrometers; Breakdown spectroscopy; Constant temperature; Fuel-air equivalence ratio; Inductive discharges; Inductive ignition systems; Line intensity ratio; Methane/air; Pressure and temperature; Air engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063725344

However, environmental loads have not been effectively taken into account for future urban plans. Specifically, possible reductions of carbon emissions from cities significantly rely on technological progress and human lifestyle changes, among other factors, which may be a barrier to estimating future environmental loads for cities. There is, therefore, urgent need for developing methods to integrate climate change policies with urban sustainable development planning. This research attempts to estimate future carbon emissions in the building sector in the megacity of Tokyo, considering the social and urban form transitions. The alternative socioeconomic pathways on an urban scale have been developed by the authors. The development of quantitative analysis methods linked with socioeconomic scenario assumptions and finding relevant parameters, also required novel thinking. In this research, influential explanatory variables for building stock changes are investigated and applied for the scenario analysis.

As small-scale tea plantation management provides livelihood security to the growers, they prefer to manage such plantation over a long period of time and therefore maintaining a permanent sink of carbon. In the present study from Barak Valley part of North East India, such smallholder plantations were assessed for carbon stock in tea bushes, shade trees and soil compartment. Allometric equation for tea plants developed from this region was used for estimation of biomass carbon stock in tea bushes, while species-specific volume equations were used for shade trees. Carbon stock of biomass, litter layer and soil compartment in smallholder tea plantations were estimated as 30.50 Mg, 5.54 Mg and 122.17 ± 9.82 Mg C ha -1 up to 1 m depth respectively. Shade tree compartment contributed a dominant proportion (56.37%) of biomass and carbon stock compared to tea bushes (25.46%) and litter layer (18.17%). Collectively soil compartment holds maximum proportion (80%) of carbon stock followed by shade tree (11%), tea bush (5%) and litter (4%) compartments in the system. Comparatively carbon stock in smallholder tea estate is lower than many of the tropical and subtropical forestry and agroforestry systems. Nonetheless, the former sustains the livelihood of million of farmers across the tropical world and simultaneously maintains a permanent sink of carbon. Further studies are required to better understand the tea agroforestry arrangement to promote sink capability of smallholder tea estates. © 2019 Current Science Association, Bengaluru.","Biomass carbon stock; Climate change mitigation; Phytosociology; Smallholder tea growers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065715790

Adaption and mitigation of future severe droughts need precise insights into the natural and anthropogenic drivers of droughts and understanding how variability in human drivers can alter anthropogenic droughts in positive or negative ways. The aim of the current study was expanding the ""observation-modelling"" approach to quantify different types of natural and human droughts. In addition, quantifying enhanced or alleviated modified droughts was the second parallel purpose of the research. The main principle of this approach is the simulation of the condition that would have happened in the absence of human interventions. The extended approach was tested in two Iranian catchments with notable human interventions and different climatic conditions. The drought events were identified through hydrological modelling by the Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model, naturalizing the time series of hydrometeorological data for a period with no significant human interventions, and anomaly analysis. The obtained results have demonstrated that both catchments were almost the same in experiencing longer and more severe negative modified droughts than positive ones because of the negative pressure of human activities on the hydrological system. A large number of natural droughts have also been transformed into modified droughts because of the intensive exploitation of surface and sub-surface water resources and the lack of hydrological system recovery. The results show that the extended approach can detect and quantify different drought types in our human-influenced era. © 2019 by the authors.","Anomaly analysis; Anthropogenic drought; Drought management; Human intervention; Iranian catchment","Catchments; Runoff; Surface water resources; Time series analysis; Anomaly analysis; Drought management; Human intervention; Hydrological cycles; Hydrological modelling; Hydrological process; Hydrometeorological data; Intensive exploitations; Drought; Anthropocene; anthropogenic effect; catchment; climate conditions; drought; hazard management; hydrological cycle; nature-society relations; quantitative analysis; water resource; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066325751

The metabolism of tropical systems may differ profoundly from temperate systems due to the higher temperatures and wider variations in precipitation. Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of the variability in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) and its drivers in a set of 102 low-latitude lakes and reservoirs that encompass wide gradients of precipitation, productivity and landscape properties (lake area, perimeter-to-area ratio, catchment size, catchment area-to-lake area ratio, and types of catchment land use). We used multiple regressions and structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine the direct and indirect effects of the main in-lake variables and landscape properties on the water pCO 2 variance. We found that these systems were mostly supersaturated with CO 2 (92% spatially and 72% seasonally) regardless of their trophic status and landscape properties. The pCO 2 values (9–40,020 μatm) were within the range found in tropical ecosystems, and higher (p &lt; 0.005) than pCO 2 values recorded from high-latitude ecosystems. Water volume had a negative effect on the trophic state (r = −0.63), which mediated a positive indirect effect on pCO 2 (r = 0.4), representing an important negative feedback in the context of climate change-driven reduction in precipitation. Our results demonstrated that precipitation drives the pCO 2 seasonal variability, with significantly higher pCO 2 during the rainy season (F = 16.67; p &lt; 0.001), due to two potential main mechanisms: (1) phytoplankton dilution and (2) increasing inputs of terrestrial CO 2 from the catchment. We conclude that at low latitudes, precipitation is a major climatic driver of pCO 2 variability by influencing volume variations and linking lentic ecosystems to their catchments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycle; Ecosystem metabolism; Eutrophication; Land-water coupling; Precipitation; Shallow lakes","Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Climate change; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Lakes; Land use; Metabolism; Physiology; Precipitation (chemical); Runoff; Tropics; Carbon cycles; Ecosystem metabolisms; Lake sand reservoirs; Landscape properties; Multiple regressions; Shallow lakes; Spatial and temporal patterns; Structural equation modeling; Reservoirs (water); carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; eutrophication; lake; landscape; metabolism; precipitation (climatology); reservoir; saturation; seasonality; temperature effect; trophic conditions; Article; biomass; climate change; environmental factor; environmental impact; eutrophication; lake ecosystem; landscape; latitude; phytoplankton; precipitation; pressure; priority journal; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; structural equation modeling; trophic level; water analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061209755

The challenge posed to federal countries participating in international climate agreements through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is that successful implementation requires buy-in from their subnational governments. However, subnational climate action may not be aligned with the political priorities of the national government and could either undermine or support commitments made through the agreement. To explore these dynamics, we review the incoherence between international commitments, national and subnational policies of Canada and the United States, relying on case studies of investments in low-carbon energy and emissions outcomes. Political and policy incoherence has flowed in both directions. Both countries have seen periods of federal government action, which have been undermined by subnational inaction or opposition. Similarly, both countries have seen periods of federal government inaction, which has placed the onus on subnational governments. Our analysis enables a greater understanding about how the dynamics of federalist political systems influence policy, thus the energy investment and emissions outcomes of national commitments to international agreements. The implications of our findings for other federalist political systems are discussed. We suggest that during national leadership voids, subnational governments can counteract the associated negative policy outcomes by implementing climate policies that support low-carbon technologies and reducing emissions. This type of system supports the development of a coordinated strategy among subnational governments in achieving international goals through cooperative federalism via subnational policy compacts. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","climate policy; energy innovation; greenhouse gas emissions; international commitments","carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; federal system; greenhouse gas; innovation; policy implementation; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Canada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062485477

This study presents the results of new subsurface mapping using 2D seismic data in the north of the Falkland Islands offshore area, which has delineated a series of discrete grabens northwards of the main North Falkland Basin, referred collectively to as the Northern sector of the North Falkland Basin (NNFB). Six regionally significant seismic reflectors are interpreted within this data, dividing the sedimentary fill into six tectonostratigraphic packages, including: early syn-rift; late syn-rift; transitional unit; early post-rift; middle to late post-rift; and a sag unit. Structural interpretation of the 2D seismic data has led to the definition of four north-south orientated depocentres, namely: (1) the Eastern Graben, largest of the depocentres; 20 km wide by 45 km long, reaching depths of 3 km; (2) the Eastern Graben Splay, a smaller depocentre; 10 km wide by 20 km long, reaching depths of 2–2.5 km; (3) the Western Graben Splay, the smallest depocentre; 5 km in width and 20 km long, with a basin depth of 2 km and (4) the newly defined Phyllis Graben, which is 13 km wide and 30 km long, with a basin depth of 3 km. A network of NW-SE and NE-SW trending faults controls the development of these grabens, separated by a Western, Eastern and Intra-Basin high. These grabens represent a northern continuation of the Northern Falkland Basin to the south. Hydrocarbon discoveries to the south of this study area (e.g. Sea Lion, Casper, Beverley, Zebedee, Isobel Deep, and Liz) confirm a working petroleum system adjacent to the Northern sector. This study has identified a number of seismic anomalies, including amplitude brightening events, which potentially correspond to an extension of this petroleum system, indicating active migration pathways. The main targets, in terms of hydrocarbon interest in the northern sector, are likely to be stratigraphically trapped hydrocarbon accumulations, contained within vertically-amalgamated turbidite fan sandstone reservoirs, deposited within the early post-rift. A second, yet to be tested, syn-rift play, in which the trapping geometries are structural and the reservoirs are fluvial sandstones is also identified. © 2019","North Falkland basin; Petroleum systems; South Atlantic; Tectonostratigraphy","Geophysical prospecting; Hydrocarbons; Mammals; Offshore oil well production; Sandstone; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Hydrocarbon accumulation; Hydrocarbon exploration; North Falkland basin; Petroleum systems; Sandstone reservoirs; South Atlantic; Structural interpretation; Tectonostratigraphy; Gasoline; depocenter; geological mapping; graben; hydrocarbon exploration; petroleum hydrocarbon; sandstone; seismic data; tectonostratigraphy; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Falkland Islands (Malvinas); Otariidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062170426

A total of 38 study parks were selected using a systematic random sampling method and all the trees in the parks were field-inventoried. Carbon storage and uptake by the park trees were estimated applying a quantitative model for urban open-grown trees of each species. Mean carbon storage per unit of park area, basal area, and crown cover by the trees was 38.5 ± 3.0 t/ha, 27.3 ± 0.8 kg/100 cm 2 , and 7.4 ± 0.4 kg/m 2 , respectively. Annual carbon uptake per unit area and cover by the trees averaged 3.5 ± 0.2 t/ha/yr, 2.5 ± 0.1 kg/100 cm 2 /yr, and 0.7 ± 0.0 kg/m 2 /yr, respectively. The major determinants of the levels of carbon storage and uptake were species, density, sizes, and layering structures of the planted trees. The trees across all urban parks in Seoul were estimated to store 222.3 kt of carbon and to annually sequester 20.2 kt of carbon. The trees in these parks played an important role in annually offsetting carbon emissions from gasoline consumption by approximately 2.3% of the total population of the city. The economic value of the annual carbon uptake, which was $7.1million/yr, equaled 15.1% of the annual maintenance budget of the parks in the city. However, the role of study parks as a source of carbon uptake was limited due to the distribution of large grass and impervious areas, the single-layered structures, and the dominance of small trees. Planning strategies were explored to enhance carbon reduction effects of the parks.

These observations have revealed important CO2 variability at different timescales and over regional and planetary scales. Satellite CO2 retrievals have revealed that stratospheric sudden warming and the Madden-Julian Oscillation can modulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the mid-troposphere. Atmospheric CO2 also demonstrates variability at interannual timescales. In the tropical region, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Tropospheric Biennial Oscillation can change atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At high latitudes, mid-tropospheric CO2 concentrations can be influenced by the Northern Hemispheric annular mode. In addition to modulations by the large-scale circulations, sporadic events such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and droughts, which change CO2 surface emissions, can cause atmospheric CO2 concentrations to increase significantly. The natural variability of CO2 summarized in this review can help us better understand its sources and sinks and its redistribution by atmospheric motion. ▪ Global satellite CO2 data offer a unique opportunity to explore CO2 variability in different regions. ▪ Atmospheric CO2 concentration demonstrates variations at intraseasonal, seasonal, and interannual timescales. ▪ Both large-scale circulations and variations of surface emissions can modulate CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. © 2019 by Annual Reviews.

Investigating atmospheric SO 2 contributions between different regions will help to reduce SO 2 emissions and control pollution. Using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model and the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) modeling system, as well as the intercontinental chemical transport experiment phase B (INTEX-B) data, we analyzed the regional contributions of atmospheric SO 2 in China. The results showed that SO 2 contributions varied significantly between regions and seasons. The atmospheric SO 2 levels in Central China (CTR) originated mostly from self-emissions, accounting for as much as 60% of the total emissions in January and April and up to 85% in July and October. The SO 2 concentrations in Northeast China (NE) were mainly affected by emissions from CTR, especially in January (39.53%). SO 2 concentrations in Northwest China (NW) were mainly affected by external emissions, which exceeded half of the SO 2 in this region. SO 2 concentrations in Southwest China (SW) were dominated by self-emissions, which accounted for more than 90% of the total SO 2 . In terms of seasons, SO 2 concentrations were significantly affected by external emissions in January and April and were dominated by self-emissions in July and October. Coal use, population, area, and thermal power were found to have the greatest impacts on SO 2 concentrations. Among these, coal consumption had the biggest impact on the national SO 2 concentration. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","CMAQ simulation; Driving factor; Spatial pattern; Sulfur dioxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065078987

Cassava-based fuel ethanol is one of the most important bioenergy and has attracted much attention in both developed and developing countries. However, the development of cassava-based fuel ethanol is still faced with many uncertainties, including raw material supply, net energy potential, and carbon emission mitigation potential. Thus, an accurate estimation of these issues is urgently needed. This study provides an approach to estimate energy saving and carbon emission mitigation potentials of cassava-based fuel ethanol through LCA (life cycle assessment) coupled with a biogeochemical process model—GEPIC (GIS-based environmental policy integrated climate) model. The results indicate that the total potential of cassava yield on marginal land in China is 52.51 million t; the energy ratio value varies from 0.07 to 1.44, and the net energy surplus of cassava-based fuel ethanol in China is 92,920.58 million MJ. The total carbon emission mitigation from cassava-based fuel ethanol in China is 4593.89 million kgC.

The average annual PM2.5 concentration of Beijing has shown a continued decline in recent years. However, the improvement was not obvious during the heating season, which had heavier pollution than the non-heating season. Analyzing the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations during heating and non-heating seasons, as well as their spatial differences, is believed to benefit the study of spatial-temporal variation of air pollution and provide scientific reference for the control of air pollution in Beijing. In this study, land use regression (LUR) model was employed to simulate the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing during heating and non-heating seasons in 2015. The spatial distribution of the concentration difference between heating and non-heating seasons was analyzed, and the influencing factors were also examined. The results showed that: (1) PM2.5 concentrations during heating and non-heating seasons, as well as their differences, were clearly at a maximum in the south and east of Beijing and at a minimum in the north and west; (2) the area with the biggest concentration difference was situated in a suburban area to the south and east, as well as in outer suburbs to the southeast and northwest; and (3) wind speed, area of transport land and industrial-mining-warehouse land were the main influence factors for the PM2.5 concentration difference in the central, eastern and southern area.

Intense sea-to-air N2O fluxes occur in major oceanic upwelling regions such as the eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP). The ETSP is influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation that leads to inter-annual variations in physical, chemical, and biological properties in the water column. In October 2015, a strong El Niño event was developing in the ETSP; we conduct field observations to investigate (1) the N2O production pathways and associated biogeochemical properties and (2) the effects of El Niño on water column N2O distributions and fluxes using data from previous non-El Niño years. Analysis of N2O natural abundance isotopomers suggested that nitrification and partial denitrification (nitrate and nitrite reduction to N2O) were occurring in the near-surface waters; indicating that both pathways contributed to N2O effluxes. Higher-than-normal sea surface temperatures were associated with a deepening of the oxycline and the oxygen minimum layer. Within the shelf region, surface N2O supersaturation was nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of non-El Niño years. Therefore, a significant reduction of N2O efflux (75&amp;thinsp;%-95&amp;thinsp;%) in the ETSP occurred during the 2015 El Niño. At both offshore and coastal stations, the N2O concentration profiles during El Niño showed moderate N2O concentration gradients, and the peak N2O concentrations occurred at deeper depths during El Niño years; this was likely the result of suppressed upwelling retaining N2O in subsurface waters. At multiple stations, water-column inventories of N2O within the top 1000&amp;thinsp;m were up to 160&amp;thinsp;% higher than those measured in non-El Niño years, indicating that subsurface N2O during El Niño could be a reservoir for intense N2O effluxes when normal upwelling is resumed after El Niño. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air-sea interaction; annual variation; El Nino; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global warming; nitrous oxide; open ocean; trace gas; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065875614

Reliable greenhouse gas inventory is prerequisite to making effective greenhouse gas reduction plans. Currently, Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change default emission factors were used in biological treatment of the solid waste sector without any consideration of the biological treatment process in the Republic of Korea. In this study, greenhouse gas emissions from biological treatment facilities of food waste have been monitored in order to develop country-specific emission factors in the Republic of Korea. Greenhouse gas emissions were monitored in two composting facilities and one anaerobic digestion facility. All study sites possess a local exhaust ventilation system and odour treatment system. Continuous greenhouse gas monitoring has been conducted on gathered gases using a non-dispersive infrared detector before entering odour treatment systems. At composting facilities, the emission factors of CH 4 and N 2 O were 0.17–0.19 g-CH 4 kg-waste -1 and 0.10–0.13 g-N 2 O kg-waste -1 , respectively. Especially, the emission factors of CH 4 in composting facilities showed significantly low values compared with other countries owing to the air blowing by a pump at the studied sites. At anaerobic digestion facilities, the emission factors of CH 4 and N 2 O were 1.03 g-CH 4 kg-waste -1 and 0.53 g-N 2 O kg-waste -1 . The emission factors estimated in this study showed a significant difference from the Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change default value.

Recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) have been reported in inflamed skin. In this study, keratinocytes were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor–α or flagellin in combination with AhR ligands or antagonist. TSLP gene expression and recruitment of transcriptional regulator to TSLP gene promoter were determined. The effects of AhR activation were also studied in DNFB-induced dermatitis model. We found that AhR activation suppressed upregulation of TSLP expression in keratinocytes treated with tumor necrosis factor–α or flagellin. In addition, AhR activation induced protein kinase Cδ–mediated phosphorylation of p300 at serine 89, leading to decreased acetylation and DNA binding activity of NF-κB p65 to the TSLP gene promoter. We also found that AhR activation alleviates dermatitis induced by DNFB treatment.

It has been suggested that some species or populations will have to rely on their ability to adjust their phenotype rather than on adaptation through evolutionary adaptation. We test the extent of intra- and inter-population patterns of acclimation and genetic variation in multiple traits directly related to environmental tolerance limits in the broadly distributed soil dwelling collembolan Orchesella cincta. Genetic variation in both dynamic and static assays of thermal tolerance was present across seven populations spanning 14° of latitude and both heat and cold tolerance were significantly correlated with latitude. Short-term heat and cold acclimation significantly increased thermal tolerance limits across all populations, and there was local adaptation for acclimation responses for some traits. Furthermore, results showed large acclimatization responses in the field within populations for cold tolerance throughout a 13-month period and smaller acclimatization responses for heat tolerance. Acclimatization responses were correlated with microhabitat temperature at the site of collection suggesting that plastic responses are highly dynamic and allow organisms to cope with changes in temperature. Our findings demonstrate small differences in upper and lower thermal tolerance limits across populations, but substantial local acclimatization effects dictated by microhabitat temperatures, and also highlight strong tradeoffs and limited scope to respond to increasing temperatures. These findings demonstrate the need for incorporating information on species’ ability to respond to environmental change using both laboratory and field approaches into climate change models.

In this investigation, end milling experiments with various cooling approaches were performed on DIN 1.2714 die steel using titanium aluminum nitrate-coated carbide tool inserts under dry, conventional coolant, and cryogenic CO2 environments. The end milling performance under CO2 environment has been compared with those under dry and wet conditions regarding cutting temperature (Tc), feed force (Fx), normal force (Fy), axial force (Fz), surface roughness (Ra), tool wear, surface and chip morphology, and residual stress. The consequences of these machining environments were evaluated. Using cryogenic CO2 cooling technique reduced the Tc values by approximately 50.49 % and 64.42 % compared with those of wet and dry conditions, respectively. Similarly, CO2 cooling diminished the cutting forces, namely, Fx, Fy and Fz. As a result, Ra values reduced by approximately 59.81 % and 67.15 % compared with those of wet and dry conditions, respectively. Cryogenic CO2 caused a significant reduction in surface damage and abrasion wear in the machined surfaces and cutting inserts, respectively. No substantial changes in residual stress were observed at the cut surfaces. © 2019, KSME & Springer.","Chip morphology; Cryogenic; Cutting forces; Cutting temperature; Surface roughness; Tool wear","Aluminum coated steel; Aluminum coatings; Aluminum compounds; Carbide cutting tools; Carbide tools; Carbon dioxide; Chromium compounds; Coolants; Cooling; Cryogenics; Cutting; Cutting fluids; Milling (machining); Morphology; Residual stresses; Surface roughness; Thermal management (electronics); Wear of materials; Chip morphologies; Coated carbide tools; Conventional coolants; Cutting forces; Cutting temperature; Dry and wet conditions; Surface roughness (Ra); Tool wear; Cutting tools",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065642554

This exploratory study relies on the theory of planned behavior and certain constructs from the health belief model to identify the factors leading municipal authorities to implement preventive interventions for Lyme disease (PILD). Data were obtained from an online survey sent, during the summer of 2018, to municipal officers in 820 municipalities in Quebec, in all health regions where the population is at risk of contracting Lyme disease (response rate = 36%). The questionnaire was used to measure the implementation of PILD, the intention to implement these interventions, attitudes, perceived social pressure, perceived control (levers and barriers) over interventions, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures, risk, and perceived vulnerability. Results of structural equation analyses showed that attitudes were significantly associated with municipal authorities’ intention to implement PILD, while the intention to implement PILD was a significant predictor of the implementation of PILD. Additional analyses showed that perceived barriers added a moderating effect in the intention-implementation relationship. The prediction of behaviors or practices that municipal authorities could implement to prevent Lyme disease will enable the evaluation over time of the evolution of Quebec municipalities’ adaptation to Lyme disease. Moreover, the examination of the associations of specific psychosocial factors revealed important implications for the design of effective behavior-change interventions, which would allow health officials doing awareness work to create personalized interventions better suited to municipal officers and their specific contexts. © 2019 by the authors.

In this tri-generation system, biogas is used as clean resource to reduce emissions and consumption of fossil fuels. Six electrical chillers are used for cooling demand supply of a benchmark building located in Ahwaz, Iran. In addition, expected required power of chillers and building is supplied either by gas turbine cycle or by main grid (If total power consumed by chillers and electrical equipment is larger than output power of gas turbine, building owner pays for purchasing electricity from local power system to satisfy not-supplied demand). A low-grade waste heat is extracted from the flue gases for preheating purpose and closed-air open-water humidification dehumidification (HDH) desalination process. In addition, a mixed integer non-linear programming problem is solved to minimize an objective function composed of daily electricity cost, total capital investment, operation and maintenance cost of CCWP generation system considering all operational limitations of gas turbine cycle, chillers, HDH process, and strategic cooling and electrical demand response programs (DRPs). If ambient air decreases, gas turbine power and mas flow rate of potable water will be increased due to lower compressor power and higher absolute humidity of air, respectively. Application of DRPs reduces total electricity cost from 31.2$ to 16.4$. Utilization of biogas and waste heat recovery of flue gases with no need to combustion of fossil fuels results in emission reduction. Hence, this tri-generation plant is called a net-zero emission system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Combined cooling; Compression chillers; Demand response programs (DRPs); Humidification dehumidification desalination process (HDD); Potable water and power (CCWP) generation systems","Biogas; Cooling; Costs; Desalination; Emission control; Flue gases; Fossil fuels; Gas turbines; Gases; Humidity control; Integer programming; Investments; Nonlinear programming; Potable water; Trigeneration plant; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Waste incineration; Water filtration; Combined cooling; Demand response programs; Generation systems; Humidification-dehumidification; Humidification-dehumidification desalination process; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Operation and maintenance; Total capital investments; Cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062144689

Leaf functional traits suggest a substantial basis for assessing the aridity effects on vegetation. However, since plants possess diverse leaf morphology and anatomy due to different evolutionary history of taxa, the effect of aridity can hardly be revealed in a multi-species analysis. We studied leaf functional traits for 317 samples of 193 plant species in steppe and desert communities along a 1600-km latitudinal gradient in Southern Siberia (Transbaikalia, Russia) and Mongolia. We determined morphological leaf traits, quantitative anatomical parameters, physiological parameters, and photosynthetic pigments content. Different relevance of leaf traits for indication of plant response to climate has been demonstrated. The clearest changes in site-mean values along the aridity gradient were shown for leaf thickness, total chloroplast number per leaf area (Nchl/A) and total surface area of chloroplasts (Achl/A) and cells (Ames/A) per leaf area. Unlike leaf size and leaf mass per area, these quantitative mesophyll parameters related to plant photosynthetic capacity were strongly correlated with climate. We found no evidence for a decrease in sizes of mesophyll cells with aridity, but cell volume as well as chloroplast number per cell were linked with plant functional type (PFT). We revealed an increase in Nchl/A and Achl/A in desert-steppe species in comparison to steppe and forest-steppe vegetation types within each PFT of C3-plants (C3-dicot herbs, C3-dicot shrubs, C3-monocots and C3-succulents). C4-plants were generally characterized by low Achl/A and Ames/A, but had higher rate of CO2-transfer through mesophyll and chloroplast surfaces. C3- and C4-plants differed in response to aridity and showed opposite trends in changes of leaf traits along the aridity gradient. We conclude that leaf mesophyll traits contribute to important mechanism of climatic adaptation in different PFTs along a large latitudinal gradient. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Aridity gradient; Desert steppe; Leaf morphology; Mesophyll surface; Photosynthetic performance; Plant functional traits; Quantitative leaf anatomy","adaptation; anatomy; aridity; C3 plant; C4 plant; cell; chloroplast; desert; ecophysiology; functional role; latitudinal gradient; leaf morphology; photosynthesis; pigment; steppe; Mongolia; Russian Federation; Siberia; Transbaikalia; Dicotyledoneae; Liliopsida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056251725

It requires an understanding of the needs of individual countries and their expectations related to bioeconomy. With the aim to explore the prospective developments in the global bioeconomy over the next 20 years, the German Bioeconomy Council, an independent advisory body to the German Federal Government, commissioned BIOCOM-AG to invite experts from around the globe to share their insights in a global expert survey. The survey was conducted online in autumn 2017. 345 experts from 46 countries completed the questionnaire about future developments and strategies in the global bioeconomy. As claimed by the experts, the upcoming bioeconomy must primarily meet humanity’s needs in the energy, agriculture, and food sectors. Moreover, innovative products based on renewable resources are anticipated to be of great importance. Even though all UN SDGs will be affected by future bioeconomy success stories, five SDGs stood out within the sample: SDG 12: ‘responsible consumption and production’; SDG 9: ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’; SDG 13: ‘climate action’; SDG 7: ‘affordable and clean energy’; and SDG 11: ‘sustainable cities and communities’. About three quarters of the experts emphasized the need to specifically address three conflicting goals in any future bioeconomy strategy: non-food uses of arable land, use of crop land to produce feedstock for meat, milk and egg production and, finally, the conversion of virgin forests into agricultural land. Most experts stated that reducing food loss and waste is crucial to eradicating the world hunger problem. The proposed solutions relied greatly on innovation and technological development. Bioeconomy expertise and know-how should be shared in close cooperation between developed and developing economies to reach UN SDGs. A supportive political framework would be the ultimate goal towards furthering the progress of a future bioeconomy all over the world. © 2019 Issa et al.

A CO2 emission analysis is also conducted to calculate the emissions which can be avoided by recovering this waste heat. The Aspen Plus simulation software is utilized to model and simulate the proposed integrated system. A thermochemical water splitting process is incorporated into the system for hydrogen production. The cryogenic air separation unit is integrated in order to separate nitrogen from the air. This proposed system also reduces the environmental effects of the flue gas emitted by the cement industry. Multiple parametric studies are performed to investigate the system performance by varying operating conditions and state properties.

The obtained results depict a tide dominated estuary with a delay in the tide phase and a marked asymmetry in the tide curve that increases upriver. Additionally, an upstream diminution of M2 and an upstream augmentation of M4 was observed, classifying this estuary as flooddominated. The represented current patterns show that variations in the intensities of the main driving forces alter the behaviour of the hydrodynamical patterns within the estuary, with a clear dependence on bathymetric and topographic characteristics. During flood events, larger estuarine regions become submerged due to the low margins and the wetland characteristics, highlighting the need for accurate numerical models that can be used as a decision-making support tool for effective and integrated estuarine management. © 2019 by the authors.","Estuarine modelling; Floods; Hydrodynamics; Minho estuary; Shallow water estuary","Climate change; Climate models; Decision making; Floods; Hydrodynamics; Mean square error; Numerical models; Water levels; Calibration and validations; Coastal environments; Decision making support; Estuarine management; Hydrodynamic pattern; Root mean square errors; Shallow waters; Tide-dominated estuaries; Estuaries; accuracy assessment; anthropogenic effect; climate change; estuarine environment; extreme event; flood; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; rock pool; shallow water; Iberian Peninsula; Minho Estuary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066322904

Created starting complexes are successfully operated in various countries around the world where space-rocket hardware is well-developed; they represent a set of functionally interconnected mobile and stationary technical objects, control equipment and constructions designed to support and conduct all types of work with start preparation and rockets launching. Their features depend on the type and power of the launch vehicles, infrastructure characteristics (the location of the complex, the nomenclature of space objects, development level in the space-rocket technology area), and tasks which are solved during launching, etc. The solution of various issues, which arise while making the normative framework for justifying the resource of starting complexes, is caused by the need to consider the problems of strength and resource of heterogeneous elements of their designs and space-rocket technology designs. The main methodological stages of resource justification are defined. The limiting resource is considered to be the critical operating time, or the number of cycles (starts) during this time, after which the specified limiting states are reached in the hazardous areas of the structure, such as: critical cracks, fracture, formation of unacceptable plastic deformations, loss of stability, growth of corrosion damages, etc. It is noted that the physical nonlinearity of the material and statistical approaches determine the basis for calculating strength and resource. The classification of loads on the starting complexes is made. The concepts of low- and high-cycle fatigue are used. In developing strength standards and the basis for calculating resource, it is reasonable to use up-to-date methods of technical diagnostics, particularly, methods of holographic interferometry and acoustic emission, and fast-converging schemes of methods for numerical operational calculations. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","acoustic; and thermal loads; classification of loads and damages; low-cycle fatigue; normative framework; projection and iterative schemes of numerical operational calculations; resource; shock and wave; space launch vehicles; starting buildings","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustics; Control equipment; Corrosion; Earth (planet); Holographic interferometry; Iterative methods; Launch vehicles; Numerical methods; Orbits; Thermal fatigue; Iterative schemes; Low cycle fatigues; normative framework; resource; Space launch vehicles; Rockets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070956048

A new strategy is proposed to select runs with good and poor MJO simulations among 85 generated ones. Outputs and parameter values from good and poor simulations are composited separately for comparison. Among the seven chosen parameters, a decreased value of precipitation efficiency for shallow convection, higher values of relative humidity threshold for low stable clouds and evaporation efficiency for deep convective precipitation are crucial to simulate a better MJO. Changes of the three parameters act together to suppress heavy precipitation and increase the frequency of light rainfall over the Indo-Pacific region, supplying more moisture in low and middle troposphere. As a result of a wetter lower troposphere ahead of the MJO main convection, the low-level moisture preconditioning along with the leading shallow convection tends to be enhanced, favorable for MJO's further development and eastward propagation. The MJO's further propagation across the Maritime Continent (MC) in good simulations is accompanied with more land precipitation dominated by shallow convection. Therefore, the above-mentioned three parameters are found to be crucial parameters out of the seven ones for MJO simulation, providing an inspiration for better MJO simulation and prediction with this model. This work is valuable as it highlights the key role of moisture-shallow convection feedback in the MJO dynamics. © 2019 by the authors.","Eastward propagation; General circulation model; Madden-Julian Oscillation; Moisture-convection feedback; Parameter perturbation","Climate models; Efficiency; Heat convection; Moisture; Precipitation (meteorology); Troposphere; Eastward propagation; General circulation model; Madden-Julian oscillation; Moisture-convection feedback; Parameter perturbation; Climatology; air-sea interaction; atmospheric moisture; climate modeling; convection; general circulation model; Madden-Julian oscillation; perturbation; precipitation intensity; relative humidity; troposphere; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066305514

There is growing attention to food self-sufficiency in metropolitan areas for the concern of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in food transportation. In China, grain self-sufficiency in metropolitan areas is also an important issue for grain security and involves coordination among contradictory policy goals. Based upon a comprehensive statistical analysis of 70 metropolitan areas in mainland China, we investigated the regional differences in the trends of grain self-sufficiency capacity in these areas from 1990 to 2015. The findings show a trend of decline in 3/4 of metropolitan areas, mainly located in the rapidly urbanizing eastern coastal areas and in theWest. The increase of self-sufficiency mainly occurred in the North, in areas either specialized in grain production or originally low in grain self-sufficiency. The enlarging contradiction of decreasing supply and rising demand explained the sharp decrease in self-sufficiency, while the increase in self-sufficiency was due to the increase in supply. Land productivity contributed more significantly than land availability to supply change. There was a tradeoff between urban expansion (rather than economic growth) and grain production in metropolitan areas. Our results provide implications to future research and policy-making for grain production management in China's metropolitan areas. © 2019 by the authors.","China; Grain; Metropolitan area; Regional difference; Self-sufficiency; Trend; Urbanization","agricultural management; crop plant; crop production; food production; food supply; metropolitan area; policy making; self sufficiency; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066957026

The Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China, has been suffering serious soil acidification, but the contribution of S deposition was ignored because of the regulation of S emission since 2001. Here, we chose the evergreen broadleaf forests, which are the typical forest type at the regional scale in PRD to examine the contribution of S deposition and its characteristics in this acidification, based on an established urban–rural gradient in the range of 260 km. A substantial acidification was evidenced by the significant decline of soil pH from rural to urban sites, with mean pH values decreased by more than 0.60 U through the whole 40-cm depths. However, there was no significant difference in soil pH from 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and to 20–40 cm at each site (P &gt; 0.05). Acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) showed a similar trend to soil pH, with a significant decline along the urbanization gradient and no significant effect of soil depths. Soil sulfate (SO42−), as the most abundant species in ANC, contributed greatly to soil acidification for the whole 40-cm depth, as shown by the significant positive relationships between it with soil pH and base cations. Soils also exhibited the depletion of base cations with low base saturation (&lt; 20%) and the release of Al and Fe. Our research demonstrated that the severe soil acidification in the PRD region has extended to the subsoil level (40-cm depth), and S deposition is still an important driver to this acidification. Therefore, both recovering the acidified soils and controlling the acidifying pollutants, especially S, are particularly difficult in southern China. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Rural gradient; South China; Subsoil acidification; Sulfur deposition; Tropical forests; Urban","acidification; atmospheric deposition; broad-leaved forest; emission control; forest soil; subsoil; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; tropical forest; urban pollution; urban-rural migration; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; sulfate; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; chemistry; China; forest; pollutant; river; soil; urbanization; China; Environmental Pollutants; Forests; Rivers; Soil; Sulfates; Sulfur; Sulfur Dioxide; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063202815

Emission factors of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), were acquired for a commercial broiler barn and cage-layer barn in the Canadian Prairies climate. Between March 2015 and February 2016, monthly measurements throughout the year for the layer barn and over 6 flocks for the broiler barn, and diurnal measurements in the mild, warm, and cold seasons for both barns were conducted, respectively. The ventilation rate was estimated based on a CO2 mass balance method; thus CO2 emissions were quantified by the CIGR (2002) models. The CH4 and N2O emissions present at low levels from global perspective for both barns; the cold climate proved to be a major reason for the lower CH4 emission from the layer barn. Considerable seasonal effect was observed only for N2O emissions from the broiler barn, and for CH4 and N2O emissions from the layer barn, both with higher emissions in the mild and warm seasons than in the cold season. The big diurnal variations of CO2 emissions for the layer barn demonstrated the uncertainty of the seasonal results by snapshot measurements and correction factors (from −20.9% to −22.5%) were obtained. Besides, the difference of CH4 and N2O concentrations and emissions as well as CO2 concentrations between best-case (the first day after manure removal) and worst-case conditions (the last day before manure removal) was not obvious for the layer barn. Additionally, changes of temperature and ventilation rate were likely to have more impact on N2O emission for the broiler barn and more impact on CH4 emission for the layer barn than on the other two gas emissions, both with positive correlations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diurnal; Emission; Greenhouse gases; Poultry; Seasonal","Carbon dioxide; Farm buildings; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Manures; Neutron emission; Nitrogen oxides; Poultry; Uncertainty analysis; Diurnal; Diurnal measurements; Global perspective; Mass-balance method; Positive correlations; Seasonal; Seasonal variation; Snapshot measurement; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; cold region; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; greenhouse gas; measurement method; poultry; seasonal variation; air conditioning; Article; broiler barn; cage layer barn; Canada; carbon footprint; circadian rhythm; climate; concentration (parameter); controlled study; gas; poultry; prairie; seasonal variation; summer; temperature; winter; analysis; animal; animal husbandry; chicken; grassland; greenhouse gas; growth, development and aging; manure; season; Canada; Prairie Provinces; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Canada; Carbon Dioxide; Chickens; Grassland; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062333710

In this Letter, an electrically driven silicon light source with its efficiency enhanced by using a nano-antenna in a metal–insulator–semiconductor junction is proposed. Strong plasmon confinement in the nano-antenna provides large local density of optical states and bridges the wave vector mismatch between nanoscale volume field confinement and far-field radiation.

In this paper, ceria promoted cobalt oxide was prepared by the calcination method and investigated for the CO oxidation. The microstructure and morphology of CeO2-Co3O4 were investigated by the Scanning Electron Microscope, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization. The effect of CeO2 doping on Co3O4 for CO oxidation was characterized by in situ X-ray Diffraction (in situ XRD) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS). In situ XRD was carried out under H2 atmosphere to evaluate the redox property of catalysts. The results indicated that the ceria doping can enhance the reducibility of Co2+ and promote the Co3+-Co2+-Co3+ cycle, owing to the oxygen replenish property of CeO2. Furthermore, adsorbed carbonate species on the surface of CeO2-Co3O4 were investigated by in situ-DRIFTS experiment. It was turned out that carbonate species on ceria promoted cobalt oxide catalysts showed different IR peaks compared with pure cobalt oxide. The carbonate species on ceria promoted catalyst are more active, and similar to free state carbonate species with weak bonding to catalyst surface, which can effectively inhibit catalyst inactivation. This study revealed the mechanism of ceria promoting CO oxidation over cobalt oxide, which will provide theoretical support for the design of efficient CO oxidation catalysts. © 2019, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This can be achieved in a system coupling a photovoltaic (PV) cell to an electrochemical cell (EC) for CO2 reduction. To be beneficial and applicable, such a system should use low-cost and easily processable photovoltaic cells and display minimal energy losses associated with the catalysts at the anode and cathode and with the electrolyzer device. In this work, we have considered all of these parameters altogether to set up a reference PV–EC system for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons. By using the same original and efficient Cu-based catalysts at both electrodes of the electrolyzer, and by minimizing all possible energy losses associated with the electrolyzer device, we have achieved CO2 reduction to ethylene and ethane with a 21% energy efficiency. Coupled with a state-of-the-art, low-cost perovskite photovoltaic minimodule, this system reaches a 2.3% solar-to-hydrocarbon efficiency, setting a benchmark for an inexpensive all–earth-abundant PV–EC system. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

To mitigate these problems with great efforts, the Chinese government has implemented the Environmental Protection Tax Law in the whole country since the beginning of 2018. Although the new tax law is perceived as an aggressive policy that tends to establish a taxation system for promoting air pollution control, evaluations of its effectiveness are insufficient and urgently needed for China. Using a multiregion multisector Computable General Equilibrium model, we, for the first time, quantify the impacts of this 'pollution tax' policy on modulating air pollutants emissions. Our analysis shows that current tax policy is generally able to reduce many short-lived air pollutants emissions (e.g. SO2, NO X , TSP, PM10, PM2.5, CO, VOCs, OC, NH3 and BC), but the significant effects only happen in regions with large economic scale (i.e. Guangdong, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces) and in sectors with high emission intensity (i.e. the electric power and nonmetal manufacturing sectors). However, at the national level, the overall effect of the current policy on air pollution mitigation is relatively small, less than 2% compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Large emission reduction potentials exist if the tax increases. Therefore, a more ambitious tax policy is urgently needed in order to achieve China's air pollution mitigation target of 2020. We also find that in China for implementing any pollution tax policies, the rate of decline in CO2 emissions is much larger than those of short-lived pollutants, which indicates a huge co-benefit on global climate change mitigation. © 2019 The Author(s).

Lyngby, Denmark","Floor heating (FH) system is a widely-used thermally active building system, which can take advantage of building thermal mass to shift energy demands to off-peak hours. Its ability of effective utilization of low-temperature energy resources also helps to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, control of FH systems remains a challenge due to the large thermal inertia of the pipe-embedded concrete floor. In the context of smart grids, the control issue becomes more complicated because the dynamic electricity prices need to be taken into consideration to achieve economic benefits and encourage demand response participation. In this study, an advanced optimal control method, i.e., model predictive control (MPC), is developed for FH systems, which can simultaneously consider all the influential variables including weather conditions, occupancy and dynamic electricity prices. Considering the on-line computational efficiency, a control-oriented dynamic thermal model for a room integrated with FH system is developed and represented in a stochastic state-space form. An economic MPC controller, formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, is designed for FH systems. A TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation testbed is developed to test and compare different control methods under various operating conditions in terms of energy consumption, thermal comfort and operating costs. Test results show that, compared to the conventional on-off controller, the MPC controller is able to use building thermal mass to optimally shift energy consumption to low-price periods, improve thermal comfort at the beginning of occupancy, reduce energy demand during peak periods, and save electricity costs for residential end-users. The weather conditions and electricity prices have influences on the start-up time and duration of preheating, energy flexibility potential and electricity cost savings of FH systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Dynamic electricity prices; Energy flexibility; Floor heating; Model predictive control; RC model","Computational efficiency; Controllers; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Floors; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; MATLAB; Meteorology; Model predictive control; Operating costs; Predictive control systems; Smart power grids; State space methods; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Temperature; Thermal comfort; Demand response; Electricity prices; Energy flexibility; Floor heating; RC models; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062463077

Yet large uncertainties still remain for the CH4 budget of these domains. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, is one of the world's most densely populated regions where a large number of cities are located. To estimate anthropogenic CH4 emissions in YRD, we conducted simultaneous atmospheric CH4 and CO2 mixing ratio measurements from June 2010 to April 2011. By combining these measurements with the Weather Research and Forecasting and Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport models and a priori Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research emission inventories, we applied three “top-down” approaches to constrain anthropogenic CH4 emissions. These three approaches included multiplicative scaling factors, flux ratio, and scale factor Bayesian inversion. The posteriori CH4 flux density estimated from the three approaches showed high consistency and were 36.32 (±9.17), 35.66 (±2.92), and 36.03(±14.25) nmol·m−2·s−1, respectively, for the duration of the study period (November 2010 to April 2011). The total annual anthropogenic CH4 emission was 6.52(±1.59) Tg for the YRD region based on the average of these three approaches. Our emission estimates were 30.2(±17.6)%, 31.5 (±5.6)%, and 30.8 (±27.4)% lower than the a priori Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research v432 emission inventory estimate. The scale factor Bayesian inversion results indicate that the overestimate was mainly caused by two source categories including fuel exploitation and agricultural soil emissions (rice cultivation). The posteriori flux densities for agricultural soil and fuel exploitation were 10.68 and 6.34 nmol·m−2·s−1, respectively, and were 47.8% and 29.2% lower than the a priori inventory. Agricultural soil was the largest source contribution and accounted for 29.6% of the YRD CH4 budget during the study period. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Estimating CO2 recycling efficiency in complex regions like the Sunda margin, Indonesia, is particularly difficult due to the lateral variability in sediment thickness, composition, and fraction subducted. We present a new approach for estimating sedimentary carbon flux that combines high-precision carbon content and isotope measurements with a regional sediment and unit thickness model we generated from seismic profiles to more accurately extrapolate compositional measurements from sediment core sites to the margin. Our results suggest that the subducting sedimentary carbon flux is up to an order of magnitude less than previous estimates and cannot alone account for the volume of CO2 released along the volcanic arc. Together, this and the isotopic composition of subducting sedimentary carbon suggest that an additional isotopically heavy carbon source contributes to the released CO2. Carbon from carbonate-likely from subducted altered oceanic crust and the overriding plate-can account for the discrepancy between both amount and isotopic composition of sedimentary carbon influx and those of volcanic CO2 efflux. These results highlight the importance of considering the full range of subduction zone processes operating at individual margins in order to better understand the cycling of carbon and other elements. Similar scrutiny should be applied in the evaluation of carbon subduction inputs to other subduction margins to improve global estimates of tectonic carbon cycling. © 2019 Geological Society of America.",,"Isotopes; Sedimentology; Sediments; Tectonics; Volcanoes; Altered oceanic crusts; Convergent margin; Isotope measurements; Isotopic composition; Primary mechanism; Recycling efficiency; Sediment thickness; Subduction zone process; Carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; convergent margin; sediment chemistry; sediment thickness; subduction zone; tectonic setting; volcanic arc; Indonesian seas; Pacific Ocean; Sunda Arc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065553076

In the present study, seals were harvested during subsistence hunts in four regions of the Canadian Arctic: Beaufort Sea, Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, and coastal Labrador. An extensive suite of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was determined in seal blubber collected for multiple years between 1972 and 2016. Results from this long-term study indicate geographical differences in the contaminant concentrations in seals and the significant general decrease of most POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and related compounds, chlordanes (CHL), and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) over time in ringed seals. The highest decrease rates (up to −9.1%/year for α-HCH) were found in seals from the Hudson Bay region where all chemicals investigated have significantly decreased since 1986. Significant increases in concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in seals from Labrador and β-HCH in Sachs Harbour, NT and Arctic Archipelago were observed. Site-specific and contaminant-specific associations between climate pattern (i.e., Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Pacific/North American pattern) and mean ice-coverage (total, first-year ice, and old-ice) were found at sites with the longest time trend data (i.e., Arviat, Sachs Harbour/Ulukhaktok and Resolute Bay). Overall, results suggest that North American and international regulations have led to the long-term reduction of most POPs in Canadian Arctic ringed seals by reducing emissions from primary sources.

Low abandonment pressure in the reservoir provides additional voidage-replacement potential for CO2 and allows for a low surface pump pressure during the early period of injection. However, the injection process poses several challenges. This work aims to raise awareness of key operational challenges related to CO2 injection in low-pressure reservoirs and to provide a new approach to assessing the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore. When the reservoir pressure is below the CO2 bubble-point pressure, and CO2 is injected in its liquid or supercritical state, CO2 will vaporize and expand within the well-tubing or in the near-wellbore region of the reservoir. This phenomenon is associated with several flow assurance problems. For instance, when CO2 transitions from the dense-state to the gas-state, CO2 density drops sharply, affecting the wellhead pressure control and the pressure response at the well bottom-hole. As CO2 expands with a lower phase viscosity, the flow velocity increases abruptly, possibly causing erosion and cavitation in the flowlines. Furthermore, CO2 expansion is associated with the Joule–Thomson (IJ) effect, which may result in dry ice or hydrate formation and therefore may reduce CO2 injectivity. Understanding the transient multiphase phase flow behavior of CO2 within the wellbore is crucial for appropriate well design and operational risk assessment. The commonly used approach analyzes the flow in the wellbore without taking into consideration the transient pressure response of the reservoir, which predicts an unrealistic pressure gap at the wellhead. This pressure gap is related to the phase transition of CO2 from its dense state to the gas state. In this work, a new coupled approach is introduced to address the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore under different operational conditions. The proposed approach integrates the flow within both the wellbore and the reservoir at the transient state and therefore resolves the pressure gap issue. Finally, the energy costs associated with a mitigation process that involves CO2 heating at the wellhead are assessed. © 2019 by the authors.

The Bay of Quinte (Lake Ontario, Canada) is a Great Lakes nearshore ecosystem that has been historically subjected to a variety of environmental perturbations: cultural eutrophication, low dissolved oxygen, reduced fisheries, climatic extremes, phosphorus (P) abatement, and aquatic invasive species. We used the Bay of Quinte to study how trophic state alterations affect fish assemblages in Great Lakes nearshore environments by examining the response of fish biomass to TP concentration variability in the presence of multiple stressors. Our analysis is based on a 42-year (1972–2013) dataset from the Bay of Quinte for water quality through the food web to fishes. We employed a series of statistical tools that can offer insights into the structural changes induced by the events examined. We first used dynamic linear modelling to detect temporal trends in fish biomass, while accounting for year-to-year TP variability over three spatial segments of the bay. We then developed piecewise regression models to assess the extent to which specific ecological events induced distinct shifts in the fish assemblage. Multiple regression modelling was used to quantify the relative importance of TP, zooplankton, and surface water temperature on fish biomass. Based on gillnets, there were consistent fish biomass changes across the bay with increased biomass before P control (1972–1977), declines after P control followed by the establishment of a steady state or modest increase (1978–1994), and a declining trajectory during the recent period (1995–2013). Even when accounting for the role of water temperature and zooplankton, TP still had a significant effect on fish biomass. However, the strength and nature of the relationship varied among fish groups, and overall, the effect of TP on fish biomass has weakened in recent years. Our models show that fish biomass in the Bay of Quinte is shaped by the year-to-year TP variability. However, the relationship between P and fish abundance has been modulated by various ecological events with the consequence that the Bay of Quinte fish assemblage has changed and the food web now produces less fish biomass per unit of TP. A projected reduction of mean ambient TP levels from 30 to 25 μg/L, is expected to induce a 24% decline in total fish biomass, and further shift the fish assemblage with the biomass of planktivores and walleye declining by >60% and 30%, respectively. Recreational fishing provides important economic benefits in the Bay of Quinte, through tourism and other local business operations. Recognising the economic importance of fishing, our analysis provides critical insights regarding the on-going management efforts to reduce external nutrient loadings (point and non-point sources, urban storm water) and further lower ambient TP levels and primary productivity. The potential implications of already low nutrient concentrations for fish productivity represent a major challenge in effectively balancing water quality with fisheries management in the area. © 2019 The Authors.

Urbanization holds great public health implications spanning various environmental, lifestyle behavioural, economic and social domains. Underlying risk factors for mood disorders are heterogeneous but the psychiatric literature has extended beyond individual-level risk, to account for population-level environment and social-related precursors to mental ill health. This review summarizes recent studies published since 2017 examining the impact of urbanization and associated environmental, social and lifestyle risks for mood disorders, specifically depression.Recent findingsAll identified studies examined depression or subclinical mood-related symptomatology. Recent evidence suggests individuals residing in urban areas experience increased risk of depression. Mechanistic pathways include increased exposure to noise, light and air pollution, poor quality housing, reduced diet quality, physical inactivity, economic strain and diminished social networks. The role of the gut microbiome in the development of mood disorders represents a novel research domain expected to hold potential for the psychiatric and environmental field. Further research is needed to extrapolate the relationship between increased sedentary lifestyles and technology use and depression in urban societies.SummaryRecent evidence highlights the complexity and reciprocity of underlying driving factors in the relationship between urbanization and mood disorders. Future epidemiological research should continue to untangle such complexity. There was a dearth of evidence relating to urbanization and mood disorders other than depression. Future research should identify the unique experiences of vulnerable subgroups who experience disproportionate increased risk of adverse health experiences associated with urbanization. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Additionally, only twenty-two rice farmers were typically chosen as participants in the climate smart agriculture pilot program by local government and institutions. The choices for adaptation response and climate smart agriculture participation are significantly influenced by agricultural extension services, belief in climate change, the area of farming land, as well as geographical locations (e.g., province and access to water sources). The results also reveal that climate change adaptation response, including climate smart agriculture participation, played a crucial role in improving technical efficiency of rice production by 13%–14% compared to no adaptation response.

In contrast to prior studies, which rely on process-based life-cycle-analysis GHGE estimates from the literature for particular food items, we combine a diet model, an environmentally extended input-output model of energy use in the U.S. food system, and a biophysical model of land use for crops and livestock to estimate food system GHGE from the combustion of fossil fuels and from biogenic sources, including enteric fermentation, manure management, and soil management. We find that an omnivore diet that meets the DGA while constraining cost leaves food system GHGE essentially unchanged relative to the current baseline diet (985 000 000 tons of CO2 eq or 3191 kilograms of CO2 eq per capita per year), while a DGA-compliant vegetarian and a DGA-compliant omnivore diet that minimizes energy consumption in the food system reduce GHGE by 32% and 22%, respectively.

In many regions, emissions from the electric grid tend to peak during peak demand periods due to the dispatching of fossil-based generation. The design of buildings as distributed thermal storage units can act to diminish the peaks in the grid, reduce the overall CO 2 emissions from residential heating, increase the utilization of low-CO 2 technologies (nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, etc.…), while maintaining the thermal comfort of the occupants. This study is concerned with how thermal energy storage can be integrated into heat pump systems to improve demand flexibility, and ultimately allow the heating system to remain off during peak periods. Heat pumps tend to operate under a limited temperature range, which limits the energy storage density of water as a thermal storage medium. Phase change materials (PCM) can be used as thermal storage, and they benefit from the ability to maintain a high energy density under limited temperature conditions. The challenge is that PCMs have a relatively low thermal conductivity which can limit the rate of charging and discharging of the stored thermal energy. In the current state-of-the-art literature, there is no standard methodology to size PCM thermal energy storage units for heat pump systems. This study presents novel results that compare numerical and analytical predictions of a hybrid PCM-water thermal storage tank, and proposes a reduced analytical methodology for sizing PCM thermal storage tanks for heat pumps used for demand side management. System-level numerical simulations, considering the transient complexities of the melting and solidification process in a system environment, are compared against a simplified analytical predictions of thermal storage performance. Storage tanks containing 75% PCM modules of 2 cm thickness were able to reduce storage volume by over three-fold of water-only storage operating under a ΔT=10 °C. Peak periods ranging between 2 and 6 h in a residential household were sustained when the appropriate storage volume is used. Analytical methods for estimating the required volume are presented that ease the storage sizing and discuss the expected benefits and their limitation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Building energy storage; Demand side management; Heat pumps; Phase change materials; Residential heating; Thermal Energy Storage; TRNSYS","Carbon dioxide; Demand side management; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Housing; Pumps; Storage (materials); Storage management; Tanks (containers); Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Analytical methodology; Building energy; Heat pumps; Low thermal conductivity; Melting and solidification; Residential heating; Thermal storage performance; TRNSYS; Phase change materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062269188

Most of the earlier studies have studied the effects of pilot fuel quantity (herein referred as pilot quantity) on diesel engine combustion at fixed pilot and main injection timings. Hence, results obtained represent the combined effects of dwell and pilot quantity. Aim of the present study is to investigate the sole effect of pilot quantity on combustion and emission characteristics of a diesel engine at a fixed dwell using experimental and simulation tools. Pilot injection timing was adjusted in order to maintain a constant dwell between pilot and main injection with varying pilot quantity, while main injection timing was maintained constant during the study. Numerical investigations were also performed using Converge 3-D computational fluid dynamics tool. When pilot quantity was increased from 15 to 45%, smoke emissions were reduced by 25%, while nitric oxide (NO) emission and fuel consumption were increased by 20.8% and 2.52%, respectively. Greater amount of fuel participating in pre-mixed combustion proportion in case of larger pilot quantity led to overall lesser smoke emissions compared to smaller pilot quantity case. Numerical results confirmed that prime source of soot emissions in case of pilot injection mode is the main injected fuel. Higher NO emission in case of larger pilot quantity is mainly attributed to the presence of greater and wider high-temperature region (HTR) compared to smaller pilot quantity case. Increased fuel consumption with increasing pilot quantity is mainly due to deteriorated space utilization.

Uttar Pradesh can produce 71 Mt surplus biomass annually, equivalent to 7298 MW power. Power density of biomass range between 0.10 and 0.25 Wm -2 . Significant amount of GHG emissions reduction is possible if biomass replace fossil fuel as a power source in the region. Annual GHG emissions associated with 1 MWh of power derived from coal, natural gas and biomass would cause 4.10 × 10 −7 , 2.40 × 10 −7 and 1.25 × 10 −7 mK rise in global surface temperature, 100 years after an initial emission, indicating potential of biomass power to mitigate climate change. Variation in spatio-temporal distribution and low power density could be delimiting factors in large-scale deployment of biomass power. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Absolute global temperature change potential; Biomass assessment; Biomass power; Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Power density","Atmospheric temperature; Biomass; Density of gases; Emission control; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Surface properties; Biomass assessment; Biomass resources; Global surface temperature; Global temperature change; Large-scale deployment; Power densities; Power sources; Spatiotemporal distributions; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062719768

The study compared three digesters operated at the same target volatile solids (VS) loading rate of 5.5 kg VS/d-m3, but at different feed concentrations resulting in SRTs of 10, 15, and 18 days. Lowering the feed concentration decreased the digester total ammonia nitrogen concentrations which averaged 1,580, 2,610, and 3,080 mg (Formula presented.) -N/L for the 10-, 15-, and 18-day digesters. The VS reduction and methane yields were equivalent for the 15- and 18-day digesters and about 4% lower for the 10-day digester. Ammonia inhibition of the 18-day digester occurred early in the study, but the system acclimated over time. Feed dilution reduced the viscosity and the potential for volume expansion due to gas holdup and foaming. Practioner points: Feed dilution reduces digester ammonia concentrations and inhibition potential without sacrificing digester performance at lower SRTs. Feed dilution greatly reduces digester viscosity and associated issues with digester volume expansion due to gas holdup and foaming. Operating at the lower SRT does not impact cake solids after dewatering and substantially decreases polymer demand for conditioning. © 2018 Water Environment Federation","ammonia inhibition; anaerobic digestion; dewatering; thermal hydrolysis","Ammonia; Dewatering; Dilution; Expansion; Gas foaming; Hydrolysis; Viscosity; Ammonia concentrations; Ammonia inhibition; Anaerobic digester; Feed concentration; Solids retention time; Thermal hydrolysis; Total ammonia nitrogens; Volume expansion; Anaerobic digestion; ammonia; biogas; methane; nitrogen; oxygen; polymer; ammonia; anaerobic digestion; concentration (composition); dewatering; dilution; hydrolysis; inhibition; performance assessment; retention; solid; anaerobic digestion; Article; chemical oxygen demand; dewatering; dilution; effluent; foaming; hydrolysis; nitrogen concentration; pH; priority journal; quality control; rate constant; shear rate; solids retention time; steady state; temperature; viscosity; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; hydrolysis; metabolism; microbiology; temperature; Ammonia; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolysis; Temperature; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064969163

It argues that Earth system modeling is not simply a domain of science but also a form of politics. Earth system science carries the ideas and social and cultural norms of the peculiar historical eras in which it emerged and grew. Systems thinking and a strong belief in the power of modeling have its roots in the early Cold War era. When the Cold War era gave way to a time characterized by economic stagnation, social unrest, and rising environmentalism, climate science absorbed the new cultural trend of environmental concern, while retaining an optimism and enthusiasm in the modeling paradigm. The post-1990s era reveals particularly clearly the political power that climate scientists unleashed. The modeling paradigm assumed hegemonic status, seized economic and social processes, and created not only scientific knowledge but also conceptions of political management of the Earth. The modeling paradigm, once a scientific strategy largely in the hands of scientists, has turned into a political agent in its own right, beyond the full control of the scientific community. © 2019.

The import of hydrogen generated by means of CO2 free wind electricity from overseas can be a promising option for Japan's prospective energy supply. Besides different other factors like specific costs of electrolyzers and hydrogen shipment over long distances, the economically reasonable export of hydrogen based on renewable energy requires low levelized costs of electricity. Within the scope of this study, the underlying idea of a hydrogen supply chain is taken up and revisited by means of a spatially highly resolved wind energy potential analysis and a detailed investigation of the supply chain elements between Patagonia and Japan. Our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of the total land area in Patagonia would be eligible. Approx. 33,000 turbines with a minimum number of 4500 full-load hours with an overall capacity of about 115 GW can be positioned. Taking into consideration the related average number of 4750 full-load hours and an electrolysis efficiency of 0.7, this leads to a potential production of about 11.5 million tons/year of hydrogen. So the wind power potential of Patagonia would theoretically be sufficient for the assumed Japanese hydrogen demand of 8.83 million tons/year. The total hydrogen pretax cost would amount to approx. 4.40 €/kgH2 at a liquid state at the harbor of Yokohama. Hence, the final specific costs of hydrogen in Japan depend on the expansion of wind power in Patagonia and therefore hydrogen based on wind energy can be cost-competitive to conventional fuels. © 2018",,"Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Potential energy; Power markets; Supply chains; Wind power; Conventional fuel; Fukushima daiichi; Hydrogen supply chains; Potential production; Primary energies; Renewable energies; Techno-Economic analysis; Wind electricity; Hydrogen fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059811525

This effect can be explained by the strict selection rules that apply for radiative transitions in nonpolar structures without any polarization fields in the direction of quantization. The selection rule Δn=0 reduces the number of possible radiative transitions that involve higher quantized hole states. These states will get occupied towards room temperature for wider quantum wells due to the decrease in quantization energies. Since the effective masses are strongly different in the conduction and valence bands, the thermal population of higher states is imbalanced between electrons and holes. Applying a simple model in a nondegenerate limit, we can well describe the width dependence of the experimentally determined radiative rates. At room temperature, the decrease amounts to a factor of 2-4 for nonpolar quantum wells of 8nm thickness. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Quantum theory; Electrons and holes; III-nitride quantum wells; Nonpolar quantum wells; Nonpolar structures; Quantization energy; Quantum well structures; Radiative emissions; Radiative transitions; Semiconductor quantum wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078415652

It was observed that farmers' perceptions of the rainfall amount during the early, mid, and late monsoon periods were highly accurate, and they also accurately perceived summer temperature change, but less accuracy of perception was observed of the temperate changes of the winter and monsoon seasons. Access to weekly weather information, participation in agricultural trainings, farming experience, and education level of the farmer were the major factors determining the accuracy of perception in this study.

Knowledge and understanding of non-anthropogenic climate changes in previous geological eras may improve predictions about ongoing trends. In this context plant functional traits can be useful tools – the ecotype variations and plasticity of morphological, physiological and developmental traits may help to determine which plants or plant groups might overcome present severely and rapidly changing environmental conditions. The mechanisms behind these trait–environment relationships will be relevant e.g. for a more realistic modelling of biogeochemical cycles and species distributions. In this Special Issue topics addressed above will be discussed in detail, grouped into the following sections: (1) Paleoclimate and paleovegetation, (2) Plant Silica and phytoliths, (3) Environmental gradients and intraspecific trait variation, (4) Experimental approaches to test effects of climate change on plant performance and functional traits, (5) Selection of traits – from empirical correlations to mechanistic responses, (6) Responses of plant functional traits and vegetation to global warming.

There is no mechanism to force a country to comply with its own nationally determined contributions. This bottom-up approach builds on unilateral actions and yields a kind of carbon pricing, which is not necessarily identical across countries. As a consequence, these nationally determined climate policies have drawbacks in terms of carbon leakage and loss of competitiveness for firms producing in high carbon price countries. To reduce these negative effects, border adjustments (BAs) may be appropriate subsequent to more stringent environmental regulation. We model a three-stage game involving carbon price competition in the first stage, the introduction of BAs in the second stage and oligopolistic competition between firms in the third stage. Strategic trade theory suggests that the qualitative results about the optimal BA policy may vary with the underlying type of competition, namely Bertrand and Cournot competition. However, our results are similar for both types of competition. We conclude that BAs are suitable for supporting a more stringent environmental policy. Moreover, we find that anticipation of the implementation of BAs in the second stage yields higher average carbon prices in the first stage since high carbon price countries increase their carbon prices whereas the other countries partially offset. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Border adjustment; Carbon pricing; Environmental tax competition; International trade; Oligopolistic competition; Unilateral climate policy","Carbon; Climate change; Costs; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Fighter aircraft; III-V semiconductors; International trade; Border adjustment; Carbon pricing; Climate policy; Environmental taxes; Oligopolistic competition; Competition; border region; bottom-up approach; carbon emission; climate change; competitiveness; environmental economics; environmental policy; international agreement; international trade; pollution tax; pricing policy; regulatory approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046032432

Secondly, the higher the level of corporate governance is, the higher the level of carbon information disclosure will be; that is, when the board of directors is larger, the proportion of independent directors is higher, and the chairman and general manager positions are differentiated, the level of carbon information disclosure is higher. Furthermore, when listed companies are state-owned and in heavy pollution industries, the level of carbon information disclosure is higher; when the chairman and general manager are in the same position (lower governance level), the positive impact of government pressure on carbon disclosure is less significant, the positive impact of external pressure on carbon disclosure is less significant, and the positive interactive impact of government pressure and external pressure on carbon disclosure is less significant.

To this end, CSIB v1 (Canadian Sea-ice Biogeochemistry version 1), a new sea-ice biogeochemical model, has been developed and embedded into the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) modelling system. This model consists of a three-compartment (ice algae, nitrate, and ammonium) sea-ice ecosystem and a two-compartment (dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylsulfide) sea-ice sulfur cycle which are coupled to pelagic ecosystem and sulfur-cycle models at the sea-ice-ocean interface. In addition to biological and chemical sources and sinks, the model simulates the horizontal transport of biogeochemical state variables within sea ice through a one-way coupling to a dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice model (LIM2; the Louvain-la-Neuve Sea Ice Model version 2). The model results for 1979 (after a decadal spin-up) are presented and compared to observations and previous model studies for a brief discussion on the model performance. Furthermore, this paper provides discussion on technical aspects of implementing the sea-ice biogeochemistry and assesses the model sensitivity to (1) the temporal resolution of the snowfall forcing data, (2) the representation of light penetration through snow, (3) the horizontal transport of sea-ice biogeochemical state variables, and (4) light attenuation by ice algae. The sea-ice biogeochemical model has been developed within the generic framework of NEMO to facilitate its use within different configurations and domains, and can be adapted for use with other NEMO-based sub-models such as LIM3 (the Louvain-la-Neuve Sea Ice Model version 3) and PISCES (Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies). © Author(s) 2019.",,"biogeochemistry; ecological modeling; ice alga; ice cover; ice-ocean interaction; light attenuation; marine ecosystem; pelagic ecosystem; sea ice; sulfur cycle; Belgium; Louvain la Neuve; Walloon Brabant; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065829149

Plastic biogas digester is a popular type adopted by people due to its low cost and simplicity. The utilization of materials for digester fabrication, however, positively contributes to GHG emission. The purpose of this research is to evaluate GHG emission of household scale plastic biogas digester by using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The boundary system consists of fabrication of the digester, operation and maintenance, and utilization of the biogas. The research is conducted by making an inventory to collect related information on the quantity of materials utilized to construct a household size plastic biogas digester along with emission factor of each material. Other important parameters include biogas yield and its methane content. Emission reduction is calculated from LPG saving due biogas utilization to fuel kitchen stove. Result showed that a household size plastic tube biogas digester system potentially reduced GHG emission by 1400.78 kg CO2eq/year for a five years of service life time. The GHG emission (in kg CO2eq/year) is comprised of 59.11 for digester construction, 7.83 for biogas production, (-456.14 for biogas utilization, and -1011.58 for slurry digestate utilization. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biogas; Emission control; Life cycle; Liquefied petroleum gas; Regional planning; Renewable energy resources; Biogas digesters; Biogas production; Biogas utilization; Boundary systems; Emission reduction; Operation and maintenance; Renewable energy source; Service life time; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066319569

Most studies have been in environments with relatively high concentrations such as North America, Europe and Asia. Associations at the lower end of the concentration-response function are not well defined. Objectives: We assessed associations between all-cause mortality and exposure to annual average particulate matter &lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Sydney, Australia, where concentrations are relatively low. Methods: The ‘45 and Up Study’ comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort from the state of New South Wales, Australia with 266,969 participants linked to death registry data. We analyzed data for the participants who resided in Sydney at baseline questionnaire (n = 75,268). Exposures to long-term pollution were estimated using annual averages from a chemical transport model (PM2.5), and a satellite-based land-use regression model (NO2). Socio-demographic information was extracted from the baseline questionnaire. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate associations, while adjusting for covariates. Results: In our cohort mean annual PM2.5 was 4.5 μg/m3 and mean NO2 was 17.8 μg/m3. The mortality rate was 4.4% over the 7 years of follow up. Models that adjusted for individual-level and area-level risk factors resulted in a detrimental non statistically significant hazard ratio (HR) of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.98–1.12) per 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.98–1.07) per 5 μg/m3 increase in NO2. Conclusions: We found evidence that low-level air pollution exposure was associated with increased risk of mortality in this cohort of adults aged 45 years and over, even at the relatively low concentrations seen in Sydney. However, a clear determination of the association with mortality is difficult because the results were sensitive to some covariates. Our findings are supportive of emerging evidence that exposure to low levels of air pollution reduces life expectancy. © 2019 The Authors","All-cause mortality; Fine particulate matter; Gaseous pollutants; Low concentration; Survival model","Air pollution; Fog; Hazards; Land use; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Surveys; All-cause mortality; Fine particulate matter; Gaseous pollutants; Low concentrations; Survival model; Particles (particulate matter); nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); epidemiology; health impact; mortality; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; survival; adult; aged; air pollution; all cause mortality; Article; Australia; cohort analysis; concentration response; demography; female; human; long term exposure; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; mortality risk; particle size; priority journal; questionnaire; social status; suspended particulate matter; young adult; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; epidemiology; mortality; New South Wales; prospective study; risk assessment; very elderly; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; New South Wales; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062817698

Focusing on the emerging landscape of electricity regulation and e-mobility in the United Kingdom (UK), it examines how electricity grid ownership has become financialised, and why the economic assumptions that enabled this financialisation are being called into question. New technologies, such as smart electricity meters and electric vehicles, provide cities with new tools to tackle poor air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Electricity grids are key enabling infrastructures but the companies that run them do not get rewarded for improving air quality or tackling climate change. UK government regulation of electricity grids both enables financialisation and forecloses opportunities to manage the infrastructure for wider environmental and public benefit. Nonetheless, the addition of smart devices to this network – the ‘smart grid’ – opens up an opportunity for common ownership of the infrastructure. Transforming the smart grid into commons necessitates deep structural reform to the entire architecture of infrastructure regulation in the UK. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2018.","economic development; environment/sustainability; financialisation; governance; smart grid","air quality; economic conditions; economic development; electricity; emission; environmental economics; finance; governance approach; greenhouse gas; smart grid; urban area; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060226540

The ride-sharing system is a solution that can be developed to reduce the congestion because of the high amounts of the vehicle on the road. Taxi as an alternative transportation in an urban area can impose the ride-sharing system. Taxi-sharing aims to maximize the utilization of taxi capacity, thereby reduces the fare for passengers, increases the income for taxi operator, and reduces congestion, gas emission, as well as fuel consumption. In order to maximize the benefits of the taxi-sharing system usage, we need to optimize taxi routes and match requests that share taxi service. In this paper, we used a mixed integer programming problem as in Hosni et al (2014) to make a model of optimization of the taxi-sharing problem, then solved the problem by using a tabu search method. The experiments showed that the tabu search method could increase the income of taxi operator up to 10 - 14 %. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Integer programming; Tabu search; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; Mixed integer programming; Ride-sharing; Sharing systems; Tabu search method; Taxi operators; Taxi services; Urban areas; Taxicabs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067810385

Big data on urban dynamic traffic flow can be used to improve the economics and environmental impact of vehicle travel by effectively reducing fuel usage and pollution. In this study, a fuel consumption and emissions measurement model of vehicles coupled with a dynamic traffic network were established based on a large dataset of real-world vehicle experiments. This study improved upon the traditional Dijkstra algorithm used for path planning and then, the improved algorithm was combined with a vehicle fuel consumption and emissions measurement model. An optimal path simulation analysis was performed in MATLAB based on road networks generated by ArcGIS and different optimization targets were assessed including the shortest time, shortest distance, least fuel consumption, and lowest emissions. The results show that factors such as the road type and traffic environment at intersections can greatly affect fuel consumption and emissions. Large differences in path planning results were observed depending on the optimization target. The proposed economic and environmental protection model for vehicle path planning based on a dynamic traffic network can effectively reduce fuel consumption and emissions during travel, thus, providing a new method to improve urban environmental pollution in China. © 2019","Dynamic traffic; Path planning; Real-world experiments; Road traffic; Vehicle emissions","Fuels; Large dataset; MATLAB; Motion planning; Pollution; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Vehicles; Dijkstra algorithms; Dynamic traffic; Emissions measurements; Environmental pollutions; Real world experiment; Road traffic; Vehicle emission; Vehicle path planning; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; algorithm; experimental study; fuel consumption; optimization; planning method; traffic emission; traffic management; urban area; article; China; data analysis software; environmental protection; exhaust gas; simulation; travel; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061094705

As an elastic characterization Young's modulus (Y), Poison ratio (σ) and micro hardness (H) of these glasses are studied. These grades suggest that the prepared materials are mechanically hard and exhibiting covalently interlinked structure. Further these samples are characterized by various techniques such as differential thermal analysis, thermoluminiscence, optical absorption, photoluminescence, Ionic conductivity and dielectric dispersion. The thermoluminiscence grades such as peak temperature maximum (T m ), shape symmetry factor (μ sf ) and activation energies (E τ , E δ and E ω ) are studied at various UV irradiation levels. These results strongly recommended that the both electron and hole trap centers were created at the deeper trap levels and contribute higher orders of thermoluminiscence emission with in these glasses subjected to higher orders of temperature and UV irradiation. The various optical absorption and photoluminescence factor's such as, optical band gap (E o ), nephelauxetic ratio (β), emission cross section (Ω), branching ratio (ξ) and radiative life times (τ) are studied.

A number of ASTER image spectra and field spectra (resampled to ASTER bands)of pure dolomite and rock phosphate are compared and found to be consistent in terms of the presence of absorption minima at 2.3 µm for dolomite and the absence of the same feature in the spectra of the rock-phosphate. Before attempting spectral mapping, ASTER SWIR band data are clipped using the spatial extent of host rock; which has been prepared from the reference geological map and consequently updated using VNIR-SWIR derived image enhanced products at selected part of the study areas. Two sub-pixel spectral methods namely adaptive coherence estimator (ACE)and matched filtering (MF)methods are applied to ASTER SWIR bands to delineate rock-phosphate-rich zones within dolomite. The output images of the above algorithms are integrated in a principal component (PC)image to delineate phosphate pixels. A principal component; which has similar sign of Eigen vector loading for ACE and MF abundance image is used to delineate rock phosphate within dolomite. The results are validated in the field using a qualitative colorimetric method and also by comparing image spectra of spectrally anomalous zone with the ASTER resampled laboratory spectra of rock phosphate samples. A number of sporadic but important patches of phosphate rich zones in addition to the main surface exposures of the Jhamar Kotra Mine are confirmed in the field. The proposed method is a novel application of spectral mapping of phosphate deposits in dolomitic and carbonatic rocks and present approach of ASTER data processing can be used to delineate phosphate rich zones occurring within similar geological provinces in any parts of the world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive coherence estimator; Aravalli Province dolomite; ASTER; Match filtering; Rock phosphate; Spectral unmixing; Spectroscopy","Data handling; Geology; Image enhancement; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Photomapping; Pixels; Reflection; Spectroscopy; Adaptive coherence estimator; Aravalli Province dolomite; ASTER; Match filtering; Rock phosphate; Spectral unmixing; Rock products; algorithm; ASTER; dolomite; host rock; mapping; phosphate; Proterozoic; spectroscopy; India; Rajasthan; Udaipur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044924579

HERMESv3 is coded in Python and consists of a global regional module and a bottom up module that can be either combined or executed separately. In this contribution (Part 1) we describe the global regional module, a customizable emission processing system that calculates emissions from different sources, regions and pollutants on a userspecified global or regional grid. The user can flexibly define combinations of existing up-to-date global and regional emission inventories and apply country-specific scaling factors and masks. Each emission inventory is individually processed using user-defined vertical, temporal and speciation profiles that allow obtaining emission outputs compatible with multiple chemical mechanisms (e.g. Carbon-Bond 05). The selection and combination of emission inventories and databases is done through detailed configuration files providing the user with a widely applicable framework for designing, choosing and adjusting the emission modelling experiment without modifying the HERMESv3 source code. The generated emission fields have been successfully tested in different atmospheric chemistry models (i.e. CMAQ, WRFChem and NMMB-MONARCH) at multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. In a companion article (Part 2; Guevara et al., 2019) we describe the bottom up module, which estimates emissions at the source level (e.g. road link) combining state-of-the-art bottom-up methods with local activity and emission factors. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065999102

The goal of the study is to assess the energy and environmental impacts of different scenarios involving conventional and organic cultivations, plains and hills cultivations and involving different operating techniques. The study also aims at assessing the share of each life cycle step on the total of energy and environmental impacts. The functional unit chosen for the comparative analysis is a glass bottle of 0.75 L of extra virgin olive oil. A “from cradle to gate” perspective was chosen. The analysis was developed according to the LCA standards of the ISO 14040 series. The analysis is based on a field analysis developed in the last years in the province of Reggio Calabria between more than 50 enterprises and stakeholders of the field, representative of the whole Calabria region and of most southern Italy. The data used for the development of mass and energy balances are related to the years 2013–2015. The results clarify that for all indicators that the first part of the life cycle – from the production, including the growth of the olive plant to the full production stage – is the most relevant, variable between 80.6% share in the case of the particulate matter indicator to the 99.64% in the case of land use (Hill – Biological agriculture scenario).

In this study, we investigate the relationship between air pollution and residents’ health by nesting the household registration data of the China Migrant Dynamic Survey in 2014 with city characteristic data and pollution data. The results indicated that an increase in the concentration of air pollution significantly reduced residents’ health levels. After using the instrumental variable (IV)-Oprobit model to solve endogenous problem, we have found that the negative impact of air pollution on residents’ health remained significant. Moreover, the lag term of environmental indexes was introduced and found that air pollution significantly increased health risk. The results also demonstrated that the impact of air pollution on human health was heterogeneous. Men and urban residents were more sensitive to air pollution and more adversely affected. In addition to air pollution, the study found that, among the influencing factors at the individual level, males’ health was better than females’ health, and education positively impacted on residents’ health. The health effects were consistent with the theoretical predictions of the Grossman model. The financial expenditure and medical input were negatively correlated with residents’ health levels.

By rescinding incentives and subsidies and exposing RES to the market, they become responsible for accurate prediction of their production and become penalized for deviations from the announced forecasts.Moreover, the suppliers, or the aggregators, will play an important role in unlocking and encouraging the flexible end-consumers with installed local RES and demand response (DR).

We investigated, how these CO amounts might influence exhaled CO measurements used to monitor the smoking status of healthy subjects. Methods: A cross-sectional study of healthy adults living in areas of high air pollution (N = 742) and low air pollution (N = 197) in Poland. They completed a survey regarding their smoking habits and underwent necessary body measurements including exhaled CO concentration levels. Results: Ambient CO levels were much higher in highly pollutes cities. Also exhaled CO levels in subjects from high pollution areas were significantly higher, independent of subject smoking status (8.25 ppm vs. 3.26 ppm). Smokers exhaled more CO than non-smokers. Although the duration of smoking did not affect the CO levels, they were proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked during the day, especially for higher amounts of cigarettes and in unpolluted areas. It was possible to differentiate active from passive smokers in all areas, but the difference for passive smokers vs. non-smokers was significant only in low pollution city inhabitants. Conclusions: Exhaled CO levels were confirmed to be a good indicator of smoking status and smoking pattern in healthy subjects. However, high environmental CO levels both increase baseline exhaled CO concentrations in non-smokers affecting their discrimination from passive smokers, and obscure categorizing cigarette consumption in heavy smokers. These findings add important evidence on both understanding of exhaled CO monitoring results and a significance of environmental CO exposure in areas with high pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon monoxide; Cities; Cross-sectional studies; Pollution; Tobacco smoke","carbon monoxide; cigarette smoke; carbon monoxide; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; capital city; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); environmental assessment; environmental indicator; health status; measurement method; pollution monitoring; smoking; adult; air pollution; anthropometry; Article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; exhalation; female; human; male; priority journal; smoking habit; breath analysis; city; passive smoking; Poland; smoking; Poland [Central Europe]; Nicotiana tabacum; Adult; Air Pollution; Breath Tests; Carbon Monoxide; Cities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Poland; Smoking; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062009129

Traditionally, cities have treated climate mitigation and adaptation strategies in isolation, without addressing their potential synergies, conflicts or trade-offs. Recent studies have shown that this can lead to inefficiencies in urban planning, conflicting policy objectives and lost opportunities for synergistic actions. However, in the last few years, we have observed that cities are increasingly moving towards addressing both mitigation and adaptation in urban planning. Cities need to pay particular attention and understand the rationale of both policy objectives whilst considering the integration of the two policies in urban planning and decision-making. This study presents an analytical framework to evaluate the level of integration of climate mitigation and adaptation in cities’ local climate action plans. We tested this framework in nine selected major cities, representatives from all inhabited continents, which are frontrunners in climate action both in their regions and globally. We applied the framework in order to evaluate the level of mitigation and adaptation integration in cities’ CCAPs and further explored the different types of mitigation—adaptation interrelationships that have been considered. A scoring system was also devised in order to allow comparing and ranking of the different CCAPs for their level of integration of adaptation and mitigation.

We use system dynamics modeling to combine data from field experiments, crop modeling and choice experiments to explore the potential for adoption and diffusion of a sustainable agriculture technology in a risky environment with high variability in annual rainfall: the perennial management of pigeonpea in maize-based systems of Malawi. Production estimates from a crop model for the annual intercrop system and data from field experiments on ratooning for the perennial system provided the information to create a stochastic production model. Data from choice experiments posed by a farmer survey conducted in three Malawi districts provide the information for parameters on farmers’ preferences for the attributes of the perennial system. The perennial pigeonpea technology appeared clearly superior in scenarios where average values for maize yield and pigeonpea biomass production were held constant. Adoption was fastest in scenarios where relatively dry growing seasons showcased the benefits of the perennial system, suggesting that perennial management may be appropriate in marginal locations. The potential for adoption was reduced greatly when stochasticity in yields and seasons combine with significant social pressure to conform. The mechanism for this is that low yields suppress adoption and increase disadoption due to the dynamics of trust in the technology. This finding is not unique to perennial pigeonpea, but suggests that a critical factor in explaining low adoption rates of any new agricultural technology is the stochasticity in a technology's performance. Understanding how that stochasticity interacts with the social dynamics of learning skills and communicating trust is a critical feature for the successful deployment of sustainable agricultural technologies, and a novel finding of our study. © 2019 The Authors",,"alternative agriculture; assessment method; crop production; crop yield; farmers knowledge; growing season; legume; maize; perennial plant; risk assessment; technology adoption; Malawi; Cajanus cajan; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060674156

This work models the deployment of large, non-marginal quantities of energy storage and wind and solar power to determine their combined effects on grid system emissions. Two different grid environments are analyzed: a coal-heavy grid (Midcontinent ISO) and non-coal grid (New York ISO). An iterative dispatch model is used that operates storage to maximize income, considering that this operation can influence wholesale energy prices. With current low natural gas prices ($2.6 per MMBtu), adding storage slightly reduces carbon emissions in New York, while increasing them in the Midcontinent ISO (MISO). Storage increases carbon emissions when it enables a high emissions generator, such as a coal plant, to substitute for a cleaner plant, such as natural gas. We estimate that adding storage operated to maximize revenue in the MISO region will not be carbon neutral until wind or solar power reach around 18% of the generation capacity. Different operation patterns for storage could realize higher carbon reductions. For example, a carbon price on emissions from generators would shift operation to make energy storage carbon neutral even with current wind and solar capacities. Sensitivity analysis shows that a higher natural gas price ($5 per MMBtu) yields much higher storage-induced carbon emissions in both NYISO and MISO and storage in MISO will not be carbon neutral unless 35% of total generation capacity is from wind/solar. This illustrates that low cost, efficient natural gas generation is important to realize emissions reductions with storage under economic arbitrage. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","De-carbonize; Electricity grid; Emissions; Energy policy; Energy storage; Renewable energy; Solar; Wind","Carbon; Coal; Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy storage; Gas emissions; Natural gasoline plants; Particulate emissions; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Wind; De-carbonize; Electricity grids; Emissions reduction; Environmental outcome; Generation capacity; Renewable energies; Solar; Wind and solar power; Coal storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061796166

To understand the impacts of forestry in this region, we evaluated carbon emissions from felling, skidding, and hauling in five FSC-certified concessions where workers were trained in reduced-impact logging (RIL) and in four non-certified concessions where workers were not trained in RIL in Madre de Dios, Peru. Emissions estimates did not differ by certification status, so we established a single baseline for selective logging emissions. Total carbon emissions from selective logging were low per hectare (4.9–11.6 Mg ha −1 ) due to low logging intensities (2.9–8.1 m 3 ha −1 ). Despite the unique architecture of trees in the southwestern Amazon (short stems and large crowns), emissions per volume and per ton carbon in the extracted timber were also relatively low (1.55 Mg m −3 and 4.04 Mg Mg −1 , respectively). Only emissions per area scaled with logging intensity. Emissions were dominated by the felled tree itself (in extracted logs and residuals), whereas hauling infrastructure (roads and log landings) contributed comparatively little. Unintended emissions could be reduced by 46% if concessions were able to achieve the best demonstrated outcomes in each source category and by 54% with additional improvements. Less than 5% of timber was lost due to hollow sections. We determined that it would be overly cautious to avoid cutting all trees with any hollow sections, and it would actually increase emissions per unit timber extracted if no other trees were cut in place of the hollow trees. At the tree level, certified concessions had higher log recovery and damaged fewer commercial species during felling, which should increase their current and future timber yields.

One case is that of Chagas disease, which has triatomine bugs and Trypanosoma cruzi as vectors and parasite, respectively. This work aimed to determine: (i) the activity of the prophenoloxidase system (prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase activity, two indicators of immune ability) in three intestine regions (anterior midgut, posterior midgutand rectum) of the triatomine bug Meccus pallidipennis under three temperature conditions (20 °C, 30 °C and 34 °C) against two T. cruzi strains [ITRI/MX/14/CHIL (Chilpancingo) and ITRI/MX/12/MOR (Morelos)], and (ii) whether vector survival varies under these three temperatures after infection by these T. cruzi strains. Results: Our results indicate that prophenoloxidase activity was lower at higher temperatures, that the level of prophenoloxidase activity elicited by each strain was different (higher in Chilpancingo than in Morelos strains), and that prophenoloxidase activity was more intense in the anterior midgut than in the posterior midgut or rectum. Survival rates were lower in insects maintained at higher temperatures and infected by Chilpancingo strains. Conclusions: These results indicate that climate change could lead to lower prophenoloxidase activity and survival rates in triatomines when infected with different T. cruzi strains, which could reduce the vector capacity of M. pallidipennis. © 2019 The Author(s).","Climate change; Meccus pallidipennis; Phenoloxidase activity; Prophenoloxidase activity; Strains; Temperature; Trypanosoma cruzi","monophenol monooxygenase; oxidoreductase; prophenoloxidase; unclassified drug; catechol oxidase; enzyme precursor; pro-phenoloxidase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; CD-1 mouse; Chagas disease; climate change; controlled study; enzyme activity; female; immune response; incubation temperature; incubation time; male; Meccus pallidipennis; Mexico; midgut; mouse; nonhuman; nymph; prediction; rectum; survival rate; temperature dependence; Triatominae; Trypanosoma cruzi; Trypanosoma cruzi ITRI MX 12 Morelos; Trypanosoma cruzi ITRI MX 14 Chilpancingo; anatomy and histology; animal; enzymology; gastrointestinal tract; insect vector; metabolism; parasitology; physiology; temperature; Triatoma; Trypanosoma cruzi; Animals; Catechol Oxidase; Climate Change; Enzyme Precursors; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Insect Vectors; Male; Temperature; Triatoma; Trypanosoma cruzi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065492237

The paper also put forth a policy proposal that brings together electricity end-users, suppliers and government regulators with the goal of conveying an effective outcome that withstands output growth without necessarily compromising social and developmental objectives. Design/methodology/approach: Local sources of data were utilised in applying panel data analysis. The paper utilised the data from South Africa Reserve Bank and Quantec South Africa. The Hausman test indicated that the fixed effect estimator is the appropriate estimator for this paper. Robust estimators (such as Driscoll Kraay (SCC), feasible generalised least of squares, least square dummy variables and seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) were employed for consistent and efficient inferences. The study also utilised the SUR regression to analyse the impact of electricity prices on output at a sectoral level. Findings: The fixed effect estimator results of this paper indicate that electricity prices have a negative impact on sectoral output. Again, the SUR estimator shows that the sectoral output disparately responds to electricity prices change in South Africa over the period 1994–2015.Thus, six out of eight sectors significantly and negatively respond to electricity prices change in South Africa. The mining and the construction sectors seem not to be affected by electricity prices changes unlike agriculture, manufacturing, government services, transport and communication finance and trade. Research limitations/implications: Although the research has attained its aims, there were some inevitable limitations. For instance, unlike the time series and cross-sectional data, the panel data were tardily assembled, since the researchers had to gather data for specific variables for each and every selected individual sector. However, this did not compromise the research findings since the panel data from both developed and developing countries are available from sources such as Easy data Quantec. Practical implications: The results of the study show that electricity price is a limiting factor to the sectoral production growth in South Africa. Therefore, any conservation policies regarding energy or electricity should be implemented with caution. Indeed, the government should implement policies that increase energy and electricity supply in the country. Thus, the government should set affordable prices of electricity that benefits both the power and economic sector output. In addition, the electricity regulators should set prices that do not damage output across economic sectors in South Africa. Again, the government should continue supporting the imposition of subsidies on the economic sectors that are more sensitive to electricity price. To this end, the study provides a policy proposal (in line with the South African National Development Plan and the climatic change strategies) that connects electricity producers, government electricity regulators, consumers and the society with the goal of conveying an effective outcome that withstands output growth without necessarily compromising social and developmental objectives. Social implications: Cost-reflective electricity prices may be a burden to end users but this will assist in the maintenance and expansion of the power industry to get rid of electricity supply and demand imbalances which may escalate electricity prices in future. Indeed, the electricity end users including the society should pay a price that improves generation capacity to avoid power shortages since the lack of energy (electricity) contributes to poverty and deprivation and can contribute to economic decline. In this regard, the government should work hard to reduce the public resistance towards the cost-reflective electricity prices strategy; there is a need to keep the electricity end users informed on the economic impacts of such strategies in order for them to make informed choices. Originality/value: This paper utilised the panel data for sectoral analysis. Again, the study aimed to provide policymakers with more information on the behaviour of different sectors with regards to electricity price changes, and hence assisting regulators and policymakers in future decisions on electricity price changes in relation to output at sectoral levels. Better knowledge of the link between electricity prices and the real sector output should permit better regulatory decisions to facilitate economic efficiency. Furthermore, it helps the government to identify sectors in need of power subsidies to enhance economic development. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Electricity prices; Panel data; Sectoral output",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060140290

We assessed the viability and sustainability of using vineyard pruning residues, as wood chips, for energy conversion. Wood chips, obtained from vineyards in the Prosecco DOCG region (Italy), were characterized in terms of chemical composition, calorific value, ash content and humidity. Combustion tests were performed in a medium-size biomass boiler (maximum power 500 kW) to assess the viability of the approach in terms of sustainable steady-state combustion. Primary emissions of both macro- and micro-pollutants were measured to assess the environmental impact. An analytical method was purposely developed for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in three matrices: fly ashes, condensate and gas. The results showed that vineyard pruning residues can be used for energy conversion in medium- and large-scale biomass boilers. Primary emissions of measured pollutants were all below limit values set by current European legislation except for particulate matter, for which current available abatement technologies are required to contain emissions, thus making the use of vineyard pruning residues unsuitable for combustion in domestic appliances where such technologies are not installed. Bottom ashes produced during combustion were also characterized to assess whether they can be recycled in the vineyard as soil amendments/fertilizers. Copper content in combustion ashes exceeded limit values for ashes to be used as fertilizers in agricultural fields for some European countries but not for others, indicating that ashes may need to be disposed as waste. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Emissions; Persistent organic pollutants (POPs); Vineyard residues; Waste-derived fuel; Wood boiler","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Ash handling; Biomass; Boilers; Domestic appliances; Energy conversion; Fly ash; Particulate emissions; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Soils; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Wood products; Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxin (PCDDs); Polychlorinated dibenzofurans; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Renewable energy source; Vineyard residues; Waste derived fuels; Organic pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060856051

This paper addresses the hypotheses outlined in the preceding paper: 1) A whole-plant system of modal plant functional types (PFTs) based on a core set of functional traits can provide an improved alternative to PFTs and traits used so far in models of vegetation response to climate change; 2) Modal PFTs are more efficient indicators of vegetation response to climate change than individual traits; 3) Improved plant functional selection criteria can lead to improved parameters in Earth System and Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. Present-day (1975 centred) plant–climate relationships were analyzed within a global climatic framework of 1327 (200 m2) sample sites covering all major biomes. Five regions were selected for their range of bioclimatic gradients (arctic-boreal; cool temperate-subtropical; humid equatorial; hot, cold deserts). Biophysical site data were recorded along gradient oriented transects (gradsects) using a standard protocol that included all vascular plant taxa and modal PFTs. Regression, ordination and species distribution modeling were used to assess plant–climate indicator values against ten bioclimatic variables including extremes of contemporary thermal, light (energy) and moisture availability and estimates for ‘present’ (1975) and year 2100 climate scenarios. Modal PFTs and individual traits were highly correlated in differing patterns with bioclimate in each of the five regions in both climate scenarios with PFTs being the best predictors. Each of the three hypotheses is supported by these results, indicating that preference should be given to modal assemblages rather than individual traits as response parameters in predictive vegetation models. The indicators identified here are but one element of the highly complex array of other factors that influence vegetation response to terrestrial environmental change such as resource use, species acclimation, invasive species and human population pressure. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Bioclimate; Green stem photosynthesis; Leaf inclination; Leaf stomatal distribution; Modal PFTs; Plant–climate indicators; Species distribution modeling","bioindicator; climate change; ecological modeling; functional role; hypothesis testing; invasive species; light intensity; ordination; photosynthesis; population distribution; stem; stomata; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064743984

Here the aim is to examine the potential role of specific plant functional traits and their whole-plant syndromes (Plant Functional Types or PFTs as specific ‘modal’ trait assemblages) as indicators of vegetation response to climate change, past, present and future. Because plant functional characteristics have evolved through time, it is widely argued that models of vegetation performance under future climates should benefit from a study of plant response under previous climates. This paper presents an overview first, of developmental concepts underlying the current use of PFTs as indicators of plant response to environmental change, second, implications arising from species acclimation and third, process-based models used in reconstruction of vegetation under mainly Holocene environments but also with respect to present and future climates. In this regard the role of individual functional traits in ‘biomization’ procedures in vegetation response models is briefly discussed. It is concluded that, while PFTs possess limited indicator value at biome scale, uncertainties in the delimitation of local paleohabitats greatly restrict their use as indicators for paleovegetation reconstruction at community level. Emerging hypotheses are: 1) A whole-plant system of modal PFTs based on a novel set of functional traits can provide an improved alternative to PFTs and traits used in models of vegetation response to climate change, 2) Modal PFTs are potentially more efficient indicators of vegetation response to climate change than individual traits, 3) Improved plant functional selection criteria can lead to more efficient parameterization of Earth System and Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Bioclimate; Biomization; Climate change models; Gradsects; Green stem photosynthesis; Leaf inclination; Modal plant functional types; plant–climate indicators","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; bioclimatology; bioindicator; climate change; environmental change; functional role; Holocene; leaf; model; paleoecology; photosynthesis; trend analysis; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064218690

Given that a number of plans have been developed for different communities facing the same issues, it is timely to compare and contrast these plans. To this end a set of these coastal adaptation plans developed for Australian communities were compared in order to consider the variability in the recommended adaptation responses and general consistency of the plans. The adaptation responses proposed in the plans were also assessed for their ability to be implemented. Despite the similarity in the cities and towns considered in the analysis and the commonality of risk arising from sea level rise, no consistent set of adaptation recommendations arose that was common across the communities. This lack of consistency suggests a lack of understanding of the effectiveness and implement-ability of many of the proposed adaptation responses.

However, the costs, benefits and impacts of alternative crop types and irrigation practices is challenging to evaluate comprehensively. We present an assessment methodology to evaluate the sustainability of agricultural systems as applied to a southeastern U.S. river basin. We utilized detailed, crop-level cultivation information to calculate sustainability indicators (relative to well-water irrigation) at the basin scale (6-digit Hydrologic Unit Codes). 40 design configurations comprising crop types and irrigation practices were evaluated to demonstrate the methodology’s robustness. Four RWH designs and four major crops (pasture-grass, soybeans, corn, and cotton) resembling current practices were evaluated, as well as six combined systems (combined RWH and well-water systems) with four globally representative crops (corn, soybeans, wheat, and quinoa). Sustainability scores were calculated by integrating seven life cycle impact indicators (cumulative energy demand, CO 2 emission, blue water use, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, human health-cancer, and life cycle costs). At a basin-wide RWH adoption rate of 25%, the benefits, relative to 100% well-water, of the RWH systems irrigating soybeans and supported with well-water (0.4 well-water: 0.6 RWH) provided cumulative energy savings of 39 Peta Joule and reductions in CO 2 emission, blue water use, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, and human health-cancer at 1.9 Mt CO 2 eq., 6.9 Gm 3 , 5.7 MCTU, 6.6 kt N eq., and 0.07 CTU, respectively. These benefits increased linearly with RWH scaling variables including the adoption rates, system service life, crop area, and water needs. Our methodology integrates the three pillars of agricultural sustainability specific to rainwater harvesting into a single score.

Typically, site-specific geomorphological catchment characteristics are used for regionalization, while flood statistics are used to test the homogeneity of the identified regions. This paper presents the application and comparison of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) modelling tools for the estimation of catchment characteristics to provide an enhanced understanding of the linkage between geomorphological catchment characteristics and response time. It was evident that catchment response variability is not exclusively related to catchment area, but rather associated with the increasing spatial-temporal heterogeneity of other catchment characteristics as the catchment scale increases. In general, catchment and channel geomorphology overruled the impact that catchment variables might have on the response time and resulting runoff. Shorter response times and higher peak flows were evident in similar-sized catchments characterized by lower shape factors, circularity ratios, and shorter centroid distances and associated higher elongation ratios, drainage densities and steeper slopes. The GIS applications not only enabled the inclusion of a more diverse selection of catchment characteristics as opposed to when manual methods are used, but the high degree of association between the different GIS-based methods also confirmed their preferential use. © 2019 by the authors.","Catchment geomorphology; Catchment response time; Flood hydrology; Geographical information systems; Ungauged catchments","Floods; Geographic information systems; Geomorphology; Information systems; Information use; Landforms; Response time (computer systems); Runoff; Catchment characteristics; Catchment response; Catchment response time; Degree of association; Design flood estimation; Flood hydrology; Spatial temporals; Ungauged catchment; Catchments; catchment; flood; flood frequency; fluvial geomorphology; GIS; hydrological response; peak flow; runoff; spatiotemporal analysis; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066318536

This method is based on a standard floating chamber in which a well-defined carrier gas flows. The concentration of CH4 is measured continuously at the outlet of the chamber, and the flux is determined from a mass balance equation. The method was carefully tested in a laboratory and was subsequently applied to two lakes, in Mexico, with contrasting trophic states. We show here that the method allows for the continuous quantification of CH4 diffusive flux higher than 25 × 10-6 g m-2 h-1, the determination of ebullitive flux, and the individual characterization of bubbles larger than 1.50-1.72 mm in diameter. The method was also applied to determine carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). In that case, the method was less sensitive but allowed for the characterization of diffusive fluxes higher than 10 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 and of bubbles larger than 5.3-8.4 mm in diameter.

The average plate of food will travel over 2400 km before it reaches your plate. There is potential within District heating (DH) areas to move farming indoors and into the heart of the urban environment. Vertical hydroponic farming (VHF) offers many advantages over conventional farming including more efficient water and land use, and vastly reduced transport costs if it is performed in the urban area. For this model to become economically sustainable however, it must be intelligently integrated into existing urban infrastructure. A mutually beneficial relationship with DH is possible whereby VHFs are integrated to feed back into the DH system, lower the return temperature in line with 4th Generation District Heating guidelines, and reduce CO2 emissions in food and energy production. © 2019","4th Generation District Heating; CO2 reduction; Hydroponic farming; Plant factories; Smart energy; Vertical farming","Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Land use; Population statistics; Thermal processing (foods); Urban transportation; CO2 reduction; Hydroponic farming; Plant factory; Smart energies; Vertical farming; District heating; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; farming system; fossil fuel; heating; hydroponics; smart grid; urban area; urban growth; urban population; Sweden",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062734744

However, despite minimal impact of wind turbines on the environment, there is a negative side as well. Wind speed variations are a stochastic process, and it is difficult to predict wind power accurately. Therefore, unpredictable power can disbalance the power grid; besides, huge power reserves are necessary. Wind energy can be forecasted based on statistical, physical or hybrid methods and models. However, all methods and models generate power prediction errors during different time horizons. The paper presents an analysis of wind power prediction errors determining factors based on statistical, physical and hybrid approaches. Investigation revealed that combination of statistical methods – nonlinear regression, model output statistics, the most suitable power curve and wind speed correction methods – reduced wind power prediction errors up to 1.5%. A detailed evaluation of relief variations and surface roughness increased wind power accuracy by 2%. Considering the local conditions of the western part of Lithuania, the best suitable tool for a short-term wind power prediction is a hybrid model including a detailed description of topographical conditions and the most precise statistical methods. © Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2019.","Hybrid model; Physical approach; Statistical methods; Wind power forecasting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067554448

Such an approach, although increasingly promoted, remains only loosely defined and requires further development in order to effectively integrate different interventions at landscape level. In particular, it is important to understand the possible interactions between different landscape interventions at local level—where they are intended to have effect—and the challenges associated with them. Inspired by the complexity of policy mix analysis, this article seeks to shed light on these interactions by analysing how different policies and measures for reducing deforestation and degradation have played out in a jurisdiction with wide-ranging actors and interventions aimed at shaping their behaviour. Focusing on smallholders, we examine the Sustainable Landscapes Pilot Programme in São Félix do Xingu, looking at how different policies interact—categorising interactions as “complementary,” “mutually reinforcing” (synergistic), “in conflict,” “interdependent,” and/or “redundant”—and explain how proponents of this pilot programme seek to integrate them. Most analysis is based on primary data collected through quantitative (i.e., random stratified sampling and surveys) and qualitative (i.e., observation and focus groups) methods. The São Félix do Xingu case shows that understanding effects of different policies and measures on people's behaviour requires a deeper look at local perceptions and reactions to such policies and measures, something most studies on the topic have overlooked. Ultimately, the heterogeneity and complexity of social practices that permeate landscapes must be recognised in order to integrate diverse measures to reduce deforestation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","behaviour change; Brazilian Amazon; landscape approach; policyscape","climate change; deforestation; environmental policy; landscape; perception; smallholder; Amazonia; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062349806

Yet, there are few formal and robust quantification of such associations, which seriously impedes our capacity to predict how ecological systems respond to global changes, including climate. This study was designed to assess how differences in environmental conditions affect plant form and function in a wide array of species. Twelve traits were measured on 40 species in three Mediterranean sites differing in drought conditions. Some species being common among sites, 78 species belonging to four major Raunkiær life form categories were studied. These traits correspond to: (i) plant size: vegetative and maximum plant height, (ii) seed mass, (iii) leaf morpho-anatomical traits: leaf area, specific leaf area, dry matter content and thickness, (iv) leaf chemical composition: mass based nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon contents, and carbon isotopic fraction. On average, there was a shift in the phenotypic space towards more resource conservative and taller species in the drier sites. These changes were not always consistent for hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes on the one hand, and for phanerophytes on the other hand. This is interpreted as different species responding to different aspects of complex changes in environmental factors. Intraspecific trait variation differed among species, and was lower than interspecific variation. Changes in site-average trait values were therefore mostly driven by species turnover among sites. The traits selected do not respond strongly to the differences in environmental conditions however, resulting in a moderate shift in the phenotypic space between sites. We argue that traits more directly related to plant water economy should be considered for an improved description of plant phenotypic response to the environmental factors at stake. The implications for the prediction of plant responses to climate changes likely to occur in the Mediterranean Region are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Leaf traits; Life form; Multivariate functional space; Plant height; Seed mass; Water availability; Within-species trait variability","drought; dry matter; environmental conditions; environmental factor; height; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; leaf; multivariate analysis; plant; seed; water availability; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052071747

Objective: To examine whether decreasing regional air pollutants were associated with reduced incidence of childhood asthma. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multilevel longitudinal cohort drawn from 3 waves of the Southern California Children's Health Study over a period of air pollution decline. Each cohort was followed up from 4th to 12th grade (8 years): 1993-2001, 1996-2004, and 2006-2014. Final follow-up for these data was June 2014. Population-based recruitment was from public elementary schools. A total of 4140 children with no history of asthma and residing in 1 of 9 Children's Health Study communities at baseline were included. Exposures: Annual mean community-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter less than 10 μm (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in the baseline year for each of 3 cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prospectively identified incident asthma, collected via questionnaires during follow-up. Results: Among the 4140 children included in this study (mean [SD] age at baseline, 9.5 [0.6] years; 52.6% female [n = 2 179]; 58.6% white [n = 2273]; and 42.2% Hispanic [n = 1686]), 525 incident asthma cases were identified. For nitrogen dioxide, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for asthma was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71-0.90) for a median reduction of 4.3 parts per billion, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.83 cases per 100 person-years. For PM2.5, the IRR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67-0.98) for a median reduction of 8.1 μg/m3, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 1.53 cases per 100 person-years. For ozone, the IRR for asthma was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71-1.02) for a median reduction of 8.9 parts per billion, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.78 cases per 100 person-years. For PM10, the IRR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.82-1.07) for a median reduction of 4.0 μg/m3, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.46 cases per 100 person-years. Conclusions and Relevance: Among children in Southern California, decreases in ambient nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 between 1993 and 2014 were significantly associated with lower asthma incidence. There were no statistically significant associations for ozone or PM10.. © 2019 American Medical Association.

Harvest or recurrent biomass removal can act as a selective force. However, our understanding of how harvest and changes in climate can synergistically shape plant evolutionary strategies is limited. We used age-from-stage matrix modeling to investigate how chronic anthropogenic disturbance (severe foliage and bark harvest) affects age-specific mortality trajectories of a tropical tree, Khaya senegalensis in two contrasting climatic regions (dry versus moist) in West Africa. We then developed a stochastic model to test if changes in disturbance regime and the environmental conditions in which a cohort is born may alter stochastic age-specific mortality rates. The effect of harvest on age-specific mortality trajectories was modest and only noticeable in the moist region. Age-specific mortality trajectories differed significantly between regions. In the moist region, mortality rates decreased with age for the first 30 years of life to a minimum rate and then increased gradually after to reach an old age mortality plateau. In the dry region, mortality rates decreased with age to reach a plateau asymptotically. This difference in age-specific mortality trajectory is due to a greater delay in reaching reproductive size/age in the dry region.

To determine how the urban form and meteorology influence the air pollution distribution at a neighborhood scale (2 km*2 km), we performed a fine-scale investigation of a typical air pollutant (i.e., PM 2.5 ) by mobile measurements in two communities in the inner and outer cities of Shanghai, China. The PM 2.5 mass concentrations and potential impacting factors, such as PM 2.5 background levels, road networks, traffic volumes, meteorological parameters, building heights and land use types, were collected at a 10 m spatial resolution, and their relationships were analyzed using both a generalized additive model (GAM) and land use regression (LUR). The modeling results showed that the GAM outperformed LUR in both study areas, with a higher adjusted R 2 and a lower RMSE. The PM 2.5 was found to have drastic variations at the neighborhood scale, which was primarily driven by spatial patterns of the PM 2.5 background levels and traffic volumes. The GAM-based PM 2.5 concentration surface clearly disclosed the heterogeneous variation of the PM 2.5 mass concentrations in each community, and demonstrated the prominent influence from the nearby highway, especially in the central urban area. This study provides the first empirical evidence of the exposure heterogeneity of the air pollution on a neighborhood scale, which can assist planners and policymakers in evaluating planning strategies with a full consideration of reducing local air pollution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community; Generalized additive model; PM 2.5 exposure; Urban form","Additives; Land use; Motor transportation; Risk assessment; Urban planning; Air pollution distribution; Air pollution exposures; Community; Generalized additive model; Local air pollutions; Meteorological parameters; PM2.5 exposure; Urban form; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); neighborhood; particulate matter; pollution exposure; regression analysis; risk assessment; urban pollution; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063256371

Timely availability of reliable information on weather conditions, agro-advisories, and market information can help to minimize losses in agriculture. This paper presents a scientific and integrated approach to identify areas of high agriculture vulnerability to climate change and availability of ICT services for dissemination of CSA information in the vulnerable areas. This study was illustrated for India where the majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, and this sector is highly vulnerable to climate change. The study presents four regions: i) high agriculture vulnerability and low ICT services, ii) high agriculture vulnerability and high ICT services, iii) low agriculture vulnerability and low ICT services, and iv) low agriculture vulnerability and high ICT services. This methodology, which is simple, uses available data, and is easy to apply, can be useful to prioritize locations for climate-smart interventions, mode of CSA information dissemination using ICT services, and increase coverage of agro-ICT services through development of ICT services in the locations where climate change impact is high and ICT services are very low.

While the default fractional conversion parameter is constant in RSAS, the modified parameter has the form of an exponential function of temperature above the freezing level, whereas below the freezing, level it is kept constant. The model simulation indicates RSAS with modified conversion parameter (RSAS_mod) shows a better fidelity in capturing the mean monsoon features over the ISM region. The spatial distribution of precipitation shows notable improvement over the ISM region. Most of the global general circulation models has a tendency to grossly overestimate (underestimate) the convective (large-scale) rainfall over the ISM region, which has somewhat improved in RSAS_mod simulation. It is suggested that reduced rate of conversion of cloud condensate to convective precipitation above the freezing level leads to suppression of convective precipitation, which further increases the detrained moisture from the upper-level, resulting enhancement in large-scale precipitation. Further, improvement has been noted in outgoing longwave radiation, wind circulation, total cloud fraction, and dynamical and thermodynamical processes in RSAS_mod simulation. The modified conversion parameter helps in improving the feedback between moisture and convective processes through better lower tropospheric moistening. In addition to mean summer monsoon, the RSAS_mod indicates its potential in predicting an extreme rainfall event over Mumbai in high-resolution global forecast system at T1534 horizontal resolution. However, its fidelity needs to be further tested for more number of heavy rainfall events. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Here we use a novel diagnostic based on the observed warming of the land relative to the atmosphere during dry spells (relative warming rate, RWR) to assess ESMs. The ESMs show that RWR is well correlated with changes in the partition of surface energy between sensible and latent heat across dry spells. Therefore, comparisons between observed and simulated RWR reveal where models are unable to capture a realistic soil moisture-heat flux relationship. The results show that in general, models simulate dry spell ET dynamics well in arid zones while decreases in evaporative fraction appear excessive in some models in continental climate zones.

The inductive method was adopted from a case study and information was collected from primary and secondary sources. Based on the understanding of historical emissions, climate justice and global carbon budget, it is debated here whether LDCs should actually consent to everyone’s responsibilities even if they differ, since they have urgent needs to improve their development indexes, especially in terms of GDP and IDH. It is argued that the LDCs – whose historical contribution of emissions is around 0.4% of the total – should claim an increase in the share of the global carbon budget for economic and social development purposes. © 2019, Observare.

Vulnerability is a concept often employed in the context of climate change to identify risks and develop policy and adaptation measures that address current and projected impacts. However, it is situated in a broader social context, driven by factors such as land tenure and access, livelihood diversification, and empowerment, which single out historically marginalized groups like women. This paper applies a vulnerability framework to a case study of cocoa farming in the Central Region of Ghana, depicting not only the variety of factors contributing to climate change vulnerability but also different narratives on vulnerability that emerge based on a woman’s relation to cocoa production itself. The paper conveys how homogeneous representations of women farmers and the technical focus of climate-orientated policy interventions may threaten to further marginalize the most vulnerable and exacerbate existing inequalities. This has implications for both climate change policy design and implementation, as well as the broader social development agenda that has bearing on vulnerability. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Africa; agriculture; climate change; gender; vulnerability","agrometeorology; climate change; cocoa; conceptual framework; crop production; environmental policy; equity; farmers attitude; policy implementation; policy making; social development; vulnerability; womens status; Central Region [Ghana]; Ghana; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042939298

Traditionally, state highway agencies (SHAs) have focused on maximizing the condition of a pavement network or minimizing agency costs needed to keep the network at an acceptable physical and functional level of service. However, other objectives like minimizing the road user costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are seldom factored into the M&R decision-making process. In this paper, a mixed integer program that accounts for these three objectives is presented. The proposed model is then implemented on a subset network in Texas consisting of 100 pavement sections. The results demonstrate the Pareto-optimal relationships that exist between the road condition improvements, road user costs, and GHG emissions. Notably, there is a positive relationship between condition score improvements and the observed marginal GHG emissions from the case network implementation. Furthermore, this network's results indicate that GHG emissions from materials and construction contribute to the most significant proportion of the total estimated GHG emissions. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the observed trends in the network case examined and provide valuable insights concerning the impact of variability in the budget size. The principal contribution of this study is in providing an approach for highway decision-makers to perform trade-offs in road condition improvements, road user costs, and GHG emissions of alternate pavement M&R programs or policies. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R); Optimization; Pavement management; Road user costs","Budget control; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Highway administration; Highway planning; Integer programming; Motor transportation; Optimization; Pareto principle; Pavements; Sensitivity analysis; Conflicting objectives; Decision making process; Maintenance and rehabilitations; Mixed-integer programs; Pavement management; Road user costs; State highway agencies; Sustainable pavements; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060567766

Using a large-scale US emissions trading program as a case in point, we show how undifferentiated emissions trading can dominate the differentiated alternative when ex post abatement costs exceeded expectations.

Analyses of ocean heat transport tend to emphasize global-scale seawater pathways and concepts such as the great ocean conveyor belt. However, it is the divergence or convergence of heat transport within an oceanic region, rather than the origin or destination of seawater transiting through that region, that is most immediately relevant to Earth’s heat budget. Here we use a recent gridded estimate of ocean heat transport to reveal the net effect on Earth’s heat budget, the ‘effective’ ocean heat transport, by removing internal ocean heat loops that have obscured the interpretation of measurements. The result demonstrates the overwhelming predominance of the tropical Pacific, which exports four times as much heat as is imported in the Atlantic and Arctic. It also highlights the unique ability of the Atlantic and Indian oceans to transport heat across the Equator—Northward and Southward, respectively. However, effective inter-ocean heat transports are smaller than expected, suggesting that global-scale seawater pathways play only a minor role in Earth’s heat budget. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"convergence; global ocean; heat budget; heat transfer; seawater; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063771349

In the case of peacekeeping and climate diplomacy, South Korea's identity as an international actor has been dominated by practices of self-identification that position the country at the brink of advanced countries, aspiring to lead the rest of the world but with the overall objective to maintain national autonomy in a changing regional and global context.

Models can test how legumes can be used to meet environmental and production goals, but many models used to simulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from grasslands have either a poor representation of grass-legume mixtures and BNF, or poor validation of these features. Our objective is to examine how such systems are currently represented in two process-based biogeochemical models, APSIM and DayCent, when compared against an experimental dataset with different grass-legume mixtures at three nitrogen (N) fertiliser rates. Here, we propose a novel approach for coupling DayCent, a single species model to APSIM, a multi-species model, to increase the capability of DayCent when representing a range of grass-legume fractions. While dependent on specific assumptions, both models can capture the key aspects of the grass-legume growth, including biomass production and BNF and to correctly simulate the interactions between changing legume and grass fractions, particularly mixtures with a high clover fraction. Our work suggests that single species models should not be used for grass-legume mixtures beyond about 30% legume content, unless using a similar approach to that adopted here. © 2019","Model validation; Nitrogen uptake; Overyielding; Species composition","biomass; community composition; complexity; crop yield; fertilizer application; grass; greenhouse gas; growth; legume; model validation; modeling; nitrogen fixation; nitrous oxide; nutrient uptake; Trifolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063964203

In line with current dietary guidelines, mycoprotein is high in protein and fiber, and low in fat, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar. Mycoprotein may help maintain healthy blood cholesterol levels, promote muscle synthesis, control glucose and insulin levels, and increase satiety. It is possible that some susceptible consumers will become sensitized, and subsequently develop a specific allergy. However, a systematic evidence review indicates that incidence of allergic reactions remains exceptionally low.

Both decades had similar global-mean anthropogenic aerosol optical depths but substantially different global distributions. For both years, we quantify (i) the forcing spread due to modelinternal variability and (ii) the forcing spread among models. Our assessment is based on new ensembles of atmosphereonly simulations with five state-of-the-art Earth system models. Four of these models will be used in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6; Eyring et al., 2016). Here, the complexity of the anthropogenic aerosol has been reduced in the participating models. In all our simulations, we prescribe the same patterns of the anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and associated effects on the cloud droplet number concentration. We calculate the instantaneous radiative forcing (RF) and the effective radiative forcing (ERF). Their difference defines the net contribution from rapid adjustments. Our simulations show a model spread in ERF from-0:4 to-0:9 W m-2. The standard deviation in annual ERF is 0.3 W m-2, based on 180 individual estimates from each participating model. This result implies that identifying the model spread in ERF due to systematic differences requires averaging over a sufficiently large number of years. Moreover, we find almost identical ERFs for the mid-1970s and mid-2000s for individual models, although there are major model differences in natural aerosols and clouds. The modelensemble mean ERF is-0:54 W m-2 for the pre-industrial era to the mid-1970s and-0:59 W m-2 for the pre-industrial era to the mid-2000s. Our result suggests that comparing ERF changes between two observable periods rather than absolute magnitudes relative to a poorly constrained preindustrial state might provide a better test for a model's ability to represent transient climate changes. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; anthropogenic source; climate modeling; cloud droplet; CMIP; complexity; estimation method; optical depth; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066036570

In particular, the progressive shift from traditional vehicles to EVs is considered as one of the key measures to achieve the objective of a significant reduction in the emission of pollutants, especially in urban areas. One of the major problem to be solved to make EVs a viable solution for the sustainable mobility is the development of effective facilities for vehicles. In this context, besides to technological aspects, one of the most important issues is the definition of fair and efficient policies for the sequencing and scheduling of the vehicle charging. In fact, scheduling problems are widely recognized as representing one of the most challenging class of optimization problems. Besides, the additional presence of specific features concerning vehicle charging systems (like controllable execution times, presence of intermittent energy sources, etc.) make even more difficult the vehicle charging problem. In this framework, despite the fact that optimization problems regarding energy systems are generally considered within a discrete-time setting, in this paper a discrete event approach is proposed. The reasons for this choice are essentially two. The first one is the necessity of containing the number of the decision variables, which grows beyond reasonable values when a small-time discretization step is chosen. The second is the impossibility of an accurate tracking of process and events using a discrete-time approach. The considered optimization problem regards the charging of a series of vehicles by a charging station that is integrated in a microgrid. Such a microgrid includes also renewable and traditional energy sources, storage systems and a local load. The objective function to be minimized results from the weighted sum of the (net) cost for purchasing energy from the external grid, the cost related to the use of fossil fuels, and the overall tardiness of the services provided to the customers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a real case study. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete event control; Electric vehicles; Microgrids; Optimization; Scheduling","Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Optimization; Scheduling; Discrete event control; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Intermittent energy source; Micro grid; Optimization problems; Sequencing and scheduling; Sustainable mobility; Technological aspects; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062731127

A classification of the materials has been done considering the importance of each of them. To obtain a complete overview of the problem, different criteria have been compared: the cost, the scarcity of the material and the affections these materials can cause not only to the environment but also to the humans. This classification has been used to identify which are the most critical materials. Moreover, other transversal issues have been studied as the regulations that apply to FCH technologies from a paneuropean perspective and the strategies to face the end-of-life of this equipment.

For this reason among others (noises, traffic congestion i.e.), the percentage of emissions caused by transport, that supposes adverse effects on human health and/or the environment, represents one of the greatest challenges facing the large cities in the world. In this sense, the rebirth of the electric powertrain seems to be a feasible solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and local pollutant concentration. But there exist some problems regarding battery electric vehicles, because the use of this type of motorization is inevitably linked to the upstream emissions caused by the generation of the energy needed to fill their batteries. These variations should be reflected on the greenhouse gas emissions inventories with a double purpose: design strategies and, once implemented, confirm the effectiveness and compliance of the improvements.

Here we developed back-propagation neural network (BPNN) ensembles to forecast the daily fire pixel counts in Southern China during the month of January. The BPNN ensembles were trained using daily assimilated surface meteorological data (including air temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and winds) and daily fire pixel observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the month of January during the years 2003–2012. We showed that the BPNN ensembles successfully forecasted the day-to-day variability and the interannual variability of fire pixel counts over Southern China in January of the years 2013–2015, with correlation coefficients of 0.6–0.8 against the MODIS observations. We used the forecasted daily fire pixel counts in January 2014 and January 2015 to scale the climatological January biomass burning emissions from the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) and applied the resulting forecasted daily biomass burning emissions to drive the WRF-Chem regional air quality model. The use of BPNN-ensemble-forecasted daily biomass burning pollutant emissions led to significant improvements in the daily forecasts of PM2.5 concentrations in Southern China for January 2014, with the mean bias of the simulated surface PM2.5 concentrations reduced from −9.1% to −1.2%. We repeated the sensitivity simulations for January 2015 and also found a modest improvement when using the forecasted daily biomass burning pollutant emissions (mean bias of the simulated surface PM2.5 concentrations reduced from −5.8% to −2%). Our approach can be applied to other source regions of biomass burning emissions to improve the accuracy of daily air quality forecasts. © 2019 The Author(s)","Back-propagation neural network; Biomass burning; Crop residue burning; Fire emission forecast; PM2.5","Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Backpropagation; Biomass; Crops; Digital storage; Fires; Meteorology; Neural networks; Pixels; Radiometers; Torsional stress; Back propagation neural networks; Biomass-burning; Crop residue burning; Fire emissions; PM2.5; Forecasting; air quality; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; back propagation; biomass burning; crop residue; emission; forecasting method; MODIS; particulate matter; pixel; prediction; air pollutant; air pressure; air quality; air temperature; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation; biomass; China; concentration (parameter); forest fire; humidity; particulate matter; plant residue; priority journal; wind; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061995561

I explored the spatial patterns of tropical and temperate plant diversity in Northwest Yunnan and their primary determinants. Generalized linear models (GLMs)and variance partitioning were used to investigate the influences of predictors. Temperate genus diversity significantly increased with latitude, whereas tropical genus diversity did not show any obvious latitudinal trends. Proportions of tropical genera decreased with latitude, whereas those of temperate genera were on the contrary. Environment heterogeneity explained higher percentage of the spatial variation of temperate genus diversity than for that of tropical genus diversity. It may imply that the influence of environment heterogeneity on plant diversity may depend on the taxa's biogeographic affinities, which might modify the exploitation of environment heterogeneity, though the flora diversification induced by the uplifting of the Tibet Plateau may also play important roles. Climate predictors explained higher percentages of variation in the proportions of tropical genera than for the variations in tropical genus diversity. It may suggest that compared with the associations between genus diversity with tropical affinities and climatic conditions, the associations between the proportions of tropical plants and climatic conditions might more accurately reflect niche conservatism of tropical plants in the study area. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Biogeographical affinities; Climate predictors; Environment heterogeneity; Human activities; Northwest Yunnan; Seed plant diversity","biogeography; climate conditions; climate prediction; heterogeneity; human activity; plant community; seed; spatial analysis; spatial variation; species diversity; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Yunnan; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065476568

The societal benefits of large-scale adoption of EVs cannot be realized without adequate deployment of publicly accessible charging stations. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the optimal network of charging stations for a community, considering uncertainties in the arrival and dwell times of vehicles, the state of charge of arriving vehicles' batteries, drivers' walking ranges and charging preferences, demand during weekdays and weekends, and the community's rate of EV adoption. We conducted studies using the sample average approximation method, which asymptotically converges to an optimal solution for a two-stage stochastic problem. However, this method is computationally expensive for large-scale instances. Therefore, we also developed a heuristic to produce nearly optimal solutions quickly for our data instances. We conducted computational experiments using various publicly available data sources and evaluated the benefits of the solutions for a given community, both quantitatively and qualitatively. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","charging network; electric vehicle; sample average approximation; Two-stage stochastic programming","Electric vehicles; Energy security; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mathematical programming; Optimal systems; Random processes; Solar cells; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Sample average approximation; Two-stage stochastic programming; Uncertainty; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048877031

In striving to fulfill the Paris Agreement, China has announced its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) aimed at reducing its carbon dioxide (CO2) emission intensity by 60–65% in 2030 against the level of 2005. However, China's INDCs cannot be fulfilled without formulating appropriate schemes for the allocation of carbon emission allowance (CEA) at sub-national scales. To help close the gap in our knowledge, this paper starts with measuring the overall CEA of China by 2030, and then proposes a science-based scheme for CEA allocation by developing an improved zero sum gains-data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA) model. It demonstrates that the final CEA of some northern provinces can be cut down as compared to their initial shares and, conversely, most southern provinces experience an increase in their CEA. Comparing the final share of CEA by province with current carbon emissions, we observe that provinces with abundant energy reserves, such as Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, tend to be operating in a state of overshoot in terms of space for carbon emissions (SCE). In contrast, there remains SCE when it comes to Guangdong, Hunan, Fujian, etc. The remaining provinces, such as Heilongjiang, Hebei and Ningxia, are close to the break-even point. In view of the differing SCE of individual provinces, common but differentiated policies for CO2 emission control would be the key to achieving China's INDCs. The research findings lay a scientific basis for the Chinese government to make its INDCs come true through inter-provincial collaboration on emission reduction, but also serve as a reference for fueling further scientific discussions and development of schemes for the allocation of responsibility for carbon emissions at multiple scales within and beyond China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission allowance (CEA); Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs); Multi-criteria allocation; Paris Agreement; Space for carbon emissions (SCE); Zero sum gains-data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA)","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Chinese Government; Emission reduction; Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs); Multi-criteria; Scientific basis; Zero sums; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; multicriteria analysis; pollution policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062729871

In this work, the photophysical properties of eleven TADF molecules are theoretically investigated, which are composed of 9,10-dihydro-10-phenylacridine as an electron donor and various electron acceptor units based on spiro donor-acceptor structure as well as adopting the indene-carbazole unit as the bridging body. Two new proposed calculation methods are applied. The method of overlapping integral and ΔEst, is used to screen efficient TADF molecules, and the optimal Hartree-Fock method is adopted to investigate the excited state properties for promising TADF molecules. Results show that different substituents in the indene-carbazole unit are distinctive in modulating the singlet-triplet energy gaps and the emission colors. Moreover, two promising TADF molecules with purple and blue emission are detected and the performances of emitting molecules in host matrix are theoretically investigated. Remarkable spectral overlap between host emission and guest absorption can be found and efficient energy transfer from host to guest is expected. Furthermore, the charge transfer properties are revealed based on Marcus equation, excellent hole and electron transfer properties are detected, which are comparable with these experimental detected molecules.

Using a surface directed vapor phase reaction, at relatively low temperature, we show that a highly reactive and volatile molecule can be used to selectively reduce the interface, without changing the bulk of the treated material, and without the need of alternating sequence of multiple precursors, normally involved in ALD. The model system we use to demonstrate the efficacy, and potential of our approach is trimethyl aluminum, and high energy Li and Mn rich cathode (HE-NCM)as the functional material of interest. We demonstrate that with the proposed method, the particles of HE-NMC were conformally coated with ~ 3 nm amorphous layer of the reduced surface in less than 1 h (including the cooling time),as witnessed using HR-TEM. XPS and solid-state NMR, further confirmed that surface treatment was successfully achieved using the proposed method and is well explained by DFT calculations. Utilizing online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS), we show in-operando that this amorphous layer helps to suppress parasitic reactions under extreme electrochemical conditions as indicated by the significant reduction in oxygen and CO2 evolution.

Without energy sources, it is impossible for any country to produce, transport and transform products for general human activities. Togo, a country of West Africa, is a net importer of petroleum products and produces only 40% of its electrical energy requirements. At the level of rural electrification, the rate of access to electricity is 6.3% in 2016. Although Togo is a country with a high potential for bioenergy and solar energy production. Hybrid photovoltaic/biodiesel systems (PV/BG) could therefore contribute to reducing the country's energy dependence and increasing the rate of access to electricity in rural areas while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This research presents the economic viability of a hybrid system (PV/BG from Jatropha Curcas) for the electrification of a village in the central region of northern Togo. The main objective of this research is to propose a model of electric energy production system in rural areas from renewable sources at a low operating cost while ensuring positive socio-economic impacts for the inhabitants of the environment. The analysis and optimization of the techno-economic performance of the proposed hybrid system is done using the hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER). The simulations has been carried out under various climate conditions and fuel price used as sensitivity variables. This research has proven that despite the high cost of biodiesel produced from Jatropha Curcas (1.6 USD/ litter) the hybrid (PV/biodiesel) system proposed for the production of electric energy in rural Togo is very economical. The electricity produced by the proposed system under various climate condition is always less than 0.21 USD/kWh with a capacity shortage of about 0.0999%, economical than the electricity produced by the largest thermal power plant of the country (ContourGlobal) which electricity costs 0.3 USD/kWh. The results shows that the proposed system can contribute in a sustainable way to the improvement of the economic and social conditions of the inhabitants of rural areas. © BEIESP.","Biodiesel; HOMER; Hybrid system; Jatropha curcas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067947868

Its usage in biogas production is an environmentally beneficial way not only to reduce these impacts, but also to produce energy and biofertilizers. Although manure has low energy value and low biogas conversion efficiency, it is indicated for use in co-digestion with other substrates to produce biogas. The present work provides a systematic review of studies that have analyzed the production cycle of biogas from manure around the world, to detect and compare the critical points of the life cycle assessment (LCA) steps defined by the International Standardization Organization (ISO), as well as the biogas process steps. The critical points related to LCA structure in the analyzed articles involve the different boundaries considered, since the initial stage varies from one that considers only the input of raw material in the digestion process, to the one that considers the upstream steps to obtain the substrate. Despite this, the comparison of LCA structure in the analyzed articles is possible, since the ISO standards contain well-defined parameters and steps. The critical points in biogas production processes involve different variables in regional case studies, such as climate, raw material availability, transportation distance, source of inputs and energy, plant location and technological development level, hindering comparison between studies. In relation to the level of technologies, no details of industrial steps were observed in the LCA studies of manure biogas. In spite of the difficulty, comparison between stages is developed in this work to allow careful evaluation of critical points and environmental impacts, and consequently to help establish regional sustainability strategies for the production of biogas from manure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Life cycle assessment; Literature review; Manure","Agriculture; Biogas; Fertilizers; ISO Standards; Location; Manures; Materials handling; Substrates; Sustainable development; Environmental burdens; International standardization organization; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Literature reviews; Material availability; Regional sustainability; Technological development; Transportation distance; Life cycle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062150892

It is found that a Co adatom can be effectively stabilized over a mono- or di-vacancy defective nitrogen-doped graphene due to strong hybridization between the Co-3d and N-2p states near the Fermi level. The high energy barrier for the diffusion of Co atom suggests that the resulting structures are stable enough to be used in the hydrogenation of CO 2 . Our results indicate the Co atom incorporated over a mono-vacancy defective nitrogen-doped graphene (CoN 3 -Gr) has a large tendency to activate H 2 and CO 2 molecules due to localization of a relative large positive charge on the Co atom. The hydrogenation of CO 2 over CoN 3 -Gr starts with the coadsorption of H 2 and CO 2 , followed by the formation of a formate (HCOO) intermediate. This needs an activation energy of 0.31 eV, which indicates it can easily proceed at ambient temperature. In the next step, the HCOO moiety is converted to HCOOH by overcoming an energy barrier of 0.51 eV. Our results indicate that the formation of side products, i.e. CO and H 2 O, is almost impossible or proceeds with great difficulty due to the corresponding large activation energy. The results of this study suggest that CoN 3 -Gr can be regarded as a highly active and promising catalyst for hydrogenation of CO 2 at room temperature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Catalysis; CO 2 reduction; DFT; Doping; Graphene","Activation energy; Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Defects; Density functional theory; Doping (additives); Energy barriers; Formic acid; Graphene; Hydrogenation; Molecules; Nitrogen; Catalytic hydrogenation; Co-adsorption; CO2 reduction; Dispersion-corrected density functional; High-energy barriers; Nitrogen doped graphene; Positive charges; Side products; Cobalt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059369077

Proposals for this type of housing stock of current energy retrofitting policies, based on standardized user patterns, will only contribute to increasing the ‘performance gap’ between real and estimated consumption. This study evaluates the thermal comfort conditions and energy consumption in the specific case of social housing in southern Spain, under a severe summer climate. This evaluation is based on in-situ data measurements of three housing units in use. This paper aims to test which adaptive comfort models work best in the specific conditions of the case studies and to identify the user behaviours which reduce thermal comfort. Thus, real user patterns were established and measured data were analysed. The results show that the case studies are in discomfort conditions during a high percentage of occupied hours, mainly due to the severe climate and the unsuitable use of passive measures including natural night-time ventilation and solar protection. This situation worsens with limited use of local cooling systems due to financial constraints.

A typical Nigerian rural community – Lade II in Kwara State was used as a case study where the energy demand for the residential and commercial loads was 2.5MWh/day and 171kWh/day respectively. The optimized HMS results from HOMER comprising of a solar photovoltaic (PV) array (1.5MW), diesel generators (350kW) and battery storage (1200 units) has a combined least net present cost of $4,909,206 and a levelized electricity tariff of $0.396 per kWh. Contrasting the HMS with a diesel-only system for the community, an approximate 97% reduction in all pollutant emissions was observed. Furthermore, fluctuations in diesel fuel prices, variations in average solar insolation, and variations in the solar PV's capital/replacement costs were utilized in conducting a sensitivity analysis for the HMS. The capacity outage probability table (COPT) was utilized in validating the reliability of the simulation results obtained from HOMER. The HMS was observed to experience a load loss of 0.769MW, 0.594MW &amp; 0.419MW when zero, one and two diesel generator(s) respectively were operational for all of the Solar PV's and Batteries being off-line.

Among them, the amino acid sequence of predicted rabbit DHRS11 shares 92% identity with that of human DHRS11 and matches peptide sequences (composed of total 87 amino acids) of rabbit heart acetohexamide reductase (RHAR) previously reported. However, the physiological role of RHAR remains unknown, because its known substrates are only acetohexamide and 1,4-naphthoquinone. To elucidate whether the two rabbit enzymes are identical, we have isolated the cDNA for rabbit DHRS11, which was abundantly detected in the brain, heart, kidney and intestine by RT-PCR. The recombinant rabbit DHRS11 reduced acetohexamide and 1,4-naphthoquinone, and was inhibited by tolbutamide and phenobarbital (RHAR-specific inhibitors), demonstrating its identity with RHAR. Rabbit DHRS11 also reduced α-dicarbonyl compounds, aldehydes and aromatic ketones (acetylbenzenes and acetylpyridines), and exhibited 3(17)β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. It was competitively inhibited not only by tolbutamide and phenobarbital, but also more potently by several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac and sulindac. The broad substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity were different from those of human DHRS11, which did not reduce aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic ketones despite its higher 3(17)β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, and was insensitive to tolbutamide, phenobarbital and diclofenac. The site-directed mutagenesis of Thr163 and Val200 in human DHRS11 to the corresponding residues (Gly and Leu, respectively) in rabbit DHRS11 suggested that these residues are pertinent to the differences in properties of rabbit and human DHRS11s. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","3(17)β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; Acetohexamide; DHRS11; Phenobarbital; Rabbit; Substrate-binding residue","1,4 naphthoquinone; acetohexamide; acetohexamide reductase; acetophenone; complementary DNA; DHRS11 protein; diclofenac; hydroxyhexamide; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; oxidoreductase; phenobarbital; recombinant protein; sulindac; threonine; tolbutamide; unclassified drug; valine; acetohexamide; acetohexamide reductase; alcohol dehydrogenase; DHRS11 protein, human; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; Article; controlled study; DNA isolation; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme specificity; molecular cloning; oxidation kinetics; protein localization; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity analysis; site directed mutagenesis; steroid metabolism; amino acid sequence; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cardiac muscle; chemistry; enzyme active site; enzyme specificity; enzymology; genetics; human; kinetics; Leporidae; male; metabolism; mutagenesis; sequence alignment; 17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Acetohexamide; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Catalytic Domain; Diclofenac; Humans; Kinetics; Male; Mutagenesis; Myocardium; Phenobarbital; Rabbits; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Substrate Specificity; Tolbutamide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063455103

Here we begin the process of quantification for associated climate flux implications. A low dimensionality (planar) equation of state is invoked at the global scale as our main analysis tool. For the reader's convenience, fundamental surfactant physical chemistry principles are reviewed first, as they pertain to tangential forces that may alter oceanic eddy, ripple, and bubble fields. A model Prandtl (neutral) wind stress regime is defined for demonstration purposes. It is given the usual dependence on roughness, but then in turn on the tension reduction quantity known as surface pressure. This captures the main net influences of biology and detrital organics on global microlayer physics. Based on well-established surrogate species, tangent pressures are related to distributed ecodynamics as reflected by the current marine systems science knowledge base. Reductions to momentum and related heat-vapor exchange plus gas and salt transfer are estimated and placed on a coarse biogeographic grid. High primary production situations appear to strongly control all types of transfer, whether seasonally or regionally. Classic chemical oceanographic data on boundary state composition and behaviors are well reproduced, and there is a high degree of consistency with conventional micrometeorological wisdom. But although our initial best guesses are quite revealing, coordinated laboratory and field experiments will be required to confirm the broad hypotheses even partially. We note that if the concepts have large scale validity, they are super-Gaian. Biological control over key planetary climate-transfer modes may be accomplished through just a single rapidly renewed organic monolayer. © 2019 by the authors.","Bubbles; Capillaries; Ecogeography; Food web dynamics; Global monolayer; Interfacial equation of state; Marine surface tension and pressure; Momentum-heat-gas-salt exchange; Prandtl stress; Proxy compounds; Surfactant macromolecules; Upper ocean eddies","Bubbles (in fluids); Ecology; Equations of state of gases; Knowledge based systems; Macromolecules; Monolayers; Oceanography; Phase interfaces; Surface active agents; Surface tension; Capillaries; Ecogeography; Equation of state; Food-web dynamics; Prandtl stress; Proxy compounds; Upper ocean; Interface states; air-sea interaction; biogeochemistry; bubble; eddy; equation of state; food web; stress; surface pressure; surface tension; surfactant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066322180

Despite this potential to positively feedback to climate change, lake carbon emission sources are not well understood on whole-lake scales, complicating upscaling. In this study, we used observations of radiocarbon (14C) and stable carbon (13C) isotopes in the summer and winter dissolved CH4 and CO2 pools, ebullition-CH4, and multiple independent mass balance approaches to characterize whole-lake emission sources and apportion annual emission pathways. Observations focused on five lakes with variable thermokarst in interior Alaska. The 14C age of discrete ebullition-CH4 seeps ranged from 395 ± 15 to 28,240 ± 150 YBP across all study lakes; however, dissolved 14CH4 was younger than 4,730 YBP. In the primary study lake, Goldstream L., the integrated whole-lake 14C age of ebullition-CH4, as determined by three different approaches, ranged from 3,290 to 6,740 YBP. A new dissolved-14C-CH4-based approach to estimating ebullition 14C age and flux showed close agreement to previous ice-bubble surveys and bubble-trap flux estimates. Differences in open water versus ice-covered dissolved gas concentrations and their 14C and 13C isotopes revealed the influence of winter ice trapping and forcing ebullition-CH4 into the underlying water column, where it comprised 50% of the total dissolved CH4 pool by the end of winter. Across the study lakes, we found a relationship between the whole-lake 14C age of dissolved CH4 and CO2 and the extent of active thermokarst, representing a positive feedback system that is sensitive to climate warming. ©2019.

They utilize both Faradaic and non-Faradaic procedures to store charge, leading to higher specific capacitance and energy density, higher cell voltage, longer life cycle and moderated power density. Owing to a unique combination of features such as superb electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance in aqueous electrolytes, highly modifiable nanostructures, long cycle life and the large theoretical specific-surface area, the use of ternary nanocomposites as a supercapacitor electrode material has become the focus of a significant amount of current scientific researches in the field of energy storage devices. In these nanocomposites, graphene not only can be utilized to provide a substrate for growing nanostructured polymers in a polymer-carbon nanocomposite structure in order to overcome the insulating nature of conductive polymers at dedoped states, but also is capable of providing a platform for the decoration of metal oxide nanoparticles to avoid their agglomeration. In this regard, synthesis, characterization and performance of different ternary nanocomposites of conductive polymer/graphene/metal oxide are discussed in detail. These remarkable results demonstrate the exciting commercial potential for high performance, environmentally friendly and low-cost electrical energy storage devices based on ternary nanocomposite of conductive polymer/graphene/metal oxide. © 2019 The Chemical Society of Japan & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In recent years, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and photochemical experiments provided hints of an unexpected catalytic role of the pyridine molecule in the reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid or methanol. In particular, it has been suggested that the 1-pyridinyl radical (PyH) may be able to reduce carbon dioxide to the hydroxy-formyl radical. However, extensive theoretical studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction called this interpretation of the experimental observations into question. Using ab initio computational methods, we investigated the photochemistry of the hydrogen-bonded PyH···CO 2 complex. Our results reveal that carbon dioxide can be reduced to the hydroxy-formyl radical by a proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) reaction in excited states of the PyH···CO 2 complex. In contrast to the ground-state PCET reaction, which exhibits a substantial barrier, the excited-state PCET reaction is barrierless but requires the passage through two conical intersections. Our results provide a tentative explanation of the catalytic role of the PyH radical in the reduction of CO 2 with the qualification that the absorption of a photon by PyH is necessary. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Excited states; Free radical reactions; Ground state; Hydrogen bonds; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Solar energy; Thermodynamics; Chemical feedstocks; Conical intersection; First-principles study; Photoelectrochemicals; Proton coupled electron transfer reactions; Pyridine molecules; Theoretical study; Thermodynamics and kinetics; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065081118

To foster private and communal conservation activities an economic incentive-based conservation program (IFC) called Socio Bosque was established. Existing analyses related to conservation strategies are mainly focused on deforestation; while degradation and the role of IFC to safeguard ecosystem services are still scarce. Further on, there is a lack of landscape-level studies taking into account potential side effects of IFC on different forest types. Therefore we assessed ecosystem services (carbon stocks, timber volume) and species richness in landscapes with and without IFC. Additionally, we evaluated potential side-effects of IFC in adjacent forest types; hypothesizing potential leakage effects of IFC. Finally, we tested if deforestation rates decreased after IFC implementation. Forest inventories were conducted in 72 plots across eight landscapes in the Ecuadorian Central Amazon with and without IFC. Plots were randomly selected within three forest types (old-growth, logged and successional forests). In each plot all individuals with a diameter at breast height greater than 10 cm were measured. Old-growth forests in general showed higher carbon stocks, timber volume and species richness, and no significant differences between old-growth forests in IFC and non-IFC landscapes were found. Logged forests had 32% less above-ground carbon (AGC) and timber volume in comparison to old-growth forests. Surprisingly, logged forests near IFC presented higher AGC stocks than logged forests in non-IFC landscapes, indicating positive side-effects of IFC. Successional forests contain 56% to 64% of AGC, total carbon and timber volume, in comparison to old-growth forests, and 82% to 87% in comparison to logged forests. Therefore, successional forests could play an important role for restoration and should receive more attention in national climate change policies. Finally, after IFC implementation deforestation rate decreased on parish level. Our study presents scientific evidence of IFC contribution to conserving ecosystem services and species richness. In addition IFC could help indirectly to reduce degradation effects attributed to logging, indicating potential compatibility of conservation aims with forest activities at a landscape level. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon stocks; Forest integrity; Socio Bosque program; Species richness; Timber volume","Carbon; Climate change; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Logging (forestry); Timber; Carbon stocks; Forest integrity; Socio Bosque program; Species richness; Timber volume; Conservation; carbon sequestration; conservation; deforestation; degradation; ecosystem service; environmental economics; environmental policy; forest inventory; incentive; species richness; timber; Carbon; Conservation; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Forests; Growth; Services; Sides; Amazonia; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066871277

The effects of these solvents on bitumen recovery enhancement depend on reservoir properties and operating conditions. To investigate the effects of solvents on bitumen viscosity in a solvent aided process, phase behaviors and viscosities of CO2-, C3-, and C4-bitumen systems were measured and modeled at high temperatures. Using the calibrated Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EOS), the solubilities of solvents in the Clearwater bitumen sample from the Cold Lake region were predicted. High-pressure and high-temperature equipment using an electromagnetic-based viscometer was customized to measure the viscosities of CO2-, C3-, and C4-bitumen mixtures. The measured viscosity data were used to calibrate a nonlinear viscosity model which was used to predict liquid phase viscosity as a function of solvent solubility and temperature. The effects of solvent dissolution on bitumen viscosity were investigated using PR-EOS and the calibrated viscosity model. The results show that dissolving CO2, C3, and C4 in bitumen decreases its viscosity. This viscosity reduction is lowest and highest in the case of CO2 and C4 dissolution, respectively. The effect of solvent dissolution on viscosity reduction is more pronounced at lower temperatures. EOS predictions and viscosity measurements indicate that increasing concentration of CO2, C3, and C4 above a certain threshold has a limited effect on reducing bitumen viscosity. At threshold solvent concentrations, bitumen viscosity can be reduced by 1.7, 5.6, and 15.2 times using CO2, C3, and C4, respectively, at 120 °C. Solubility and viscosity data suggest that C4 has the potential to be used in hot-solvent recovery methods in shallow and deep oil sand reservoirs. C3 may be a more effective solvent in deeper reservoirs which allow higher operating pressures. The modified viscosity model showed better performance than the Lobe and Shu correlations and logarithmic mixing rule. This model improves existing correlations for predicting viscosities of light solvent-bitumen mixtures since it requires less input data and does not require density data. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Bituminous materials; Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Equations of state; Forecasting; Lakes; Mixtures; Oil sands; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Solubility; Solvents; Viscosity measurement; High pressure and high temperature; Liquid phase viscosity; Nonlinear viscosity; Operating condition; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Solvent concentration; Steam-assisted gravity drainages; Viscosity reduction; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065846213

The Mediterranean Region acquires a relevant role for its vulnerability to rise of temperatures, sea level rise and scarcity of water and resources. Energy supply is one of the priorities for Europe, and most of the efforts should be oriented on renew abIes as the principal energy source option to support. Despite the fact that urban areas are the most densely populated, rural areas represent more extension of European territory than urban areas. In the case of the MED area, this is not the exception, an important part of the territory of Portugal, Spain, France, Italy or Greece is considered as rural typology of regions (Eurostat 2017). Currently, Rural Areas are becoming more vulnerable due to an increasing process of depopulation and aging. In most of the cases, rural areas lose attractiveness for new generations, and most of the people migrate to cities. At the same time, climate change is expected to worsen the existing vulnerability of rural areas. Accordingly to the 5th IPCC report55'... rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world. These impacts will disproportionately affect the welfare of the poor in rural areas, such as female-headed households and those with limited access to land, modern agricultural inputs, infrastructure and education'., such pressure is expected to generate conflicts in resource-dependent livelihoods. EU Projects represent an opportunity to bring new ideas and initiatives not only at scientific field but also for economy and social development. Interreg Med Programme66https://interreg-med.eu/ organizes its architecture into eight Thematic Communities grouped as well in three axes: 1) Innovation; 2) Low Carbon Economy; and 3) Natural and cultural resources. The Renewable Energy Community77https://renewable-energies.interreg-med.eu/ forms part of the Low Carbon Economy axe and it is constituted by six Modular Projects: Compose; Forbioenergy; Local4green; Pegasus; Prismi and Stores. Then also counts with one Horizontal Project: Greencap, which has the role of capitalization and main dissemination of the community. All projects jointly promote an energy model based on local renewable sources and sharing management through microgrids in the Mediterranean Region developing several planning, management and governance tools. Even that most of the strategies can be replicated and adapted to urban areas; RES Community focuses on rural and islands areas as a main focus. Most of the current issues around energy transition claim for a holistic vision that founds solutions that can be able to face the complexity of implementation processes. For that reason, RES Community finds its common approach through an ecosystemic base thinking; merging the essential technical outcomes from each one of Modular Projects in an integral strategy addressed to four policy pillars: Climate Change, Energy Transition, Land use Planning and Circular Economy. For that purpose, Greencap Horizontal Project, proposes to exemplify this integral strategy through Ecosystemic Transition Units (E TU), as a planning and management tool to boost and ensure energy transition at regional and local level authorities. The aim of this paper is to present the methodological and conceptual framework of this strategy as a basis for a new policy recommendation at Mediterranean Region. © 2019 IEEE.","Climate Change; Ecosystemic Transition Units; Energy local communities; Energy transition policies; Island areas; Land use Planning; Mediterranean Region; Prosumers; Renewable Energy; Rural areas","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental management; Food supply; Land use; Landforms; Renewable energy resources; Sea level; Urban planning; Ecosystemic Transition Units; Energy transitions; Island areas; Land Use Planning; Local community; Mediterranean region; Prosumers; Renewable energies; Rural areas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069930530

Additional stress from climate perturbations, such as droughts, can reduce fuel moisture and lead to fires that render the reserves more vulnerable to further degradation. Here, we explore recent drought-associated wildfires in the forest zone of Ghana to better understand the combined effects of forest degradation and drought stress on fire in the forest reserves. We used remotely sensed Earth observations from MODIS and Landsat 8 along with Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) precipitation data, to study fires that occurred during drought conditions in 2016. Fires were widespread in 2016, with an estimated 2137 km 2 of forest reserve area burned. During the period 2003–2017, forest reserves experienced the most active fire detections in 2016. The majority of these fires were located in the moist semi-deciduous forests, the largest and most economically valuable forest type, accounting for more than 50% of all active fires and burned area. Forest reserves within the moist semi-deciduous forest type also had the highest standardized fire anomalies in 2016. There was a higher percentage of burned area in degraded forest reserves than in more intact reserves. These results underscore the vulnerability of Ghana's forest reserves, particularly in the moist semi-deciduous type, to fires during severe droughts. Although drought predisposes moist tropical forests to fire, forest degradation also influences the spatial pattern and extent of burned forests. Fire-induced forest degradation presents a major challenge for conservation of humid tropical forests in the region. Within the context of REDD+ and other climate change mitigation and adaptation programs in West Africa, it will be imperative to incorporate effective fire management strategies into ongoing efforts to reduce forest degradation and sustain forest resilience. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drought; Forest conservation; Forest degradation; Forest reserves; Landsat; MODIS; REDD+; Remote sensing; Upper Guinean forest; West Africa","Climate change; Conservation; Drought; Fires; Land use; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Tropics; Forest conservation; Forest degradation; Forest reserves; LANDSAT; MODIS; REDD; Upper Guinean forest; West Africa; Forestry; adaptive management; climate change; deciduous forest; drought; drought stress; emission inventory; environmental degradation; fire; forest ecosystem; habitat fragmentation; land use change; Landsat; MODIS; nature conservation; nature reserve; precipitation assessment; refugium; remote sensing; tropical forest; vulnerability; wildfire; Conservation; Drought; Fires; Land Use; Remote Sensing; Tropics; Ghana; Guinea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062859702

(area 1) and from the limnetic region (area 2) of a tropical coastal lagoon separated from the sea by a sandbar. We hypothesized that area 1 presents a proportionally smaller potential methane production (PMP) on sulphate addition than area 2. We further hypothesized that acetate addition stimulates proportionally greater PMP in area 2 sediment layers than in area 1. Materials and methods: The PMP rates were measured in sediment samples from three depths (0–2, 2–6, and 6–10 cm) in areas 1 and 2 for 89 days. The sediment incubations were prepared with additions of acetate (1 mM), sulphate (10 mM), and acetate plus sulphate (1 and 10 mM, respectively); the control treatment had no addition of acetate and/or sulphate. We also measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC), carbohydrates, and sulphate in the interstitial water. Results and discussion: PMP responded differently to acetate and sulphate addition. In general, PMP in area 2 was proportionally more stimulated by the addition of acetate and less inhibited by the addition of sulphate. In the 0–2-cm layer, the addition of acetate did not stimulate PMP in relation to the control in area 1, reaching a rate of 376.11 nmol CH4 g−1 day−1. In area 2, PMP was 5-fold higher in relation to the control, reaching 5.4 nmol CH4 g−1 day−1. Contrarily, in the 6–10-cm layer, sulphate addition inhibited PMP by 127.8-fold in relation to the control in area 1, reaching 0.6 nmol CH4 g−1 day−1. In area 2, PMP decreased 3.2-fold in relation to the control, reaching a value of 3.7 nmol CH4 g−1 day−1. These results agreed with the higher amounts of carbohydrates and lower amounts of sulphate in area 1 in the experiment beginning. Conclusions: Acetate and sulphate are effective PMP regulators in the sediment of two areas of a tropical coastal lagoon.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dietary supplementation of Moringa oleifera on the production performance and fecal methanogenic community in dairy cows using methyl-coenzyme M reductase α-subunit gene. Sixty-four cows were allocated to one of four treatments: Basal diet without M. oleifera (control) or low (3% w/w, M3), medium (6%, M6), or high (9%, M9) supplementation with M. oleifera. This study demonstrated that different supplementation levels of Moringa oleifera in the diet achieved similar feed intake and milk production, but adding 6% of Moringa oleifera improved milk fat content. Two families, two phyla, three genera, and three species in total were identified among the four treatments. The fecal archaeal community in the control treatment was predominated by Methanobrevibacter (39.1% of the total sequence reads) followed by Methanosphaera and Methanocorpusculum at the genus level. The increased abundance of the Methanosphaera genus and Methanosphaera sp. ISO3-F5 species was induced by secondary metabolites of Moringa oleifera in the diet. Results indicated that Moringa oleifera supplementation not only improved dairy product quality but could also potentially reduce methane emissions. © 2019 by the authors.

Yet, information on sequestration rates is still scarce, especially for AFS in temperate regions and for maturing AFS. This study aims to determine the rate and amount of carbon and nitrogen uptake in a 17-year-old northern red oak (Quercus rubra)–pecan (Carya illinoinensis) silvopastoral planting in Fayetteville, AR, USA. Seven oak and pecan trees were felled to develop AFS-specific allometric equations for above-ground biomass, carbon, and nitrogen. Tree-stand woody biomass (DWw), carbon (Cw) and nitrogen (Nw) and leaf biomass (DWL), carbon (CL), and nitrogen (NL) were calculated with these equations. Diameter at 1.37 m above ground (DBH) was measured annually, and a non-linear mixed-effect model was used to estimate absolute (AGR) and relative growth rates. DWw and Cw was 7.1 and 3.4 Mg ha−1 for pecan and 26.6 and 12.7 Mg ha−1 for oak, which corresponds to a carbon sequestration rate of 0.75 and 0.20 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Total N uptake was approximately 66 and 71 g N tree−1 yr−1 for oak and pecan. The mixed-effect model with individual-tree-level random effects for all parameters provided the best representation of DBH growth of oak and pecan, likely due to the high heterogeneity of site characteristics. The AGR explained the non-linear plant growth and reached its maximum of 0.017 and 0.0179 m yr−1 for oak and pecan, respectively, 11 years after planting. This suggests that carbon and nitrogen uptake also declined after 11 years. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Allometric equations; Carbon sequestration; Carya illinoinensis; Mixed effect models; Nitrogen uptake; Quercus rubra","aboveground biomass; agroforestry; allometry; carbon sequestration; deciduous tree; diameter; ecological modeling; equation; growth rate; long-term change; nitrogen cycle; nutrient uptake; pasture; silviculture; temperate environment; Arkansas; Fayetteville; United States; Carya illinoinensis; Quercus rubra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064541316

As one of the most important economic growth poles in China, BTH region has long been suffering from air pollution especially PM 2.5 pollution. Thus, in this study, we utilized satellite observations of PM 2.5 pollution and panel data of 13 cities in BTH region from 1998 to 2016 to investigate the relationship between economic growth and PM 2.5 pollution. After verifying the spatial effect of PM 2.5 pollution by spatial statistical analysis, the spatial econometric model, Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) was chosen over the non-spatial model in the examination of EKC. The results showed that: 1) the relationship between economic growth and PM 2.5 pollution presented a significant inverted U-shaped pattern. Though BTH region is still in the upward section, there is a hope that it will cross the point and enter the downward section in the future; 2) the turning points of EKC would happen later with spatial effect considered, compared to the result of non-spatial model; 3) the turning point of EKC would not happen until the region enter the post-industrial economy stage. Moreover, though some of the cities in BTH region have entered post-industrial stage, none of them has cross the turning point of EKC.

Ancient DNA (aDNA) metabarcoding allows biodiversity responses to major climatic change to be explored at different spatial and temporal scales. We extracted aDNA preserved in fossil rodent middens to reconstruct late Quaternary vegetation dynamics in the hyperarid Atacama Desert. By comparing our paleo-informed millennial record with contemporary observations of interannual variations in diversity, we show local plant communities behave differentially at different timescales. In the interannual (years to decades) time frame, only annual herbaceous expand and contract their distributional ranges (emerging from persistent seed banks) in response to precipitation, whereas perennials distribution appears to be extraordinarily resilient. In contrast, at longer timescales (thousands of years) many perennial species were displaced up to 1,000 m downslope during pluvial events. Given ongoing and future natural and anthropogenically induced climate change, our results not only provide baselines for vegetation in the Atacama Desert, but also help to inform how these and other high mountain plant communities may respond to fluctuations of climate in the future. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","ancient DNA; Atacama Desert; biodiversity; biogeography; climate change; desert plants; elevational gradients; fossil middens; metabarcoding; paleoecology","biodiversity; biogeography; climate change; climate effect; DNA; fossil; midden; paleoecology; plant; species diversity; Atacama Desert; Chile; Rodentia; ancient DNA; biodiversity; Chile; classification; climate change; desert climate; ecosystem; fossil; genetics; plant; plant dispersal; population dynamics; Biodiversity; Chile; Climate Change; Desert Climate; DNA, Ancient; Ecosystem; Fossils; Plant Dispersal; Plants; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061986479

However, their effects on urban air pollution are not straightforward. The main objective of this work is to estimate the emissions and energy use from bio-fuelled vehicles by using an integrated and flexible modelling approach at the urban scale in order to contribute to the understanding of introducing biofuels as an alternative transport fuel. For this purpose, the new Traffic Emission and Energy Consumption Model (QTraffic) was applied for complex urban road network when considering two biofuels demand scenarios with different blends of bioethanol and biodiesel in comparison to the reference situation over the city of Coimbra (Portugal). The results of this study indicate that the increase of biofuels blends would have a beneficial effect on particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions reduction for the entire road network (-3.1% [-3.8% to -2.1%] by kg). In contrast, an overall negative effect on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions at urban scale is expected, mainly due to the increase in bioethanol uptake. Moreover, the results indicate that, while there is no noticeable variation observed in energy use, fuel consumption is increased by over 2.4% due to the introduction of the selected biofuels blends. © 2019 by the authors.","Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Energy use; Road transport; Traffic emissions; Urban air pollution","atmospheric pollution; biofuel; energy use; fuel consumption; modeling; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; road transport; traffic emission; transport vehicle; urban pollution; Coimbra [Portugal]; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067079623

This paper proposes a fuzzy optimal protection system (FOPS) based on fuzzy logic to manage odour production from a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill. The case study is a MSW landfill in an old quarry site located 6 km north-west of Naples city centre (Italy). The aim is to reduce the odour nuisance in the area surrounding the landfill where there are several sensitive receptors. FOPS is based on logical relationships between local atmospheric dynamics, number and intensity of odour pollution events detected by certain fixed receptors and odour emission rate via an optimal fuzzy approach. Such system allows to start, in real time, established mitigation actions required to further reduce the odorous emissions from the landfill itself (e.g. spraying of perfumed substances and activation of extraction wells), especially when weather conditions might not be favourable and cause by causing a higher odour perception.

Hence, there is a good potential to use waste heat recovery systems for space heating purposes in order to reduce the energy consumption, energy cost as well as pollutant emissions. In present study, the feasibility of using the air source heat pump (ASHP), as a waste heat recovery system operating with different refrigerants, in a 54-racks data center in Mashhad city of Iran has been investigated to save the electrical energy consumption of the mechanical cooling as well as the natural gas fuel consumption of the adjoining office building with area of 416 m 2 . The energy-environmental-economic analysis results indicated that around 35000 m 3 /year natural gas saving, 20.8 MW h/year electrical energy saving, 121 tons/year CO 2 emission reduction and 25000$/year cost saving can be achieved through using the proposed waste heat recovery system.

In the city gate station, the temperature drops because of pressure drop has been occurred. In this case, the gas temperature may be reached to natural gas hydrates’ temperature and therefore natural gas pipelines are blocked. To avoid this condition, natural gas is preheated. Heating of natural gas should be in the range to avoid the gas hydrated temperature as well as, if possible, lower fuel consumption. For this purpose, the minimum possible temperature regulator output has been defined. The minimum temperature is based on gas hydrate temperature and has been calculated by applying fundamental thermodynamic equations and the equation of state. For validation of proposed method, the results have been compared to the measured temperature of Abbas Abad CGS. The validation shows that the proposed method has reduced fuel consumption by about 35%. The results show the price of reduced fuel consumption and carbon tax has been dropped in a year, also producing carbon dioxide because of incomplete combustion is significantly reduced. © The Author(s) 2018.","AGA8 equation; City gate station; examines economic; optimization temperature; thermodynamic analysis","Carbon dioxide; Drops; Equations of state of gases; Gas hydrates; Gases; Hydration; Natural gas; Natural gas pipelines; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; AGA8 equation; City gate station; Incomplete combustion; Measured temperatures; Minimum temperatures; Temperature drops; Thermo dynamic analysis; Thermodynamic equations; Natural gas wells; combustion; fuel consumption; gas hydrate; natural gas; optimization; pollution tax; price dynamics; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059348041

Here, we present a multiyear observational analysis using data collected before, during, and after the record-breaking California drought (2011-2015) at the O3-polluted locations of Fresno and Bakersfield near the Sierra Nevada foothills. We separately assess drought influences on O3 chemical production (PO3) from O3 concentration. We show that isoprene concentrations, which are a source of O3-forming organic reactivity, were relatively insensitive to early drought conditions but decreased by more than 50% during the most severe drought years (2014-2015), with recovery a function of location. We find drought-isoprene effects are temperature-dependent, even after accounting for changes in leaf area, consistent with laboratory studies but not previously observed at landscape scales with atmospheric observations. Drought-driven decreases in organic reactivity are contemporaneous with a change in dominant oxidation mechanism, with PO3 becoming more NOx-suppressed, leading to a decrease in PO3 of ∼20%. We infer reductions in atmospheric O3 loss of ∼15% during the most severe drought period, consistent with past observations of decreases in O3 uptake by plants. We consider drought-related trends in O3 variability on synoptic time scales by analyzing statistics of multiday high-O3 events. We discuss implications for regulating O3 air pollution in California and other locations under more prevalent drought conditions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Isoprene; Location; Ozone; Plants (botany); Atmospheric observations; Chemical production; Drought influences; Mass balance equations; Observational analysis; Organic reactivity; Oxidation mechanisms; Temperature dependent; Drought; isoprene; nitrogen oxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; biological uptake; concentration (composition); drought; landscape change; oxidation; ozone; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmospheric transport; California; drought; ecosystem; flame ionization detection; landscape; leaf area; oxidation; temperature dependence; air pollutant; California; drought; Nevada; Bakersfield; California; Fresno [California]; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; California; Droughts; Nevada; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065547310

Here we show that city-scale electrification of heat with large-scale thermal storage also cost-effectively unlocks significant additional operational benefits for the power sector. We build an optimization model of fully electrified district heating and cooling networks integrated with other electric loads. We leverage real-world consumption and operational data from a first-of-a-kind facility that meets heating, cooling and electrical energy requirements equivalent to a city of 30:000 people. Using our model, we compute optimal operational strategies for the controllable loads and thermal storage in this system under different economic hypotheses. In our example, electrifying the previously gas-based heating and cooling infrastructure has led to a 65% reduction in the overall campus carbon footprint. Through least-cost scheduling, the load shape of the aggregate energy system can be flattened and annual peak power demand can be reduced by 15%. Through carbon-aware scheduling that takes advantage of variations in grid power carbon intensity, heating and cooling emissions could further decrease by over 40% in 2025 compared to the 2016 baseline, assuming a policy-compliant electricity mix for California.

The literature on CO2 emissions and innovation for regional differences is very scanty as there is not enough study that considered different regions in a single analysis. We adopt a holistic approach by incorporating different regions so as to assess how innovation contributes to emission reduction. The study, therefore, examined the effects of innovation and economic growth on CO2 emissions for 18 developed and developing countries over the period of 1990 to 2016. The study used panel technique capable of dealing with cross-section dependence effects: panel cross-sectional augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) unit root to determine the order of integration, Westerlund cointegration tests confirmed that the variables are co-integrated. We employed panel fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and panel dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) to estimate the long-run relationship. The results show that energy consumption increases CO2 emissions at all panel levels. However, innovation reduces CO2 emissions in G6 while it increases emissions in the MENA and the BRICS countries.

The first design corresponds to a Deterministic Market Clearing (DMC) similar to the mechanism currently used in organized wholesale electricity markets in the United States. The other three designs account for the day-ahead (DA) wind power production uncertainty into the DA market mechanisms either implicitly or explicitly. An Augmented Deterministic Market Clearing (ADMC) design introduces DA ramp-capability products. These products ensure adequate and ramp-feasible electricity generation capacity commitments in the DA stage to cope with the real-time realization of wind power generation. A Hybrid Deterministic Market clearing (HDMC) design augments ADMC by explicitly integrating a characterization of wind power production uncertainty into the residual unit commitment (RUC) process, which is run after the DA market is closed, using stochastic programming. The last design, referred to as stochastic market clearing (SMC), uses stochastic optimization to explicitly account for wind power production uncertainty in the DA market clearing mechanisms (i.e. DA unit commitment and economic dispatch). The four market clearing designs are assessed by simulating the electricity market operations of a test system and comparing their results in terms of operating costs, prices, costs and revenues of different types of producers, consumer's payments, integration of wind power, and air emissions. The test system has 12% of the capacity of PJM's fossil-fired power generation fleet, and uses data on coincident demand and wind power production from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) system during years 2010–2014. The simulations are performed hourly for a whole year. Results show that SMC is superior as its costs reductions are more than two times the improvements attained by ADMC and HDMC. Also, SMC results in electricity prices that are better aligned with operation costs, cuts the spread between the day-ahead and real-time prices by &gt;40%, reduces out-of-market short-term revenue sufficiency payments by 58%, reduces CO 2 emissions by 3.52%, and decreases power plants’ cycling. HDMC is a distant second-best market design. Relative to DMC, it achieves a reduction in total costs that is less than half the reduction achieved by SMC, a reduction in out-of-market payments that is 80% of the reduction attained by SMC, and an increase in wind power integration that is &lt;10% the improvement obtained under SMC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Hidden uncertainty costs; Market clearing design; Price formation; Two-settlement markets; Wind energy","Commerce; Cost reduction; Electric industry; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Operating costs; Product design; Scheduling; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Bonneville power administrations; Electricity generation capacity; Electricity market operations; Environmental implications; Market clearing; Market clearing mechanisms; Price formation; Wholesale electricity markets; Power markets; cost analysis; design; electricity supply; energy market; power generation; price determination; uncertainty analysis; wind power; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060954391

The social and biophysical sciences are an important information source but are often neglected in policy and practice. The literature has identified the science, policy practice gaps as significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources. However, there is lack of research specifically covering the interactions between the three domains. This paper aims to: a) review the literature to identify gaps and related factors or themes contributing to the science-policy-practice disconnect; and b) propose a conceptual integrated model to address those gaps and to increase the uptake of science into policy and practice in coastal systems. The results confirm that there are gaps in the two way-links between science and policy and practice. Most research (64%) is published in the science to policy area, 32% in the policy and practice area, and only four % of the research is published in the science-policy-practice area. Effective integration is inhibited by issues of knowledge, uncertainty, communication, political and cultural issues and institutions or rules and a clear mechanism for linking science, policy and practice is needed. Frameworks may help alleviate the problem but may not be holistic or flexible enough to facilitate interactions across science-policy-practice. There needs to be a clear mechanism for integrating science, policy and practice. To address this a conceptual model of the interactions between science and policy and practice is proposed. The model includes two-way connections between science-policy-practice, mediated by both internal and external factors including key drivers, facilitators, inhibitors and barriers. The model is applied to three case studies, namely: implementing international level blue carbon policy at a local level; an historical perspective on mangrove damage and restoration at an Australian state level; and an Australian example of long-term interactions between science, policy and practice, illustrating how multiple connections and interactions can occur as projects proceed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Case studies; Coastal systems; Conceptual model; Integrated management","coastal zone management; conceptual framework; integrated approach; literature review; marine policy; model; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062096022

This study focused on a respective inland area-Hunan province China, which was surrounded by mountains in three sides. This unique characteristic of terrain contributed largely to the heavy pollution level. We used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, Artificial Neutral Network (ANN) model and the Hybrid Single Paricle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model to study pollution characteristics of PM 2.5 . The results showed that the meteorological parameters were correlated with PM 2.5 concentration and ANN model performed better than MLR model in predicting PM 2.5 concentrations in Hunan. According to the trajectory, several peaks were observed in January. The first one occurred at the beginning of January. We supposed that the firework used to celebrate the New Year accounted for the climb of PM 2.5 concentration. Moreover, peaks were found in the same day in 14 cities during heavy polluted period. Based on the trajectory, we found that there were successive air masses coming from the northern or northwest China entered into Hunan in January. The pocket-like terrain of Hunan led to the stagnation of air masses causing the air pollution. Besides, the trajectories also implied that the air masses would bypass Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangtan, which were regarded as pollution sources, before reaching other cities. Therefore, the pollutants emission should be strictly regulated during the polluted period. Moreover, ozone pollution is becoming more obvious during summer time, which might be a major pollutant after particulate pollution is under control. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Hunan; Meteorological parameters; Models; Particulate; Pollution characteristics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065145403

In order to mitigate the environmental pressures caused by NO2 pollution, it is of vital importance to investigate the influencing factors. We first obtained data for NO2 pollution at the city level using satellite observation techniques and analyzed its spatial distribution. Next, we introduced a theoretical framework, an extended stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model, to quantify the relationship between NO2 pollution and its contributing natural and socio-economic factors. The results are as follows. Cities with high NO2 pollution are mainly concentrated in the North China Plain. On the contrary, southwestern cities are characterized by low NO2 pollution. In addition, we find that population, per capita gross domestic product, the share of the secondary industry, ambient air pressures, total nighttime light data, and urban road area have a positive impact on NO2 pollution. In contrast, increases in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed may reduce NO2 pollution. These empirical results should help the government to effectively and efficiently implement further emission reductions and energy saving policies in Chinese cities in a bid to mitigate the environmental pressures. © 2019 by the authors.

The increasing use of natural gas in the central heating supply system may have altered the spatial and temporal patterns of CO2 emissions from central heating, yet the quantitative impacts are poorly understood. Here we detect the spatio-temporal dynamics of CO2 emissions of central heating from 2012 to 2016 at the prefectural-city level in the NCP region, by using the satellite NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data and a panel regression model to estimate CO2 emissions on a 5 × 5 km2 grid. We find that despite a slight decrease (2%) in 2014 under the “Natural Gas Utilization Policy” CO2 emissions continued to grow. Between 2012 and 2016, CO2 emissions from central heating in the NCP increased from 106 to 121 Tg, although CO2 emissions declined by 12% in Beijing due to the increasing contribution of natural gas boilers. The gridded CO2 emissions map shows that over 2012–2016 coal burning is the main driving force of CO2 emissions in both urban and non-urban regions, despite the increasing fraction of gas-based heating. Our results contribute to city-level policymaking on carbon reduction and climate change mitigation.

In this paper, we aim to investigate some key questions about recycling across three dimensions: greenhouse gas emissions, operational costs, and aggregate costs (social costs of emissions plus operational costs.) First, we build supply chain models for cradle-to-grave and cradle-to-cradle supply chains to derive an analytical condition for recycling effectiveness, and use US emissions and cost data to empirically validate that recycling is effective in reducing emissions for all the abovementioned materials. Furthermore, our analysis shows that recycling is effective for all materials, with the exception of glass, with respect to both operational and aggregate costs. Second, we study optimal recycling decisions in terms of collection and yield rates in a socially optimal case, as well as in scenarios in which recycling decisions are made by a local government, a product manufacturer, and an independent recycling firm. Unlike some of existing findings, we show that there are instances in which a product manufacturer or an independent firm might be the best choice for organizing recycling operations. Finally, we discuss and analyze incentives that a social planner should offer to recyclers to bring their efforts closer to the socially optimal choice. We obtain a novel result, which shows that a deposit/refund scheme implemented by a social planner with a refund to local governments might lead to a socially optimal collection rate. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Green supply chains; Life-cycle analysis; OR in environment and climate change; Recycling rebates; Socially optimal recycling","Aggregates; Climate change; Gas emissions; Glass; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Metal recovery; Municipal solid waste; Recycling; Supply chains; Analytical conditions; Coordination mechanisms; Green supply chain; Life cycle analysis; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Product manufacturers; Recycling operations; Supply chain models; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057001807

Biomass loads were based on a Mexican biomass map, updated with the net primary productivity products. The burning effciency was estimated from a Random Forest Regression (RFR) model, which considered the fuel, weather and topographical conditions. The burned areas were the downloaded Maryland University MCD64c6 product. The emission factors were obtained from well-known estimations, corrected by a dedicated US Forest Service and Mexican campaign. The uncertainty was estimated from an integrative method. Our method was applied to a four-year period, 2011-2014, in three Mexican ecoregions. The total burned in the study region was 12,898 km2 (about 4% of the area), producing 67.5 (±20) Tg of CO2. Discrepancies of the land cover maps were found to be the main cause of a low correlation between our estimations and the Global Emission Database (GFED). The emissions were clearly associated to precipitation patterns. They mainly affected dry and tropical forests (almost 50% of all emissions). Six priority areas were identified, where prevention or mitigation measures must be implemented. © 2019 by the authors.","Gas emissions; Machine learning; Remote sensing","Biomass; Decision trees; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Fire hazards; Fires; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Uncertainty analysis; Emission factors; Forest fire emissions; Global emissions; Mitigation measures; Net primary productivity; Precipitation patterns; Satellite observations; US Forest Service; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066748759

Nevertheless, shale gas production generates greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions including carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and volatile organic compounds. In this study we develop three shale gas drilling projections in Germany and the United Kingdom based on estimated reservoir productivities and local capacity. For each projection, we define a set of emission scenarios in which gas losses are assigned to each stage of upstream gas production to quantify total emissions. The “realistic” (REm) and “optimistic” (OEm) scenarios investigated in this study describe, respectively, the potential emission range generated by business-as-usual activities, and the lowest emissions technically possible according to our settings. The latter scenario is based on the application of specific technologies and full compliance with a stringent regulatory framework described herein. Based on the median drilling projection, total annual methane emissions range between 150–294 Kt in REm and 28–42 Kt in OEm, while carbon dioxide emissions span from 5.55–7.21 Mt in REm to 3.11–3.96 Mt in OEm. Taking all drilling projections into consideration, methane leakage rates in REm range between 0.45 and 1.36% in Germany, and between 0.35 and 0.71% in the United Kingdom. The leakage rates are discussed in both the European (conventional gas) and international (shale gas) contexts. Further, the emission intensity of a potential European shale gas industry is estimated and compared to national inventories. Results from our science-based prospective scenarios can facilitate an informed discussion among the public and policy makers on the climate impact of a potential shale gas development in Europe, and on the appropriate role of natural gas in the worldwide energy transition. © 2019 The Author(s).","Fracking; Methane leakage; Natural gas; O&G industry; Shale gas; Unconventional gas","climate effect; emission inventory; gas industry; hydraulic fracturing; leakage; methane; natural gas; oil industry; scenario analysis; shale gas; Germany; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070557511

However, this type of energy infrastructure has faced local opposition that could be explained by the perceived risk associated with new energy technologies. Our research aims to understand how risk is socially constructed in relation to non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) projects in Chile, considering ecosystem services (ES) as central. This research was carried out through a qualitative methodological framework, which involved the application of semi-structured interviews. The information was analysed based on a qualitative strategy of categorisation, combining the inductive and a-priori approaches to the definition of themes. Our results reveal that ecosystem services are a practical tool that can be applied in the social perception of risk to improve the management processes associated with NCRE projects. We provide an understanding of ES's role within the social amplification of risk theoretical framework. Our findings suggest that conflicts around NCRE projects would be linked to a reduction of an ES provision. These results contribute to understanding the function of ES in risk perception associated with the balance between supply and demand. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cultural ecosystem services; Landscape value; Renewable energy; Social amplification of risk","alternative energy; culture; ecosystem service; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; landscape; risk assessment; risk perception; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061202504

This high vulnerability is due to the socioeconomic limitations and high environmental sensitivity which affect the biophysical and socioeconomic components of their farming systems. Therefore, systems' functionality and farmers' livelihoods will also be affected, with significant implications for global food security, land-use/land-cover change processes and agrobiodiversity conservation. Thus, less vulnerable and more resilient smallholder farming systems constitute an important requisite for sustainable land management and to safeguard the livelihoods of millions of rural and urban households. This study compares a comprehensive socioeconomic and environmental dataset collected in 2015-2016 based on household interviews of 30 farmers of highland agroforestry systems and 30 farmers of conventional agriculture systems, to determine which system provides better opportunities to reduce exposure and sensitivity.

The interview data are based on the perceptions of Kayambi indigenous farmers about the levels of exposure and sensitivity of their farming systems during the last decade. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the data from the 60 farms. Results indicate that both agroforesters and conventional farmers clearly perceived increases in temperature and reductions in precipitation for the last decade, and expected this trend to continue in the next decade. Furthermore, conventional farmers perceived greater exposure to droughts (20%), solar radiation (43%), and pests, weeds and disease outbreaks (40%) than agroforesters. Additionally, results emphasize the better ability of agroforestry systems to reduce exposure and sensitivity to climate change and variability. These findings support the well-known assumptions about the key role played by agroforestry systems for climate change adaptation and mitigation, especially in developing countries. © 2019 by the authors.","Agroforestry and conventional agricultural systems; Climate change and variability; Exposure and sensitivity; Smallholder farmers; Traditional and indigenous knowledge; Tropical Andes","agricultural worker; agroforestry; climate change; climate variation; comparative study; farming system; food security; indigenous knowledge; livelihood; mountain; perception; sensitivity analysis; smallholder; sustainable development; traditional knowledge; tropical environment; Andes; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066932274

The transformation of areas underused, such as urban rooftops, into productive spaces is being increasingly implemented as a result of associated multiple benefits. Rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) are an interesting option for exploiting urban rooftops with direct exposure to sunlight, reducing food miles and creating new agricultural spaces, while building-applied solar photovoltaic (BAPV) panels provide clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a proper assessment of environmental costs and benefits related to both systems is vital for a successful implementation. By means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, modelled in the professional software SimaPro, this paper aims at comparing the environmental performance of different productive uses of rooftops under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The results showed that both systems are favourable and contribute to decreasing the environmental impacts thanks to the production of resources on-site. BAPV system shows the highest avoided burdens in comparison with RTG: for instance, the impacts generated by BAPV on climate change and fossil depletion categories, corresponding to - 430 kg CO2 eq/m2 and - 110 kg oil eq/m2 respectively (versus - 22 kg CO2 eq/m2 and - 4.7 kg oil eq/m2 in the RTG system), are around 20 times lower than RTG. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed through different scenarios, based on reductions or substitution of the most sensitive input flows, thus providing some useful tools for improved environmental performances. Attention to additional energy and material efficiency, in favour of the more environmentally sustainable choice, should remain a main point of investigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","agri-urban; circular economy; cities; LCA; photovoltaic energy; rooftop","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Oils and fats; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Urban growth; agri-urban; Circular economy; cities; Photovoltaic energy; rooftop; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; agricultural production; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; public space; roof; solar power; sustainability; urban design; urban development; agricultural procedures; Article; climate change; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; energy yield; environmental factor; fossil; greenhouse; life cycle assessment; light exposure; photovoltaic energy generation; resource management; sensitivity analysis; software; Southern Europe; sunlight; sustainable development; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061434365

We conducted a systematic literature review on SOC storage under agroforestry and conservation agriculture systems in sub-Saharan Africa, where we reported 66 and 33 cases for both systems respectively. The results showed that SOC storage rates were significantly higher than 4‰ yr−1 in fallows and in multistrata agroforestry systems (P = 0.0001 and 0.0178, respectively), but not in alley cropping and parklands systems. For conservation agriculture, SOC storage rates were only significantly higher than 4‰ yr−1 (P = 0.0438) when all three principles were applied, i.e. no- or minimum tillage combined with crop residue retention and intercropping or rotation. The data showed very large variability in SOC storage rates as the result of various factors, including previous land-use history, experimental set up and approach used to determine SOC storage (diachronic versus synchronic approach), soil type, depth of soil sampling, type of crops and management, and duration of the experiment. SOC storage rates significantly decreased with time in the agroforestry systems (P = 0.0328). However, we were unable to find significant relationships with initial SOC stocks or tree density. Given the limited published data and the high variability in results, no significant relationships between SOC storage rates and site variables were found for conservation agriculture. We argue that there is a potential for SOC storage in agricultural soils of sub-Saharan Africa, as illustrated by SOC gaps observed on smallholder farms. Low SOC levels are, however, to a great extent the result of limited resources of most smallholder farmers. Practices such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture can restore SOC in these soils, but the 4‰ initiative has to be implemented on the grounds of the positive impact on crop productivity rather than on climate change mitigation. The efficiency in doing so will depend on the specific situations and will need economic support to smallholder farmers, including the promotion of good markets for sale of extra produce and for input supply, effective private support and policy, such as credit schemes and subsidies for inputs, and efficient extension services which incentivize farmers to invest in new technologies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alley cropping; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Crop residues; Crop rotation; Fallows; Intercropping; No-tillage; Parklands","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Climate change; Crops; Digital storage; Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Soil conservation; Soils; Alley cropping; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Crop residue; Crop rotation; Fallows; Intercropping; No tillage; Parklands; Information management; agricultural management; agroforestry; alley cropping; alternative agriculture; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop residue; crop rotation; fallow; intercropping; soil carbon; soil organic matter; state role; zero tillage; France; Ile de France; Paris; Sub-Saharan Africa; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042939468

To date, information on the quality of tropical peatland organic matter and its sensitivity to increases in global temperatures is limited, particularly in the context of land conversion. The aim of this work is therefore to determine peat quality and temperature response of potential GHG emissions under flooded conditions from tropical peatland sites. Whilst reflecting the process of conversion from forest to oil palm plantation. Four land use types that represent the stages of conversion from peat swamp forest to oil palm were chosen: (i) secondary ‘forest’, (ii) recently ‘drained’ but not cleared forest (iii) cleared and recently planted ‘young oil palm’ plantation and (iv) ‘mature oil palm’ plantation. Overall, surface peat carbon was more labile than deeper peats. The largest labile pool was measured at forest sites. In the later stages of land conversion, the labile carbon had been lost and the relative abundance of recalcitrant organic material increased. Potential GHG fluxes were greatest in surface peats compared to deeper peats and declined as labile carbon was depleted following land conversion. Higher temperatures resulted in higher potential GHG emissions at all stages of conversion, but the magnitude of the temperature response depended on organic matter lability. For CO 2 fluxes, the temperature response was most pronounced at forest sites. This reflects the greater peat lability at this land use. In contrast, for CH 4 emissions, there were increased emissions both at forest and converted land types with higher temperatures. This suggests that increasing temperatures in response to climate warming may drive higher CH 4 emissions from sites dominated by degraded organic matter. Collectively, this study demonstrates that during conversion from peat swamp forest to oil palm plantation, the enhanced decomposition and reduced litter input rates is reflected eventually in reduced potential gross CO 2 emissions from peat. Nonetheless higher temperature resulting from climate warming may maintain high GHG emissions at plantation sites. © 2019","Carbon dynamics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use change; Peatland","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Forestry; Gas emissions; Land use; Palm oil; Peat; Tropics; Wetlands; Carbon dynamics; Carbon emissions reductions; Global temperatures; Increasing temperatures; Land-use change; Oil palm plantations; Peatland; Temperature response; Greenhouse gases; carbon flux; crop plant; decomposition; greenhouse gas; land use change; leaf litter; peat soil; peatland; plantation; soil emission; soil organic matter; soil quality; swamp forest; tropical region; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061630430

In practice, however, central governments and international policymakers have been unable to provide a successful policy architecture. Yet, city-level initiatives within the Smart City framework are a promising way to tackle climate change. An example of such a Smart City framework is the London Environment Strategy (LES). In this paper, we propose a zero mean reverting model for greenhouse gas emissions to quantitatively analyze its consistency with the 2050 Zero Carbon objectives. We consider different policy scenarios proposed in the LES and the forward-looking policy uncertainty embedded in different economic sectors, primarily domestic, industrial and commercial and transport.

AVs show potential to reduce total CO2 emissions at a network scale, approaching 4% reduction at full autonomy, assuming the same fuel technology in AV as in today’s fleet. Furthermore, it is found that this reduction is sensitive to the penetration ratio of AVs, and is greatest at full AV penetration; AV penetration may generate greater total vehicular CO2 emissions than 0% AV penetration does, contrary to popular belief.

This research evaluates the contribution of traditional strategies, and whether innovative strategies perform environmentally and economically better for this purpose. We use LCA to define a benchmark for the environmental impact, expressed as lifecycle GWP, and LCC to assess the economic impact, expressed as Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The two indicators are evaluated in a Pareto optimal method. We consider combinations of strategies for the thermal envelope, the building services, and the integration of locally available renewable energy in five existing buildings. Results show that accelerating the implementation rate of traditional strategies contributes only partially to raise the degree of certainty in reaching climate targets. For this purpose, innovative building services strategies as well as the extensive integration of local energy generation from renewable sources is required, even if the GWP reduction target of electricity from the main grid is met. The use of renewable energy has a much bigger impact on the overall GWP balance than the choice between a standard renovation and a minimal renovation of the building envelope. IRR tends to sink with GWP. We conclude that a regulated benchmark for the environmental lifecycle impact of residential building projects will help to introduce the trade-off assessment necessary to identify economically sustainable strategies that increase the level of certainty in meeting climate targets. © 2019","Building energy renovation; CO 2 emission reduction; LCA; LCC; Renewable energy","Earnings; Emission control; Housing; Life cycle; Pareto principle; Building energy; CO2 emission reduction; Innovative strategies; Internal rate of return; Renewable energies; Residential building; Sustainable strategies; Use of renewable energies; Economic and social effects; alternative energy; building; carbon dioxide; economic impact; emission control; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; residential energy; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063613143

To date, however, no analyses have focused on the economic costs and benefits of pursuing less carbon-intensive urban growth in sub-Saharan African cities. This is significant as the perception that low-carbon urban development is more expensive than higher-carbon alternatives can be enough to preclude consideration of opportunities for more sustainable development, especially in highly resource-constrained contexts. This paper examines the validity of this perception through an economic appraisal of the scope for low-carbon development in Kigali, Rwanda. We find that the city of Kigali could theoretically invest 0.6% of its GDP each year for 10 years in economically attractive mitigation measures. This would generate annual energy savings equivalent to 1.5% of its GDP and reduce city-scale emissions by 39% by 2032 (relative to business-as-usual trends). The economic case for urban climate action is therefore substantial, and although the city is in some ways unique, this suggests that promising opportunities also exist in other sub-Saharan African cities. However, few national or local governments in the region have the political will and institutional capabilities necessary to realise this mitigation potential. We also find that although potentially significant in the short to medium term, these economically attractive measures would not be sufficient to decouple economic development and greenhouse gas emissions in Kigali in the longer term. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","cities; climate change; climate change mitigation; environmental economics; greenhouse gas emissions; sub-Saharan Africa","carbon emission; climate change; economic analysis; economic development; emission control; energy conservation; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; perception; Kigali; Kigali City; Rwanda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057471579

While many studies have explored barriers that stand in the way of their implementation, the factors determining their potential to mainstream adaptation into various sectors are less clear. In the present paper, we aim to address this gap for two international, six national, and six local adaptation strategies. Based on document analyses and 35 semi-structured interviews, the 14 case studies also explore in how far the factors facilitating climate change adaptation are similar across levels of government or level-specific. Although located at three different levels of government, we find that the 14 adaptation strategies analyzed here represent “one-size-fits-all governance arrangements” that are characterized by voluntariness and a lack institutionalization. Since adaptation strategies are relatively weak coordination hubs that are unable to force adaptation onto sectoral policy agendas, they rely mainly on sectoral self-interest in adapting to climate change, largely determined by problem pressure. We conclude that one-size-fits-all governance arrangements are rarely adequate responses to complex challenges, such as climate change. Although climate change adaptation depends more on framework conditions such as problem pressure than on administrative or governance features, the findings presented here can help to understand under what circumstances adaptation is likely to make progress. © 2019 The Authors.

However, “physical-social” integrated carbon balance examinations and the link to multiangle land use change analysis are still lacking. Based on land use data, field observations, climate data, and socioeconomic data, this study performed a comprehensive analysis of land use change from the aspects of land use type, land cover and land use intensity and examined the effect on carbon storage, the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and energy consumption-related carbon emissions. Finally, this study proposed multiangle land use strategies for low-carbon development. The results show that built-up land occupation of cropland was the main land use type change pattern in Nanjing City. The period of 2005–2010 presented the most obvious land use type change. Between 2000–2015, vegetation carbon storage loss reached 8.21×104 t, with woodland shrinkage contributing the most. The initial core city and the peripheral area show the most obvious land use type changes, with decreases in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NEP. For all of Nanjing City, the NDVI followed a weak increasing trend from 2000 to 2015, and the NEP also exhibited a weak increasing trend for areas without built-up land and water. Spatially, the NDVI and NEP present similar changing trends for most grids. Land use intensities were continuously increasing, and energy-related carbon emissions increased from 4389.35×104 t in 2000 to 10145.09×104 t in 2015, with the industry sector contributing more than 80% of the total carbon emissions. In total, NEP accumulation can offset 2% of energy-related carbon emissions. Low-carbon land management should be strengthened from multi-land use aspects, including urban expansion control, ecological land protection, and land use efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon balance; Land management; Land use; Multiangle; Nanjing City","carbon balance; carbon emission; energy use; land cover; land management; land use change; net ecosystem production; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063391973

It uses a new extractant (H3A) for the extraction of plant available nutrients, a new method of soil respiration measurement (24-hr CO2 burst) using Solvita® gel system, and a new approach in determining bioavailable carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) namely water extractable organic C (WEOC) and water extractable organic N (WEON). A soil health score is calculated by combining Solvita® respiration, WEOC, and WEON data. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of HSHT to detect the management-induced changes in soil nutrient levels and soil health in the production systems of west Tennessee. We tested soils collected from a cover crop field trial established in 2013 on a no-till corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. Compared to Mehlich-1 and Mehlich-3, H3A extracted the lowest amount of soil extractable phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Neither the soil health score nor its component parameters showed significant differences between cover crop treatments and the control. In addition, the Solvita® CO2 data did not provide a reliable estimation of potentially mineralizable N. Overall, the HSHT did not detect differences in soil health due to cover cropping in west Tennessee. We conclude that HSHT, though a promising concept due to its focus on linking soil biology with soil fertility and soil health, may need extensive field evaluation and refinement in contrasting soils and climates across the US. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","24-hr CO2 burst; cover crops; H3A extractant; potentially mineralizable nitrogen; soil health; Solvita®; The Haney soil health test","agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; chemical substance; cover crop; feasibility study; measurement method; nitrogen; soil fertility; soil nutrient; soil quality; soil respiration; soil test; Tennessee; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064605600

The present research quantitatively assesses the potential impact of these strategies on primary material footprint (MF) and carbon footprint (CF) of households in areas an urban area, using the case of Brussels Capital Region (BCR), Belgium. Because the CE-strategies are linked to consumption domains, this assessment first calculates both footprints of consumption domains using a city-level input-output analysis and discusses the relationship between the footprints. The findings show that the carbon footprint of BCR in 2010 was 22 Mt CO 2 -eq. or 20.3 t/cap. The material footprint of BCR in 2010 was 31 Mt or 29.5 t/cap. Important insights are that BCR relies on its hinterland for 98% of its primary materials and 83% of the region's greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are emitted outside of its territory. The household consumption domains of food, housing and transport were identified as hotspots in both footprints. Within these domains, we calculated and discussed the potential impact on both footprints of CE-strategies on consumption or production of food, mobility and housing. Results from this case show that with these strategies Brussels could mitigate 25% of its CF and 26% of its MF, 18% of its CF and 26% of its MF, and 7% of its CF and 10% of its MF, respectively. The methodology and insights could therefore support authorities and policy-makers to effectively develop coherent and consistent action plans on consumption domains to improve resource efficiency and reduce the GHGs, simultaneously. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Input-output analysis; Material footprint; Urban area","Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Brussels Capital Region; Climate change mitigation; Household Consumption; Input output analysis; Potential effects; Primary materials; Resource efficiencies; Urban areas; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061624950

Several recent investigations have estimated that household emissions are the largest contributor to ambient PM2.5 exposure in the country. Using satellite-derived district-level PM2.5 exposure and an Eulerian photochemical dispersion model CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions), we estimate the benefit in terms of population exposure of mitigating household sources––biomass for cooking, space- and water-heating, and kerosene for lighting. Complete mitigation of emissions from only these household sources would reduce India-wide, population-weighted average annual ambient PM2.5 exposure by 17.5, 11.9, and 1.3%, respectively. Using GBD methods, this translates into reductions in Indian premature mortality of 6.6, 5.5, and 0.6%. If PM2.5 emissions from all household sources are completely mitigated, 103 (of 597) additional districts (187 million people) would meet the Indian annual air-quality standard (40 μg m−3) compared with baseline (2015) when 246 districts (398 million people) met the standard. At 38 μg m−3, after complete mitigation of household sources, compared with 55.1 μg m−3 at baseline, the mean annual national population-based concentration would meet the standard, although highly polluted areas, such as Delhi, would remain out of attainment. Our results support expansion of programs designed to promote clean household fuels and rural electrification to achieve improved air quality at regional scales, which also has substantial additional health benefits from directly reducing household air pollution exposures. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

At the Paris climate agreement in 2015, major cities were identified as a key player to decarbonise the energy generation sector. Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, within which the local government sector has a significant capacity to accelerate a transition to clean energy generation. Through a case study of a renewable energy master plan involving five urban-councils in Sydney, this study uncovers the underlying drivers and emerging project challenges behind a cooperative joint-council approach. Social and environmental responsibility was found to be the primary motivator to develop a regional renewable energy master plan. Leveraging the collective bargaining-power through a regional joint-procurement process was an equally significant motivation. The study also revealed five major challenges. Most projects are reliant on some degree of funding from commonwealth and state government grants which are often associated with political uncertainty and a lack of continuity in programs and funding. Different positions exist as to the preferred financing options for solar-systems among councils. The previous success of a collective bargaining by councils that secured below-market prices supply-contracts of fossil-based electricity, paradoxically, reduced the financial viability of the current renewable energy project. The installable roof-space of some sites was over-estimated when not considering an on-site demand and low feed-in-tariff dynamics. Insolvency risk of renewable energy suppliers was identified as a factor that could impact on the long-term success of the project. Looking forward there are opportunities for progressing clean energy generation transformation through collective action by local government. Revolving clean energy funds can be used to establish and support renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Regional collaboration can draw on existing technical expertise and institutional and political learnings. Power supply arrangements between councils should be supported through innovative governance and financial arrangements. Combined, these initiatives should be framed to distribute risks, lessen uncertainty and support innovation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate and energy policy; Energy transition; Local governments and cities; Renewable energy; Renewable investment","Electric power systems; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Industrial relations; Motivation; Regional planning; Clean energy generation; Energy transitions; Local government; Regional collaboration; Renewable energies; Renewable energy projects; Social and environmental; Urban energy systems; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062030716

We stress that soil organic carbon storage (i.e. an increase of soil organic carbon stocks) should be clearly differentiated from soil organic carbon sequestration, as the latter assumes a net removal of atmospheric CO2. Implementing management options that allow increasing soil organic carbon stocks at the local scale raises several questions, which are discussed in this article: how can we increase SOC stocks, at which rate and for how long; where do we prioritize SOC storage; how do we estimate the potential gain in C and which agricultural practices should we implement? We show that knowledge and tools are available to answer many of these questions, while further research remains necessary for others. A range of agricultural practices would require a re-assessment of their potential to store C and a better understanding of the underlying processes, such as no tillage and conservation agriculture, irrigation, practices increasing below ground inputs, organic amendments, and N fertilization. The vision emerging from the literature, showing the prominent role of soil microorganisms in the stabilization of soil organic matter, draw the attention to more exploratory potential levers, through changes in microbial physiology or soil biodiversity induced by agricultural practices, that require in-depth research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","4 per 1000 initiative; Agricultural practices; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; Carbon storage potential","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Carbon capture; Climate change; Food supply; Forestry; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soils; Stabilization; 4 per 1000 initiative; Agricultural practices; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; Climate change adaptation; Soil organic carbon sequestration; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Soil organic carbon storages; Organic carbon; adaptive management; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; climate change; food security; innovation; knowledge; management practice; organic carbon; soil fertility; soil management; soil organic matter; soil stabilization; United Nations; zero tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046371726

In this study, the MK (Mann-Kendall) test and KZ (Kolmogorov-Zurbenko) filtering analysis method were applied to evaluate the variations of PM 2.5 concentration at different sites in Beijing before and after the filtering meteorological conditions. The results showed that the averaged PM 2.5 concentrations in five sites decreased by 29.82% after filtering weather conditions, which was significantly lower than the average decrease rate (33.61%) of the original data. The emissions by human activities contributed about 69–94% to the decreased PM 2.5 concentrations during 2013–2017 at different sites in Beijing while the meteorological conditions contributed not more than 31% indicating the leading role of the emission reduction measures in the air quality improvement in Beijing. Contrary to the monthly averaged trends, the original PM 2.5 concentrations in heating seasons during 2013–2016 did not decrease obviously and not passed the significant test (α = 0.1) due to the unfavor weather conditions which always aggravated degree and duration of air pollution. In order to further improve air quality, emission reduction measures such as reducing coal combustion, reducing oil consumption, controlling vehicles, emissions reduction, and cleaning dust should be continuously promoted. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Beijing; Emission reduction; KZ filtering; Meteorology; PM 2.5",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065072172

The formation of secondary iPM2.5 is characterized by thermodynamic equilibrium gas-particle partitioning of gaseous ammonia (NH3) and aerosol ammonium (NH4 +). To develop effective strategies for controlling atmospheric PM2.5, it is essential to understand the responses of secondary iPM2.5 to different precursor gases. In southeastern North Carolina, the amount of NH3 is in excess to fully neutralize acidic gases (i.e., NH3-rich conditions). NH3-rich conditions are mainly attributed to the significant NH3 emissions in the region, especially from the large amounts of animal feeding operation (AFO). To gain a better understanding of the impact of NH3 on the formation of secondary iPM2.5 in this area, the responses of iPM2.5 to precursor gases under different ambient conditions were investigated based upon three-year monitoring data of the chemical components in iPM2.5, gaseous pollutants, and meteorological conditions. The gas ratio (GR) was used to assess the degree of neutralization via NH3, and ISORROPIA II model simulation was used to examine the responses of iPM2.5 to changes in the total NH3, the total sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the total nitric acid (HNO3). It was discovered that under different ambient temperature and humidity conditions, the responses of iPM2.5 to precursor gases vary. In general, iPM2.5 responds nonlinearly to the total NH3 but linearly to the total H2SO4 and the total HNO3. In NH3-rich regions, iPM2.5 is not sensitive to changes in the total NH3, but it is very sensitive to changes in the total H2SO4 and/or the total HNO3. Reducing the total H2SO4, as opposed to the total HNO3 or the total NH3, leads to a significant reduction in iPM2.5 and is thus a more effective strategy for decreasing the concentration of iPM2.5. This research provides insight into controlling and regulating PM2.5 in NH3-rich regions. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Ammonia; Animal feeding operations; Inorganic PM2.5; ISORROPIA II; Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling","Animals; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric humidity; Fog; Gases; Nitric acid; Animal feeding operations; Degree of neutralization; Gas-particle partitioning; Inorganic PM2.5; ISORROPIA II; Temperature and humidities; Thermodynamic equilibria; Thermodynamic equilibrium model; Ammonia; air quality; ammonia; equilibrium; gas; modeling; particulate inorganic matter; thermodynamics; North Carolina; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069175937

The 2C26 strategy implemented in March 2018 led to a mean PM2.5 concentration 16.43% lower than that during the pollution episode in March 2013, when no specific emission-reduction measures were in place. The same 2C26 strategy implemented in November 2017 led to a mean PM2.5 concentration 32.70% lower than that during the pollution episode in November 2016, when local emission-reduction measures were implemented. The results suggested that the effects of the 2C26 regional emissionreduction measures on PM2.5 reductions were influenced by a diversity of factors and could differ significantly during specific pollution episodes. Furthermore, we found the proportions of sulfate ions decreased significantly, and nitrate ions were the dominant PM2.5 components during the two 2C26 orange alert periods. Meanwhile, the relative contribution of coal combustion to PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing during the pollution episodes in March 2013, November 2016, November 2017 and March 2018 was 40 %, 34 %, 28% and 11 %, respectively, indicating that the recent ""Coal to Gas"" project and the contingent 2C26 strategy led to a dramatic decrease in coal combustion in the Beijing-Tianjin- Hebei region. On the other hand, the relative contribution of vehicle exhaust during the 2C26 orange alert periods in November 2017 and March 2018 reached 40% and 54 %, respectively. The relative contribution of local emissions to PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing also varied significantly and ranged from 49.46% to 89.35% during the four pollution episodes. These results suggested that the 2C26 regional emission-reduction strategy should be implemented with red air pollution alerts during heavy pollution episodes to intentionally reduce the dominant contribution of vehicle exhausts to PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing, while specific emissionreduction measures should be implemented accordingly for different cities within the 2C26 framework. ©Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; particulate matter; policy analysis; pollutant transport; pollution policy; source apportionment; spatial variation; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066009699

This type of catalyst has been under intensive development for use as a platinum-group-metal-free cathode catalyst in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. The KIE value derived from the Tafel method (the slopes of the semilogarithmic representation of the polarization data) is effectively 1, indicating that for this Fe-N-C electrocatalyst, the rate-determining step (RDS), i.e., first electron charge transfer, is independent of the proton/deuteron ratio (H+/D+). This finding suggests that the RDS of the Fe-N-C catalysts is not the main factor limiting its performance. Thus, through careful optimization of structure and morphology resulting in overcoming other limitations, Fe-N-C catalysts could, in principle, successfully compete with Pt-based ORR electrocatalysts. In contrast, the KIE value derived from the Koutecky-Levich method, based on the analysis of linear sweep voltammetry in the diffusion-limited region of polarization response at varied convective conditions (electrode rotating speeds), is approximately 2, thus implying that in mass-transport-controlled region of ORR, the mechanism and, hence, the RDS are H+-dependent. This behavior, combined with the understanding that Fe-N-C display multiple active sites, suggests a more complex and more limited mechanism of ORR for the sites involved in hydrogen peroxide production and further reduction, a.k.a.

The catalysts exhibiting this hydrogen peroxide production (bifunctional or 2 × 2 e-) pathway will be intermittently inferior in ORR due to the concerted proton/electron charge-transfer process as RDS. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon; Charge transfer; Chemical plants; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Hydrogen peroxide; Hydrogen production; Iron; Isotopes; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Oxygen; Peroxides; Polarization; Polyelectrolytes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Structural optimization; Charge transfer process; Electron charge transfer; Hydrogen peroxide production; Kinetic isotopic effects; Linear sweep voltammetry; Oxygen reduction reaction; Rate-determining step; Structure and morphology; Iron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065674551

There is a growing interest in exploring regulating emissions from the demand side by incentivizing consumers to reduce their energy consumptions, or to purchase power from cleaner sources through tracking carbon content of power flow in the transmission network. This paper analyzes market outcomes under two approaches: producer-based and demand-based carbon taxes. We formulate each approach as a market equilibrium model. For the consumer-based approach, the analysis assumes that a utility, procuring electricity on behalf of consumers, is subject to the carbon tax. For the producer-based approach, the producers are subject to the carbon tax, and therefore, pay for their emissions. We show that the two approaches are equivalent when the program's coverage is complete. However, when the coverage is incomplete, the consumer-based carbon tax is less effective in pricing carbon emissions owing to the fact that sales to unregulated regions are not subject to the carbon tax. Given that the transaction cost of implementing consumer-based tax is likely to be high, benefit of tracking power flows in order to estimate carbon content or footprint might not be justified even with a full coverage program. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon taxes; Climate policy; Electricity industry; Linear complementarity problem; Pigovian tax","Commerce; Costs; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Emission control; Energy utilization; Forensic science; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Climate policy; Electricity industry; Linear complementarity problems; Pigovian tax; Carbon; carbon emission; electricity industry; energy use; environmental economics; environmental policy; pollution tax; price dynamics; regulatory framework",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061269086

The hydraulic regenerative braking control strategies can reasonably distribute the ratio of hydraulic regenerative braking torque and the traditional friction torques, under the premise to ensure braking safety, the kinetic energy of the brake can be recovered and utilized efficiently, and it has good ride comfort. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","AMESim simulation; Braking energy recovery; Control strategy; Hydraulic hybrid; MATLAB/Simulink simulation; Optimization; Road tests","Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Hydraulic machinery; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Optimization; Recovery; Regenerative braking; Roads and streets; Software prototyping; Software testing; AMESim simulation; Braking energy recoveries; Control strategies; Hydraulic hybrids; Matlab/Simulink simulation; Road tests; MATLAB",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029181268

Hyperspectral measurements in the near infrared and shortwave infrared (NIR/SWIR) bands from the generation of new greenhouse gas satellites (e.g., the Chinese Global Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Scientific Experimental Satellite, TanSat) contain aerosol information for correction of scattering effects in the retrieval. Herein, a new approach is proposed for optimizing the aerosol model used in the TanSat CO2 retrieval algorithm to reduce CO2 uncertainties associated with aerosols. The weighting functions of hyperspectral observations with respect to elements in the state vector are simulated by a forward radiative transfer model. Using the optimal estimation method (OEM), the information content and each component of the CO2 column-averaged dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) retrieval errors from the TanSat simulations are calculated for typical aerosols which are described by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) inversion products at selected sites based on the a priori and measurement assumptions. The results indicate that the size distribution parameters (reff, veff), real refractive index coefficient of fine mode (ar f) and fine mode fraction (fmf) dominate the interference errors, with each causing 0.2-0.8 ppm of XCO2 errors. Given that only 4-7 degrees of freedom for signal (DFS) of aerosols can be obtained simultaneously and CO2 information decreases as more aerosol parameters are retrieved, four to seven aerosol parameters are suggested as the most appropriate for inclusion in CO2 retrieval. Focusing on only aerosol-induced XCO2 errors, forward model parameter errors, rather than interference errors, are dominant. A comparison of these errors across different aerosol parameter combination groups reveals that fewer aerosol-induced XCO2 errors are found when retrieving seven aerosol parameters. Therefore, the model selected as the optimal aerosol model includes aerosol optical depth (AOD), peak height of aerosol profile (Hp), width of aerosol profile (Hw), effective variance of fine mode aerosol (veff f), effective radius of coarse mode aerosol (reff c), coefficient a of the real part of the refractive index for the fine mode and coarse mode (ar f and ar c), with the lowest error of less than 1.7 ppm for all aerosol and surface types. For marine aerosols, only five parameters (AOD, Hp, Hw, reff c and ar c) are recommended for the low aerosol information. This optimal aerosol model therefore offers a theoretical foundation for improving CO2 retrieval precision from real TanSat observations in the future. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerosol; CO2; DFS; Error; TanSat","Carbon dioxide; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Errors; Greenhouse gases; Infrared devices; Radiative transfer; Refractive index; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol robotic networks; Hyperspectral measurements; Hyperspectral observations; Optimal estimation methods; Radiative transfer model; Refractive index coefficient; TanSat; Theoretical foundations; Aerosols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065716683

As a result, an increasing number of voluntary and governmental initiatives that penalize emission generated by businesses have been witnessed. In this research, we examine the extent to which imposing penalties on the emission of harmful pollutants can successfully reduce overall emissions in decentralized supply chains. Using a buyer–vendor supply chain framework, we show that penalizing each firm for the emissions for which it is directly responsible can sometimes lead to higher overall supply chain emissions. We show that this phenomenon occurs because firms, in their efforts to reduce their own emissions, can make decisions that adversely impact the emissions of other firms in its supply chain. Moreover, we show that centralizing the supply chain—contrary to what one may think at first glance—is not always the appropriate solution to mitigate this effect. We provide some potential remedies and evaluate their relative effectiveness. We also present a detailed numerical example using realistic problem parameter values to examine the extent to which emission reduction efforts by individual firms are successful in reducing overall emissions. © 2018","Emission penalties; Environmental policy; Inventory; OR in environment and climate change; Supply chain management","Climate change; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Supply chain management; Decentralized supply chains; Environmental policy; Governmental initiatives; Industrial activities; Inventory; Problem parameters; Scientific community; Supply chain emissions; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056706883

A critical review of these differences and the connection among them can help to bridge our knowledge between university-based researchers and protocol practitioners in accounting and taking further mitigation actions. The purpose of this study is to provide a review of published research and protocols related to city carbon accounting, paying attention to both their science and practical actions. To begin with, the most cited articles in this field are identified and analyzed by employing a citation network analysis to illustrate the development of city-level carbon accounting from three perspectives. We also reveal the relationship between research methods and accounting protocols. Furthermore, a timeline of relevant organizations, protocols, and projects is provided to demonstrate the applications of city carbon accounting in practice. The citation networks indicate that the field is dominated by pure-geographic production-based and community infrastructure-based accounting; however, emerging models that combine economic system analysis from a consumption-based perspective are leading to new trends in the field. The emissions accounted for by various research methods consist essentially of the scope 1-3, as defined in accounting protocols. The latest accounting protocols include consumption-based accounting, but most cities still limit their accounting and reporting from pure-geographic production-based and community infrastructure-based perspectives. In conclusion, we argue that protocol practitioners require support in conducting carbon accounting, so as to explore the potential in mitigation and adaptation from a number of perspectives. This should also be a priority for future studies. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Emission control; Carbon accounting; Citation networks; Critical review; Data-sources; Economic system; Carbon; accountability; action plan; carbon emission; economic system; literature review; mitigation; network analysis; carbon; carbon dioxide; city; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066155749

Air quality modelling was carried out to predict the dust concentrations that likely to arise as a result of the several mine operations. This modelling analysis enabled the effective mitigating measures to control mining related air pollution. It was observed that the main cause of particulate matter generation in the region is due to the road transportation of ore. Transportation of iron ore by conveyor belts from the pit head to the bunkers at the nearest railway siding, and thereafter from the bunkers to the user site by covered railway wagons demonstrated the best possible alternative mechanism for reducing particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) concentrations in the region. It was predicted that concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2.5 would be below or slightly higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in most of the surroundings and higher within mine leasehold areas. Air pollution levels can be minimized by implementing effective control measures. Consequently, it was suggested that all the existing working mines as well as proposed operative mines in the region should use the transportation from mine to the nearest railway siding by covered conveyor belts and bunker loading systems with the use of scientific dust suppression systems at transfer points. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Control measures; Dispersion modelling; Impact assessment; Iron ore mines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057434032

Several measures have been undertaken to address climate change in China, including the establishment of a carbon trading system. Since 2013, eight regional carbon emissions markets have been established, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Chongqing, Hubei and Fujian. The Central Government announced a national carbon emissions market, with power generation as the first industry to be considered. However, as carbon emissions prices in the eight regional markets are very different, for a variety of administrative reasons, it is essential to create a procedure for establishing a national carbon emissions price. The regional markets are pioneers, and their experience will play important roles in establishing a national carbon emissions market, with national prices based on regional prices, turnovers and volumes. The paper considers two sources of regional data for China's carbon allowances, which are based on primary and secondary data sources, and compares their relative strengths and weaknesses. The paper establishes national carbon emissions prices based on the primary and secondary regional prices, for the first time, and compares both national prices and regional prices against each other. The carbon emission prices in Hubei, Guangdong, Shenzhen and Tianjin are highly correlated with the national prices based on the primary and secondary sources. Establishing national carbon emissions prices should be very helpful for the national carbon emissions market that is under construction in China, as well as for other regions and countries worldwide. For purposes of establishing a single indicative price for carbon emissions in China, the empirical results suggest that the Arithmetic Mean of the National Primary and Secondary prices leads to the optimal prices for carbon emissions in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","C22; C58; Energy; Energy finance; G12; National pricing policy; Pricing Chinese carbon emissions; Provincial decisions; Q35; Q48; Volatility","Carbon; Climate change; Emission control; Carbon emissions; Energy; Energy finances; Pricing policy; Provincial decisions; Volatility; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062071490

However, immense discrepancies between political commitments and governmental action remain. Combined national climate commitments fall far short of the Paris Agreement's 1.5/2°C targets. Similar political ambition gaps persist across various areas of sustainable development. Many therefore argue that actions by nonstate actors, such as businesses and investors, cities and regions, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), are crucial. These voices have resonated across the United Nations (UN) system, leading to growing recognition, promotion, and mobilization of such actions in ever greater numbers. This article investigates optimistic arguments about nonstate engagement, namely: (a) “the more the better”; (b) “everybody wins”; (c) “everyone does their part”; and (d) “more brings more.” However, these optimistic arguments may not be matched in practice due to governance risks. The current emphasis on quantifiable impacts may lead to the under-appreciation of variegated social, economic, and environmental impacts. Claims that everybody stands to benefit may easily be contradicted by outcomes that are not in line with priorities and needs in developing countries. Despite the seeming depoliticization of the role of nonstate actors in implementation, actions may still lead to politically contentious outcomes. Finally, nonstate climate and sustainability actions may not be self-reinforcing but may heavily depend on supporting mechanisms. The article concludes with governance risk-reduction strategies that can be combined to maximize nonstate potential in sustainable and climate-resilient transformations.

However, these trades redistribute where emissions are generated, which has important implications for welfare because many pollutants have differential environmental and health impacts depending on where they are emitted. This paper compiles and analyzes a national data set of power plant emissions in order to assess how the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) cap-and-trade program involving nine states in the United States, impacts the emissions and damages from copollutants. Our results suggest that, in addition to achieving its goal of reducing CO 2 , the program has lowered the quantity of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions as well as associated damages in the policy region. However, two factors diminish the overall benefits from the program. First, within the RGGI region, trading shifts electricity generation to locations with higher marginal damages for SO 2 . Second, there is leakage of electricity generation and emissions to nearby states, although this latter effect is more modest than ex ante analyses predicted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cap-and-trade; Copollutants; Pollution damages","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Electric power generation; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Sulfur dioxide; Cap and trade; Cap-and-trade program; Co-pollutants; Electricity generation; Ex-ante analysis; Pollution damage; Power-plant emissions; Unintended consequences; Gas emissions; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; emission control; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; pollutant; sulfur dioxide; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061341403

The answers to the questionnaire were statistically analyzed, investigating also the influence of gender, age and BMI on human climate perception. We also used the adaptive thermal comfort model for Southeast Asia, with the purpose of understanding the thermal environment and verifying its use for the hot and humid region of the Brazilian Amazon. The results indicated that although the riverside residents perceive a thermally uncomfortable environment and prefer a cooler environment, they accept the climate situation, which raised points that are discussed along the article. Likewise, it was observed that the adaptive comfort model used is a positive instrument for the development of architecture when associated with the use of bioclimatic strategies.

Using a semi-systematic literature review, Gap Analysis and multilevel meta-analysis, we assessed the status of empirical knowledge on the direct effects of climate change on 37 high-value species targeted by European fisheries and aquaculture sectors operating in marine and freshwater regions. Knowledge on potential climate change-related drivers (single or combined) on several responses (vital rates) across four categories (exploitation sector, region, life stage, species), was considerably unbalanced as well as biased, including a low number of studies (a) examining the interaction of abiotic factors, (b) offering opportunities to assess local adaptation, (c) targeting lower-value species. The meta-analysis revealed that projected warming would increase mean growth rates in fish and mollusks and significantly elevate metabolic rates in fish. Decreased levels of dissolved oxygen depressed rates of growth and metabolism across coherent species groups (e.g., small pelagics, etc.) while expected declines in pH reduced growth in most species groups and increased mortality in bivalves. The meta-analytical results were influenced by the study design and moderators (e.g., life stage, season). Although meta-analytic tools have become increasingly popular, when performed on the limited available data, these analyses cannot grasp relevant population effects, even in species with a long history of study. We recommend actions to overcome these shortcomings and improve mechanistic (cause-and-effect) projections of climate impacts on fish and shellfish. © 2019 The Authors.

Water balances, tidal regime, geomorphology, anthropic modifications, salts in the soils and vegetation in each salt marsh were compared in order to determine how the natural and anthropic factors condition the salinization of the marshes. In addition, the way in which these factors affect the distribution of the communities of plants was studied. The climatic conditions are humid and arid along the northern and southern Argentine Atlantic coast. The tidal conditions were micro-tidal in the Ajó River associated with the Río de la Plata Estuary, meso-tidal in Bahía Blanca, and macro-tidal in San Antonio and Fracasso salt marshes. It is expected that, under natural conditions, the formation of salts in soils will present a higher increase in the south (arid and macro-tidal) than in the north (humid and micro to meso-tidal). However, the results obtained show that the anthropic factors associated with the construction of embankments in the northern marshes modify their hydrological functioning, and generate conditions which favour the processes of salinization, causing considerable changes in the distribution of the communities of plants. Thereby, future research should be aimed to improve the development of engineering structures that will not affect the salt marsh environments nor the ecosystem services the salt marshes provide. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Changes in vegetation; Coastal wetlands; Embankments; Soil salinization","Ecosystems; Embankments; Estuaries; Salts; Soils; Vegetation; Climatic conditions; Coastal wetlands; Construction of embankments; Ecosystem services; Engineering structures; Natural conditions; Soil salinization; Tidal conditions; Wetlands; anthropogenic effect; climate conditions; coastal wetland; ecosystem service; ecozone; embankment; humid environment; intertidal environment; pedogenesis; plant community; salinization; saltmarsh; vegetation dynamics; Argentina; Atlantic Coast [South America]; Bahia Blanca Estuary; Bahia Blanca [(INL) Buenos Aires]; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; Chubut; Rio de la Plata; Valdes Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060980084

Only a few trajectories (&lt;10%) dynamically deviated and did not sample this σ-complex structure and resulted in direct methane reductive elimination/dissociation. This indicates that the Rh-methane σ-complex is directly dynamically connected to the Rh-methyl hydride reductive coupling transition state and is not the result of methane rebound due to a solvent cage. Unexpectedly, trajectories that resulted in a Rh-methane σ-complex occurred with paddle ball motion where methane began to leave the Rh coordination sphere but then returned to the σ-complex, and so the distinction between reductive coupling and elimination is blurred. Trajectories also revealed that immediately after reductive coupling, there is relatively fast methane tumbling motion that generally sampled η1-C,H- and η2-C,H-type structures, and this motion is correlated with the paddle ball motion. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Coordination reactions; Dynamics; Hydrides; Methane; Trajectories; Coordination sphere; Dynamics simulation; Hydride complexes; Reaction pathways; Reductive couplings; Reductive elimination; Tumbling motion; Type structures; Rhodium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064982916

Nevertheless, the role of air pollution, both form urban and industrial sources, needs to be addressed. Numerous studies have concluded that long-term exposure to air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for lung cancer mortality. Still, there are only a few studies on air pollution and lung cancer in Portugal and none addressing its spatial dimension. The goal was to determine the influence of air pollution and urbanization rate on lung cancer mortality. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was performed to evaluate the relation between particle matter10 (PM10) emissions and lung cancer mortality relative risk (RR) for males and females in Portugal between 2007 and 2011. RR was computed with the BYM model. For a more in-depth analysis, the urbanization rate and the percentage of industrial area in each municipality were added. GWR efforts led to identifying three variables that were statistically significant in explaining lung cancer relative risk mortality, PM10 emissions, urbanization rate and the percentage of industrial area with an adjusted R2 of 0,63 for men and 0,59 for women. A small set of 8 municipalities with high correlation values was also identified (local R2 above 0,70). Stronger relationships were found in the north-western part of mainland Portugal. The local R2 tends to be higher when the emissions of PM10 are joined by urbanization and industrial areas. However, when assessing the industrial areas alone, it was noted that its impact was lower overall. As one of the first communications on this subject in Portugal, we have identified municipalities where possible impacts of air pollution on lung cancer mortality RR are higher thereby highlighting the role of geography and spatial analysis in explaining the associations between a disease and its determinants. © D.

The indoor PM2.5 concentration in two periods of 2013 in Wuhan city was simulated by cigarette burning in a series of sealed chambers. Six common indoor potted plants were selected as samples to investigate the effect of plants on PM2.5 decline. The effects of potted plants on PM2.5 decline were analyzed from three aspects: plant species, leaf characteristics and relative humidity. The results show that the presence of potted plants accelerated the decline of PM2.5. The additional removal rates (excluding gravity sedimentation of PM2.5 itself) for Aloe vera and Epipremnum aureum were 5.2% and 30% respectively, when the initial PM2.5 concentration was around 200 μg/m3. The corresponding values were 0% and 17.2%, respectively, when the initial PM2.5 was around 300 μg/m3. Epipremnum aureum was the optimum potted plant for PM2.5 sedimentation, due to its rough and groove leaf surface, highest LAI (leaf area index, 2.27), and strong humidifying capacity (i.e., can promote chamber humidity to 65% in 30-60 minutes.). Actual indoor studies have also confirmed that a certain amount of Epipremnum aureum can promote the decrease of indoor PM2.5.

Yet when applied to DRM reaction under realistic conditions, it is of great challenge overcoming the related durability problems due to sintering and coke deposition. Atomically thin meshed-like Co coating catalytic structure is designed and fabricated to decorate Ni nanoparticles via atomic layer deposition. The coating structure improves the catalytic activity and effectively eliminates carbon deposition for the DRM reaction. Optimized catalytic performance is achieved by fine tuning the density of Co coating on nickel particles. The meshed coating structure partitions the Ni surface to prevent continuous carbon nanotubes network formation. The Co component helps stabilizing the metallic phase of Ni in the DRM reaction. The Co-Ni interfaces created are beneficial for reducing carbon intermediates CHx formation and accelerate carbon removal.

This trend deviates from the emissions trajectory required to fulfill the climate change goals to maintain the earth's temperature below 2-degrees. The transport sector accounts for about a quarter of these emissions but its the sector with the highest dependence on fossil-fuels. In order to reduce emissions, several approaches have been taken, from increasing fuel efficiency to the use of alternative fuels altogether. The most recent trend leans towards electrifiying the transport sector. High penetration of mature renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar photovoltaics as well as energy storage improvements are leading the way. While mass adoption of electric-propulsion systems for boats are still years away, recent pilot projects suggest that electrifying boats for passenger transportation may be not only a sustainable transport solution but its lower operation costs could facilitate its penetration on densely populated coastal and river cities where conventional public transport systems are reaching their full capacity. © 2019 IEEE.","Electric propulsion; Electric vehicles; Energy Storage; Maritime transport; Passenger ferry; Sustainable transportation; Waterborne transportation","Alternative fuels; Boats; Climate change; Earth (planet); Electric propulsion; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Intelligent systems; Mass transportation; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Electric propulsion systems; Maritime transport; Passenger ferries; Passenger transportation; Public transport systems; Renewable energy technologies; Sustainable transport; Sustainable transportation; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067109915

However, our understanding of the full suite of processes underpinning carbon exchange with the atmosphere and near shore-waters, the allocation of carbon in mangroves, and fluxes of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) are limited to a handful of studies. This constrains the scientific basis from which to advocate for greater support for and investment in mangrove restoration and conservation. Improving understanding is urgently needed given the on-going landuse pressures mangrove forests face, particularly throughout much of Southeast Asia. The current study reduces uncertainties by providing a holistic synthesis of the net potential GHG mitigation benefits resulting from rehabilitating mangroves and established forests. Rehabilitating sites from two contrasting locations representative of high (Tiwoho) and low (Tanakeke) productivity systems on the island of Sulawesi (Indonesia) were used as case studies to compare against established mangroves. A carbon budget, allocation and pathways model was developed to account for inputs (carbon sequestration) and outputs (GHG emissions of CO 2 , N 2 O and CH 4 ) to estimate Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) and Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance (NECB). Our results indicate that while Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites and established mangroves represent a significant carbon sink (−10.6 ± 0.9 Mg CO 2 e ha −1 y −1 and 16.1 Mg CO 2 e ha −1 y −1 respectively), the low productivity of Tanakeke has resulted in minimal reductions to date (0.7 ± 0.3 Mg CO 2 e ha −1 y −1 ). Including NEP from mangrove-allied primary producer communities (e.g. benthic algae) and the portion of dissolved inorganic carbon exported from mangroves (EX DIC ) that remains within the water column may drive overall removals considerably upwards in established forests to −37.2 Mg CO 2 e ha −1 y −1 . These values are higher than terrestrial forests and strengthen the evidence base needed to underpin the use of forest carbon financing mechanisms for mangrove restoration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon allocation and pathways; CO 2 , N 2 O and CH 4 emissions; Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB); Net ecosystem production; Restored and mature mangroves","Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Conservation; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Magnesium; Patient rehabilitation; Productivity; Restoration; Sanitary sewers; Carbon allocation; Carbon sequestration; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Ecosystem carbons; Financing mechanisms; Net ecosystem production; Restored and mature mangroves; Tropical rain forest; Forestry; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; biomass allocation; carbon balance; carbon emission; environmental restoration; greenhouse gas; mangrove; nature conservation; net ecosystem production; nitrogen oxides; biomass; carbon allocation; carbon balance; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; controlled study; ecosystem restoration; environmental management; environmental protection; foliage; Indonesia; land use; mangrove; nonhuman; priority journal; productivity; Review; Southeast Asia; air pollutant; analysis; carbon sequestration; environmental protection; forest; greenhouse gas; metabolism; tree; wetland; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; algae; Rhizophoraceae; Air Pollutants; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Indonesia; Trees; Wetlands",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061438839

This paper illustrates the definition of the LESER and establishes an implementation framework for LESER to improve the manufacturing process. To quantify and evaluate performance of LESER, the state space model of the carbon footprint for energy consumption and waste discharge is established. A method for implementing the LESER strategy is constructed in the following steps: (i) clarification of the current situation; (ii) analysis of the root cause; (iii) improvement; (iv) evaluation of the carbon emissions; (v) sustaining and standardizing. Finally, the LESER strategy is applied to the Zcrubber Group Co. Ltd., which is characterized with high pollution, high energy consumption, and high emission in green transition.

Hence, the sustainability of biogas digester is under questioned. The objective of this research is to analyse the environmental load effects of the biogas digester installation, maintenance and utilization from industrial wastewater of small-scale tapioca industry along with the replacement of fossil fuel as the energy source. Furthermore, this research was conducted by life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA is a support tool to assist the decision-makers to understand and improve the environmental impact of a technology/service. The study started from the beginning of life until the end of the product lifespan (including the construction process, and maintenance). Hence, this study found that the emission from the installation and maintenance of small-scale biogas digester contribute to +18.5 Kt CO2 eq. The biggest contributors of greenhouse gasses (GHG) are geomembrane HDPE and gasoline. On the other hand, the utilisation of biogas to fuel the tapioca drying process and replace fossil fuel (LPG) could significantly reduce the GHG with a total reduction of 296 Kt CO2 eq for one life cycle (15 years). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Bioenergy; Biogas; life cycle assessment; Sustainable energy; wastewater","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Industrial research; Liquefied petroleum gas; Maintenance; Materials handling; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Wastewater; Bio-energy; Construction process; Environmental footprints; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Industrial wastewaters; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sustainable energy; Transportation process; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066304850

These humidity levels affect combustion parameters in premixed combustion systems such as laminar burning velocity, adiabatic flame temperature, and pollutant emissions. The greatest effect of water in the reaction zone is the reduction of NOx formation (at equilibrium) by up to 40% through the thermal mechanism for lean mixtures. The laminar burning velocity is reduced by up to 25% at an equivalence ratio of 0.5 and a molar moisture content of 3.5%. This effect is reduced near the stoichiometric point due to the higher adiabatic flame temperature. The natural gas mixtures from the Cusiana and Guajira fields were analyzed. The same combustion property changes were obtained for both fuels when the reaction zone water content was varied. However, the Cusiana gas had a higher absolute flame temperature, laminar flame speed, and pollutant emissions than the Guajira gas, due to its greater heavy hydrocarbon content. This work presents the analysis and the resulting favorable-combustion map for the regions of Colombia. Therein is shown that Bogotá and its surroundings are the most prone to NOx emissions due to the region's low atmospheric moisture content; less than 1.5% molar fraction. As a consequence, this area should implement tightened emissions monitoring and regulation. In contrast, the Atlantic coast and the Magdalena river valley are the regions of Colombia that have the best conditions for combustion due to their high moisture content; greater than 3.5% molar fraction. This makes them the preferred regions for the installation of combustion systems and thermal power generation plants from the point of view of minimizing operational instabilities and pollutant emissions. For example, at high pressure and temperature, the humidity has an appreciable effect on the laminar flame speed, reducing it by up to 25% at the equivalence ratio of 0.5. This effect lessens as the mixture shifts towards the stoichiometric point due to the higher adiabatic flame temperature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Colombian gas pipe network; Industrial development; Natural gas; NOx; Premixed combustion","Atmospheric humidity; Fuel systems; Gas emissions; High pressure effects; Moisture; Moisture determination; Molar ratio; Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Natural gasoline plants; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Atmospheric moisture content; Gas pipe networks; High-pressure and temperatures; Industrial development; Laminar burning velocity; Magdalena River Valleys; Premixed combustion; Thermal power generation; Adiabatic flame temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061031399

Although clear standards of new building construction and retrofitting options have been developed and are able to reduce building emissions, there is need for a clear prioritisation of policy options capable of delivering the greatest reduction in emissions at minimal costs. This requires an assessment of the trade-offs between new construction and retrofitting in terms of the pace of adoption of improved building standards and the emissions savings achieved to meet current climate targets. In this paper, a dynamic material flow analysis is used to explore the impact of combined mitigation strategies on both new and existing buildings capable of reducing embodied and operational emissions in the English domestic housing stock. The results show that progress in the use of low carbon materials in construction and the deployment of zero-carbon buildings at scale would not be enough to deliver a reduction of building emissions of the scale required nationally (–66% from current levels by 2050). Improvement in building standards for both new and pre-existing construction is essential to meet targets, but its costs are likely to be unreasonable without a reduction in the demand for floor area per capita by promoting flexible design of buildings, house sharing or telecommuting, which are likely to produce far-reaching implications in social organisation and urban planning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Buildings; Dwelling stocks; Emissions; Material flow analysis; New construction; Retrofitting","Building codes; Buildings; Carbon; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Particulate emissions; Retrofitting; Building construction; Building standards; Dwelling stocks; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Material flow analysis; Mitigation strategy; New constructions; Process emissions; Construction; carbon; building; construction; emission control; greenhouse gas; housing; material flow analysis; Article; building industry; carbon footprint; city planning; controlled study; environmental management; flow measurement; housing; social structure; standardization; statistical model; telecommuting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061372207

In this paper, we argue that the role of discourses has been overlooked in the literature on carbon lock-in. We argue that discourses are both part of lock-in mechanisms and, using the concept of discursive turning points, important factors in explaining change. This implies that we need to carefully investigate the dominant discourses that constitute and justify the very technologies, institutions and behaviors of the status quo. For the case of the German energy transition, we demonstrate the importance of discursive turning points for overcoming carbon lock-in, based on a literature review. Germany's long-standing lock-in of fossil fuels and nuclear power was undermined by the rise of the energy transition discourse. This discourse transitioned from a very marginal position to dominance through a number of factors, winning against the energy mix discourse. Over time the energy transition discourse became de-radicalized. Coal has been able to defend its role in the German energy mix in the name of affordability and energy security. While renewables continue to grow, this happens alongside a remaining carbon lock-in. We conclude that discursive lock-in and discursive turning points are useful analytical tools that help to explain how the transition to renewable energies unfolds. In future research, the interaction between discursive lock-ins and other types of lock-in should be investigated.

To date, no systematic review has assessed the effectiveness of interventions aiming to reduce ambient air pollution. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ambient particulate matter air pollution in reducing pollutant concentrations and improving associated health outcomes. Search methods We searched a range of electronic databases with diverse focuses, including health and biomedical research (CENTRAL, Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO), multidisciplinary research (Scopus, Science Citation Index), social sciences (Social Science Citation Index), urban planning and environment (Greenfile), and LMICs (GlobalHealth Library regional indexes, WHOLIS). Additionally, we searched grey literature databases, multiple online trial registries, references of included studies and the contents of relevant journals in an attempt to identify unpublished and ongoing studies, and studies not identified by our search strategy. The final search date for all databases was 31 August 2016. Selection criteria Eligible for inclusion were randomized and cluster randomized controlled trials, as well as several non-randomized study designs, including controlled interrupted time-series studies (cITS-EPOC), interrupted time-series studies adhering to EPOC standards (ITSEPOC), interrupted time-series studies not adhering to EPOC standards (ITS), controlled before-after studies adhering to EPOC standards (CBA-EPOC), and controlled before-after studies not adhering to EPOC standards (CBA); these were classified as main studies. Additionally, we included uncontrolled before-after studies (UBA) as supporting studies. We included studies that evaluated interventions to reduce ambient air pollution from industrial, residential, vehicular and multiple sources, with respect to their effect on mortality,morbidity and several air pollutant concentrations.We did not restrict studies based on the population, setting or comparison. Data collection and analysis After a calibration exercise among the author team, two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted data extraction, risk of bias assessment and evidence synthesis only for main studies; we mapped supporting studies with regard to the types of intervention and setting. To assess risk of bias, we used theGraphic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiological studies (GATE) for correlation studies, as modified and employed by the Centre for Public Health Excellence at the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). For each intervention category, i.e. those targeting industrial, residential, vehicular and multiple sources, we synthesized evidence narratively, as well as graphically using harvest plots. Main results We included 42 main studies assessing 38 unique interventions. These were heterogeneous with respect to setting; interventions were implemented in countries across the world, but most (79%) were implemented in HICs, with the remaining scattered across LMICs. Most interventions (76%) were implemented in urban or community settings. We identified a heterogeneous mix of interventions, including those aiming to address industrial (n = 5), residential (n = 7), vehicular (n = 22), and multiple sources (n = 4). Some specific interventions, such as low emission zones and stove exchanges, were assessed by several studies, whereas others, such as a wood burning ban, were only assessed by a single study. Most studies assessing health and air quality outcomes used routine monitoring data. Studies assessing health outcomes mostly investigated effects in the general population, while few studies assessed specific subgroups such as infants, children and the elderly. No identified studies assessed unintended or adverse effects. The judgements regarding the risk of bias of studies were mixed. Regarding health outcomes, we appraised eight studies (47%) as having no substantial risk of bias concerns, five studies (29%) as having some risk of bias concerns, and four studies (24%) as having serious risk of bias concerns. Regarding air quality outcomes, we judged 11 studies (31%) as having no substantial risk of bias concerns, 16 studies (46%) as having some risk of bias concerns, and eight studies (23%) as having serious risk of bias concerns. The evidence base, comprising non-randomized studies only, was of low or very low certainty for all intervention categories and primary outcomes. The narrative and graphical synthesis showed that evidence for effectiveness was mixed across the four intervention categories. For interventions targeting industrial, residential and multiple sources, a similar pattern emerged for both health and air quality outcomes, with essentially all studies observing either no clear association in either direction or a significant association favouring the intervention. The evidence base for interventions targeting vehicular sources was more heterogeneous, as a small number of studies did observe a significant association favouring the control. Overall, however, the evidence suggests that the assessed interventions do not worsen air quality or health. Authors’ conclusions Given the heterogeneity across interventions, outcomes, and methods, it was difficult to derive overall conclusions regarding the effectiveness of interventions in terms of improved air quality or health.Most included studies observed either no significant association in either direction or an association favouring the intervention, with little evidence that the assessed interventions might be harmful. The evidence base highlights the challenges related to establishing a causal relationship between specific air pollution interventions and outcomes. In light of these challenges, the results on effectiveness should be interpreted with caution; it is important to emphasize that lack of evidence of an association is not equivalent to evidence of no association. We identified limited evidence for several world regions, notably Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia; decision-makers should prioritize the development and implementation of interventions in these settings. In the future, as new policies are introduced, decision-makers should consider a built-in evaluation component, which could facilitate more systematic and comprehensive evaluations. These could assess effectiveness, but also aspects of feasibility, fidelity and acceptability. The production of higher quality and more uniform evidence would be helpful in informing decisions. Researchers should strive to sufficiently account for confounding, assess the impact of methodological decisions through the conduct and communication of sensitivity analyses, and improve the reporting of methods, and other aspects of the study, most importantly the description of the intervention and the context in which it is implemented. © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"black carbon; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; air quality; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cause of death; combustion; concentration (parameter); cooking; decision making; domestic waste; environmental exposure; environmental policy; exhaust gas; health hazard; heating; high income country; industrial waste; particulate matter; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; Review; air pollution; epidemiology; health status; human; particulate matter; prevention and control; randomized controlled trial (topic); Air Pollution; Health Status; Humans; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Particulate Matter; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066826359

With the increasing number of electric vehicles, the charging infrastructure has to be fundamentally adjusted. Due to the changing loads on the electricity network, the scarcity of available places for charging stations and a major investment at the beginning of the overall installation, a planning and an optimized distribution of such wireless charging stations are indispensable and more than justified. This paper presents a study discussing the necessary measures and distribution optimization plan of wireless charging systems in an urban environment. This is done considering the economical aspects. The study considers a hypothetical scenario being that 80% of the vehicles are actually electric. Therefore, we use the geographical distribution of the existing fuel stations as a start point for our infrastructure optimization.

The field has advanced immensely in recent years, taking significant strides towards commercial realization. Catalyst innovations have played a pivotal role in these advances, with a steady stream of new catalysts providing gains in CO2 conversion efficiencies and selectivities of both C1 and C2 products. Comparatively few of these catalysts have been tested at commercially-relevant current densities (∼200 mA cm-2) due to transport limitations in traditional testing configurations and a research focus on fundamental catalyst kinetics, which are measured at substantially lower current densities. A catalyst's selectivity and activity, however, have been shown to be highly sensitive to the local reaction environment, which changes drastically as a function of reaction rate. As a consequence of this, the surface properties of many CO2 reduction catalysts risk being optimized for the wrong operating conditions. The goal of this perspective is to communicate the substantial impact of reaction rate on catalytic behaviour and the operation of gas-diffusion layers for the CO2 reduction reaction. In brief, this work motivates high current density catalyst testing as a necessary step to properly evaluate materials for electrochemical CO2 reduction, and to accelerate the technology toward its envisioned application of neutralizing CO2 emissions on a global scale. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Current density; Diffusion in gases; Reaction rates; Reduction; Catalytic behaviour; Catalytic performance; Gas diffusion electrodes; Gas diffusion layers; High current densities; Operating condition; Testing configurations; Transport limitations; Catalyst selectivity; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; catalysis; catalyst; diffusion; electrode; electrokinesis; performance assessment; reaction rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061969158

Glacier- and snow-fed rivers are one of the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change, and can provide early warning of wider-scale changes. These rivers are frequently used for hydropower production but there is minimal understanding of how biological communities are influenced by climate change in a context of flow regulation. This study sheds light on this issue by disentangling structural (water temperature preference, taxonomic composition, alpha, beta and gamma diversities) and functional (functional traits, diversity, richness, evenness, dispersion and redundancy) effects of climate change in interaction with flow regulation in the Alps. For this, we compared environmental and aquatic invertebrate data collected in the 1970s and 2010s in regulated and unregulated alpine catchments. We hypothesized a replacement of cold-adapted species by warming-tolerant ones, high temporal and spatial turnover in taxa and trait composition, along with reduced taxonomic and functional diversities in consequence of climate change. We expected communities in regulated rivers to respond more drastically due to additive or synergistic effects between flow regulation and climate change. We found divergent structural but convergent functional responses between free-flowing and regulated catchments. Although cold-adapted taxa decreased in both of them, greater colonization and spread of thermophilic species was found in the free-flowing one, resulting in higher spatial and temporal turnover. Since the 1970s, taxonomic diversity increased in the free flowing but decreased in the regulated catchment due to biotic homogenization. Colonization by taxa with new functional strategies (i.e. multivoltine taxa with small body size, resistance forms, aerial dispersion and reproduction by clutches) increased functional diversity but decreased functional redundancy through time. These functional changes could jeopardize the ability of aquatic communities facing intensification of ongoing climate change or new anthropogenic disturbances. © 2019 The Authors.

These exposures, in turn, can affect risks for a variety of human diseases and health outcomes. Climate epidemiology plays an important role in informing policy related to climate change and its threats to public health. Climate epidemiology leverages deep, integrated collaborations between epidemiologists and climate scientists to understand the current and potential future impacts of climate-related exposures on human health. A variety of recent and ongoing developments in climate science are creating new avenues for epidemiologic contributions. Here, we discuss the contributions of climate epidemiology and describe some key current research directions, including research to better characterize uncertainty in climate health projections. We end by outlining 3 developing areas of climate science that are creating opportunities for high-impact epidemiologic advances in the near future: 1) climate attribution studies, 2) subseasonal to seasonal forecasts, and 3) decadal predictions. © 2019 The Author(s).","adaptation; climate; climate change; climate epidemiology; climate projections; extreme events; temperature; weather","climate change; epidemiology; extreme event; natural disaster; nature-society relations; public health; temperature effect; climate; climate change; climate epidemiology; environmental policy; environmental temperature; epidemiology; exposure; forecasting; health; human; prediction; Review; seasonal variation; weather; cooperation; population dynamics; public relations; season; socioeconomics; temperature; uncertainty; Climate Change; Cooperative Behavior; Epidemiology; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Socioeconomic Factors; Temperature; Uncertainty",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064522915

In this context, the possibility to obtain bio-alcohols from non-edible residues of food and plants is particularly attractive for gasoline replacement in SI (Spark Ignition) engines. Such bio-fuels are characterized by higher laminar flame speed (LFS) and octane rating, resulting in improved thermal efficiency and reduced regulated emissions. Low-carbon alcohols (e.g. ethanol) are disadvantageous as gasoline replacement due to poor energy density and high corrosive action on distribution pipelines, whereas high-carbon ones (e.g. n-butanol) are particularly promising candidates thanks to the physical properties and the energy density closer to those of gasoline. High latent heat of vaporization and low saturation pressure are the most relevant weaknesses of n-butanol related to gasoline replacement in DISI (Direct Injection SI) power units. On equal injection pressure and phasing, the slow evaporation rate of n-butanol leads to poor mixture preparation and larger fuel deposits. In particular, this is emphasized by low charge and wall temperatures during part load operation, reducing combustion efficiency and promoting the formation of pollutant particles. Split injection is a promising strategy to improve charge preparation contemporary reducing fuel deposits and improving mixture homogeneity, mostly for low-evaporating fuels. In the present work different split injection strategies are tested in an optically accessible SI engine fueled with n-butanol and simulated through CFD with the aim of identifying trends and understanding the root causes behind measured behaviors. CFD simulations help in understanding changes in charge stratification using different injection strategies, allowing to explain both combustion behavior and soot formation tendency from the analysis of fuel distribution. Mixture quality in the spark region and the presence of very rich mixture pockets in the combustion chamber are identified as the most critical aspects that should be optimized when changing the injection strategy; this in turn contributes to avoid slow burn rates or excessive soot production during operation with low evaporating fuels such as n-butanol. A strong correlation between diffusive flames and rich mixture pockets is found in terms of both location and intensity, proving the first order role of fuel deposits formation and mixture homogenization on both combustion development and soot formation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Butanol; CFD simulation; Direct injection; Spark ignition engine; Split injection strategy","Butenes; Carbon; Combustion chambers; Computational fluid dynamics; Deposits; Diesel engines; Gasoline; Internal combustion engines; Mixtures; Oils and fats; Pipeline corrosion; Soot; CFD simulations; Charge stratification; Combustion efficiencies; Experimental and numerical studies; Improved thermal efficiencies; Latent heat of vaporization; Mixture homogenizations; Split injection strategy; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060476101

This review suggests that these stocks are currently growing in primary forests at rates that have decreased in recent decades. Droughts are an important mechanism in reducing forest C uptake and stocks by decreasing photosynthesis, elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires. Tropical forests were a C source to the atmosphere during the 2015-2016 El Niño-related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released. With continued climate change, the intensity and frequency of droughts and fires will likely increase. It is unclear at what point the impacts of severe, repeated disturbances by drought and fires could exceed tropical forests' capacity to recover. Although specific threshold conditions beyond which ecosystem properties could lead to alternative stable states are largely unknown, the growing body of scientific evidence points to such threshold conditions becoming more likely as climate and land use change across the tropics. ▪ Droughts have reduced forest carbon uptake and stocks by elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires. ▪ Threshold conditions beyond which tropical forests are pushed into alternative stable states are becoming more likely as effects of droughts intensify. © 2019 by Annual Reviews.

Species can be identified using taxonomic keys and molecular methods. The genus includes 52 species and subspecies colonising conifers and non-conifer trees in many areas in the world, among which five species are present in the EU. The non-EU species are listed in Annex IAI of Council Directive 2000/29/EC as Choristoneura spp. (non-European). Some Choristoneura species are important defoliators in North America, mainly on conifers but also on several broadleaf tree species and on non-forest crops. Females lay eggs in batches on the needles or the leaves, and overwintering occurs at the larval stage in a silken hibernaculum. Most species are univoltine, some are bivoltine and at least one subspecies has a 2-year life cycle. Pupation occurs on the twigs of conifers or in folded leaves of broadleaf trees. The adults are strong flyers, and the larvae can disperse by ballooning. The main pathways for entry are plants for planting, cut branches, fruits of host plants (including cones), round wood with bark and bark. Suitable host plants and climate would allow the establishment in the EU of the known, North American harmful species. Non-EU Choristoneura spp. satisfy all the criteria to be considered as Union quarantine pests. Measures are in place to prevent the introduction of non-EU Choristoneura spp. through the pathways described above. As non-EU Choristoneura spp. are not present in the EU and plants for planting are not the major pathway for spread, non-EU Choristoneura spp. do not meet the criteria to be considered as regulated non-quarantine pests. © 2019 European Food Safety Authority.

However, given the low prices of wood, the Swiss forest industry is unwilling to produce more, despite the important potential of wood mobilization. Financial incentives may help meet the goals of both environmental and economic sustainability, if actors respond to price changes. To estimate demand and supply price- and cross-elasticities on the market for roundwood in Switzerland, we use a rich yearly time series data set covering the period 1949–2013. We consider both short term and long term relationships, thanks to a lagged adjustment model and correct for the price endogeneity using a supply-demand equations system estimated with the 3 Stage Least Squares approach. We find that the demand for roundwood is elastic in the long and short run, while the supply is not. However, supply still responds positively to a price increase. In this context, a 10% increase in the price paid to suppliers would lead to a 5% increase in Swiss roundwood production and a 10% decrease in price paid by consumers to an 18% increase in roundwood consumption. Such an increase in the use of wood would lead to sequester 1% of Swiss CO 2 emissions in wood products each year. © 2019","Construction; Roundwood; simultaneous equations; Structural breaks; Time series","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Construction; Forestry; Sustainable development; Time series; Wood products; Economic sustainability; Financial incentives; Least-squares approach; Long-term relationships; Roundwood production; Roundwoods; Simultaneous equations; Structural break; Cost estimating; Carbon Dioxide; Commerce; Construction; Demand; Forestry; Increments; Supply; Wood Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063294220

We therefore expect that geographic variation in climate might lead to variation in plant mating systems. Biogeographic processes, such as range expansion, can also contribute to geographic patterns in mating system traits. We manipulated pollinator access to plants in eight sites spanning the geographic range of Clarkia pulchella to investigate geographic and climatic drivers of fruit production and seed set in the absence of pollinators (reproductive assurance). We examined how reproductive assurance and fruit production varied with the position of sites within the range of the species and with temperature and precipitation. We found that reproductive assurance in C. pulchella was greatest in populations in the northern part of the species’ range and was not well explained by any of the climate variables that we considered. In the absence of pollinators, some populations of C. pulchella have the capacity to increase fruit production, perhaps through resource reallocation, but this response is climate dependent. Pollinators are important for reproduction in this species, and recruitment is sensitive to seed input. The degree of autonomous self-pollination that is possible in populations of this mixed-mating species may be shaped by historic biogeographic processes or variation in plant and pollinator community composition rather than variation in climate. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Clarkia; Geographic variation; Pollinator exclusion; Range limits; Self-pollination","autogamy; community composition; dicotyledon; fruit production; geographical variation; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; pollinator; precipitation (climatology); range expansion; reproductive strategy; seed set; Clarkia; Clarkia pulchella; Clarkia; flower; plant seed; pollination; reproduction; symbiosis; Clarkia; Flowers; Pollination; Reproduction; Seeds; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064441281

The model is a time-dependent Energy Balance Model (EBM) with latitudinal resolution and allows for the evaluation of non-uniform climate engineering strategies. The resulting partial differential equation is solved using a Green’s function approach. This model offers an efficient analytical approach to design strategies that counteract climate change on a latitudinal basis to overcome regional disparities in cooling. Multi-objective analyses are considered and time-dependent analytical expressions of control functions with latitudinal resolution can be obtained in several circumstances. Results broadly comparable with the literature are found, demonstrating the utility of the model in rapidly assessing new climate engineering controls laws and strategies. For example, the model is also used to quickly assess the trade-off between the number of degrees of freedom of SRM and the rms error in latitudinal temperature compensation. Moreover, using the EBM the dynamics of the ice line can be investigated and a Lyapunov stability analysis is employed to estimate the maximum reduction of solar insolation through climate engineering before the current climate falls into an ice-covered state. This provides an extreme operational boundary to future climate engineering ventures. © 2018, The Author(s).","Climate engineering; Climate modelling; Ice line; Lyapunov stability; Multi-objective control; SRM","climate change; climate modeling; energy balance; Green function; ice cover; latitude; solar radiation; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054704557

This included forms of public endorsement, policy documents and legislative change that prioritised further oil development in the country to create a certain common-sense around increased fossil fuel extraction. In response, a range of communities and autonomous Oil Free groups have emerged to contest both the legislative changes and this underlying common-sense. We draw on this example to respond to calls within geography and political science literature to situate analysis of contemporary politics in empirical contexts. We use Rancière’s thought combined with the frames of politicisation, depoliticisation and repoliticisation to explore the entangled nature of government and oil industry actions, and community climate change activism. We argue that while there were clearly attempts by government and the oil industry to close down spaces of dissent and limit debate around fossil fuel development to technocratic questions of health and safety, the effects of attempts at closure are paradoxical. Such attempts at closure are always incomplete and at times, mobilise people to contestatory action.

Surprisingly, the British theatre is equally engaged (albeit less spectacularly) in exploring the same threat. Namely, what happens when the natural world strikes back and begins to encroach against our established homesteads and populated cities. One of the best-known plays on the topic of climate change is Steve Waters' The Contingency Plan (2009). Waters delves into the growing crisis of rising water tables to low lying areas of England by exploring the effect it has personally on an aging climate scientist and his wife and politically on their son, also a scientist, who is charged by two newly installed government officials with preparing Britain for the looming watery disaster. Eschewing the bombastic Hollywood nature of disaster films, Waters' play is intimately crafted, showing the dangerous and fatal disruptions of the changing natural world, and, more specifically, the negotiations that take place between science and politics when it comes to the unpredictability of rising sea levels.

Despite the scientifically established threats of climate change, there remains a segment of the American population that is skeptical of the scientific consensus on climate change and the urgent need for action. One of the most important stakeholders and conversants in environmental conversations is the religious community. While existing studies have discussed environmentalism as a factor within the religious community, this book positions religion as an important factor in environmentalism and focuses on how identities play a role in environmental conversation. Rather than thinking of religious skeptics as a single unified group, Emma Frances Bloomfield argues that it is essential to recognize there are different types of skeptics so that we can better tailor our communication strategies to engage with them on issues of the environment and climate change. To do so, this work breaks skeptics down into three main types: ""separators,"" ""bargainers,"" and ""harmonizers."" The book questions monolithic understandings of climate skepticism and considers how competing narratives such as religion, economics, and politics play a large role in climate communication. Considering recent political moves to remove climate change from official records and withdraw from international environmental agreements, it is imperative now more than ever to offer practical solutions to academics, practitioners, and the public to change the conversation. To address these concerns, this book provides both a theoretical examination of the rhetoric of religious climate skeptics and concrete strategies for engaging the religious community in conversations about the environment.

Besides the many advantages of laser material processing, most applications are based on thermal processes, which cause significant emissions and pollution. In the last 5 years, the developments in the field of fiber-reinforced composites led to a growing interest and demand of engineers for lightweight designs. The trend of new lightweight materials and, especially, the supplement of carbon nanotubes and graphene, requires a substantiated scientific approach for handling emissions. This includes a rethinking of manufacturing processes to ensure a safe interaction between operator and machinery in the industrial environment. This work provides fluidic and design simulations to characterize the emerging process emission, which includes solid particles and gases near the point of origin. In a first step, the air circulation during the production process is simulated applying computational fluid dynamics in Ansys. Here, the selected constraints of the numerical model and the spatial rough discretization in the region of the high current gradient are important to ensure accurate results. Next, the generated numerical models are transferred into experimental investigations. The measurement of particles is discussed for six different plastic substrates (PC, PMMA, SAN, PE, TPE, PP). The approaches of the design concept are tested with the help of experimental visualization methods for the airflow. Selected results for a low-emission laser material process are introduced and evaluated for different machine concepts, such as laser scanner units. Due to the volume flow rate and the power level of the extraction system, the results can be evaluated. © 2019 Laser Institute of America.","composite materials; low emission laser processes; particle measurement; polymers","Air; Composite materials; Computational fluid dynamics; Fiber reinforced plastics; High power lasers; Machinery; Manufacture; Materials handling; Numerical models; Polymers; Thermal pollution; Yarn; Emissions and pollution; Experimental investigations; Experimental visualization; Fiber reinforced composites; Laser material processing; Low emission; Measurement of particles; Particle measurement; Laser materials processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066800314

Using an integrated model of electric sector investments and operations with detailed spatial and temporal resolutions, the analysis demonstrates how renewable mandate trade formulations for electricity and renewable energy certificates can materially impact power sector outcomes like capacity planning decisions, compliance costs, CO2 emissions, and the regional distribution of renewable development. There are substantial welfare gains, up to $84 billion in present value terms through 2050, from inter-regional electricity and permit trade (and costs of market fragmentation), but the degree and direction of impact depend on region-specific considerations. Allowing permit trade encourages greater deployment of wind and solar in regions with favorable investment environments and resources, but renewable capacity additions are appreciable in all regions since diminishing marginal returns and transmission constraints limit the benefits of overdevelopment in any single region. Model results suggest that regions will likely find it beneficial to generate at least half of their renewable mandate compliance obligations through in-state resources and that most of the economic benefits from inter-regional REC exchange can be captured with a relatively modest amount of trading flexibility. Trade flexibility is shown to have minimal impacts on CO2 emissions leakage nationally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","F18; L94; Market integration; Multiregional models; Policy flexibility; Q28; Q42; Q48; Renewable energy certificates; Spatial economics; Trade; Variable renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric power distribution; Electric power system interconnection; Regulatory compliance; Market fragmentation; Market integration; Multiregional model; Regional distribution; Renewable energy certificates; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Transmission constraint; Variable renewable energies; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062352021

These comparisons are typically based on average energy and emission factors per passenger trip or per passenger-kilometer traveled. However, as acknowledged in the energy production sector, comparing average emission factors can misinform policy and other decisions because it fails to represent the marginal impact of changing demand. The objective of this paper is to quantify the difference between average and marginal energy and emission factors for passenger transportation modes. Transportation system operations data are used to estimate energy and emission factors per passenger-kilometer traveled for U.S. urban and intercity travel. Marginal emission factors range from 30% (intercity rail) to 90% (private vehicles) of average factors. For urban travel, private vehicles and public transit have similar average emission factors, but marginal factors are 50% lower for transit. The average emission factor for intercity rail is 10% lower than air travel and 30% lower than private vehicles, but the marginal factor is 60% and 80% lower, respectively. Using average energy and emission factors to represent the impacts of travel by different modes is biased against public transit and discounts the benefits of shifting travel away from private passenger vehicles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission factors; Marginal effects; Motor vehicles; Transportation modes; Transportation systems","Passenger cars; Vehicles; Emission factors; Marginal effects; Motor vehicle; Transportation mode; Transportation system; Urban transportation; air transportation; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; pollution policy; traffic emission; transport vehicle; transportation system; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063396676

A progressive warming is demonstrated to alter the geographical distribution of grapevine, reducing land capability for typical grapes and vine productions in most Southern European districts traditionally specialized in tree crops. Grapevine growth and reproduction under climate change require a continuous monitoring to adapt agronomic practices and strategies to global change. The present study illustrates an empirical approach grounded on a set of bio-physical indicators assessing the genotype-related response to climate variation. This approach was tested in Umbria, central Italy, to verify the response of some major international and local grapevine varieties to climate variation during a relatively long time interval (1995-2015). Long-term data for ripening time and berry quality collected in the study area were correlated to representative bioclimatic indices including Winkler, Huglin, and Cool night indicators. Results of this study highlighted the increase of air temperature (reflecting the inherent growth in thermal availability for maturation) and the alteration of precipitation patterns toward more intense precipitation. Climate variability exerted distinctive impacts on grapevine phenology depending on the related genotype. Empirical findings underline the usefulness of a permanent field monitoring of the relationship between selected climate variables and grape ripening with the aim to develop adaptive viticultural practices at farm’s scale. © 2019 by the authors.

Most developed countries and China have laid out ambitious plans for electric vehicles penetration. However, there are several challenges that must be addressed on the supply-chain side of the problem for a successful transition toward an alternative and less environmentally harmful transport system. This study proposes a methodology for the optimal plan and decision making of primary energy sources, electricity generation, electricity distribution to vehicles' charging stations, carbon capture and sequestration, and electric vehicles' charging stations network to satisfy the electricity demand of the overall economy including electric vehicles at a regional/countrywide level under operation and green constraints. The optimization problem was modeled as a mixed integer program in general algebraic modeling system (GAMS). The formulation was employed to propose the upcoming electricity supply chain for electric vehicles in the most populous German state (North Rhine-Westphalia) in 2025. The optimization show that fossil-based power still controls the generation in 2025, while carbon capture and sequestration along with higher renewable penetration help meeting the state's greenhouse gases (GHG) emission target.

We characterized fire extent and severity using the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity raster mosaic data set. This data set did not maintain a consistent spatial extent across years, but rather the annual spatial extent encompassed all fires that occurred in a specific year. The data set thus periodically excluded parts of western California and northern Washington when no fires occurred in those areas. We did not adequately account for no-data values that were introduced by shifts in annual spatial extent of these data. The nodata values were then propagated through the analysis when we updated the biomass map at each time-step to account for prior tree mortality. Functionally, the biomass map were iteratively nibbled away by no-data values along the western and northern edges of the study domain, causing us to underestimate tree mortality in these areas. We corrected this error and updated our estimates of statewide tree mortality. Our estimates of mean annual tree mortality from fires increased from 2.60 ± 2.14 to 2.73 ± 2.43 Tg AGC yr-1 for California and from 0.52 ± 0.38 to 0.80 ± 0.78 Tg AGC yr-1 for Washington. Similarly, our estimates of mean annual tree mortality from beetles increased from 1.65 ± 0.95 to 1.71 ± 1.01 Tg AGC yr-1 for California and from 1.64 ± 0.45 to 2.47 ± 0.77 Tg AGC yr-1 for Washington. We updated our estimates of tree mortality in table S2 and where referenced in the abstract and results. We also updated our corresponding tree mortality data set that is archived on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive System. Overall, this correction did not change the conclusions of our paper and we apologize for any inconvenience. Abstract High temperatures and severe drought contributed to extensive tree mortality from fires and bark beetles during the 2000 in parts of the western continental United States. Several states in this region have greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets and would benefit from information on the amount of carbon stored in tree biomass killed by disturbance. We quantified mean annual tree mortality from fires, bark beetles, and timber harvest from 2003-2012 for each state in this region. We estimated tree mortality from fires and beetles using tree aboveground carbon (AGC) stock and disturbance data sets derived largely from remote sensing. We quantified tree mortality from harvest using data from US Forest Service reports. In both cases, we used Monte Carlo analyses to track uncertainty associated with parameter error and temporal variability. Regional tree mortality from harvest, beetles, and fires (MORTH+B+F) together averaged 47.1 ± 17.1 Tg AGC yr-1 (±95% confidence interval), indicating a mortality rate of 1.13 ± 0.41% yr-1. harvest accounted for the largest percentage of MORTH+B+F (49%), followed by beetles (33%), and fires (18%). Tree mortality from harvest was concentrated in Washington and Oregon, where harvest accounted for 68%-83% of MORTH+B+F in each state. Tree mortality from beetles occurred widely at low levels across the region, yet beetles had pronounced impacts in Colorado and Montana, where they accounted for 53%-93% of MORTH+B+F. Tree mortality from fires was highest in California, though fires accounted for the largest percentage of MORTH+B+F in Arizona and New Mexico (~50%). Drought and human activities shaped regional variation in tree mortality, highlighting opportunities and challenges to managing GHG emissions from forests. Rising temperatures and greater risk of drought will likely increase tree mortality from fires and bark beetles during coming decades in this region. Thus, sustained monitoring and mapping of tree mortality is necessary to inform forest andGHGmanagement. Results Regional tree mortality from disturbance Taken together, mean annual tree mortality from timber harvest, bark beetles, and fires (MORTH+B+F) was 47.1 ± 17.1 Tg AGC yr-1 from 2003-2012 across the western US. Regional tree AGC stocks totaled 4.16 ± 0.12 Pg, suggesting that the tree mortality rate was 1.13 ± 0.41% yr-1. Timber harvest accounted for the largest percentage of MORTH+B+F (49%), followed by bark beetles (33%) and then fires (18%, figure 3, table S2). Tree mortality from fire Mean annual tree mortality from fires (MORTfire) was 8.6 ± 6.9 Tg AGC yr-1 and the mortality rate was 0.21 ± 0.17% yr-1 from 2003-2012 in the western US (figures 3, 4(a), 5, table S2). Absolute MORTfire was highest in northern California, central Idaho, and western Montana, with these states accounting for 63%of regional MORTfire. Forests in Arizona andNew Mexico experienced the highest annual rates of MORTfire (0.36%-0.57% yr-1), as well as the highest percentage of MORTH+B+F caused by fire (51%- 55%). Conversely, forests in Colorado, Oregon, and Washington had the lowest rates of MORTfire (0.03%- 0.10% yr-1) and the lowest percentage of MORTH+B+F caused by fire (2%-8%). Fires that occurred in Oregon and Washington were largely concentrated along the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range. Tree mortality from bark beetles Mean annual tree mortality from bark beetles (MORTbeetle) was 15.5 ± 7.4 Tg AGC yr-1 and the mortality rate was 0.37 ± 0.18% yr-1 from 2003-2012 in the western US (figures 3, 4(b), 5, table S2). Absolute MORTbeetle was highest in northern Colorado, western Montana, and central Idaho, with these states accounting for 49% of regional MORTbeetle (table S2). Forests in Colorado and Wyoming had the highest annual rates of MORTbeetle (1.12%-1.22% yr-1) and the highest percentage of MORT + + H B F caused by bark beetles (80%-93%). Conversely, Oregon and Washington had not only two of the lowest rates of MORTfire, but also two of the lowest rates of MORTbeetle (0.10%-0.30% yr-1). Tree mortality from timber harvest Mean annual tree mortality from timber harvest (MORTharvest) was 23.0 ± 2.8 Tg AGC yr-1 and the mortality rate was 0.55 ± 0.07% yr-1 from 2003-2012 in the western US (figures 3, 5, table S2). Timber harvest in Oregon and Washington accounted for 67% of regional MORTharvest. These two states had the highest rates of MORTharvest (0.85%-0.86% yr-1) and the highest percentage of MORTH+B+F caused by harvest (68%-83%). Conversely, forests in Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico had the lowest rates of MORTharvest (0.04%-0.06% yr-1) and among the lowest percentage. of MORTH+B+F caused by harvest (3%-10%). © 2019 The Author(s).

Since carbon dioxide emissions are highly correlated with fuel consumption (FC), fuel consumption regulation is a useful policy instrument to combat climate change. Although the Chinese government set fuel economy standards in 2004, like many countries it does not conduct testing to confirm real-world FC rates comply with the standards. This paper employs a dataset of real-world FC measurements self-reported by over 1 million vehicle owners in China between 2008 and 2017 through a dedicated mobile phone application. By comparing this user-generated FC data with FC certification, the study provides an indication of discrepancies of FC gap and its characteristics, including: vehicle model year, transmission type, segment, weight bin, and market share. The study finds that while average certified FC decreased by 15% between 2008 and 2017, real-world FC remained unchanged, resulting in FC gap increase from 12% to 30%.

Climate change will reduce discharge and increase flow intermittence in Mediterranean streams, which will lead to an intensified flow regulation to meet water demands. Very little is known about how the functional features of aquatic communities vary along combined anthropogenic flow alteration and natural intermittence gradients. As intermittent streams are subjected to natural stress (droughts and flash floods), the flow regime alteration effect may differ from that observed in perennial rivers. Consequently, studies that aim to determine the effects of flow regulation on the functioning of aquatic communities in a global change context are crucial. By applying linear mixed-effect models and null models to the macroinvertebrate communities from 65 stream sites in the Segura River Basin (south-east Spain), we assessed the separate effects of natural flow intermittence and flow regulation, as well as their interaction, on biological traits and functional diversity indices. Natural flow intermittence and flow regulation were mainly associated with loss of taxa with semivoltine or univoltine cycles and more sensitive aquatic stages (i.e. eggs), and with the replacement by taxa with multivoltine cycles and more resistant aquatic stages (i.e. adults). Flow regulation intensified the impact of natural flow intermittence on some biological traits, producing synergistic effects (i.e. decreasing interstitial taxa and tegument breathers and increasing taxa with aquatic adult stages). At the same time, antagonistic (life cycle) and opposing (shredders) interaction effects were also observed. Functional diversity, functional dispersion, and functional redundancy underwent a non-random decrease as the flow regime alteration increased, and a significant antagonistic interaction was also found between both stressors for functional redundancy. In general, flow regulation effects were stronger in perennial than in intermittent streams because natural intermittence imposes a previous eco-evolutionary pressure on aquatic biota by selecting those resistant or recovery traits that confer resilience to anthropogenic flow regime alterations. Thus, the natural flow regime influences the functional sensibility of communities to anthropogenic flow alteration. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biological traits; functional diversity; functional redundancy; hydrologic alteration; intermittent streams",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063136794

As a result, biomass is increasingly exported from the US to the EU, but changes to the policy landscape are poised to alter this. This study utilizes Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess impacts of biomass transportation on bioenergy life cycle GHG emissions. Transportation modes considered include truck, train and sea freight and each are assessed at realistic distances expected in bioenergy supply chains. Emissions for biomass firing alone and co-firing with coal using wood chips and pellets are compared to a baseline coal-fired power plant. Results include life cycle emissions for each case, and sensitivity analysis is presented for variation in power plant efficiency and biomass heating value. A generalized model for estimation of bioenergy emissions is presented. In nearly all cases, biomass utilization for electricity production produces lower life cycle GHG emissions compared to the coal baseline, with emission reductions as high as 76%. Utilization in the US and EU have similar overall emissions at long US distances.

To design and realize sustainable urban transportation, it is vital to understand and analyze interactions between a set of dynamic factors that shape transportation patterns, behaviors, and impacts. To this end, this study aims to develop a systems dynamics (SD) model for Istanbul, Turkey to simulate its urban motorized passenger transport system for analyzing numerous policies under different scenarios and assessing their potential effects in reducing energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in the upcoming years. The constructed SD model includes four subsystems: population, household disposable income, transport, and energy and CO 2 emissions. Based on historical data (2000–2015) and model validation processes, the energy consumption and the associated CO 2 emissions from motorized passenger transport are forecasted for the following scenarios. The first one is business as usual scenario (BAU) which is designed to show how energy use and the associated CO 2 emissions would evolve over time with the current development plans. The second and third scenarios constitute supply management measures (SMM) which consider different levels of improvements in the fuel economy of the vehicle fleet and reduced carbon emission intensity in electricity generation through increased share of renewable energy use. The fourth and fifth scenarios consider travel demand management (TDM) policies that include different levels of transport cost increase, and trip length reduction. Finally, the last two scenarios include integrated scenarios that are composed of the SMM and TDM options. In detail, compared to the BAU scenario, integrated scenario considers (1) a 10% improvement in the fuel economy of the vehicles, (2) a 10% reduction in the emission intensity of electricity generation, (3) a 30% increase in the transportation cost, and (4) a 15% reduction in the trip lengths. Under the BAU scenario, the SD model shows that energy consumption per capita from passenger trips will increase from 183 L of oil equivalent in 2016 to 315 L of oil equivalent in 2025 while the associated CO 2 emissions per capita will increase from 460 kg in 2016 to 807 kg in 2025. To combat this dramatic growth, the findings indicate that the ambitious integrated scenario achieves the lowest energy consumption and CO 2 emissions by offering a 33.5% expected reduction in total energy consumption and a 32.8% expected reduction in total CO 2 emissions. © 2019","CO 2 emissions; Energy; Istanbul; System dynamics; Transport policy","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Computer aided software engineering; Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Fuel economy; CO2 emissions; Energy; Istanbul; System Dynamics; Transport policy; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061613003

Using seven pollination networks across Europe that include the phylogeny and life history traits of plants, we show a substantial variability across networks in climatically predicted plant extinction—and particularly the subsequent coextinction—rates, with much higher values in Mediterranean than Eurosiberian networks. While geographic location best predicts the probability of a plant species to be driven to extinction by climate change, subsequent coextinctions are best predicted by the local network of interactions. These coextinctions not only increase the total number of plant species being driven to extinction but also add a bias in the way the major taxonomic and functional groups are pruned.

Despite the slower than anticipated pace of commercializing next-generation biofuels, the research community continues to make dramatic improvements at every stage of production, from feedstock cultivation through conversion to final products. However, the interdisciplinary nature of bioenergy research, and the need for cross-coordination among biologists, chemists, agronomists, and engineers, make coordinating and optimizing these strategies challenging. This Perspective surveys recent advancements in bioenergy crop engineering, lignocellulosic biomass deconstruction and fractionation, catabolism of biomass-derived sugars and aromatics, and biological conversion to fuels and products. We organize major research approaches into broad categories and comment on which strategies offer synergies or trade-offs in the context of four approaches to improving the economics and carbon-efficiency of advanced biofuels and bioproducts: (1) maximize sugar conversion to a single product, (2) utilize diverse carbon sources for producing a single product, (3) convert lignin to high-value products, and (4) fractionate the hydrolysate to derive maximum value from each component.

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of the responses of this process to precipitation changes, hindering accurate prediction of C cycling in a changing world. We examined the responses of ecosystemCO2 flux to ambient precipitation and experimentally decreased (-35%) and increased precipitation (+20%) in a semiarid grassland in China between July 2013 and September 2015. The measured CO2 flux components included the gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (Re), and soil respiration (Rs). The results showed that the seasonal and diurnal patterns of most components of ecosystem CO2 flux were minimally affected by precipitation treatments, with less than 4% changes averaged across the three growing seasons. GEP and NEE had a quadratic relationship, while Re and Rs increased exponentially with soil temperature. GEP, RE, and Rs, however, decreased with soil moisture. Decreased precipitation reduced the dependence of CO2 flux on soil temperature but partly increased the dependence on soil moisture; in contrast, increased precipitation had the opposite influence. Our results suggested a relatively stable CO2 flux in this semiarid grassland across the tested precipitation regimes. © 2019 by the authors.","Ecosystem respiration; Net ecosystem exchange; Response function; Soil moisture; Soil respiration; Soil temperature","carbon cycle; carbon flux; ecosystem dynamics; grassland; growing season; net ecosystem exchange; precipitation (climatology); respiration; semiarid region; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; uncertainty analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066958262

However, the current response behavior guidance released by the government is insufficient because of the limited understanding of public perceptions of heat-related risk and the motivating factors for the public's diverse adaptive behaviors. Here, we conducted a survey on the behavioral adaptations of 3065 urban residents in response to heat waves in Jinan, which is a typical city suffering from a hot climate. We provided evidence on the current state of residents’ perception of heat waves and the mechanism of how risk perception mediates individual behavioral intentions upon exposure to high ambient temperatures. We found that the mediating effects of risk perception varied significantly with respect to different types of adaptive behaviors. Concern behaviors appeared be motivated completely by the mediating effects of perceived concern (b = 0.45, p < 0.01 for concerns about health guidelines; b = 0.36, p < 0.01 for concerns about the weather forecast) and severity (b = 0.11, p < 0.01 for concerns about health guidelines), while outdoor activity could be consciously adjusted according to temperature changes without those mediating effects (p > 0.05).

In Australia, off-grid communities and mining sites that are not connected to the electrical grid meet their electricity demand primarily through diesel generator systems. The economic and environmental ramifications associated with diesel generators can be minimised using hybrid renewable energy technologies. This study aims to identify the optimal combination of technologies in a hybrid system consisting of concentrating solar thermal (CST), solar photovoltaic (PV), battery storage and diesel generators. Optimisation is carried out through an economic analysis based on minimisation of the levelised cost of energy (LCOE). The CST system considered here utilises a supercritical CO2 power cycle, which presents increased suitability for small scales (&lt;10 MW). The efficiencies and costs of the CST system are closely related to the turbine inlet temperature. In this work, three temperatures are explored to identify the optimal case. The results indicate that the optimal system consists of CST (650 °C) as the primary source of baseload power, with PV and diesel generation serving as supplementary sources. These systems present significant reductions in LCOE and emissions compared to the diesel base case, and therefore offer a promising solution for remote electricity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar thermal; Cost of energy; Hybrid renewable energy system; Optimisation; Photovoltaic; Remote area","Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Environmental technology; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Concentrating solar; Cost of energies; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Optimisations; Photovoltaic; Remote areas; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; diesel; economic analysis; electrification; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; smart grid; thermal power; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064205693

While previous research has focused on insect attraction and dispersal to infected plants, little is known about mechanisms mediating these interactions. Here, we investigate the role of ethylene in green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) attraction to potyvirus-infected plants. In our experiments, we utilized two different potyviruses, Potato virus Y (PVY) and Turnip mosaic virus, in lab and field experiments. Consistent with previous studies, we show that greater numbers of aphids settle on potyvirus-infected plants in the lab and greater numbers of aphids are found in PVY-infected potato (Solanum tuberosum) fields compared to controls. In laboratory experiments, inhibition of ethylene signaling in plants either chemically or genetically prevented aphids from preferentially settling on potyvirus-infected plants. Virus spread was reduced in lab arenas by over 80% when ethylene signaling was inhibited chemically. Despite this, ethylene inhibition had no significant impact on virus spread in field mesocosms. Our results indicate that induction of ethylene signaling by potyviruses mediates aphid attraction to infected plants and virus spread; however, additional factors may contribute to plant–vector dynamics in complex communities. Specific components of ethylene signaling may be important targets for future management of vector-borne viruses and research on mechanisms mediating plant–vector–virus interactions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Disease ecology; Insect behavior; Phytohormone; Plant–insect interaction; Virus–vector interaction","aphid; disease control; disease spread; disease vector; dispersal; ethylene; host-pathogen interaction; infectious disease; inhibition; phytohormone; plant-insect interaction; virus; Aphididae; Hexapoda; Myzus persicae; Potato virus Y; Potyvirus; Solanum tuberosum; Turnip mosaic virus; ethylene derivative; animal; aphid; ecosystem; plant disease; potato; Potyvirus; Animals; Aphids; Ecosystem; Ethylenes; Plant Diseases; Potyvirus; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065469849

The research period (2006–2015) is divided into the 11th Five-Year Plan period (FYP) (2006–2010) and the 12th FYP period (2011–2015). On this basis, we conduct a comparative analysis to describe the spatial-temporal evolution of the decoupling states of transportation output and transportation carbon emissions. Furthermore, in order to deeply analyze the reasons for the evolution of the decoupling states during the 12th FYP period compared with the 11th FYP period, the LMDI decomposition method is used to decompose and compare the factors affecting the transportation carbon emissions in the two periods. The results show the following: (1) from the national point of view, the decoupling relationship between transportation output and transportation carbon emissions improved gradually, with small fluctuations from 2006 to 2015; (2) from the provincial point of view, their decoupling states mainly were expansive negative decoupling and weak decoupling, and the spatial evolution of the two decoupling states is significantly different; (3) the reductions in the transportation energy intensity and transportation intensity were the main factors inhibiting the increase of transportation carbon emissions in the 11th and 12th FYP periods, respectively. The growth of per-capita wealth was the decisive factor driving the increase in transportation carbon emissions in the two periods; (4) in contrast to the causes of decreases in the carbon emission variations in the 11th FYP period, in the 12th FYP period, the significant reduction in transportation intensity is the main reason causing the significant decrease of carbon emission variations. However, the transportation energy intensity and the transportation intensity fail to reduce simultaneously in the two periods. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Decoupling; Driving factor; LMDI; Spatial-temporal evolution; Transportation carbon emissions; Transportation output","atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; energy intensity; pollutant transport; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; carbon; analysis; China; exhaust gas; theoretical model; Carbon; China; Models, Theoretical; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066457663

In addition to harboring numerous uniquely adapted species, they play a major role in global climate regulation due to their ability to sequester large amounts of carbon in soil. Despite their significance, however, many aspects of peatland ecology remain largely unknown. Our study aimed to deepen the understanding of one such aspect, namely peatland ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. The structure of belowground ECM fungal communities of Scots pine along a peatland – forest ecotone in the Lithuanian Čepkeliai peatland was examined by molecular identification of ectomycorrhizae collected at the study sites. Additionally, the ectomycorrhizae functionality, as expressed by exploration types, was assessed. The results revealed significant differences in the taxonomic composition of ECM fungal communities along the gradient. Moving from peatland to forest, a gradual increase in ECM fungal taxonomic richness was observed. As the soil water content increases, the medium and long distance exploration types of ectomycorrhizae became more prevalent and dominated on the peatland site. To our knowledge, this study is the first to document ECM fungal communities of Scots pine in peatland conditions and in European peatlands more broadly. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Exploration types; Functional ecology; Pinus sylvestris; Symbiosis; Čepkeliai bog","bog; boreal forest; coniferous tree; ecosystem function; ecotone; ectomycorrhiza; functional morphology; fungus; global climate; peatland; soil water; symbiosis; water content; wetland; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062886697

Progress on carbon emission reduction requires firms to adopt clean technologies which minimize material and energy consumption. Technological change is particularly required in developing countries, where industrial emissions often lead to chronic urban pollution problems. In this study, we explore the antecedents of clean technology strategy by firms in developing countries. We combine the contingent natural resource-based view with the relational view to examine how network embeddedness, market incentives and slack resources influence adoption of clean technology. The empirical support for our hypotheses comes from data obtained from 342 firms that operated in the carbon-offset market during the years 2007 to 2009. We find that a firm’s relational network structure influences adoption of clean technologies, particularly when market incentives are low. Contrary to one of the hypotheses, the results of our paper suggest a negative relationship between a firm’s slack resources and its clean technology strategy. Our study highlights the benefits of networks in fostering adoption of clean technology in developing countries. Furthermore, we find that high market incentives (carbon price) decrease the probability of clean technology adoption, so adding to the view that firms respond to carbon-offset rules to realize high carbon revenues at the lowest cost. Key policy insights High market incentives (carbon price) decrease the probability that firms in developing countries will adopt clean technology. This adds to concerns about the capability of the Clean Development Mechanism to deliver sustainable development. Even where market incentives are low, firms in developing countries are more likely to adopt clean technologies when they are embedded in a closed network of connected partners. To stimulate adoption of clean technology in developing countries, policy makers should focus on initiatives to facilitate partnerships between organizations operating in the carbon market and create opportunities for knowledge sharing and learning. By changing the policy focus to networks of organizations, the carbon market can bring about positive change in terms of shifting the firm behaviour. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adoption of clean technologies; carbon-offset market; market incentives; network embeddedness; slack resources","carbon dioxide; clean development mechanism; developing world; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; fossil fuel; incentive; industrial practice; technology adoption; waste technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055247569

Policymakers and practitioners are calling for implementation of a climate smart strategy by increasing yields and augmenting shade tree cover in cocoa systems. However, there have been few studies in West Africa on the relationship between shade and cocoa yield under field conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of shade tree cover and other factors on on-farm cocoa yields over a four-year period. The study was conducted on 86 farm plots of 8–28 years’ cocoa trees with varied canopy cover (CC) in Ashanti and Western regions of Ghana. A linear mixed model analysis showed that yields increased significantly with increased CC of shade trees, and indicated a doubling of yields when going from zero to approximately 30% crown cover. Fertilizer use gave a yield increase of 7%. Farms located in Western region had higher yields compared to Ashanti, and cocoa systems on short fallows had lower yields than farms cultivated on recent forest clearings and old fallows. Fungicide use, seed sources and land ownership had no significant effects on yield.

Because the distribution of CO2 emissions is highly heterogeneous in space and variable in time in urban areas, gradients of atmospheric CO2 (here, dry air mole fractions) need to be measured by numerous instruments placed at multiple locations around and possibly within these urban areas. This calls for the development of lower-cost medium-precision sensors to allow a deployment at required densities. Medium precision is here set to be a random error (uncertainty) on hourly measurements of ±1ppm or less, a precision requirement based on previous studies of network design in urban areas. Here we present tests of newly developed non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors manufactured by Senseair AB performed in the laboratory and at actual field stations, the latter for CO2 dry air mole fractions in the Paris area. The lower-cost medium-precision sensors are shown to be sensitive to atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions. The sensors respond linearly to CO2 when measuring calibration tanks, but the regression slope between measured and assigned CO2 differs between individual sensors and changes with time. In addition to pressure and temperature variations, humidity impacts the measurement of CO2, with all of these factors resulting in systematic errors. In the field, an empirical calibration strategy is proposed based on parallel measurements with the lower-cost medium-precision sensors and a high-precision instrument cavity ring-down instrument for 6 months. The empirical calibration method consists of using a multivariable regression approach, based on predictors of air temperature, pressure and humidity. This error model shows good performances to explain the observed drifts of the lower-cost medium-precision sensors on timescales of up to 1-2 months when trained against 1-2 weeks of high-precision instrument time series. Residual errors are contained within the ±1ppm target, showing the feasibility of using networks of HPP3 instruments for urban CO2 networks. Provided that they could be regularly calibrated against one anchor reference high-precision instrument these sensors could thus collect the CO2 (dry air) mole fraction data required as for top-down CO2 flux estimates. © 2019 Author(s).",,"atmospheric modeling; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; in situ measurement; instrumentation; pollution monitoring; precision; sensor; urban area; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065557858

Mitigation of residential sector emissions has been suggested as a method to rapidly reduce anthropogenic global warming. This study presents model results from a regional model with coupled chemistry, aerosols, and dynamics over an East Asian domain for January 2014 to investigate the radiative effects of residential sector emissions. Model results are evaluated against surface measurements of particulate matter and remote sensing products, comparing well but with a high aerosol optical depth bias over Sichuan and low single scattering albedo over many locations. We calculate effective radiative forcing of residential sector aerosols at the top of the atmosphere of +1.22 W/m2 over Eastern China, +1.04 W/m2 due to shortwave and +0.18 W/m2 due to longwave forcing. We decompose the shortwave forcing into component parts and find the direct radiative effect is the dominant component (+0.79 W/m2), with a smaller contribution from semidirect effects (+0.54 W/m2) partly countered by negative indirect effects (−0.29 W/m2). The effective radiative forcing varies from 0.20 to 1.97 W/m2 across a reasonable range of black carbon to total carbon emission ratios for the residential sector. Overall, this study shows that mitigation of the residential sector is likely a viable method to locally reduce short-term atmospheric warming in China, but efforts are needed to reduce uncertainty in composition of residential sector emissions to be confident in this conclusion. ©2019.

In drying regions, hydropower generation may be impaired, creating a need for new power investments that would otherwise have been unnecessary. In this study we apply two partial equilibrium models (GCAM and TIAM-ECN) and two general equilibrium models (MEG4C and Phoenix) to identify possible pathways of power sector adaptation for Colombia under climate change. We adopt two GCM projections that deteriorate hydropower generation over the next three decades, and simulate each for two radiative forcing scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5). Relative to Colombia's projected power demand growth over the coming decades, losses in hydropower generation are marginal. Nonetheless, climate-driven losses in hydropower must be compensated by alternative technologies´expansion, which vary significantly across models. When climate policy is implemented (RCP4.5), three distinct expansion pathways emerge: increased solar and wind energy (TIAM-ECN); significant power demand reductions (Phoenix and MEG4C); and increased fossil resources with carbon dioxide capture and storage (GCAM). We show the need to explore the tradeoffs/synergies among alternative expansion pathways and their potential impacts on other sectors (e.g. water and land), and for effective policies to incentivize their adoption in Colombia. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Electricity supply; Energy modeling; Energy-water nexus; Hydropower generation","Atmospheric radiation; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Electric power utilization; Expansion; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Wind power; Alternative technologies; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Electricity supply; Energy model; Energy-water nexus; General equilibrium models; Hydro-power generation; Partial equilibrium model; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; electricity supply; environmental policy; hydroelectric power; modeling; numerical model; power generation; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059556975

One simulation used the default TOP hydrology scheme in the CLM4.5 land surface model; the other used the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrology model coupled to CLM4.5. The results show that the VIC scheme has a lower soil infiltration rate and hence lower surface soil moisture (10 cm in this study) relative to the default TOP scheme. This leads to a different partitioning of terms in the surface energy balance, with low evapotranspiration and high sensible heat flux, resulting in a net warming effect. The VIC simulation also has low relative humidity due to the low evapotranspiration rate. The low infiltration rate of the VIC hydrology also results in accumulation of moisture on the soil surface. In addition, the VIC scheme generates more precipitation, especially in the summer (JJA) season. Thus, the hydrology parameterization can affect not just the terrestrial hydrology cycle but also energy balance partitioning and hence the surface climate. Moreover, the VIC simulation has smaller biases in the surface energy flux and other surface climate variables in comparison with the default CLM4.5 run. We conclude that the VIC land surface hydrology scheme succeeds in controlling the infiltration rate, the surface soil moisture, and hence total evapotranspiration, which improves the surface energy balance and hence produces a better surface climate. Thus, we recommend the VIC hydrology scheme for future climate studies over Africa. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Infiltration and VIC hydrology scheme; Regional climate; Surface energy balance","atmospheric modeling; energy balance; hydrology; infiltration; land surface; regional climate; surface energy; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049973824

In the context of climate change adaptation strategies, a reliable and accurate assessment of the physical vulnerability to SLR is crucial. This study is a contribution to the implementation of flooding standards imposed by the European Directive 2007/60/EC, which requires each member state to assess the risk associated to SLR and floods caused by extreme events. Therefore, coastal hazard on the Atlantic Coast of Portugal’s mainland was evaluated for 2025, 2050, and 2100 over the whole extension due to SLR, with different sea level scenarios for different extreme event return periods. A coastal probabilistic flooding map was produced based on the developed probabilistic cartography methodology using geographic information system (GIS) technology. The Extreme Flood Hazard Index (EFHI) was determined on probabilistic flood bases using five probability intervals of 20% amplitude. For a given SLR scenario, the EFHI is expressed, on the probabilistic flooding maps for an extreme tidal maximum level, by five hazard classes ranging from 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Extreme). © 2019 by the authors.

The increase integration of wind can potentially mitigate global warming by reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, the power generated from wind turbines is always fluctuating due to the intermittent nature of the wind. The most effective powerful tool to suppress these fluctuations is by utilizing energy storage systems. Hence, assessing the impact of wind energy and energy storage on the reliability of local loads is an important issue. In this paper, the impact of wind capacity and energy storage on the reliability of local load of the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) is studied in the stand-alone operational mode. The performance of the system states and simulation results were performed using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) and considering the uncertainty of the wind energy. © 2019 IEEE.","energy storage system; Monte Carlo simulation; reliability; wind energy","Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent systems; Reliability; Smart power grids; Wind power; Energy storage systems; Local loads; Operational modes; Reliability assessments; Stand -alone; System state; Test systems; Wind capacity; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074937490

It is extensively accepted that PAHs require metabolic activation in order to exert their biological activities, including carcinogenicity. Upon entering the cell PAHs are either metabolized into diol epoxides, quinones, or free-radical intermediates, all of which can react with cellular DNA to produce PAH-DNA covalent adducts and cause other forms of DNA damage. We have studied the binding and photo-reaction of PQ 1 with herring sperm (HS) DNA in order to see if it binds to the DNA. PQ 1 alone does not bind to herring sperm DNA, even though it might form hydrogen bonds with bases. In addition, PQ 1 alone does not linearized super-coiled ΦX174 plasmid DNA. Therefore, PQ 1 alone does not have the capability to photochemically cleave and/or damages DNA duplexes directly. We attribute this lack of reactivity to the low solubility of PQ 1 in water, since when it is masked with a water solubilizing group (dipyridinium dihydrodioxin), DHD 2, it is very effective in causing DNA damage. Electrochemical results indicate that the reduction potential of the first electron donated to PQ 1 in acetonitrile has E 0 red = −0.052 V vs. NHE, and converts it to the semiquinone radical anion. Thus, the Gibbs free energy (ΔG 0 ) of the electron transfer to the excited state of PQ 1 in DNA is roughly estimated using the Rehm–Weller equation to have ΔG 0 = −33.536 kcal/mol, which indicates the electron transfer can happen spontaneously from adenine to the photoexcited PQ 1. These results strongly suggest, and are consistent with the hypothesis, that PQ 1 cleaves and/or damages DNA duplexes at Gs or As when it is intercalated between base pairs. DNA–DHD 2 interactions have previously been investigated by transient absorption spectroscopy which indicates that PQ 1 is photochemically released into the base pair stacks where it can photochemically triggers the further release of PQ 1 and cause extensive DNA damage. Thus the photochemical release of PQ 1 from DHD 2 is autocatalytic, which makes this system a very effective DNA oxidizing system. The nature of this DNA damage has been investigated by mass spectroscopy using electrospray ionization. In this work, experiments using DNA with known sequences of nucleotides such as: A 7 + DHD 2, A 7 + PQ 1, ds (T 7 A 7 ) + DHD 2, and ds (T 7 A 7 ) + PQ 1, were investigated. DHD +2 2-2BF 4 − photochemically damages the DNA and the generated PQ 1 and dipyridinium stilbene become attached to the DNA bases at different positions. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy of the plasmid ΦX174 photochemically damaged with DHD 2 indicates that the DNA strands become extensively crosslinked together forming aggregated DNA that would not be subject to repair. © 2018","Dihydrodioxin photochemistry; DNA atomic force microscopy; DNA mass spectrometry; DNA Photochemistry; Ortho-quinone photochemistry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062907548

In the years since Miller (Economy and Environment of Malyan, a Third Millennium B.C. Urban Center in Southern Iran. Ph.D. Dissertation, Department of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1982; Paléorient 10:71–79, 1984) and Miller and Smart (J Ethnobiol 4:15–28, 1984) first identified archaeological plant remains from Malyan (Iran) as those of burned dung, subsequent archaeobotanical, experimental, and ethnographic research has been undertaken to test and expand her criteria for its recognition. A key criterion of Miller’s was a high ratio of weed seeds to wood charcoal (or a low ratio of charcoal to weed seeds). When used together with other quantitative measures based on standardizing ratios, this measure can help to illuminate variability in the sources of the recovered carbonized plant remains and some of the taphonomic processes that contributed to the resulting assemblage. Using the Late Early Halaf dataset from Fistıklı Höyük, Turkey, as a case study, non-parametric statistical analysis was applied to eight such measures, including a new Fragmentation Index (FI), density measures (per litre of sediment) for charcoal, cereal grains, weed seeds, chaff, non-wood items, and cereal-type indeterminate non-wood items, and a relative density measure of charcoal to weed seeds. Each measure was calculated on the basis of 35 samples (n = 8,532). The results of this analysis indicate that these measures, when used in combination with Miller’s weed seed to charcoal ratio, implemented here as the relative density of charcoal to weed seeds, can reveal recovery context-related variations in formation processes that help to clarify both the role of dung fuel in assemblage formation and to differentiate the remains of cereal processing from those of burned fuel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Archaeobotany; Crop processing; Dung; Fragmentation Index; Site formation processes; Standardizing ratios; Statistical analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064462947

The AMOC has been observed to show multi-stability across a range of models of different complexity. The simplest models find a bifurcation associated with the AMOC 'on' state losing stability that is a saddle node. Here, we study a physically derived global oceanic model of Wood et al. with five boxes, that is calibrated to runs of the FAMOUS coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. We find the loss of stability of the 'on' state is due to a subcritical Hopf for parameters from both pre-industrial and doubled CO2 atmospheres. This loss of stability via subcritical Hopf bifurcation has important consequences for the behaviour of the basin of attraction close to bifurcation. We consider various time-dependent profiles of freshwater forcing to the system, and find that rate-induced thresholds for tipping can appear, even for perturbations that do not cross the bifurcation. Understanding how such state transitions occur is important in determining allowable safe climate change mitigation pathways to avoid collapse of the AMOC. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Six heifers were allocated to three diets: The roughage diet (R) consisted of wheat straw (0.61) and Rhodes grass hay (0.39; on dry matter (DM) basis); R + SPVS combined R (0.81) and SPVS (0.19); and with R + UMB animals had access to UMB. During two experimental periods, feed intake, feces and urine excretion, digesta passage, and rumen microbial protein synthesis were determined during seven days and methane emissions during three days. There was no treatment effect (p > 0.05) on DM and N intake. Apparent DM digestibility of R + SPVS (510 g/kg) was higher (p < 0.05) than of R (474 g/kg). Digesta passage and duodenal microbial N flow were similar for all diets (p > 0.05), while N retention was highest with R + SPVS (p > 0.05). Methane emissions per unit of digested feed (g CH4/kg dDM) were lower (p < 0.05) for R + SPVS (55.2) than for R (64.7). Hence, SPVS supplementation to poor–quality roughage has the potential to increase diet digestibility and N retention while reducing CH4 emissions. © 2019, MDPI AG.

We analyse a large-scale, unique and diverse dataset, collected over 15 years, as part of major landscape scale blanket peat restoration projects in the south Pennines, UK. Trajectories of ecosystem change after restoration were assessed by measuring key ecosystem responses including: vegetation cover and indicator species; water table, runoff, and water quality. The reactions of these metrics vary in their behaviour, both in the timing of first response and the rate of change towards a new stable state. Re-establishment of vegetation is a key driver in rapidly reducing particulate carbon loss and attenuating stormflow, while over time biodiversity is improved by the return of native species, and water tables gradually rise. The phasing of these ecosystem service responses indicates that there are different characteristic timescales for the improvement of peatland functions, driven by both surface and subsurface processes. The rapid establishment of vegetation cover over two years, and its importance in improving a broad range of functions, signify it as a key milestone for reporting project success within typical funding timeframes. This study supports the adoption of Lime-Fertiliser-Seed-Mulch restoration on eroding blanket peatlands globally. The trajectories developed are important to help guide practitioners of ecological restoration. Better understanding of the dynamics underpinning the slower response times of subsurface hydrological and biogeochemical function is identified as a key knowledge gap. An understanding of the limits of ecosystems recovery is important when target setting for restoration projects, especially where attaining pristine conditions is unachievable. © 2019","Ecosystem services; Peatland restoration; Restoration success criteria; Restoration trajectories","Biodiversity; Groundwater; Land use; Large dataset; Lime; Restoration; Trajectories; Vegetation; Water quality; Wetlands; Biogeochemical functions; Ecological restoration; Ecosystem response; Ecosystem services; Indicator species; Particulate carbon; Peatland; Restoration project; Ecosystems; carbon; data set; ecosystem response; ecosystem service; environmental change; peatland; restoration ecology; runoff; water quality; Article; biodiversity; biogeochemistry; controlled study; ecosystem monitoring; ecosystem regeneration; ecosystem restoration; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; information processing; landscape; peatland; priority journal; runoff; species diversity; surface property; surface water hydrology; United Kingdom; vegetation; water flow; water quality; water table; environmental protection; theoretical model; wetland; England; Pennines; United Kingdom; Conservation of Natural Resources; Models, Theoretical; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061650167

To maintain reefs in a net growth or net-neutral condition, curbing the impact of OA is therefore necessary. A variety of mitigation and adaptation strategies have been proposed to abate OA impacts on reefs. However, detailed guidance for managers on the types, effectiveness, or costs of different local interventions to address OA is scarce. To advance the discussion about available interventions, this review explores and compares mitigation and adaptation techniques that have been proposed to abate OA impacts on coral reefs. We focus primarily on four categories of interventions intended to address different ecosystem service changes: phytoremediation, chemical remediation, reef restoration, and assisted evolution. We briefly touch on traditional restoration methods like marine protected areas (MPAs) and reducing secondary sources of stress. Of the techniques reviewed, most are costly and do not scale at the same pace as global reef loss. Nor do they address the root cause of OA, global carbon emissions. That said, intervention should not be an all or nothing approach; some techniques may be worth implementing at smaller scales in a coordinated way. Working to save pieces of ecosystems and buying time may help ensure that there is more to rebuild from in the future. Despite the seemingly high price tag of many of these techniques, given the potential value of regained ecosystem services, net gains may exceed implementation costs. It is certain, however, from the limited reach of coral reef interventions, that they must be undertaken as part of a suite of global-scale interventions including atmospheric CO 2 reduction to preserve coral reef ecosystem function and benefits to humanity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064312273

The present work compares the environmental performance of two scenarios: a solar thermal system for providing domestic hot water (DHW) used in conjunction with a traditional natural gas heating system, and the natural gas heating system on its own. Weak points are found and different eco-design scenarios are evaluated in order to achieve a more circular economy. In addition, the authors explore what would be the national Greenhouse Gas emission reduction potential of a wider use of domestic solar hot water systems (DSHW) in China's and Spain's built environment. In this case, five displacement methods are suggested to show how the emissions reduction vary. Through a review of the state of the art and a Life Cycle Assessment of a solar system the two scenarios are assessed. Some impact categories, such as global warming, suggest a markedly better performance of the solar system (-65%). However, weak points in the solar solution have been identified as there is an increase of impacts in cases such as acidification (+6%) and eutrophication (+61%), mostly due to the metals used. The components with higher environmental impact are the collector, the tank, and the copper tubes. The reduction of national emissions by promoting DSHW depends on the actual displaced technology/ies. The consequences on national emissions reduction depending on these choices are assessed.

We exploit the 26 different circulation tax rules and their variation over time, which we interpret as a natural experiment, to see if linking them to a vehicle's CO2 emissions rate has helped shift new car sales towards lower-emitting vehicles. We find that even when the penalty associated with a highly polluting vehicle is high, the effect is relatively small. For example, in canton Zurich, imposing a 50% “malus” on the annual registration fee for cars that emit 200 or more grams of CO2 per kilometer reduces the average CO2 emissions rate from new cars by only 0.46 g per kilometer, bringing it to 158.11 g per kilometer in 2011. A similar effect would be attained with a modest increase in fuel taxes.

Countries around the globe are establishing plans to reduce carbon emissions by adopting green sustainable forms of energy. Furthermore, there is also a parallel global race for creating free economic zones within countries to attract business and investment, namely, to diversify their economies and move away from fossil fuels. With its mega project 'Neom', Saudi Arabia is planning to enter the race in a major way. Neom will be a city bordering on Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan with unparalleled capacity for sun and wind. It is envisioned that Neom will heavily rely on renewable energy, thus, it is conceivable that it will be formed of clusters of microgrids with distributed renewable energy sources. However, the stochastic nature of solar and wind energy sources impacts power production causing imbalance between generation and demand. This imbalance, will no doubt grow with time causing frequency to become even less stable and challenging to control. Recent advances in energy storage technology, however, offer a wide range of alternatives to choose from for different applications. This has motivated the development of the energy warehouse (EW) concept, a controlled and managed massive modular energy storage system. Sized and located properly, EW can offer significant technical and economic benefits for Neom including buffering the difference between demand and supply within microgrids, not only to stabilize, but also to suppress frequency abnormalities, reducing losses, mitigating congestion, and increasing efficiency. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy storage; Energy warehouse; Microgrid; Neom; Renewable energy","Economics; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Stochastic systems; Traffic congestion; Warehouses; Wind power; Energy storage systems; Energy storage technologies; Micro grid; Neom; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar and wind energies; Stochastic nature; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067127284

Ambient management interventions are beneficial and are the dire need of animal production in tropics. Ambient management intervention and its effect on physiological performance of lactating NiliRavi buffaloes were investigated during the hot dry months (April to June) of Pakistan. Fifteen lactating NiliRavi water buffaloes of similar size, age, and same parity were randomly stratified into three groups, comprising of five animals in each group, designated as group S, SF, and SFS. Animals of group S (control) were kept just under the shade while the animals in group SF were provided shade plus fan, animals in group SFS were provided the shade, fan as well as sprinklers during the hot day hours between 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Shed conditions were same for all animals, isonitrogenous and isocaloric feed was provided to all animals. Milk production decreased with the increase in ambient temperature. Average dry matter intake in group S, SF, and SFS were 75%, 80%, and 90% of the total feed offered to the experimental animals, respectively. The mean rectal temperatures (°F) were 101.69, 101.19, and 100.85 in group S, SF, and SFS, respectively. Heat stress had pronounced effect on blood glucose level as indicated by the mean glucose concentration in group S and SFS being recorded at 78.04 mg/dl and 90.47 mg/dl, respectively.

Irrigation is critical for climate change adaptation, but it is also an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. This study analyzes the carbon (C) footprint of irrigation in Spain, covering the complete historical process of mechanization. A 21-fold total, 6-fold area-based, and 4-fold product-based increase in the carbon footprint was observed during the 20th century, despite an increase in water use efficiency. CH4 emissions from waterbodies, which had not previously been considered in the C footprint of irrigation systems, dominated the emission budget during most of the analyzed period. Technologies to save water and tap new water resources greatly increased energy and infrastructure demand, while improvements in power generation efficiency had a limited influence on irrigation emissions. Electricity production from irrigation dams may contribute to climate change mitigation, but the amount produced in relation to that consumed in irrigation has greatly declined. High uncertainty in CH4 emission estimates from waterbodies stresses a need for more spatially resolved data and an improved empirical knowledge of the links between water quality, water level fluctuations, and emissions at the regional scale. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Budget control; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Machinery; Uncertainty analysis; Water levels; Water quality; Water resources; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Electricity production; Empirical knowledge; Mediterranean region; Power generation efficiency; Water use efficiency; Water-level fluctuation; Climate change; carbon; methane; water; methane; water; carbon footprint; climate change; greenhouse gas; irrigation system; methane; spatiotemporal analysis; water use efficiency; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; crop production; decomposition; electricity; greenhouse effect; hydropower; irrigation (agriculture); pond; renewable energy; seashore; sensitivity analysis; water quality; water supply; greenhouse gas; Spain; Mediterranean Region; Spain; Carbon Footprint; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Spain; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065579922

The deployment of renewable energy, especially solar and wind power, decreases carbon dioxide emissions, but presents issues of resource intermittency. In this study, a cost-optimised 100% renewable energy based system is analysed and quantified for the Americas for the reference year 2030 using high spatially and temporally resolved weather data. Several scenarios have been applied, from a decentralised power system towards a fully centralised and interconnected system, taking into account a mix of renewable energy, energy storage and transmission networks. This research aims to evaluate the benefits of an interconnected energy system for the Americas. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is between 48.8 and 59.0 €/MWh depending on the chosen scenario. The results show that the LCOE and total annualised cost drop by 14% and 15%, respectively, in a centralised power system. The optimised utilisation of transmission grids leads to less energy storage requirement. Sector coupling brings further benefits by reducing additional 4% of LCOE, where electricity demand for power, seawater desalination and non-energetic industrial gas sectors have been supplied. A comparison between the interconnected Americas and North and South America individually shows a reduction of 1.6% and 4.0% for the total annual system cost and LCOE. Although the cost of the energy system decreased due to wide grid interconnection, substantial benefits have not been achieved as reported earlier for a Pan-American energy system. A scenario with synthetic natural gas (SNG) trading through a liquefied natural gas value chain has also been presented. The results suggest that local SNG production cost in the assumed consumption centre is almost the same as the cost of imported SNG. © 2019 The Authors","Energy storage; Grid interconnection; Hourly resolved spatial-temporal data; North America; Renewable energy system; South America","Carbon dioxide; Desalination; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission; Energy storage; Gas industry; Global warming; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas substitutes; Wind power; Grid interconnections; North America; Renewable energy systems; South America; Spatial-temporal data; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060941469

With its ever increasing demand for fuel, India is the fourth largest consumer of crude oil in the world and imports 70% of its total demand. Also, to reduce the carbon footprint, the search is on for eco-friendly and renewable sources of energy. In India, one such unconventional fuel is ethanol produced from sugarcane molasses and blended with gasoline for use as biofuel. In this paper, the authors propose an entrepreneurial project to produce ethanol from maize, with an objective to develop a clean & green source of energy and to give a boost to the agricultural economy. Maize is the third most important crop in India, with approximate 85% of areal coverage. It has applications in adhesives, food industry, beverages and breweries for producing ethanol. Ethanol produced from maize has advantages over sugarcane, as the fibrous byproduct makes an excellent animal feedstock and can be further processed for the production of corn starch and syrup, to maximize the profit. The present paper suggests an entrepreneurial opportunity for commercial production of ethanol from maize directly purchased from farmers, creating a win–win scenario for farmers as well as the enterprise. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agriculture; biofuel; entrepreneurship; ethanol; Maize","Adhesives; Agriculture; Biofuels; Carbon footprint; Molasses; Oils and fats; Agricultural economy; Commercial productions; Developing economies; Entrepreneurial opportunities; Entrepreneurial project; entrepreneurship; Maize; Sugarcane molasses; Ethanol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045642655

However, clay source properties influence thermal activation and ultimate pozzolanicity. In this study, clay from the Ashanti region of Ghana was thermally activated at calcination temperatures of 600, 800, and 1000°C (1112, 1472, and 1832°F). The raw clay and the calcined products were characterized in terms of mineralogy and silica intensity using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and solid-state silicon magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS NMR). The impact of the calcined clay material on portland cement was analyzed based on the pozzolanic strength activity index (PSAI). The influence of the calcined material on portland cement in terms of formation of polymerized phases including calcium aluminosilicate hydrates and lime consumption was determined using 29Si MAS NMR and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results of the study indicated that optimum calcination temperature of the clay was 800°C (1472°F), where more reactive pozzolanic phases were formed. The study concluded that the use of calcined clay at optimum calcination temperature together with portland cement improves the strength of mortar. The improvement in strength is consistent with the observed increased polarization between the reactive phases of the calcined clay and cement phases as well as the higher degree of pozzolanic reaction of portland and calcined clay mixtures at the hardened state compared to only portland cement.

Therefore, atmospheric GCMs that use observed SSTs are expected to simulate tropical climate with reduced bias. This paper evaluates the performance of the atmosphere only GCM of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP-AGCM4.1) in simulating the climate of West Africa. Monthly simulated climatology of precipitation and temperature in five precipitation regions are compared with observed CRU climatology. Inter-annual variability in simulated precipitation and temperature are also compared with observation. In addition, the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of simulated precipitation and temperature are compared with the observed precipitation and temperature using normalised deviation from mean and normalised root-mean-square difference. Finally, observed and simulated links between multivariate ENSO index (MEI) and precipitation (temperature) are compared. IAP-AGCM4.1 simulates the mean climatology well over Western part of West Africa (WWA), Central Guinea Coast (GC), and Eastern GC. At the Eastern Sahel, precipitation is over estimated at the 10th and 50th percentile. Generally, there is overestimation at the 10th percentile and underestimation at the 90th percentile. The model also simulates the observed annual variability reasonably well. As expected positive MEI leads to reduction in precipitation in substantial part of West Africa while negative MEI leads to wetness. Furthermore, temperature increases with positive MEI while it decreases with negative MEI over West Africa. However, the model reproduces the dynamics of the influence of MEI on the climate of West Africa with weaker signal. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"air temperature; atmospheric general circulation model; climatology; computer simulation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050919155

A total of 60 surface water and 19 sediment samples were collected from 5 sites of the estuary over a period of 6 months (December 2015 to May 2016). Extraction of PAHs from the water and sediment samples was achieved by using liquid–liquid and soxhlet extraction methods respectively, followed by column clean up with silica gel and quantification by gas chromatography–flame ionization detection. Individual PAH levels in the water and sediment samples ranged from not detected (ND) to 24.91 μg/L and ND to 7792 μg/kg, respectively. Total concentrations of the PAHs in the water and sediment samples varied as 14.91–206 μg/L and 1107–22,310 μg/kg in that order. Total levels of the contaminants were above the target values in the two matrices and were higher in summer than autumn. Although the noncarcinogenic risk of PAHs estimated in the water column through dermal absorption was very low compared with the target value, the carcinogenic risk determined was high for both adults and children. Similarly, benzo(a)pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene were found to be of higher carcinogenic and mutagenic risks in the sediments collected from the study area. Diagnostic ratios suggest that the target hydrocarbons are predominantly from pyrolytic sources. It therefore could be inferred that the water body is conspicuously polluted; hence, efforts should be made to control all the activities contributing to such magnitude of pollution at the sites. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"benzo[a]pyrene; brackish water; dibenz[a,h]anthracene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; silica gel; surface water; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; cleanup; concentration (composition); detection method; extraction method; health risk; PAH; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; spatial distribution; autumn; carcinogenicity; estuary; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; health hazard; liquid liquid extraction; mutagenicity; priority journal; quality control; sediment; skin absorption; South Africa; Soxhlet extraction; summer; water pollution; water sampling; analysis; chemistry; child; environmental monitoring; human; procedures; risk assessment; river; season; sediment; South Africa; water pollutant; Arkansas; Buffalo River [Arkansas]; United States; Child; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Seasons; South Africa; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063086874

This study presents the impact of climate forecasts on GR within a probabilistic framework in a site-specific study in the Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH), the largest stabilized sand dune region in the USA containing the greatest recharge rates within the High Plains Aquifer. A total of 19 downscaled climate projections were used to evaluate the impact of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration on GR rates simulated by using HYDRUS 1-D. The analysis of the decadal aridity index (AI) indicates that climate class will likely remain similar to the historic average in the RCP2.6, 4.5, and 6.0 emission scenarios but AI will likely decrease significantly under the worst-case emission scenario (RCP8.5). However, GR rates will likely decrease in all of the four emission scenarios. The results show that GR generally decreases by ~25% under the business-as-usual scenario and by nearly 50% in the worst-case scenario. Moreover, the most likely GR values are presented with respect to probabilities in AI and the relationship between annual-average precipitation and GR rate were developed in both historic and projected scenarios. Finally, to present results at sub-annual time resolution, three representative climate projections (dry, mean and wet scenarios) were selected from the statistical distribution of cumulative GR. In the dry scenario, the excessive evapotranspiration demand in the spring and precipitation deficit in the summer can cause the occurrence of wilting points and plant withering due to excessive root-water-stress. This may pose significant threats to the survival of the native grassland ecology in the NSH and potentially lead to desertification processes if climate change is not properly addressed. © 2019 by the authors.","Aridity index; Grassland; HYDRUS 1-D; Root water stress; Scenario-based projections; Water balance","Aquifers; Ecology; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater resources; Recharging (underground waters); Aridity index; Grassland; HYDRUS 1-D; Scenario-based; Water balance; Water stress; Climate change; aridity; climate change; desertification; dune; evapotranspiration; grassland; groundwater; index method; precipitation (climatology); recharge; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; water budget; Nebraska; Ogallala Aquifer; Sand Hills; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066329251

Eccentricities can often be measured for exoplanets, but rotation rates are currently difficult or impossible to constrain. Here we examine how the combined effects of rotation and eccentricity on observed emission from ocean-rich terrestrial planets can be used to infer their rotation rates in circumstances where their eccentricities are known. We employ an Earth climate model with no land and a slab ocean, and consider two eccentricities (e = 0.3 and 0.6) and two rotation rates: a fast Earth-like period of 24 hr, and a slower pseudo-synchronous period that generalizes spin synchronization for eccentric orbits. We adopt bandpasses of the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope as a template for future photometry. At e = 0.3 the rotation rates can be distinguished if the planet transits near periastron, because slow rotation produces a strong day-night contrast and thus an emission minimum during periastron. However, light curves behave similarly if the planet is eclipsed near periastron, as well as for either viewing geometry at e = 0.6. Rotation rates can nevertheless be distinguished using ratios of emission in different bands, one in the water vapor window with another in a region of strong water absorption. These ratios vary over an orbit by ≲0.1 dex for Earth-like rotation, but by 0.3-0.5 dex for pseudo-synchronous rotation because of large day-night contrast in upper-tropospheric water. For planets with condensible atmospheric constituents in eccentric orbits, rotation regimes might thus be distinguished with infrared observations for a range of viewing geometries. © 2019.

Many CSA assessment methods that consider these three challenges have emerged, but to better assess the environmental resilience of farming systems, other categories of environmental impacts beyond climate change need to be considered. To meet this need, we propose the LCA4CSA method, which was tested in southern Colombia for family farming systems including coffee, cane and small livestock production. This methodological framework is based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and multi-criteria assessment methods. It integrates CSA-related issues through the definition of Principles, Criteria and Indicators, and involves farmers in the assessment of the effects of CSA practices. To reflect the complexity of farming systems, the method proposes a dual level of analysis: the farm and the main cash crop/livestock production system. After creating a typology of the farming systems, the initial situation is compared to the situation after the introduction of a CSA practice. In this case, the practice was the use of compost made from coffee processing residues. The assessment at the crop system level made it possible to quantify the mitigation potential related to the use of compost (between 22 and 41%) by taking into account operations that occur on and upstream of the farm. However, it showed that pollution transfers exist between impact categories, especially between climate change, acidification and terrestrial eutrophication indicators. The assessment made at the farming system level showed that farms with livestock units could further limit their emissions by modifying the feeding of animals due to the large quantities of imported cereals. The mitigation potential of compost was only 3% for these farms. This article demonstrates the merits of using life cycle thinking that can be used to inform stakeholder discussions concerning the implementation of CSA practices and more sustainable agriculture. © 2019 The Authors","Crop system; Environmental sustainability; Farm; Mitigation","alternative agriculture; climate change; coffee; crop plant; crop production; eutrophication; farming system; food security; life cycle analysis; livestock farming; sustainability; Colombia; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061309335

To explain this limited effectiveness, this paper takes a discourse analytical perspective on gender policy and budgeting, with a focus on the translation of the international norm into domestic norms and policies. An in-depth, inductive analysis of 107 policy documents in Uganda examines how the gender mainstreaming norm has been translated at three administrative levels: national, district, sub-county. The analysis finds five processes that reduce the norm's transformational potential: neglecting gender discourse, gender inertia, shrinking gender norms, embracing discursive hybridity and minimizing budgets. Overall, gender mainstreaming largely stopped at the discursive level, and often paradoxically depoliticized gender. The findings explain why gender mainstreaming might be helpful but not sufficient for advancing gender equality and suggest additional focus on promising practices, women's rights movements and stronger monitoring. © 2019 The Authors","Gender mainstreaming; Norm domestication; Norm translation; Transformational potential; Uganda","agricultural policy; climate change; environmental policy; gender disparity; womens status; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062617089

Objectives: As part of a comprehensive air pollution accountability study, we used a counterfactual study design to estimate the impact of mobile source and electricity generation control policies on health outcomes in the Atlanta, GA, metropolitan area from 1999 to 2013. Methods: We identified nine sets of pollution control policies, estimated changes in emissions in the absence of these policies, and employed those changes to estimate counterfactual daily ambient pollutant concentrations at a central monitoring location. Using a multipollutant Poisson time-series model, we estimated associations between observed pollutant levels and daily counts of cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits at Atlanta hospitals. These associations were then used to estimate the number of ED visits prevented due to control policies, comparing observed to counterfactual daily concentrations. Results: Pollution control policies were estimated to substantially reduce ambient concentrations of the nine pollutants examined for the period 1999–2013. We estimated that pollutant concentration reductions resulting from the control policies led to the avoidance of over 55,000 cardiorespiratory disease ED visits in the five-county metropolitan Atlanta area, with greater proportions of visits prevented in later years as effects of policies became more fully realized. During the final two years of the study period, 2012–2013, the policies were estimated to prevent 16.5% of ED visits due to asthma (95% interval estimate: 7.5%, 25.1%), 5.9% (95% interval estimate: −0.4%, 12.3%) of respiratory ED visits, and 2.3% (95% interval estimate: −1.8%, 6.2%) of cardiovascular disease ED visits. Discussion: Pollution control policies resulting from the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments led to substantial estimated reductions in ambient pollutant concentrations and cardiorespiratory ED visits in the Atlanta area. © 2019 The Authors",,"Air pollution; Air quality standards; Disease control; Diseases; Emergency rooms; Environmental protection; Ambient concentrations; Cardio-vascular disease; Clean air act amendments; Electricity generation; Emergency departments; Monitoring locations; Pollutant concentration; Time series modeling; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; emission; pollution control; pollution policy; public health; air pollution control; Article; asthma; concentration (parameter); emergency care; emergency ward; environmental policy; general health status assessment; health impact assessment; health service; heart disease; meteorological phenomena; pollutant; pollution control; pollution monitoring; priority journal; program evaluation; sensitivity analysis; time series analysis; uncertainty; air pollutant; air pollution; cardiovascular disease; city; government; government regulation; hospital emergency service; human; legislation and jurisprudence; prevention and control; public policy; Atlanta; Georgia; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cities; Emergency Service, Hospital; Federal Government; Georgia; Government Regulation; Humans; Public Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062461161

However, at such high resolution, shadows will appear in the optical imagery effectively reducing the reflectance and emission signal received by imaging sensors. To date, research that evaluates procedures to identify the occurrence of shadows in imagery produced by UAVs is limited. In this study, the performance of four different shadow detection methods used in satellite imagery was evaluated for high-resolution UAV imagery collected over a California vineyard during the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) field campaigns. The performance of the shadow detection methods was compared and impacts of shadowed areas on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and estimated evapotranspiration (ET) using the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model are presented. The results indicated that two of the shadow detection methods, the supervised classification and index-based methods, had better performance than two other methods. Furthermore, assessment of shadowed pixels in the vine canopy led to significant differences in the calculated NDVI and ET in areas affected by shadows in the high-resolution imagery. Shadows are shown to have the greatest impact on modeled soil heat flux, while net radiation and sensible heat flux are less affected. Shadows also have an impact on the modeled Bowen ratio (ratio of sensible to latent heat) which can be used as an indicator of vine stress level. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Aircraft detection; Antennas; Evapotranspiration; Heat flux; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Atmospheric profile; High resolution imagery; High resolution remote sensing imagery; High-resolution optical imagery; Normalized difference vegetation index; Sensible heat flux; Shadow detections; Supervised classification; Satellite imagery; assessment method; crop plant; detection method; evapotranspiration; image resolution; latent heat flux; NDVI; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sensible heat flux; supervised classification; unmanned vehicle; vine; vineyard; California; United States; Vitaceae; Vitis vinifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058055655

This is because the elevated temperature so attained during machining not only lowers carbon cohesion energy thereby reducing the fracture toughness of diamond tool due toC Cbond weakening but also facilitates high rate of carbon diffusion from diamond tool into silicon workpiece leading to high tool wear. This research therefore studied the response of diamond tool wear path and mode to changing rake angle and d R uncut edge ratio during ultraprecision single point diamond turning of a monocrystalline silicon. It was observed from the study that the tool with larger rake angle and high d R uncut edge ratio experienced stronger cutting resistance from the workpiece thereby causing the kinetic friction to be high. Additionally, silicon carbide (Tribochemistry) formation was observed to be through both solid-state single phase and multiphase reaction which are in tandem with sp 3 sp 2 disorder (graphitization) of diamond with bulk of the observed tool wear happening in the flank face which could be due to increasing rake angle influence on the changing d R uncut edge ratio. ©2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Duncut/Redge ratio; Kinetic friction; Multiphase and single phase chemical reaction; Rake angle; Tersoff potential; Tribochemistry; Wear","Carbide cutting tools; Diamonds; Fracture toughness; Friction; Monocrystalline silicon; Silicon carbide; Turning; Wear of materials; Duncut/Redge ratio; Kinetic friction; Rake angle; Single phase; Tersoff potential; Tribo-chemistry; Diamond cutting tools",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070961183

The Nash bargaining algorithm optimizes the traffic signal timings at each signalized intersection by modeling each phase as a player in a game, where players cooperate to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. The controller is implemented and tested in the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation software, comparing its performance to that of a traditional decentralized adaptive cycle length and phase split traffic signal controller and a centralized fully-coordinated adaptive phase split, cycle length, and offset optimization controller. The comparisons are conducted in the town of Blacksburg, Virginia (38 traffic signalized intersections) and in downtown Los Angeles, California (457 signalized intersections). The results for the downtown Blacksburg evaluation show significant network-wide efficiency improvements. Specifically, there is a 23.6% reduction in travel time, a 37.6% reduction in queue lengths, and a 10.4% reduction in CO2 emissions relative to traditional adaptive traffic signal controllers. In addition, the testing on the downtown Los Angeles network produces a 35.1% reduction in travel time on the intersection approaches, a 54.7% reduction in queue lengths, and a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to traditional adaptive traffic signal controllers. The results demonstrate significant potential benefits of using the proposed controller over other state-of-the-art centralized and de-centralized adaptive traffic signal controllers on large-scale networks both during uncongested and congested conditions. © 2019 by the authors.

Here, we investigated how drainage shapes structure and functioning of the paddy soil microbial community. Soil microcosms were pre-incubated for 28 days under flooded conditions followed by nine days' drainage. Upon sampling, metatranscriptome libraries were generated from flooded and drained soils. With drainage, oxygen concentration increased from suboxic (1.6 μmol/l) to near-atmospheric (240 μmol/l) levels. Concurrently, water potential decreased to −0.87 MPa (corresponding to 11% soil moisture content). Drainage did not affect the absolute (RT-qPCR) SSU rRNA abundance of Bacteria and Archaea, but changed significantly their community composition. Firmicutes (Clostridiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae) decreased in relative abundance, while Actinobacteria (Nocardioidaceae) and Proteobacteria (Comamonadaceae) increased. These taxon-specific dynamics were observed on rRNA and mRNA levels. Methanogen SSU rRNA was stable, but methanogen mRNA significantly decreased. This coincided with complete inhibition of the methane production potential in drained soil. Among Eukarya, protists and Amoebozoa thrived in flooded soil, while Fungi proliferated with drainage. In particular, Pezizomycotina (Ascomycota) and Agaricomycotina (Basidiomycota) were the most abundant fungal groups in dry soil. Taking community-wide mRNA expression as a proxy, the overall microbial activity was not severely affected by drainage. The proportion of mRNA in total RNA increased from 1.7% to 2%. In particular, the abundance of mRNA related to transcription and translation significantly increased. Correspondingly, the bacterial SSU rRNA transcript/gene ratio increased 12-fold with drainage, suggesting the development of a metabolically highly active microbial community well adapted to oxic and dry soil conditions. This community showed an increased transcription of genes involved in the degradation of lignin, peptidoglycan, and storage molecules such as glycogen. Under flooded conditions, the microbial community expressed a higher level of glycoside hydrolase transcripts involved in cellulose and chitin degradation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CAZymes; Drainage; Metatranscriptomics; mRNA; Paddy soil; rRNA","Drainage; Floods; Forestry; Fungi; Methane; Methanogens; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Soil moisture; Transcription; CAZymes; Metatranscriptomics; mRNA; Paddy soils; rRNA; Nucleic acids; abundance estimation; cellulose; drainage; enzyme; enzyme activity; genetic analysis; genomics; microbial activity; microbial community; paddy field; RNA; soil microorganism; Drainage; Floods; Forestry; Fungi; Methane; Nucleic Acids; Actinobacteria; Amoebozoa; Ascomycota; Bacteria (microorganisms); Basidiomycota; Clostridiaceae; Comamonadaceae; Eukaryota; Firmicutes; Fungi; Lachnospiraceae; Nocardioidaceae; Pezizomycotina; Proteobacteria; Protista",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061632079
