Using beneficial soil bacterial to increase crop health is a quickly developing area in sustainable agriculture, but it is unknown if climate change or interactions with other species could alter their effect. The plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Acidovorax radicis N35 is known to increase barley (Hordeum vulgare) plant growth under laboratory conditions, and we tested the stability of the plant-bacterial interactions when exposed to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) levels while infesting the aboveground leaves with cereal aphids (Sitobion avenae) and the soil with beneficial earthworms. Acidovorax radicis N35 increased plant growth and reduced insect growth – with greatest effect in a high-stress elevated O3 environment, but reduced effects under elevated CO2. Earthworms promoted both plant and insect growth, but inoculation with A. radicis N35 alleviated some of the earthworm-mediated increase in pest abundance, particularly in the ambient environment. The consistency of these beneficial effects highlights the potential of exploiting local species interactions for predicting and mitigating climate change effects in managed systems. We conclude that microbial bioprotectants have high potential for benefiting agriculture via plant-growth promotion and pest suppression. © Copyright © 2020 Zytynska, Eicher, Rothballer and Weisser.","aphid; barley; carbon dioxide; earthworms; ozone; PGPR; plant-insect-microbe; rhizobacteria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091539444

The most effective current method requires alternating COD and nitrite to achieve high N2O production making it incompatible with typical wastewaters and consequently difficult to use in most settings. The work described here introduces a robust and highly efficient N2O recovery approach which has the potential to work with wastewaters containing COD and nitrite simultaneously. This method relies on low pH incubation and inert gas sparging (IGS) to shift a community of mainly N2 producing nitrite denitrifiers to a community that accumulates N2O when incubated in the absence of IGS. Before experiencing IGS, samples from activated sludge incubated at a pH of 4.5 and 6.0 only achieved a maximum N2O production efficiency (PE_N2O) of ∼26%. After IGS the PE_N2O values increased to ∼97.5% and ∼80.2% for samples from these same pH 4.5 and pH 6.0 reactors, respectively. IGS did not lead to N2O production in a pH 7.5 bioreactor. Meta-omics analysis revealed that IGS resulted in an increase in bacteria utilizing the clade I nitrous oxide reductase (nosZI) relative to bacteria utilizing the clade II nitrous oxide reductase (nosZII). This likely results from IGS flushing out N2O leaving nitrite as the principal nitrogen oxide available for respiration, favoring nosZI utilizing bacteria which are more likely to be complete denitrifiers. Metatranscriptomic analysis suggested that the high PE_N2O values that occurred after stopping IGS result from the NO generated by chemodenitrification accumulating to levels that inactivate [4Fe:4S] clusters in the NosR protein essential for N2O reduction in the nosZI denitrifiers. This study provides an efficient and straightforward method for N2O recovery, widening the options for energy recovery from nitrogen-based wastes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biological nitrogen removal; Energy recovery; Meta-omics; Nitrous oxide; Sparging in acidic condition","Bacteria; Inert gases; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Recovery; Acidic conditions; Activated sludge; Chemodenitrification; Energy recovery; High-efficiency; Nitrite denitrification; Production efficiency; Straight-forward method; Denitrification; acid; bacterial protein; inert gas; nitrite; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; protein nosR; RNA 16S; unclassified drug; nitrogen; acidity; activated sludge; chemical oxygen demand; denitrification; gas; nitrite; nitrous oxide; protein; recovery method; reduction; activated sludge; amplicon; Article; chemical oxygen demand; cladistics; Comamonadaceae; denitrification; denitrifyer; energy recovery; gene expression; gene sequence; metagenomics; metatranscriptomics; microbial community; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; sparging; waste water management; bioreactor; denitrification; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086342635

However, the production of chemical fertilizer causes greenhouse gas (GHG) and atmospheric pollutant emissions, not to mention the effects of increased crop productivity, which creates a large mass of straw to be either burned or abandoned, leading to waste of resources, as well as GHG and atmospheric pollutant emissions. While many studies recognize the importance of substituting chemical fertilizer with straw as an organic alternative, little is known about the potential and spatiotemporal patterns in mitigating GHG and atmospheric pollutant through substituting chemical fertilizer with crop straw during the fertilizer production stage. We examine the potential impact of substituting straw for chemical fertilizer on the spatiotemporal pattern, and also examine the variation of both GHG and atmospheric pollutant emissions through using straw nutrient contents, emission factors, in combination with crop statistical data. Results show that, theoretically, accumulative nitrogen and phosphorus amounts from straw are estimated to be 55440.2 Gg and 16173.3 Gg, respectively, corresponding to 13.5% of total chemical nitrogen fertilizer and 11.5% of chemical phosphorus fertilizer. The substitution of chemical fertilizer with crop straw can mitigate 7088.8 Gg of GHG emissions, 19.9 Gg of NH3 emissions, 43.6 Gg of NOx emissions and 2.9 Gg of PM2.5 emissions annually. At the provincial level, Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Jiangsu and Anhui have the largest mitigation potential of GHG, NH3, NOx and PM2.5. High crop cultivation areas and yields in these provinces are the main cause of large emission mitigation. On the whole, the substitution of crop straw for chemical fertilizer is an effective measure to achieve crop waste utilization and to mitigate GHG, NH3, NOx and PM2.5 emissions. Finally, we propose three measures: innovation technologies for comprehensive straw utilization; multiple-channel financial support; and enhancing the awareness of resource recycling and environmental protection of farmers; as methods to promote straw-return, and thus achieve theoretical mitigation potential of GHG, NH3, NOx and PM2.5 emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric pollutant; Chemical fertilizer; Greenhouse gas; Mitigation potential; Straw return","Air pollution; Ammonia; Atmospheric chemistry; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Phosphorus; Productivity; Atmospheric pollutant emissions; Atmospheric pollutants; Environmental benefits; Fertilizer production; Innovation technology; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Phosphorus fertilizer; Spatiotemporal patterns; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084816605

The results showed that the Beijing carbon market has the highest transaction efficiency, followed by those of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City. Hubei Province also has a relatively high carbon market transaction volume and turnover; its transaction efficiency ranks fourth. Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing are the lowest-ranked regions, having carbon markets with relatively low trading volume and turnover. We, therefore, recommend that to develop a unified national carbon market, governmental agencies at all levels should equitably allocate carbon; strict regulations and penalties are also needed. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon market; Entropy-weighted approach; Power industry; TOPSIS; Transaction efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091318653

Here we use a top-down approach with city-level takeaway order data to explore the packaging waste and life-cycle environmental impacts of the takeaway industry in China. The ten most wasteful cities, with just 7% of the population, in terms of per capita waste generation, were responsible for 30% of the country’s takeaway waste, 27–34% of the country’s pollutant emissions and 30% of the country’s water consumption. We defined one paper substitution and two sharing tableware scenarios to simulate the environmental mitigation potentials. The results of the scenario simulations show that sharing tableware could reduce waste generation by up to 92%, and environmental emissions and water consumption by more than two-thirds.

It is thus imperative that all levels of government develop and introduce more effective policies and measures to further drive the potentiality exploitation of ECER. The purpose of this paper is to examine which policies are more conducive to improving regional ECER levels. By taking Fujian Province as an example, the paper builds an ECER dynamic model and provides integrated incentives from six dimensions including fiscal, tax, emissions trading, finance, industry and technology, and examines their policy effectiveness. The results show that: (1) In the single policy scheme, the tax policy is the most effective, though such effect is less than that of the policy combination; (2) With the increase of the category and quantity of policy combinations, the synergy among policies is so significant that ECER effect is expected to be remarkable; (3) Within the scenarios of policy combination, the technical policy has not contributed to obvious performance improvement, because it requires a longer lag phase to truly experience a prominent innovation spillover of clean technology. This paper elucidates theoretical implications by enriching the social-economic system and underscoring the critical importance of public incentive for the ECER initiative. Also, the findings carry managerial implications by guiding companies to carry out more targeted green and cleaner production activities and providing a valuable reference for the government to make ECER policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ECER; ECER system; Policy combination; Policy simulation; Sustainable initiative; System dynamics","Energy conservation; Public policy; Cleaner production; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Managerial implications; Policies and measures; Policy combination; Social economic system; System construction; Technical policies; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084938390

This study further conducts mechanism analysis from two aspects: environmental regulation and economic development to illustrate the potential mechanism of the effects of the anti-corruption campaign on air pollution. Our results indicate that the anti-corruption campaign has reduced air pollution by 20.3% and that this pollution-reduction effect of anti-corruption is heterogeneous in terms of urban resource attribute and geographical difference.

Overall, the soil CH4 emissions in the 2 years under all residue treatments (104.4–122.8 and 83.3–133.3 g CH4 m−2) were higher than those in CK (57.0 and 20.7 g CH4 m−2) and CF (71.8 and 21.9 g CH4 m−2) treatments. The FMR treatment decreased CH4 emissions when compared with FM and FR, especially in the second year. A higher abundance of methanogens (mcrA gene copies) was found under the plant residue-treated soils (4.35 × 108 g−1 dry soil on average) and FM increased the abundance of methanotrophs (pmoA gene copies, 2.68 × 106 g−1 dry soil). Application of plant residues changed the methanogenic and methanotrophic community structures in comparison with CF (e.g., markedly increased the populations of Methanobacteriales and Methylomonas and suppressed Methanomicrobiales and Methylobacter populations). Methane emissions were significantly and positively related to the mcrA and pmoA gene copy numbers, as well as the mcrA/pmoA ratio. The partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) indicated that the rice plant biomass (path coefficient = 0.64), the abundance of methanogens (path coefficient = 0.57) and the community structure of methanotrophs (path coefficient = −0.59) were determinants of CH4 emissions. Among the three residue-treated soils, FMR showed the lowest CH4 emissions and was associated with a slight decrease in the mcrA/pmoA ratio and a significant increase in the Type I/Type II methanotrophs ratio. Thus, we recommend the co-incorporation of Chinese milk vetch and rice straw as a sustainable fertilization pattern to improve the growth of rice and minimize CH4 emissions. Highlights: Residue application improves rice productivity (except for FR), soil fertility and CH4 emissions. Co-incorporation of MV and RS reduces CH4 emissions in comparison with pure MV or RS addition. Residue application changes the community structure of methanogens and methanotrophs. The methanogenic abundance and the methanotrophic community structure determine the CH4 emissions. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","CH4 emissions; green manure; methanogens; methanotrophs; paddy soil; rice straw","agricultural soil; biomass; carbon emission; community structure; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; paddy field; relative abundance; rice; straw; vine; Astragalus sinicus; Methanobacteriales; Methanomicrobiales; Methylobacter; Methylomonas; Oryza sativa; Vicia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077908436

However, little studies have focused on the comparation of effects of different shrub lands on soil carbon storage. In this case, 16-year-old Caragana Korshinskii K. (CK) land and 16-year-old Hippophae rhamnoides L. (HR) land were investigated in Huining County, Gansu Province, to explore the differences in soil carbon storage between them. The results showed that the total soil carbon storage at the 1.0 m soil depth for the CK land and HR land was 46.55 Mg·ha-1 and 56.73 Mg·ha-1, respectively, with a significant difference in total soil carbon storage between them. The soil organic carbon (SOC) decreased with the soil depth, and was significantly negatively correlated to soil bulk density, but positively correlated to STN. However, SOC showed no significant correlations with soil pH, STP and soil moisture content. The SOC arising was not significant affected by the interactions between land use type and soil depth, demonstrating that the SOC is generally affected by soil either depth or stand type, rather than both in this area. This study expects to advance new understanding of the relationships between soil carbon storage and shrub land in the Loess Plateau, and it could also have wider implications for other regions where land use and land cover change is being addressed by afforestation options. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Moreover, it is fundamental in assessing regional climate variability and to validate the effectiveness of cloud and precipitation parameterization schemes in weather and climate models. Based on observational data from 2008 to 2017, this manuscript objective is to assess the aerosol effects on summer precipitation on an hourly-scale diurnal variation basis in the Beijing metropolitan area. The results put in evidence that the precipitation frequency and duration on polluted days were 25.0% and 14.8% lower with respect to clean days. No significant differences were observed in total daily accumulated rainfall between clear and polluted days. While heavy precipitation mean intensity on polluted days increased by 13.5%, which is potentially linked with aerosol microphysical effects. Note that precipitation occurs earlier on polluted days, with peak time of 1 ∼ 2-hour in advance compared with clean days over the urban areas of Beijing, which may be primarily ascribed to the influence of advanced turning local circulation of mountain-valley breezes and urban heat island circulation due to aerosol-radiation effects. © 2020 The Author(s).

Whether CO2 emissions trading can reduce the intensity of CO2 emission or how much CO2 emission intensity can be reduced still requires further study. Theoretical analysis shows that CO2 emissions trading positively affects the reduction of CO2 emission intensity, but credible empirical support is limited. Moreover, a ""quasi-natural experiment"" is constructed using Guangdong province as an example, and the net effect of CO2 emissions trading policy on the industry CO2 emission intensity is validated using the panel data of Guangdong province from 2000 to 2016 to establish a difference-in-differences model (DID).

To prevent excessive accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and the perturbation of natural carbon cycles, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is urgently needed. In this review, a brief overview is provided for both biotic and abiotic CO2 sequestration pathways. Special focus is given to sequestration approaches pertaining to clathrate hydrates. CO2 hydrate, a solid compound made of molecular CO2 enclathrated in crystalline lattices formed by water molecules, is an attractive option for long-term CO2 sequestration due to its higher density than seawater, stability below moderate oceanic/permafrost depths, low susceptibility to fluid flow perturbation when formed in sediments. This review compiles and summarizes the research efforts made on CO2 sequestration as hydrates. Various approaches of CO2 sequestration via gas hydrates are discussed, including storage in seawater, sediments under the sea floor, permafrost regions, methane hydrate reservoirs via CO2-CH4 exchange, and depleted gas fields. The technical feasibility and potential storage capacity of these approaches are analyzed. Finally, the key scientific challenges and prospects are identified and highlighted. Issues related to economics, scale-up, and relative attractiveness versus non-hydrate methods are touched upon but are not the focus of this work.

The results showed that: (i) From 1990 to 2015, the ecosystem services value (ESV) of the TRH region showed an upward trend, an increase of 60.681 billion yuan from 126.967 billion yuan in 1990 to 187.648 billion yuan in 2015. Moreover, the dynamic degree of ecosystem services was 6.59%. Regulating services accounting for 69.51% were the largest in all ecosystem services, followed by supporting, provisioning, and cultural services. Among the individual ecological services, only the values of gas regulation and environment depuration decreased, other services increased. Among various land use, the ecosystem services of grassland accounting for 47% were the largest, followed by watershed, wetland, forestland, desert, and farmlands. (ii) The spatial distribution of ecosystem services showed an increasing pattern from northwest to southeast. High-value areas of ecosystem services per unit area distributed in the lakes and basins of Zhidoi county, Madoi county, and Tanggulashan town. Low-value areas mainly distributed in the northwest of Zhidoi county. (iii) There was a significant positive correlation between climate regulation and soil conservation. Aesthetic landscape and all provisioning services were weak synergies, gas regulation and other services were weak tradeoffs. (iv) Analysis of multi-scale tradeoffs/synergies showed that synergies dominated ecosystem services, and tradeoffs transformed into synergies with the increase of scale.

In this study, a two-pathway environmental simulation model is developed to uncover heavy metal emissions as induced by intra-provincial production and extra-provincial investments, filling the gap of mitigating heavy metal emissions from separate pathway. This developed model is applied to Guangdong Province, China targeting on the mitigation of Hg, As, Cd, Cr, and Pb emissions. Additionally, emission reduction simulations are implemented on the basis of key sector identification. The effects of intra-provincial production reduction are more notable than those of extra-provincial investment reduction. In addition, mitigation of Hg and As emissions can be achieved through the reduction in both intra-provincial production and extra-provincial investment. In the contrast, it is not expected that the reduction of extra-provincial investment be duo to the emission mitigation of Cd, Cr and Pb. Moreover, an examination of five optimized scenarios reveals that the most remarkable emission mitigation pathway is the reduction of intra- and extra-provincial activities. This study is an indispensable reference for multi-pathway emission mitigation for heavy metals. © 2020","Emission embodied in bilateral trade; Heavy metal emissions; Input-output analysis; Scenario simulation","Emission control; Investments; Developed model; Emission mitigation; Emission reduction; Environmental simulation; Guangdong Province; Heavy metal emissions; Production reduction; Heavy metals; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; lead; mercury; computer simulation; concentration (composition); emission control; environmental conditions; heavy metal; mitigation; scenario analysis; Article; China; controlled study; emission reduction simulation; extra provincial investment; heavy metal removal; intra provincial production; mathematical model; priority journal; process optimization; reduction (chemistry); simulation; two pathway environmental simulation model; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085565708

Promoting the sustainable development of energy and water resources has been an inevitable choice for regional energy system planning. In this study, a hybrid interval two-stage fuzzy credibility constrained programming (ITFCP) model is developed for supporting energy-water nexus system management. ITFCP can explicitly address system uncertainties presented as probability distributions, fuzzy sets, and intervals, as well as dual dynamics through the concept of solutions with interval membership function. The method could provide effective linkages between predefined policies and economic penalties as well as system economy and risk. Then, ITFCP is applied to electric power system management under considering energy-water nexus in Tangshan City, which is a typical resource-based, high pollution, and water-deficient region in China. Multiple scenarios of different credibility levels about water availability are designed. Results disclosed that coal-fired power and imported electricity would play primary role in meeting tremendous electricity demand under the current situation.

In response to implementation of the Plan, daytime PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) showed significant downward trends from 2015 to 2019, with the largest reduction during spring and winter in the North China Plain. Unlike PM2.5, O3 (ozone) showed a general increasing trend, reaching 29.7 μg m−3 on summer afternoons. Increased O3 and reduced PM2.5 simultaneously occurred in more than half of Chinese cities, increasing to approximately three-fourths in summer. Declining trends in both PM2.5 and O3 occurred in only a few cities, varying from 19.1% of cities in summer to 33.7% in fall. Meteorological variables helped to decrease PM2.5 and O3 in some cities and increase PM2.5 and O3 in others, which is closely related to terrain. High wind speed and 24 h changing pressure favored PM2.5 dispersion and dilution, especially in winter in southern China. However, O3 was mainly affected by 24 h maximum temperature over most cities. Soil temperature was found to be a key factor modulating air pollution. Its impact on PM2.5 concentrations depended largely on soil depth and seasons; spring and fall soil temperature at 80 cm below the surface had largely negative impacts.

According to this project, Xianghe County reduced coal consumption and increased gas consumption by 26.71 million cubic meters in 2018. Our observations showed that some of the air pollutants in the Langfang area were effectively improved by changing fuel from coal to natural gas, including SO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CO; the average concentrations of them in the heating period of 2018 significantly dropped compared with those in 2017, with decreases of 46.5%, 13.1%, 21.0% and 10.5%, respectively. However, the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOX = NO+NO2) increased significantly. The average NOX concentration increased from 78.7 to 116.1 μg/m3, while the concentrations of NO2 and NO increased by 24.8% and 76.8%, respectively. Such a significant increase in NOX will bring about changes in the atmospheric oxidation process and influence human health. Changes in meteorological elements were not the main cause of elevated NOX because the total averaged PLAM changing rate and the PLAM changing rates in most of the months indicated a more favorable condition for the diffusion of pollutants. Through the comparison of daily changes in various pollutants during holidays and working days, the impact of motor vehicle emissions on the increase in NOX was essentially ruled out. Compared with that in the heating period of 2017, the significantly higher NOX in 2018 mainly appeared in early morning, which was consistent with the main heating period, and the differences in NOX between holidays and working days were found to be related to sectional heating. At the same time, it was found that the average concentration of NO2 from Nov. 2018 to Mar. 2019 increased in all 12 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region compared with the same period of the previous year, and more than half of the cities had similar variation characteristics of NO2 than that of Langfang. Heating gas was the main factor causing the increase in NOX concentration in Langfang city during the heating period in 2018. Excluding the impact of meteorological conditions, the “Coal to Gas” project brought about 51.8% increase in NOX in the southeast area of Beijing during the heating period of 2018, as well as 8.8%, 16.7%, 42.2% and 10.5% decrease of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and CO, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Elevated nitrogen oxides; Emission reduction; Heating period; Langfang city; “Coal to Gas” project","Air pollution; Coal; Gases; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Atmospheric oxidation; Average concentration; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Favorable conditions; Meteorological condition; Meteorological elements; Motor vehicle emissions; Variation characteristics; Heating; atmospheric pollution; coal supply; concentration (composition); heating; meteorology; natural gas; nitrogen oxides; suburban area; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Langfang; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083096559

The model's ability to simulate the dust process in Northwest China is firstly evaluated using various satellite-retrieved and observational data, including satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD), extinction coefficient and dust index, as well as observational wind field, precipitation and particulate matter with particle size below 10 mic (PM10) mass concentration at surface. The four-dimensional assimilation method is also used to optimize meteorological data and effectively improve the simulation of the dust process. The comparisons between the simulations based on five dust emission schemes within WRF-Chem and the observations show that, the Shao01 scheme overall has good performance in simulating the emission flux, the spatial pattern of source region, as well as the spatiotemporal variation of dust mass concentration, during this dust process. In comparison to Shao01, the GOCART AFWA and Shao04 schemes can also produce quite similar spatial pattern of dust source region, but tend to overestimate or underestimate dust emission and mass concentration. The Shao11 scheme fails to simulate the dust process since the importance of the fully disturbed particle size distribution is omitted. It is also noted that the GOCART scheme can well reproduce dust emission processes under weak wind erosion but underestimate dust emission flux under strong wind erosion. In addition, the GOCART scheme has produced some spurious emissions and thus blurred the distribution of dust source region. The Shao01 simulation was found to reasonably reproduce the spatial distribution and magnitude of the satellite-retrieved AOD and vertical profile of extinction coefficient, as well as the PM10 mass concentration at surface. Northwest China is covered by mountains, basins, deserts and other landforms, thus the complex terrain is one of the key factors to influence the dust process over the region. Our study shows that after being emitted, the airborne dust transported toward the east and west. The dust to the east was diffused rapidly, but the portion toward the west was blocked and accumulated at the edges of the mountains and thus produced dust weather characterized by high dust concentration and long lifetime. The dust accumulated at the edges of the mountains could reach an altitude of more than 6 km due to wind and thermal effect, and finally arrive at Tibetan Plateau and eastern China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Assimilation; Dust process analysis; Model results evaluation; WRF-Chem","Arid regions; Erosion; Landforms; Meteorology; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Precipitation (chemical); Satellites; Size distribution; Transport properties; Weather forecasting; Assimilation; Model results; Multi-sensor observations; Pm10 mass concentrations; Process analysis; Spatio-temporal variation; Weather research and forecasting models; WRF-Chem; Dust; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; concentration (composition); dust; satellite data; satellite imagery; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082837081

This study investigated changes in fire season pattern (i.e., the number of separate periods of a year when wildfires are most likely to ignite, spread, and affect resources) and the contributions of climate change in Daxing'anling, Northeast China. An expanded fire dataset in both spatial and temporal converge from ground reporting was used. A comparison with satellite detected burned areas showed good agreement in spring, summer, and entire fire season. The results showed that the number of fires used to appear in a bimodal pattern with spring and fall peaks in the last century, but transitioned to a unimodal pattern peaked in summer in this century. This conversion was mainly resulted from a remarkable increase in summer lightning fires, which was in turned associated with warming in Daxing'anling. Another factor for the conversion was decreased spring nonlightning fire occurrence in the northwest subregion, where the conversion was the most significant. This decrease of fire was mainly associated with increased precipitation. The analysis of a compositional fire series, built as the log of the ratio of lightning to nonlightning fires, suggests that climate change was a major factor for the conversion of fire season pattern. The finding from this study indicates a need to adjust the fire prevention implementation timeline by including summer fires and to develop strategies to reduce the related risks to firefighter safety and forest ecosystem health in Daxing'anling. © 2020","Compositional fire series; Fire management; Fire trend; Fire-weather relationship; Historical analysis; Weather trend","climate change; ecosystem health; forest ecosystem; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; China; Da Hinggan Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086413622

This analysis indicates that pre-existing changes in human adaptive behaviors prior to the cooling events were sufficient to enable people in certain areas to apply the intensification of food procurement in circumscribed territories as a strategy to cope with the climate fluctuations of the 8.2 ka BP cooling event. The application of such a coping strategy facilitated the economic and sociopolitical transition into Neolithic lifeways and led to the flourishing development of Neolithic cultures after 8 ka BP in North China. © 2020 by the author.

The region of Negombo, located in the Western province, experienced the greatest number of dengue cases in the country and is the focus area of our study, where we aim to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of dengue transmission. Methods: We present a statistical modeling framework to evaluate the spatial-temporal dynamics of the 2016-2017 dengue outbreak in the Negombo region of Sri Lanka as a function of human mobility, land-use, and climate patterns. The analysis was conducted at a 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution and a weekly temporal resolution. Results: Our results indicate human mobility to be a stronger indicator for local outbreak clusters than land-use or climate variables. The minimum daily temperature was identified as the most influential climate variable on dengue cases in the region; while among the set of land-use patterns considered, urban areas were found to be most prone to dengue outbreak, followed by areas with stagnant water and then coastal areas. The results are shown to be robust across spatial resolutions. Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential value of using travel data to target vector control within a region. In addition to illustrating the relative relationship between various potential risk factors for dengue outbreaks, the results of our study can be used to inform where and when new cases of dengue are likely to occur within a region, and thus help more effectively and innovatively, plan for disease surveillance and vector control. © 2020 The Author(s).","Climate; Dengue; Human mobility; Land-use; Outbreaks; Risk factors; Spatial-temporal dynamics; Statistical modeling, Sri Lanka","water; Article; climate; dengue; disease surveillance; disease transmission; dynamics; epidemic; human; land use; migration; risk factor; seashore; sensitivity analysis; Sri Lanka; statistical model; temperature; urban area; vector control; climate; dengue; epidemic; travel; Climate; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Models, Statistical; Risk Factors; Sri Lanka; Temperature; Travel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090319323

In 2017, China implemented the Winter Clean Heating Pilot (WCHP) project, which was designed to convert energy from “coal-to-gas/electricity”. However, the impact of the WCHP project and its associated dynamic changes have not yet been well quantified. Based on daily monitored panel data covering 35 pilot cities, we conducted a difference-in-differences (DID) model to identify whether or not the WCHP project is effective in maintaining air quality. Results showed that AQI, PM2.5, NOx, and SO2 emissions decreased by 20.4%, 18.59%, 34.1%, and 68.4%, respectively, and, except for SO2, these pollutant reductions were greater in Western China than in Eastern China. Furthermore, when certain variables were controlled, such as weather, holidays, GDP, the ratio between secondary industries, income levels, and environmental expenditures, these results were also robust. Parallel trends and placebo tests were additionally used to confirm the reliability of the DID model. The implementation of energy transition could gain the synergy between emission reduction and air quality improvement. Policy recommendations were finally made on rural-scale energy transition, including reforming the cost of electricity/gas through advanced technology and subsidies to account for regional inequality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; DID; Energy transition; Heating; WCHP project","Air quality; Emission control; Health risks; Heating; Advanced technology; Air quality improvement; Ambient air pollution; Cost of electricity; Difference-in-differences; Emission reduction; Environmental expenditures; Policy recommendations; Coal industry; advanced technology; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; energy use; environmental economics; heating; subsidy system; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086772706

In this study, low density polyethylene passive samplers were deployed in urban-influenced and background nearshore freshwaters of northwestern Lake Ontario and analyzed for a broad range of both legacy halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). Non-targeted analysis was conducted for screening additional halogenated substances. For most compounds, concentrations were greatest in the industrialized Hamilton Harbour and more generally at sites that have stronger influences of wastewater effluent discharges and stormwater run-off through rivers and creeks. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain the dominant class of HOCs in water, with dissolved-phase concentrations ranging from 10 to 4100 pg/L (ΣPCBs), followed by polybrominated diphenylethers (ΣPBDEs; 14–960 pg/L) and the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs; 22–290 pg/L). Several non-PBDE brominated flame retardants (nBFRs) and chlorinated Dechlorane-related compounds were detected, with hexabromocyclododecanes (ΣHBCDD; sum of 3 diastereoisomers) the most abundant (1.0–21 pg/L). Non-targeted screening of samples by high resolution mass spectrometry using Kendrick mass defect plots for data analysis indicated that several other halogenated compounds were present in waters at relatively high abundances compared to the flame retardants, based on semi-quantitative estimates. These included methyl-triclosan, four halogenated anisoles (2,4,6-tribromoanisole, dimethyl-trichloroanisole, pentachloroanisole, and pentachlorothioanisole), and pentachloro-aniline. Dissolved-phase methyl-triclosan was estimated to contribute up to approximately 40% of the summed target HOC concentrations. Polyethylene passive samplers provided an excellent medium for both non-targeted screening of HOCs not currently included in monitoring programs and tracking brominated and chlorinated chemicals slated for reductions in uses and emissions through international (Stockholm Convention) and binational (Great Lakes) agreements. Passive sampling with targeted and non-targeted screening is demonstrated as a useful tool for measuring halogenated organic contaminants of concern in water. © 2020","Flame retardants; Great Lakes; Halogenated anisoles; Methyl-triclosan; Polyethylene passive sampler","Aliphatic compounds; Aniline; Contamination; Effluents; Flame retardants; Lakes; Mass spectrometry; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polyethylenes; River pollution; Screening; Brominated flame retardants; Halogenated flame retardant; Halogenated organic contaminants; Hexabromocyclododecanes; High resolution mass spectrometry; Organochlorine pesticides; Polybrominated diphenylethers; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Halogenation; 2,4,6 tribromoanisole; aniline derivative; anisole derivative; dimethyl trichloroanisole; flame retardant; hexabromocyclododecane; organochlorine pesticide; organohalogen derivative; pentachloro aniline; pentachloroanisole; pentachlorothioanisole; polychlorinated biphenyl; polyethylene; storm water; unclassified drug; chlorinated hydrocarbon; diphenyl ether derivative; flame retardant; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; flame retardant; lake pollution; lake water; organic pollutant; PBDE; PCB; urban area; Article; Canada; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); controlled study; effluent; lake; mass spectrometry; pollution monitoring; pollution transport; urban area; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; water sampling; environmental monitoring; lake; Ontario; water pollutant; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; Hamilton Harbor; Lake Ontario; Ontario [Canada]; Environmental Monitoring; Flame Retardants; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Lakes; Ontario; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084601149

The large regional disparities in economic development and air pollution across China calls for regionally differentiated policies. Previous studies have not systematically investigated the environmental impacts of regional carbon policies in China covering different spatial scales. This study constructs a multi-regional dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model covering 30 provinces of China to assess the impacts of national and subnational carbon polices on CO2 emissions and co-emitted air pollutants from 2020 to 2050. We consider one national carbon policy which aims to achieve China's 2030 national CO2 abatement target, as well as three regional policies with the same policy stringency as the national one but only applied to eastern China (EP), the Jiangsu-Shanghai-Zhejiang area (JSZP), and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area (BTHP), respectively. We find that regional policies (EP, JSZP, and BTHP) are as effective in reducing CO2 emissions in their targeted regions as the national policy. However, they lead to an increase in CO2 emissions in untargeted regions (the so-called “emissions leakage”). The CO2 leakage rates, which depend on the policy spatial coverage, are 4%, 13%, and 65% for EP, JSZP, and BTHP, respectively, in 2050. Compared with CO2, changes in air pollutant emissions, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), exhibit a similar pattern under all policy scenarios, but the magnitude of change is significantly smaller. Transportation, thermal power, and some energy intensive industries are the three largest contributors to CO2 and air pollutant emission reductions. Our results suggest that regional carbon policy is effective in reducing CO2 and air pollutant emissions in the targeted regions, and extending the spatial coverage or increasing policy stringency can largely inhibit emissions leakage. © 2020","Air pollutants; CGE modeling; Emissions leakage; Mitigation; Subnational carbon policy","carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; carbon; carbon dioxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; environmental impact; global climate; pollution policy; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollutant; Article; carbon footprint; China; computable general equilibrium model; environmental impact; environmental policy; particulate matter; air pollution; environment; environmental monitoring; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088042049

Whilst highly successful in many regions, in areasdominated by agricultural burning, MODIS-based (MODIS: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) fire emissions inventories such as the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) and Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) are suspected of significantly underestimating the magnitude of biomass burning emissions due to the typically very small, but highly numerous, fires involved that are quite easily missed by coarser-spatial-resolution remote sensing observations. To address this issue, we use twice-daily fire radiative power (FRP) observations from the ""small-fire-optimised""VIIRS-IM FRP product and combine them with fire diurnal cycle information taken from the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite. Using this we generate a unique high-spatio-temporal-resolution agricultural burning inventory for eastern China for the years 2012-2015, designed to fully take into accountsmall fires well below the MODIS burned area or active fire detection limit, focusing on dry matterburned (DMB) and emissions of CO2, CO, PM 2.5, and black carbon. We calculate DMB totals 100% to 400% higher than reported by the GFAS and GFED4.1s, and we quantify interesting spatial and temporal patterns previously un-noted. Wheat residue burning, primarily occurring in May-June, is responsible for more than half of the annual crop residue burning emissions of all species, whilst a secondary peak in autumn (September-October) is associated with rice and corn residue burning. We further identify a new winter (November-December) burning season, hypothesised to be caused by delays in burning drivenby the stronger implementation of residue burning bans during the autumn post-harvest season. Whilst our emissions estimates are far higher than those of other satellite-based emissions inventories for the region, they are lower than estimates made using traditional ""crop-yield-based approaches""(CYBAs) by a factor of between 2 and 5. We believe that this is at least in part caused by outdated and overly high burning ratios being used in the CYBA, leading to the overestimation of DMB. Therefore, we conclude that satellite remote sensing approaches which adequately detect the presence of agricultural fires are a far better approach to agricultural fire emission estimation. © 2020 Author(s).",,"biomass burning; carbon emission; forest fire; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; trend analysis; VIIRS; China; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091863677

The pulse modulation forms are: single rectangular pulse modulation, continuous rectangular pulse modulation, and combined rectangular pulse modulation. The results shown that adjusting the modulation time width effectively suppressed energy dissipation, the system coherence evolution was protected, and the amplitude of atomic population oscillation became larger. The coherence evolution of the system is effectively protected under short-length combined rectangular pulse modulation.

Moreover, the effects of different carbon nanotube contents on the load-deformation characteristics, including the stress-strain response, displacement field, maximum shear strain field, Poisson's ratio and energy drop release law, of carbon nanotube-reinforced foam concrete materials are investigated. The results show that the ultimate strain of the carbon nanotube-reinforced foam concrete materials is much larger than that of brittle materials, such as ordinary concrete and rock. As the carbon nanotube content increases, the carbon nanotube-reinforced foam concrete specimen provides higher post-peak compressive resistance under certain deformation conditions. This property is a performance requirement of surrounding rock support pressure relief materials. It is proposed that the deformation localization starting conditions of the carbon nanotube-reinforced foam concrete specimens are divided into strain decision conditions and stress decision conditions. The strain decision condition is 86.8% of the peak strain, and the stress decision condition is 80.2% of the peak stress. It is suggested that the strain condition is more reasonable than the stress condition as the starting condition for deformation localization in the carbon nanotube-reinforced foam concrete specimens. So on after deformation localization starts, the corresponding Poisson's ratio-strain curve exhibits a steep increase. The energy release process of carbon nanotube-reinforced foam concrete is measured by the energy drop release rate. The energy release process of the carbon nanotube-reinforced foam concrete specimens with 0.05% carbon nanotubes best satisfies the surrounding rock support pressure relief requirements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CNTs; Deformation under load; Digital speckle; Energy evolution; Foam concrete","Autoclaved aerated concrete; Compression testing; Deformation; Drops; Foams; Poisson ratio; Reinforced concrete; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Shear flow; Shear strain; Compressive resistance; Deformation conditions; Deformation localization; Displacement field; Energy-absorbing materials; Performance requirements; Stress-strain response; Uni-axial compression tests; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083759171

To understand the evolution of China’s carbon market, this paper firstly divides the development of China’s regional carbon markets into three phases: pilot construction (phase 1, before 31 May 2015), preparation for the UNETS (phase 2, 1 June 2015–19 December 2017), and formal construction of the UNETS (phase 3, 20 December 2017–present). Then this research reviews the trading performance and employs four robust variance ratio (VR) tests to capture structural changes and examine the efficiency of China’s eight regional carbon markets in different periods. Results show that compared to phase 1, smaller price volatility, larger daily trading volume, and higher market liquidity are more frequent at the later stages of majority markets. Despite these improvements, results from the VR tests indicate that the statistic in majority of China’s regional carbon markets is insignificant in any given period and, therefore, they are not weak-form efficient. The additional detrended cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that market liquidity affects market efficiency in the Hubei market only, which implies that Hubei, where the market liquidity reaches almost 100% in phase 3, is highly likely to be weak-form efficient shortly. Finally, several recommendations are provided to improve the efficiency and maturity of China’s carbon markets, including strengthening legislation, improving the market design, and constructing information platforms. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon market efficiency; China; Policy implications; Trading price; Trading volume","carbon emission; economic development; efficiency measurement; emissions trading; legislation; performance assessment; China; Hubei; carbon; China; economic development; productivity; Carbon; China; Economic Development; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086477809

A lot of research work has been performed on the response of Rs to land use change in this region. Nevertheless, the microbiological mechanism on the response of Rs to land use change has not been elucidated. In this study, Rs was measured during the conversion of cropland to plantations. Moreover, soil microbial community and metabolic function were analyzed by metagenomic sequencing. When the conversion of cropland to plantations was implemented, Rs significantly increased. Metagenomic analysis indicated that the conversion of cropland to plantations had a stronger impact on microbial abundance than microbial composition, which was reflected in the abundance of dominant phyla, such as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. Carbon metabolic pathways and genes also had a remarkable response to land use change. Although the abundance of some carbon metabolic genes decreased with the conversion of cropland to plantations, the abundance of CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes) genes increased. Moreover, carbon metabolic genes with significant differences affiliated to above dominant phyla. All results indicated that the conversion of cropland to plantations changed microbial abundance, which in turn affected abundance of carbon metabolic and CAZy genes. The increase in the storage of organic matter caused by the above changes promoted microbial catabolism for producing a large amount of CO2 in plantations soil, which was reflected by high Rs. Our study provides insights into the microbiological mechanism on the response of Rs to land use change during the conversion of cropland to plantations in the Loess Plateau of China. © 2020 The Authors","Land use change; Loess plateau; Metagenomics; Microbial community; Microbial function; Soil respiration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083638727

In order to control the rapid spread of the virus, the Chinese government implemented a national lockdown policy. It restricted human mobility and non-essential economic activities, which, as a side effect, resulted in the reduction of the emission of pollutants and thus the improvement of the air quality in many cities in China. In this paper, we report on a study on the changes in air quality in the Guanzhong Basin during the COVID-19 lockdown period. We compared the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 obtained from ground-based monitoring stations before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis confirmed that the air quality in the Guanzhong Basin was significantly improved after the COVID-19 outbreak. During the emergency response period with the strictest restrictions (Level-1), the concentrations of PM2.5 , PM10 , SO2, NO2 and CO were lower by 37%, 30%, 29%, 52% and 33%, respectively, compared with those before the COVID-19 outbreak. In contrast, O3 concentrations increased substantially. The changes in the pollutant concentrations varied between cities during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The highest O3 concentration changes were observed in Xi'an, Weinan and Xianyang city; the SO2 concentration decreased substantially in Tongchuan city; the air quality had improved the most in Baoji City. Next, to complement the sparsely distributed air quality ground-based monitoring stations, the geographic and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model, combined with satellite observations of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological factors was used to estimate the spatial and temporal distributions of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations with a resolution of 6 km × 6 km before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The model was validated by a comparison with ground-based observations from the air quality monitoring network in five cities in the Guanzhong Basin with excellent statistical metrics. For PM2.5 and PM10 the correlation coefficients R2 were 0.86 and 0.80, the root mean squared errors (RMSE) were 11.03 μg/m3 and 14.87 μg/m3 and the biases were 0.19 μg/m3 and -0.27 μg/m3, which led to the conclusion that the GTWR model could be used to estimate the PM concentrations in locations where monitoring data were not available. Overall, the PM concentrations in the Guanzhong Basin decreased substantially during the lockdown period, with a strong initial decrease and a slower one thereafter, although the spatial distributions remained similar. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; AOD; COVID-19; GTWR model; Particulate matter","Air quality; Economics; Mean square error; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Viruses; Air quality monitoring networks; Correlation coefficient; Ground-based monitoring; Ground-based observations; PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations; Pollutant concentration; Root mean squared errors; Spatial and temporal distribution; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092261367

The results revealed that the gold in the ore mainly occurred as visible native gold, which can be leached easily via cyanidation, whereas the visible silver minerals occurred as native silver, acanthite, chlorargyrite, acanthite, pyrargyrite, andorite and polybasite. Nevertheless, most of the silver occured as invisible silver in manganese oxide ore with the form of isomorphs and could not be leached via direct cyanidation. A pretreatment of reductive acid leaching using sodium sulphite as a reductant successfully leached the manganese and liberated the silver, which was very beneficial for the cyanidation of silver. The manganese was enriched in the leaching solution at a concentration of 16.51 g/L with an average leaching percentage of 70.27% after five-stage cyclic reductive acid leaching under optimised conditions of 1.0 mol/L of H2SO4, 20 g/L of Na2SO3, a liquid-solid ratio of 5:1, and stirring speed of 300 r/min at room temperature (28 ± 1 °C) for 1.0 h. We could easily recover 99.90% copper and 99.80% manganese from the leaching solution via iron powder reduction and sodium carbonate precipitation. Following the leaching of manganese, the cyanidation leaching percentages of gold and silver were to 87.37% and 80.19% respectively.

Both deposit into leaves via stomata, which on the one hand benefits air quality and on the other hand provides an additional source of nitrogen for plants. In this study, we first determined the NO and NO2 specific deposition velocities based on projected leaf area (sVd) using a branch enclosure system. We studied four tree species that are regarded as suitable to be planted under predicted future urban climate conditions: Carpinus betulus, Fraxinus ornus, Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Ostrya carpinifolia. The NO and NO2 sVd were found similar in all tree species. Second, in order to confirm NO metabolization, we fumigated plants with 15NO and quantified the incorporation of 15N in leaf materials of these trees and four additional urban tree species (Celtis australis, Alnus spaethii, Alnus glutinosa, and Tilia henryana) under controlled environmental conditions. Based on these 15N-labeling experiments, A. glutinosa showed the most effective incorporation of 15NO. Third, we tried to elucidate the mechanism of metabolization. Therefore, we generated transgenic poplars overexpressing Arabidopsis thaliana phytoglobin 1 or 2. Phytoglobins are known to metabolize NO to nitrate in the presence of oxygen. The 15N uptake in phytoglobin-overexpressing poplars was significantly increased compared to wild-type trees, demonstrating that the NO uptake is enzymatically controlled besides stomatal dependence. In order to upscale the results and to investigate if a trade-off exists between air pollution removal and survival probability under future climate conditions, we have additionally carried out a modeling exercise of NO and NO2 deposition for the area of central Berlin. If the actually dominant deciduous tree species (Acer platanoides, Tilia cordata, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur) would be replaced by the species suggested for future conditions, the total annual NO and NO2 deposition in the modeled urban area would hardly change, indicating that the service of air pollution removal would not be degraded. These results may help selecting urban tree species in future greening programs. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Ghirardo, Gori, Albert, Buegger, Pace, Georgii, Grote, Schnitzler, Durner and Lindermayr.","15N; air pollution mitigation; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; phytoglobin; urban trees",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092520629

As the world's largest CO2 emitter, we reported China's recent progresses and pitfalls in climate actions to achieve climate mitigation targets (i.e., limit warming to 1.5–2°C above the pre-industrial level). We first summarized China's integrated actions (2015 onwards) that benefit both climate change mitigation and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These projects include re-structuring organizations, establishing working goals and actions, amending laws and regulations at national level, as well as increasing social awareness at community level. We then pointed out the shortcomings in different regions and sectors. Based on these analyses, we proposed five recommendations to help China improving its climate policy strategies, which include: 1) restructuring the economy to balance short-term and long-term conflicts; 2) developing circular economy with recycling mechanism and infrastructure; 3) building up unified national standards and more accurate indicators; 4) completing market mechanism for green economy and encouraging green consumption; and 5) enhancing technology innovations and local incentives via bottom-up actions. © 2020","China; Climate change; Climate policy; Sustainable Development Goals","bottom-up approach; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; innovation; Sustainable Development Goal; technological development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100566578

In plant science, two different scales have predominated in their use of ABM. One is the scale of populations and communities, through the modelling of collections of agents representing individual plants, interacting with each other and with the environment. The other is the scale of the individual plant, through the modelling, by functional-structural plant models (FSPMs), of agents representing plant building blocks, or metamers, to describe the development of plant architecture and functions within individual plants. The purpose of this review is to show key results and parallels in ABM for growth, mortality, carbon allocation, competition and reproduction across the scales from the plant organ to populations and communities on a range of spatial scales to the whole landscape. Several areas of application of ABMs are reviewed, showing that some issues are addressed by both population-level ABMs and FSPMs. Continued increase in the relevance of ABM to environmental science and management will be helped by greater integration of ABMs across these two scales. © 2020 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company 2020.","environmental gradients; forest succession; functional-structural plant models; gap phase models; global change; invasive plants; plant carbon allocation; Population-level models; spatial patterns; spatial scaling","biomass allocation; cell component; ecology; functional role; growth response; mortality; plant architecture; reproduction; reproductive behavior; carbon; ecology; plant; Carbon; Ecology; Plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091125658

The aim of this study is to delimitate PM2.5 pollution regions of Xianyang, which is very important to the regional environmental prevention and control. The result showed that PM2.5 air pollution had significant cross-administrative characteristics in Xianyang. Using spatial clustering algorithm under adjacent matrix constrain, this study classified the air quality monitoring sites into two clusters. For each monitoring site, we generated Voronoi polygons and ultimately Xianyang was delimitated into two regions, south and north. The air pollution of the southern region was more serious with 64 days of heavy and severe pollution since 2018, while the northern region had only 10 days. The southern region consisted of four complete administrative districts and parts of three administrative districts. While the northern region consisted of six complete administrative districts and parts of three administrative districts. Visualization of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the PM2.5 air pollution in the two regions further illustrated the significant difference. We suggest when heavy pollution happens, the two regions should be considered separately. If the southern region is heavily polluted while the northern region not, only the southern region needs to implement the emergency plan to minimize the damage to society and economy. Seventy-five percent of the city area, 2.3 million people, 59% of schools, and 43% of GDP would not be impacted if air pollution was controlled by region separately. The sensitive analysis shows that clustering result is robust against different pollution degree and missing values. © 2020 by the authors.","Cluster analysis; Fine particulate matter; Pollution regions; Sensitive analysis; Society and economy impact","Air quality; Clustering algorithms; Air quality monitoring; Clustering results; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Monitoring sites; Pollution degree; Prevention and controls; Sensitive analysis; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Pollution control; atmospheric pollution; cluster analysis; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution monitoring; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomic impact; China; Shaanxi; Xianyang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091859626

Thus, reducing energy intensity is one of the top priorities of China's ongoing transport upgrade. In this paper, by establishing a panel data regression model derived from the Cobb–Douglas cost function, we focus on investigating the impacts of energy price and transport productivity on transport energy intensity at the national and regional levels. The study uses the provincial panel data for 2005–2016 to perform regression analysis. The results show that: (1) energy price has a significantly negative effect on transport energy intensity in the whole China and the eastern region, whereas it has no significant impacts in the central and western China. (2) Improvements in transport productivity can effectively decrease transport energy intensity in the whole China and the three major regions. (3) Applying an extended data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, we decompose transport productivity into four components (i.e., technical change, technology gap change, scale efficiency change, and pure efficiency change) and further differentiate their impacts in different regions. The results indicate that these four components have substantially different impacts in each region. These results provide some valuable insights for policymakers and enterprise entities aiming to adopt measures to reduce energy intensity and achieve sustainable development in China's transport sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Energy intensity; Energy price; Regional disparity; Transport productivity; Transport sector","comparative study; data envelopment analysis; energy intensity; sustainable development; transportation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076243627

The precise accounting of sources of N2O is essential to national and global budgets, as well as the understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships with environmental variables such as rainfall, air and soil temperature, and soil moisture. The objective of this work was to investigate the temporal correlations of N2O fluxes with soil and air temperatures, as well as soil moisture. N2O fluxes were measured over four biofuel crops in Central Illinois during their establishment phase. Measurements were carried out from 2009 to 2011 using a trace gas analyzer (TGA) with tunable laser technology. Measurements of concentrations of N2O and CO2 were taken at the center of four plots of maize/soybean rotation, miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and a mixture of native prairie plants. Cumulative fluxes indicate an average emission of nitrogen via N2O fluxes on the order of 1.5 kg N ha−1 year−1, in agreement with chamber measurements previously reported for the site. N2O fluxes were associated with peaks in soil and air temperature, and soil moisture, particularly during spring and winter thaws. Cross-wavelet analysis was used to investigate the correlation between N2O fluxes and those variables. Results indicate that N2O fluxes and meteorological variables have significant covariance in time scales ranging from 4 to 32 days. In addition, temporal delays of 1–8 days were found in those relationships. Cross-wavelet patterns were similar when relating N2O fluxes with soil temperature, air temperature and soil moisture. The temporal patterns of fluxes and environmental variables reported here support the modeling of emissions and highlight the importance of considering the timing of fluxes in relation to trends in meteorological variables. © 2020 The Authors.

For the methanogenic tests, a thermophilic anaerobic sludge has been used as inoculum while the thermal treatment of the anaerobic sludge allowed the acetogenic inoculum selection. The optimal pH has been selected through methane and acetate hydrogenophilic tests at three different pH values (5.5, 6.5, 7.5) while three different cathodic potentials (-0.7, −0.9, −1.1 V vs SHE) have been tested in bioelectrochemical experiments by using the optimum pH value. Both methane and acetate production showed higher efficiency by the use of the bioelectrochemical system instead of the corresponding hydrogenophilic tests, i.e. during the −0.9 V vs SHE bioelectrochemical condition, the efficiency for methane and acetate reached the 95 and 88% while in the hydrogenophilic tests the efficiency resulted considerably lower, with average values of 11% and 16% for methane and acetate, respectively. The higher efficiency of the bioelectrochemical system has been also confirmed by the determination of methane and acetate production rate which shown a 45 and 66% increase with respect the hydrogenophilic tests. The higher efficiency of bioelectrochemical tests has been justified by assuming a higher hydrogen mass transfer from the electrode surface to the attached biofilm. Moreover, the bioelectrochemical tests suggested the presence of a direct electron uptake for methane production, while for the acetate production, a hydrogen mediated mechanism appeared necessary. Finally, the microbial community characterization by the DGGE analysis highlighted the effectiveness of the thermal treatment for acetogens selection by methanogens inhibition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biocathode; Bioelectrochemical systems; Bioelectrosynthesis; CO2 utilization; Homoacetogenesis; Methanogenesis inhibition","Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Heat treatment; Mass transfer; Microorganisms; pH; Bio-electrochemical; Bio-electrochemical systems; Cathodic potentials; Electrode surfaces; Higher efficiency; Methane production; Microbial community characterizations; Production rates; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084238536

Reforestation has recently been identified as a promising nature-based climate solution. Yet there are context-dependent biophysical, financial, land-use and operational constraints to reforestation that demand careful consideration. Here, we show that 121 million ha of presently degraded land in Southeast Asia, a region noted for its significant reforestation potential, are biophysically suitable for reforestation. Reforestation of this land would contribute 3.43 ± 1.29 PgCO2e yr−1 to climate mitigation through 2030. However, by taking a combination of on-the-ground financial, land use and operational constraints into account, we find that only a fraction of that mitigation potential may be achievable (0.3–18%). Such constraints are not insurmountable, but they show that careful planning and consideration are needed for effective landscape-scale reforestation. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate change; economic conditions; environmental planning; land use; reforestation; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089541984

Three vegetation types (no grazing and logging in grasslands and forests, and planted herbs and small shrubs in bare land in the desert) on the Loess Plateau in China were chosen as subjects, and pyrosequencing of the 18S rRNA gene region was used to analyze the changes in the diversity and community composition of soil fungi. Vegetation type had significant effects on soil fungal diversity. The forest and grassland soils had similar fungal diversity levels, which were significantly higher than that of the desert ecosystem. Multiple regression models indicated that total phosphorus in soil and the ratio of soil organic carbon to total nitrogen in soil (C:N) were the best predictors of soil fungal diversity. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most dominant phyla in all soils, accounting for 83.6 % of fungal sequences. Dothideomycetes (26.6 %), Sordariomycetes (18.3 %), Eurotiomycetes (8.5 %), Pezizomycetes (12.1 %) and Dothideomycetes (10.7 %) were the dominant classes across the three vegetation types. Agaricomycetes and Sordariomycetes were more dominant in forest soils than grasslands and desert soils, while Pezizomycetes were more frequently observed in desert soils. Along an increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradient, relative abundance of the Ascomycota phylum decreased and that of the Basidiomycota increased. Among local environmental factors, MAP, soil pH and soil organic matter were the main factors influencing the soil fungal community composition, explaining 20.9 %, 15.9 % and 10.4 % of the variation in the fungal community, respectively.

The catalyst synthetized by the hydrothermal method was thoroughly characterized by means of XRD, XRF, Raman and SEM techniques. Combustion of methane was performed in a TPSR mode using sole 16O2 or a 1:1 mixture of 16O2 and 18O2. Two distinct mechanistic pathways of the C[sbnd]H bond activation, and subsequent oxidation of the consecutive intermediates involve a suprafacial mechanism operating in the oxygen covered surface and an interfacial mechanism operating on the oxygen depleted/bare surface. It was found that depending on the conditions they may act separately in the early and late stages of the reaction, and simultaneously in the middle phase, in response to differences in the nature and accessibility of the surface and lattice oxygen species, however the activation of the first C– bond remains the kinetically relevant step. The cobalt-oxo CoT2c–O species exhibit the highest activity in the suprafacial C[sbnd]H bond breaking, and the peroxo O22– species are engaged in the intermediate reaction steps leading to formation of final H2O and CO2 products. On the oxygen exhausted surface, where the interfacial mechanism operates, dual Co–O sites constituted by CoO5c–O3O and CoT2c–O2O,1T pairs may activate the C[sbnd]H bond in a concerted way, with the former being more active. For all the mechanistic steps the transition and stable states of the involved intermediates and products were identified and quantified in terms of their structure and the associated free enthalpy profiles. The three dimensional (log(kintra/ksupra) versus (ΔGasupra-ΔGasupra) and ΘO) diagrams were constructed to discriminate between the suprafacial (Eley-Rideal/Langmuir-Hinshelwood) and interfacial (Mars-van Krevelen) mechanism of CH4 combustion. It is believed that the main features of the established mechanism are also applicable in the case of the methane oxidation over other electron rich transition metal oxides. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Activation of C[sbnd]H bond; CH4 combustion; Co3O4 nanocrystals; Langmuir-Hinshelwood; Mars–van Krevelen; Reaction mechanism","Carbon dioxide; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical activation; Chemical bonds; Cobalt; Cobalt deposits; Combustion; Isotopes; Methane; Oxidation; Oxygen; Transition metal oxides; Co3O4 nanocrystals; H-bonds; Interfacial mechanism; Intermediate reactions; Isotopic investigation; Langmuir-Hinshelwood; Oxygen-covered surfaces; Reaction mechanism; Reaction intermediates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064180655

It is shown that the air quality in urban and rural settlements improves, despite the absence of sustainable positive dynamics in reducing gross emissions of stationary and mobile sources. To explain this phenomenon, it has been suggested that as a result of the spatial redistribution of the location of the emissions sources, residential, recreational and other standardized zones, the sources of exposure to atmospheric air are removed from the places of population. The main substances that affect the atmospheric air quality in the Russian Federation are benzo(a)pyrene, ethylbenzene, carbon, suspended solids, hydrogen fluoride, mercury, hydroxybenzene, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide and acrolein. The study showed that atmospheric pollution with benzo(a)pyrene decreased 3.14 times, with suspended solids 9.36 times, with carbon monoxide 9.28 times, and with hydroxybenzene 8.74 times. There was a reduction in exposure of carbon monoxide emissions (by 1.236 million tons, VOCs (by 580 thousand tons) and nitrogen oxides (by 297 thousand tons). The quality of ambient air and its change in the Russian Federation was influenced by a number of natural and anthropogenic factors such as adverse weather conditions for dispersion of impurities in the atmosphere, forest fires, industrial accidents and disasters, implementation of planning decisions on the territory of urban and rural settlements, allowing to place emission sources into the ambient air at the necessary distance from residential areas, and to implement the principle of distance protection and etc. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air quality; Biotechnology; Carbon monoxide; Deforestation; Disasters; Fluorine compounds; Gas engineering; Housing; Hydrogen sulfide; Industrial emissions; Industrial hygiene; Nitrogen oxides; Occupational diseases; Pyrene; Rural areas; Sulfur compounds; Anthropogenic factors; Atmospheric pollution; Carbon monoxide emissions; Distance protection; Hydrogen fluoride; Industrial accident; Residential areas; Russian federation; Atmospheric chemistry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091195147

In order to cope with the serious problem of SO2 pollution, this study attempts to explore the spatial temporal variations of industrial SO2 emissions in China utilizing the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light (NSL) data. We first explored the relationship between the NSL data and the statistical industrial SO2 emissions at the provincial level, and confirmed that there was a positive correlation between these two datasets. Consequently, 17 linear regression models were established based on the NSL data and the provincial statistical emissions to model the spatial-temporal dynamics of China’s industrial SO2 emissions from 1997 to 2013. Next, the NSL-based estimated results were evaluated utilizing the prefectural statistical industrial SO2 emissions and emission inventory data, respectively. Finally, the distribution of China’s industrial SO2 emissions at 1 km spatial resolution were estimated, and the temporal and spatial dynamics were explored from multiple scales (national scale, regional scale and scale of urban agglomeration). The results show that: (1) The NSL data can be successfully applied to estimate the dynamic changes of China’s industrial SO2 emissions. The coefficient of determination (R2) values of the NSL-based estimation results in most years were greater than 0.6, and the relative error (RE) values were less than 10%, when validated by the prefectural statistical SO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with the inventory emissions, the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj.R-Square) reached 0.61, with the significance at the 0.001 level. (2) During the observation period, the temporal and spatial dynamics of industrial SO2 emissions varied greatly in different regions. The high growth type was largely distributed in China’s Western region, Central region, and Shandong Peninsula, while the no-obvious-growth type was concentrated in Western region, Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan and Middle south of Liaoning. The high grade of industrial SO2 emissions was mostly concentrated in China’s Eastern region, Western region, Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou and Shandong Peninsula, while the low grade mainly concentrated in China’s Western region, Middle south of Liaoning and Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan. These results of our research can not only enhance the understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of industrial SO2 emissions in China, but also offer some scientific references for formulating feasible industrial SO2 emission reduction policies. © 2020 Yue et al.

In a firmly controlled rhizosphere system, we added a glucose solution through artificial roots to soils collected from two subalpine coniferous forests (an approximately 200-year-old spruce-fir forest and an approximately 70-year-old spruce plantation) with the soils subsequently incubated over 25 days. The results showed that the addition of glucose significantly increased the concentrations of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) bound in both metal-organic complexes (MOCs) and short-range order phases (SROs) by 45%, 68%, 31% and 38%, respectively (soil-averaged), which indicated that glucose addition enhanced the formation of physicochemical-protected SOM. The induced protection of SOM mainly resulted from the stimulation of interactions of the microbial residues with soil minerals and/or metal cations, as indicated by the concurrently increased microbial communities and zeta potential after glucose addition. Moreover, the glucose-induced absolute changes in MOCs at the spruce-fir site were higher than those at the spruce plantation site, whereas the changes in SROs exhibited an opposite trend to that observed for MOCs. This discrepancy is presumably due to the higher organic matter content with more extractable metals at the spruce-fir site being more beneficial for supporting microbial stabilization of glucose and subsequent necromass sequestration as MOCs. In addition, more clay minerals at the spruce plantation site had larger surface areas and more binding sites to bind microbial-derived organic molecules as SROs. Collectively, our findings provide robust evidence that the input of labile C to soils could facilitate the formation of physicochemical-protected SOM, which is potentially involved in transformation into microbial residues and subsequent interaction with metal cations and/or minerals and may also be mediated by soil properties. The formation of protected SOM may potentially offset native SOM decomposition and thus has ecologically important implications for long-term terrestrial C storage. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Clay; Metal-organic association; Microbial community; Rhizosphere process; Subalpine coniferous forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089409951

We analyzed the gross primary productivity (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), and evapotranspiration (ET) derived from MODIS and three earth system models participated in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in the Asian permafrost region. The water use efficiency (WUE) was further computed. The simulated GPP, NPP, and ET show slightly increasing trends during historical period (1900–2014) and strong increasing trends in projection period (2015–2100), and projected impacts of climate change on all variables are greater under high-emission scenarios than low-emission scenarios. Further analysis revealed higher increases in GPP and NPP than that of ET, indicating that vegetation carbon sequestration governs the growing WUE under historical and projected periods in this region. The GPP, NPP and ET showed higher changing rates in western, central and southeast areas of this region, and WUE (WUEGPP, and WUENPP) shows the similar spatial pattern. Compared to MODIS-derived GPP, NPP, and ET during 2000–2014, Earth system models yield the best estimates for NPP, while slight underestimations for GPP and ET, and thus slight overestimations for WUEGPP and WUENPP. This study highlights the predominant role of vegetation activity in regulating regional WUE in Asian permafrost region under future climate change. Vegetation domination of the growing water use efficiency implies that the permafrost region may continue acting efficiently in sequestrating atmospheric carbon in terms of water consumption throughout the 21st century. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; CMIP6; Earth system model; Siberia; WUE","Carbon; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Permafrost; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Radiometers; Vegetation; Water supply; Carbon sequestration; Earth system model; Global climate system; Gross primary productivity; Low emission scenarios; Net primary productivity; Vegetation activity; Water use efficiency; Climate change; CMIP; evapotranspiration; MODIS; permafrost; primary production; vegetation dynamics; water use efficiency; Article; carbon cycling; carbon sequestration; climate change; evapotranspiration; fluid intake; nonhuman; permafrost; plant water use; primary production (biomass); priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation; water loss; wetland; carbon cycle; ecosystem; theoretical model; Asia; water; Carbon Cycle; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Models, Theoretical; Permafrost; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085543793

Compared to a centralized approach, low voltage grids (decentralized and distributed) are promising approaches to integrating non-dispatchable renewable energy sources (RESs). Installing local micro level power generation sources such as fuel cells, microturbines, and energy storage systems are a recent trend which helps in the intermittent effects of RESs and makes microgrids less dependable on the main grid. Due to the increasing variety of distributed generation sources having diverse characteristics, power dispatch scheduling of distributed microgrids is becoming challenging. A dispatch scheduling solution from an operator's point of view is presented by the authors. The core objective of this study is to minimize the carbon emissions and the cost of each microgrid.

We measured the extent of particulate matter (PM) reduction at a buffer green area in the Sihwa Industrial Complex. PM was measured at the industrial complex, the urban green area, and a nearby residential area from April to October 2019. PM reduction rates were highest at the urban green area in August and October, which is related to increased atmospheric mixing height and the active west wind blowing from the industrial complex to the residential area. Reduction rates of PM10 and PM2.5 at the urban green area showed the lowest values, namely 14.4% and 25.3%, respectively. The air temperature, wind speed, and humidity could affect the PM reduction rate by influencing the movement and dispersion of PM at the micro-spatiotemporal scale. These results indicated that PM concentration could be reduced by the structural change of a forest layer at a micro scale in urban green areas. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollutants; Atmospheric mixing height; PM reduction; Sihwa Industrial Complex; Urban green area; Wind speed","air temperature; complexity; concentration (composition); dispersion; forest cover; greenspace; humidity; particulate matter; reduction; spatiotemporal analysis; wind velocity; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091180265

Simulations that applied basic emissions (BASE) and simulations that applied reduced SO2 emissions from foreign sources (R_FSO2) were performed, respectively, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) two-way coupled model. In addition, the difference between the two experimental results was calculated (i.e., R_FSO2 minus BASE) to quantitatively identify the impact of foreign SO2 emission reduction. The reduction in foreign SO2 emissions caused a decrease in the concentration of SO2 flowing in from overseas to South Korea. As a result, a clear decrease in SO42- concentration was shown mainly in the southwest coast of South Korea. The difference in PM2.5 concentration in South Korea according to the foreign SO2 emission reduction did not correspond to the difference in SO42- concentration; it was determined in a complex way by the changes in SO42- concentration caused by SO2 concentration changes, and the subsequent series of changes in NO3- and NH4+ concentrations. The differences in SO42- and PM2.5 concentrations caused by the foreign SO2 reduction also affected the ADRE changes in South Korea. The distribution of ADRE difference between the two experiments was not consistent with the distribution of PM2.5 concentration difference, but it was very similar to the distribution of SO42- concentration difference. These results imply that the ADRE of South Korea is not simply proportional to PM2.5 concentration and may be determined by concentration changes of SO42-. © 2020 by the authors.","Aerosol direct radiative effects; SO2 emissions; SO42-; WRF-CMAQ two-way coupled model","Aerosols; Air quality; Emission control; Weather forecasting; Community multi-scale air qualities; Concentration change; Coupled modeling; PM2.5 concentration; Radiative effects; SO2 emissions; South Korea; Weather research and forecasting; Sulfur dioxide; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; concentration (composition); numerical model; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; weather forecasting; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091339570

To inform action at provincial levels in China, we estimated the exposure to air pollution and its effect on deaths, disease burden, and loss of life expectancy across all provinces in China from 1990 to 2017. Methods: In all 33 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions in China, we estimated exposure to air pollution, including ambient particulate matter pollution (defined as the annual gridded concentration of PM2·5), household air pollution (defined as the percentage of households using solid cooking fuels and the corresponding exposure to PM2·5), and ozone pollution (defined as average gridded ozone concentrations). We used the methods of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 to estimate deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to air pollution, and what the life expectancy would have been if air pollution levels had been less than the minimum level causing health loss. Findings: The average annual population-weighted PM2·5 exposure in China was 52·7 μg/m3 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 41·0–62·8) in 2017, which is 9% lower than in 1990 (57·8 μg/m3, 45·0–67·0). We estimated that 1·24 million (95% UI 1·08–1·40) deaths in China were attributable to air pollution in 2017, including 851 660 (712 002–990 271) from ambient PM2·5 pollution, 271 089 (209 882–346 561) from household air pollution from solid fuels, and 178 187 (67 650–286 229) from ambient ozone pollution. The age-standardised DALY rate attributable to air pollution was 1513·1 per 100 000 in China in 2017, and was higher in males (1839·8 per 100 000) than in females (1198·3 per 100 000). The age-standardised death rate attributable to air pollution decreased by 60·6% (55·7–63·7) for China overall between 1990 and 2017, driven by an 85·4% (83·2–87·3) decline in household air pollution and a 12·0% (1·4–22·1) decline in ambient PM2·5 pollution. 40·0% of DALYs for COPD were attributable to air pollution, as were 35·6% of DALYs for lower respiratory infections, 26·1% for diabetes, 25·8% for lung cancer, 19·5% for ischaemic heart disease, and 12·8% for stroke. We estimated that if the air pollution level in China was below the minimum causing health loss, the average life expectancy would have been 1·25 years greater. The DALY rate per 100 000 attributable to air pollution varied across provinces, ranging from 482·3 (371·1–604·1) in Hong Kong to 1725·6 (720·4–2653·1) in Xinjiang for ambient pollution, and from 18·7 (9·1–34·0) in Shanghai to 1804·5 (1339·5–2270·1) in Tibet for household pollution. Although the overall mortality attributable to air pollution decreased in China between 1990 and 2017, 12 provinces showed an increasing trend during the past 27 years. Interpretation: Pollution from ambient PM2·5 and household burning of solid fuels decreased markedly in recent years in China, after extensive efforts to control emissions. However, PM2·5 concentrations still exceed the WHO Air Quality Guideline for the entire population of China, with 81% living in regions exceeding the WHO Interim Target 1, and air pollution remains an important risk factor. Sustainable development policies should be implemented and enforced to reduce the impact of air pollution on long-term economic development and population health.

Few studies have investigated the role of sRNAs in Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). In the present study, the association between sRNA and biofilm formation in S. mutans was explored. sRNAs that are differentially expressed in the biofilm and planktonic states of this bacterium were identified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to investigate the characteristics of biofilm formation in a standard strain of S. mutans (UA159, ATCC 700610) and ten clinical strains. Bioinformatics analyses were employed to predict and examine potential sRNA regulatory pathways. The results showed that sRNA0426 has a strong positive relationship with dynamic biofilm formation. Moreover, sRNA0426 expression was positively correlated with exopolysaccharide (EPS) production. Bioinformatics analyses showed that sRNA0426 is involved in biofilm formation such as metabolic pathways, especially carbon metabolism. Five target mRNAs (GtfB, GtfC, GtfD, ComE, and CcpA) involved in the synthesis of EPS were selected for further evaluation; the expression levels of three of these mRNAs (GtfB, GtfC, and CcpA) were positively correlated with sRNA0426 expression levels, and the expression level of one (ComE) was negatively correlated. In conclusion, the results suggested that sRNA0426 may play an important and positive role in the biofilm formation of S. mutans and provide novel insight into the S. mutans biofilm regulatory network. © 2020 The Authors.

The ventilation and air conditioning system in the subway station is the key energy-consuming system. It consumes a large amount of energy every day to provide a comfortable environment for passengers, and it has therefore received increasingly more attention from researchers worldwide. In this work, the variation law of the ventilation and air conditioning system of a subway station is analyzed from three aspects (energy consumption, load, and temperature) based on field test data, and the problems existing in the operation and management of the system are analyzed. For example, the results show that the total load of fresh air in the station was as high as 34–37%, and about 30 min was required to adjust the indoor temperature to a stable state. In addition, three general models and seven energy-saving strategies are put forward, and their energy saving potentials are estimated. After optimization, the ventilation and air conditioning system is found to reduce energy consumption by more than 30%.

This highly dynamic methane reservoir is susceptible to be modified by bottom water warming. The warming may lead to gas hydrate destabilization releasing elevated methane fluxes to the seafloor and seawater. Reconstructing past methane dynamics can be achieved by using specific proxies left in the geological record. In this study, we apply a multi-proxy approach for paleo seepage reconstruction from sediment records at gas hydrate mounds (GHMs) in Storfjordrenna (south of the Svalbard archipelago). These shallow water (∼380 m water depth) systems are potentially vulnerable to global warming related temperature changes. 14C dating of foraminifera shells indicated an onset of deglaciation in the Storfjordrenna region at ∼20 kyr BP and allowed us to establish a stratigraphic context based on sediment Zr/Rb and Fe/Ca ratios. Several major (between 15 and 17 kyr BP) and minor methane venting phases were identified and interpreted to be related to gas hydrate instability triggered by isostatic adjustment right after the onset of the deglaciation. The detection of all major methane releases was only possible by combining data sets of stable carbon isotope compositions of foraminifera, mineralogy and δ13C values of authigenic carbonates, and abundance and stable carbon isotope signatures of lipid biomarkers. The most robust single proxy in this study was provided by the δ13C values of archaeal biomarkers. In contrast, the sediment Ba/Ti ratios recorded only the major events. Our results highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of methane dynamics in a small area of some hundred meters across. © 2020 The Author(s)","Authigenic carbonates; Carbon isotopes; Foraminifera; Lipid biomarkers; Methane seepage reconstruction; Proxies","Biomarkers; Carbon; Gases; Global warming; Hydration; Hydrocarbon seepage; Isotopes; Methane; Minerals; Sediments; Stratigraphy; Authigenic carbonates; Bottom-water warming; Foraminifera shells; Methane emissions; Methane reservoirs; Stable carbon isotope compositions; Stable carbon isotopes; Temperature changes; Gas hydrates; abundance; bottom water; carbon isotope; cold seep; deglaciation; foraminifera; gas hydrate; global warming; methane; seepage; shallow water; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Archaea; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089282888

We review the properties of the chemical elements, overlaid with trends in the periodic table, which can help explain the historical - and present - dominance of hydrocarbons as fuels for power generation. However, the continued use of hydrocarbons as fuel/power sources to meet our economic and social needs is now recognized as a major driver of dangerous global environmental changes, including climate change, acid deposition, urban smog and the release of many toxic materials. This has resulted in an unprecedented interest in and focus on alternative, renewable or sustainable energy sources. A major area of interest to emerge is in hydrogen energy as a sustainable vector for our future energy needs. In that vision, the issue of hydrogen storage is now a key challenge in support of hydrogen-fuelled transportation using fuel cells. The chemistry of hydrogen is itself beautifully diverse through a variety of different types of chemical interactions and bonds forming compounds with most other elements in the periodic table. In terms of their hydrogen storage and production properties, we outline various relationships among hydride compounds and materials of the chemical elements to provide some qualitative and quantitative insights. These encompass thermodynamic and polarizing strength properties to provide such background information. We provide an overview of the fundamental nature of hydrides particularly in relation to the key operating parameters of hydrogen gravimetric storage density and the desorption/operating temperature at which the requisite amount of hydrogen is released for use in the fuel cell. While we await the global transition to a completely renewable and sustainable future, it is also necessary to seek CO 2 mitigation technologies applied to the use of fossil fuels. We review recent advances in the strategy of using hydrocarbon fossil fuels themselves as compounds for the high capacity storage and production of hydrogen without any CO 2 emissions. Based on these advances, the world may end up with a hydrogen economy completely different from the one it had expected to develop; remarkably, with 'Green hydrogen' being derived directly from the hydrogen-stripping of fossil fuels.

By conducting real-world driving and emission measurements with a portable emission measurement system, we found that the usage of the speed guided-ITS (SG-ITS) significantly reduces fuel consumption and pollutant emissions (i.e., carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particle number) of both tested vehicles (a light-duty gasoline car and a heavy-duty diesel truck) through decreasing the frequency of starts and stops, the strength of acceleration, and the time proportions of acceleration and idle. These reductions obtained from real-world measurements are higher than those predicted by vehicle emission models such as Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) and Computer Programme to calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT). Reductions in fuel consumption and pollutant emissions due to the usage of the SG-ITS are most efficient on urban roads (low traffic) among all the three road types, while the most time saving can be obtained on urban roads (high traffic). By combining a high-resolution vehicle emission inventory, we estimate that the implementation of the SG-ITS may significantly reduce the total vehicular exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, and particulate matter in Beijing by 15.9%, 20.5%, 23.9%, and 22.5%, respectively. Our study directly evaluates the benefits of using SG-ITS based on real-world measurements, highlighting that implementation of the SG-ITS can be a practical policy option in terms of efficiently reducing energy consumption, mitigating urban air pollution, and alleviating urban traffic congestion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Intelligent transportation systems; Real-world measurement; Speed-guided; Vehicle emission","Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Commercial vehicle operations; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Intelligent systems; Motor transportation; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Emission measurement; Emission measurement systems; Intelligent transportation systems; Motor vehicle emissions; Reducing energy consumption; Urban traffic congestion; Vehicle emission models; Vehicular exhaust emissions; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085270711

Using data from a 4-year (2015-2018) field manipulation experiment, we explored effects of changed precipitation in different periods on soil respiration (SR) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) in a semi-arid grassland in northern China. The results showed that: (1) Decreased precipitation both in the early (DEP), late (DLP), and entire growing season (DP) reduced SR, whereas DP and DLP rather than DEP reduced HR. The declines of SR in DLP and DP are larger than in DEP; (2) Increased precipitation in the early (IEP), late (ILP), and entire (IP) growing season promoted SR, but had little effect on HR. Enhancement of SR in IEP is larger than in ILP; (3) The change of SR and HR can be attributed to varied plant community cover which is related to soil water content; and (4) SR and HR are more sensitive to decreased than to increased precipitation, to DLP than DEP, and IEP than ILP. The findings suggest an asymmetric response of soil carbon process to precipitation in different periods, highlighting that future study should not neglect the role of precipitation timing in regulating ecosystem carbon fluxes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","carbon cycling; climate change; plant growth; precipitation magnitude and timing; soil water content; temperate steppe","carbon flux; grassland soil; growing season; heterotrophy; plant community; precipitation assessment; semiarid region; soil respiration; soil water; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086455695

Tourism scenic spots are important carriers of tourist activities and play a crucial role in low-carbon tourism. There are multiple factors affecting the low-carbon performance of a tourism scenic spot, and thus the performance evaluation and ranking of low-carbon tourism scenic spots can be framed as a hierarchical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This paper develops a novel method to tackle hierarchical MCDM problems, in which the importance preferences of criteria over the decision goal and sub-criteria with respect to the upper-level criterion are provided by linguistic-term-based pairwise comparisons and the assessments of alternatives over each of sub-criteria at the lowest level are furnished by positive interval values. The linguistic-term-based pairwise comparison matrices are converted into intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations and an approach is developed to obtain the global importance weights of the lowest level sub-criteria. A multiplicatively normalized intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix is established from the interval-value-based assessments of alternatives and a method is proposed to determine the intuitionistic fuzzy value based comprehensive scores of alternatives. A case study is offered to illustrate how to build a performance evaluation index system of low-carbon tourism scenic spots located at Zhejiang Province of China and show the use of the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy hierarchical MCDM method. © 2020 by the authors.

Prior studies suggest that water availability is the primary factor limiting potential woody cover. To this end, variations in future water availability due to climate change are likely to alter localized potential woody cover. This study aims to test this hypothesis in the savanna of central Texas, USA during the 21st century, with application of climate projection of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The established relationship between potential woody cover and observed mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1981-2010 in the study area works as the basis in this study. It turns out that the vast majority of Texas savanna will receive less precipitation in the rest of the 21st century to different degrees, depending on temporal stages and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). However, the potential woody cover does not necessarily change with precipitation. The semiarid region of Texas savanna and the very west portion of the mesic region will have lower potential woody cover.

In this paper, the ST ordinary kriging method was used to obtain the ST distribution of annual precipitation (AP) based on the data collected from the 961 meteorological monitoring stations of the Huanghuaihai basin in China during 1956–2016. Then, stochastic site indicators were applied to quantitatively assess the ST uncertainties, and the results indicated the probability that higher precipitation (beyond 1000 mm) occurred simultaneously at any two regions was extremely low. In terms of the AP intensity analysis, the annual rainfall in 50% of the regions exceeded 500 mm, and the largest fragmentation of AP was calculated from this threshold. Furthermore, the ST characterization and the trend of AP were analyzed in different climatic environments, indicating that (1) the AP increased from west to east, exhibiting a significant gradient distribution; (2) overall, the temperature of the study area increased by approximately 0.027 °C per year, while the AP decreased by 0.2 mm per year; (3) the temperature in three subregions [high-altitude region (HAR), mid-altitude region (MAR), low-altitude region (LAR)] exhibited an increasing trend, and the significant increasing trend of temperature occurred primarily in the LAR; (4) the precipitation in the MAR and LAR exhibited a nonsignificant decreasing trend, while the precipitation in the HAR showed a significant increasing trend. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Annual precipitation; Spatiotemporal characteristic; Spatiotemporal ordinary kriging; Stochastic site indicators","Interpolation; Stochastic systems; Altitude regions; Annual precipitation; Gradient distributions; Intensity analysis; Meteorological monitoring; Ordinary kriging; Ordinary kriging methods; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Uncertainty analysis; annual variation; climate modeling; kriging; numerical model; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076617839

Previous work has shown the “ignition delay” phenomenon in the forced ignition process, revealing that the burner ignition process is complex and needs further exploration. In this work, the spark ignition and flame kernel propagation in a centrally staged optical model combustor are experimentally investigated to further illustrate the interaction between random kernel motion and flow statistics from the perspective of timescales and kernel propagations. Stochasticity involved in each individual phases of the whole ignition is obtained via repeated high-speed imaging tests. Timescales of the successful ignition processes are analyzed in a statistical method, revealing the time randomness of ignition phases. Spatial probability of the flame kernel propagation in turbulent sprays is calculated and analyzed with the combination of time-averaged flow and spray distribution. The flame projected area evolutions show that the burner ignition phase can be further divided into three phases: flame propagation, flame residence and flame growth. Three modes of ignition failure are identified during the burner ignition phase. The flame residence phase features a special period of spark ignition with low light emissions from the highly wrinkled flame kernel in the center, which is the “ignition delay” before the growth of flame. Timescales of ignition stages involve stochasticity and the flame growth phase has a higher proportion in the whole process. Statistical analysis of the flame kernel spatial position shows that in turbulent spray the flame kernel has a greater probability of propagating to the region with low axial velocity, low shear strain rate, and appropriate spray concentration. © 2020","Flame kernel propagation; Separated dual-swirl; Spark ignition; Spray distribution","Aircraft engines; Crack propagation; Ignition; Probability distributions; Shear flow; Shear strain; Statistical methods; Strain rate; Combustion technology; Experimental investigations; Flame propagation; High speed imaging; Spatial positions; Spray concentrations; Spray distribution; Time-averaged flow; Flame research; aerosol; article; flame; growth curve; motion; probability; stochastic model; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086363249

However, to broaden the potential applications of B6O in the field, further improving its activity and understanding its fundamental chemical properties are essential. Herein, transition metal doping (Cr or Co) is designed to engineer the band structure of B6O via a solid state reaction. The valence band edge of Cr or Co doped B6O is proposed to be more positive than that of pristine B6O while the original conduction band of B6O is not much influenced by doping, contributing to the better light harvesting ability and lower charge recombination rate of doped B6O. The photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PEC) performances of doped B6O were therefore remarkably enhanced. The apparent quantum yields (AQY) of 20 wt% Cr or Co doped B6O are much higher than that of pristine B6O. In addition, the 20 wt% Cr doped B6O exhibits the best electrical conductivity and photocatalytic performance compared with the Co doped B6O and pristine B6O. The present work demonstrates a facile and effective strategy to engineer the band structure and reduce the charge migration resistance of B6O.

Results from two standard optimization procedures to solve the ZSG-DEA model are compared. We also extend the current methods by improving the iterative approach and then introduce fairness to the efficiency-oriented approach for the 2030 case. We found that the choice of optimization procedures has only a minimal impact on the results, but the specification of model does matter. For 2020, a standard DEA approach shows that only 2 provinces out of 30 are efficient. According to the estimation results of the ZSG-DEA model, 12 provinces need to set higher reduction targets, whereas the other 18 provinces could have lower target values to achieve overall efficiency. These results are generally consistent across different optimization approaches. The improved approach is applied to further evaluate a number of scenarios in 2030, in which the adjustment values towards optimum can be calculated for each scenario.

Based on the LCZ scheme, a LCZ mapping of Shenyang, a city in northeast China, was first constructed using the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) Level 0 method. Subsequently, DeST-h was considered to simulate the energy consumption of urban buildings with concentration areas. The results show that with Shenyang being a severely cold area, the annual energy consumption of heating is approximately twice that of refrigeration for an individual building. The total energy consumption of open-distributed single buildings is higher than that of compact-distributed single buildings. Consequently, the unit cumulative energy consumption in compact-distributed buildings is higher than that in openly distributed building areas. The compact high-rise buildings (LCZ 1) have the highest energy consumption, with a unit annual energy consumption of 123,771.150 MW·h, which is equivalent to 41,257 tons of standard coal combustion power generation. Considering the energy consumption of residential buildings, the central high-rise buildings group and the compact centralized middle-rise buildings in the downtown area are high energy consumption areas. For future urban planning, design strategies such as energy-saving transformation and energy planning should be considered. The research results can provide a scientific basis and theoretical support for reducing building energy consumption, alleviating the urban heat island effect, and the development of modern urban planning. © The Author(s) 2020.","building energy consumption; Local climate zones; simulation research; urban heat island; urban planning; WUDAPT","Atmospheric temperature; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Energy conservation; Tall buildings; Urban planning; Annual energy consumption; Building energy consumption; Cumulative energy consumption; Distribution of energy consumption; Energy consumption of residential buildings; High energy consumption; Total energy consumption; Urban Heat Island Effects; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092398039

Herein, we demonstrate an effective oxygen-induced surface electron density modulation strategy to significantly boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of carbon nanotubes. Experimental and theoretical studies conjointly reveal that the incorporation of electron-drawing oxygen atoms in the conjugated carbon nanotube plane imparts a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms, making them energetically favorable for OOH∗ adsorption in OER and OH∗ desorption in ORR.

Japan, as one of the most developed countries worldwide, is found to be the fourth largest CO2 emitter in the world. Meanwhile, Japan is currently promoting social electrification from varied aspects. And this action further brings the household residential consumption to the vital place for overall energy conservation and emission reduction plans. Although electricity consumption and prediction analysis have been widely discussed. However, previous studies mainly focused on the estimation and analysis of energy consumption at the national level, without enough discussion from prefecture-level insights. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study established a factor-based bottom-up model to estimate the electricity consumption and carbon emissions during the 2015–2040 periods in the Japanese residential sector, considering the prefectural characteristics including per capita gross domestic product, population size, household size, residential floor space area, lifestyle, weather condition, and transition effect of appliance in the future. Nine scenarios that combine three levels of household size and three levels of growth of per capita gross domestic product are taken into account to estimate the electricity consumption for space heating and cooling, water heating, cooking, and appliances. Results indicate that the total residential electricity consumption will reach a peak during 2020s. The total carbon emissions will keep decreasing by 51.14–72.16 Mt between 2015 and 2040.

Recently, urban flooding is attached more attention. By analyzing and summarizing urban flooding data from recent decades, which includes frequency, scope of influence, and losses, the causes and status quo of urban flooding problems in China is generalized from varied perspectives of urban climate change, urban planning, urban construction, urban management and policy. The data shows that the number of cities suffered from urban flooding increased by approximately 30% since 1980s, while the average frequency of urban flood increased from nearly 1 time in every 2 years to more than 3 times per year in some major cities that face serious urban flooding risks. Even for those cities located in west-northern and semi-arid regions, such as Taiyuan in Shanxi province, they also suffered from urban flooding. Prevention and control measures like the constriction of sponge city, the upgrade of drainage system, and the promotion of relative policies are suggested. © Author(s) 2020.

Therefore, this paper constructs a bi-level programming model with bonus-penalty standards and emission quotas, based on the maximization of social benefits and the minimization of the gap between reward and punishment funds. Given the NP-hard problem of bi-level programming model, this work also designs a nested hierarchical particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm for the above model. Subsequently, from the emission data of SO2 and macroeconomic data in the northeastern region of China from 2006 to 2015, the SO2 emission quota and bonus-penalty standards of each province are calculated. The results demonstrate that (1) the optimal emission quotas of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning province are 37.7, 30.3 and 69.3 (10,000 tons), respectively. (2) When the compensation fee of pollutant abatement is set at 521.48 yuan/ton and the standard of excess discharge levy is 2977.43 yuan/ton, the effect of pollution control in each province can be effectively improved. The empirical analysis also reveals that the proposed model has a remarkable effect on regional environmental governance.

This study reports surface charging behavior and flashover performance of alumina/epoxy spacers with different surface conductivity graded coating (SCGC) schemes in SF6/N2 mixtures under DC stress. Four kinds of SCGC schemes, i.e. localized coating near high voltage (HV-coating), near grounded electrode (GND-coating), at the middle of spacer surface (SPM-coating) and near both high voltage and grounded electrode (HV-GND-coating), are designed by partially spraying SiC/epoxy composites on the spacer surface. Surface charge distribution patterns exhibit varied features with different SCGC schemes. The HV-coating and GND-coating schemes lead to aggravated homo-charge and hetero-charge accumulation respectively, whereas in the SPM-coating scheme surface charge shows a multi-tier distribution pattern with alternating polarity. A transition of the dominant surface charge mechanism from bulk conductivity to surface conductivity with increasing conductivity on the coated area is found. Flashover performance differs a lot with different SCGC schemes: the HV-coating and HV-GND-coating schemes increase the flashover voltage while the SPM-coating and GND-coating schemes degrade it. The optimal surface insulation strength is achieved in the HV-coating scheme with a coating width of about 10 mm. The impact of different SCGC schemes on flashover performance is revealed based on the electric field analysis by considering the effect of surface charges. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","alumina/epoxy spacers; flashover; surface charges; surface conductivity graded coating","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Coatings; Electric conductivity; Electric grounding; Electric insulators; Flashover; Grounding electrodes; Shims; Silicon carbide; Surface charge; Alternating polarity; Distribution patterns; Electric field analysis; Flashover performance; Gas-insulated transmission line; Hetero-charge accumulation; High voltage direct current; Surface charge accumulations; HVDC power transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087111365

However, detecting and quantifying such changes are still difficult because noise and variability in observed streamflow are relatively larger than the long-term trends. In this study, the impacts of global warming on the catchment water cycles in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB), one of most important catchments in south of the Tibetan Plateau, are quantified using a climatic approach based on the relationship between basin-scale groundwater storage and low flow at the annual time scale. By using a quantile regression method and flow recession analysis, changes in low flow regimes and basin-scale groundwater storage at the Nuxia hydrological station are quantified at the annual time scale during 1961-2000. Results show annual low flows (10th and 25th annual flows) of the YZRB have decreased significantly, while long-term annual precipitation, total streamflow, and high flows are statistically unchanged. Annual lowest seven-day flow shows a significantly downward trend (2.2 m3/s/a, p &lt; 0.05) and its timing has advanced about 12 days (2.8 day/10a, p &lt; 0.1) during the study period. Estimated annual basin-scale groundwater storage also shows a significant decreasing trend at a rate of 0.079 mm/a (p &lt; 0.05) over the study period. Further analysis suggests that evaporation increase, decreased snow-fraction, and increased annual precipitation intensity induced by the rising temperature possibly are the drivers causing a significant decline in catchment low flow regimes and groundwater storage in the study area. This highlights that an increase in temperature has likely already caused significant changes in regional flow regimes in the high and cold mountainous regions, which has alarming consequences in regional ecological protection and sustainable water resources management. © 2020 by the authors.","Cold mountainous catchments; Global warming; Groundwater storage dynamic; Low flow regimes; Water cycle changes; Yarlung Zangbo River Basin","Catchments; Global warming; Groundwater; Regression analysis; Runoff; Stream flow; Watersheds; Annual precipitation; Ecological protection; Groundwater storage; Mountainous regions; Quantile regression; Rising temperatures; Sustainable water resources; Yarlung zangbo river basins; Water conservation; catchment; climate effect; global warming; hydrological cycle; low flow; mountain region; precipitation (climatology); regression analysis; streamflow; water storage; Brahmaputra Basin; Nuxia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090268403

Although much progress has been achieved, the development of better CDI technologies, especially through the design and synthesis of various porous carbonaceous materials with enhanced CDI performance, continues to attract increasing interest within the scientific fraternity. Considering that previous traditional porous carbons might suffer from deficient salt adsorption capacity, the nitrogenization of porous carbons, which brings new opportunities for CDI applications, has emerged as an effective strategy to modify the surface characteristics of porous carbons and ultimately improve their CDI performance. This review summarizes the recent significant breakthroughs on the construction of NCs, including in situ doping and post-treatment strategies, and their practices in the field of CDI to impart a comprehensive understanding of the strategic evolution of the synthetic approaches to nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs) with remarkable CDI characteristics. We present an exhaustive analysis of newly synthesized NCs and the impact of their compositional and structural features on their CDI performance; further, we highlight a special emphasis on the possible role of nitrogen dopants in the CDI process. In addition to elucidating the state-of-the-art CDI applications, we address the remaining challenges, and finally, the possible direction for the use of NCs for CDI is described to provide some useful clues for future developments in this promising field. © 2020","Capacitive deionization; Material design; Nitrogen-doped carbons; Nitrogenization strategies; Water desalination",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092005977

This study provides a new insight in the decomposition method, which can decompose the emissions into new effects compared with the exiting studies. This study reveals that the regional environmental-based technology (EBT) effect is the key curbing factor for PM2.5 emissions, followed by the regional PEI effect. The curbing effect of regional EBT on PM2.5 emissions is strong in East China and weak in Northeast China. The environment-oriented scale efficiency (ESE), environment-oriented management efficiency (EME), production-oriented scale efficiency (PSE), production-oriented management efficiency (PME), and production-based technology (PBT) had relatively small effects on PM2.5 emissions on the whole. The effects differ among different areas and periods in China. The emission reduction potential of these efficiency effects has not been realized. The national economic growth greatly promotes PM2.5 emissions. The regional economic structure effect slightly increases PM2.5 emissions because of the unbalanced development of regional economy.

To tackle this issue, this paper develops a leader-follower optimized approach for economic and environmental equilibrium in incineration power plants that includes a carbon allowance allocation scheme (IPP-CAAS) under combustion and pollutant limitations. In the leader-follower (bi-level) game, the regional authority on the upper level determines the carbon allocations and environmental targets and the IPPs on the lower level develop schemes to maximize revenue under the upper-level restrictions. By employing uncertain parameters for the carbon and power conversion fluctuations, the approach is able to more accurately depict the industry characteristics of waste incineration process in this carbon-economy balance problem. The robustness and practicality of the proposed methodology was then validated through a case study. Scenario analysis under different political parameters indicates that the proposed methodology can assist the authorities to achieve carbon-economy trade-off and under serious carbon-control situations, encourage the IPPs to reduce their blended coal ratios, and invest in low-carbon incineration technology. Managerial insights on further industrial developments are also given for the authority and relevant practitioners. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions mitigation; Leader-follower model; Municipal solid waste incineration","carbon emission; combustion; economic growth; emissions trading; incineration; municipal solid waste; optimization; parameterization; trade-off; uncertainty analysis; urbanization; China; carbon; coal; China; incineration; solid waste; Carbon; China; Coal; Incineration; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086173541

The Qilian Mountains (QLMs) typify dryland mountain ranges in northern temperate belts and offer fundamental ecosystem services including forage production and water conservation. However, dominant controls on the interannual trend and variability of net primary productivity (NPP) in this region are unknown. Thus, we examined magnitude and direction of the NPP trend and quantified NPP sensitivity to temperature and precipitation under different biomes and altitudes using ground and remote sensing data. Our results showed that 12% of the QLMs had a reversed NPP trend from increasing to decreasing from 2000 to 2016, particularly in the western and southern parts, where NPP reductions were related to precipitation deficits. About 34% of the QLMs showed accelerated or persistent increasing NPP trends, mainly from the mid-altitude between 3,100 and 4,300 m. The growth rate of NPP was higher in deserts and grasslands than in forests and increased in deserts but decreased in forests and grasslands with increasing elevation. Precipitation showed a stronger effect on the interannual variability in NPP than temperature did. The temperature sensitivity of NPP was similar along elevation gradients in forest steppes but decreased with increasing elevation in alpine deserts. The precipitation sensitivity of NPP reached highest in shrubby meadows when compared with coniferous forests and alpine deserts. This research provides new insights into climate controls of the NPP over the QLMs and to present drought as a growing threat to shrubby meadows and alpine deserts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","climatic controls; dryland ecosystems; elevational gradients; NPP sensitivity; vegetation productivity","Arid regions; Ecosystems; Forestry; Landforms; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Water conservation; Climatic controls; Dryland; Elevational gradients; NPP sensitivity; Vegetation productivity; Growth rate; climate change; drought; ecosystem response; elevation; factor productivity; forage; growth rate; mountain environment; net primary production; precipitation (climatology); remote sensing; trend analysis; China; Qilian Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081922237

This study divides Chinese interregional trade into four trade patterns from the perspective of domestic production fragmentation. Then we develop a decomposition model of the interregional trade-related CO2 emissions and pollution heaven hypothesis (PHH) of different trade patterns based on China's interregional input-output table for 2002 to 2010. Finally, we explore the influencing factors of the changes of environmental effects using structural decomposition analysis method. The results show that from 2002 to 2010, the volume of CO2 emissions embodied in interregional trade increased significantly with the share of CO2 emissions induced by traditional trade in intermediate products always representing a major proportion but which still underwent a downward trend. Interregional trade activities increase China's CO2 emissions, and the PHH holds at the national level. Among them, trade in final products is conducive to reducing national CO2 emissions while the other three patterns of interregional trade are opposite. In particular, the balance of avoided CO2 emissions (BAC) in trade related to the DVC is positive, meaning that the DVC is polluting. In addition, domestic trade activities of the central region, northwestern region, and northern coast are not conducive to reducing regional and national CO2 emissions while the southern coast and northeastern region are opposite. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Input-output model; Interregional trade patterns; Pollution heaven hypothesis (PHH); Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Trade-related CO2 emissions","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; environmental economics; hydrocarbon exploration; input-output analysis; pollution control; air pollution; Article; chemical composition; China; decomposition; economic development; environmental impact; industrialization; seashore; climate; pollution; Carbon Dioxide; China; Climate; Environmental Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086113326

However, the interactive effects of long-term mowing and climate change on the diversity and stability of leguminous and non-leguminous species in the semi-arid grasslands are largely unknown. Here, we used in situ monitoring data from 1982 to 2011 to examine the effects of continuous mowing and climate change on the plant biomass and diversity of leguminous and non-leguminous species, and soil total nitrogen in the typical semi-arid grasslands of northern China. Results showed that the biomass and diversity of leguminous species significantly decreased with the increasing in the biomass and diversity of non-leguminous species during the 30-a period. Variations in biomass were mainly affected by the long-term mowing, while variations in diversity were mainly explained by the climate change. Moreover, the normalized change rates of diversity in leguminous species were significantly higher than those in non-leguminous species. Mowing and temperature together contributed to the diversity changes of leguminous species, with mowing accounting for 50.0% and temperature 28.0%. Temporal stability of leguminous species was substantially lower than that of non-leguminous species. Consequently, soil total nitrogen decreased in the 2000s compared with the 1980s. These findings demonstrated that leguminous species were more sensitive to the long-term mowing and climate change than non-leguminous species in the semi-arid grasslands. Thus, reseeding appropriate leguminous plants when mowing in the semi-arid grasslands may be a better strategy to improve nitrogen levels of grassland ecosystems and maintain ecosystem biodiversity. © 2020, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","climate change; community succession; diversity; legume; mowing; productivity; temporal stability","climate change; grassland; in situ measurement; legume; mowing; productivity; semiarid region; species diversity; succession; temporal analysis; China; Fabaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094853122

By referring to Kaya identity and combining with the actual situation of agricultural carbon emissions, four basic influencing factors were obtained: agricultural production efficiency, agricultural structure, agricultural economic development level, and agricultural population size. In addition, urbanization, mechanization, and natural disaster level were listed as influencing factors. The results demonstrated: (a) Urbanization was the first promoting factor of agricultural carbon emissions, indicating a 0.2510% increase in agricultural carbon emissions due to a 1% increase in urbanization. The other three positive factors were, respectively, agricultural mechanization, agricultural structure, and agricultural economic development and their influence indexes were 0.1481, 0.1163, and 0.0845, respectively. (b) Agricultural production efficiency was the most important factor to restrain agricultural carbon emissions. For every 1% increase in agricultural production efficiency, corresponding agricultural carbon emissions would be reduced by 0.3288%. Agricultural population size was also an important factor to reduce agricultural carbon emissions and its influence index was −0.045.

Under this background, the first 600 MW supercritical circulating fluidized bed (SCCFB) boiler unit in the world have carried out the demonstration of the technical route of ultra-low emission transformation and the research of key technologies. By adopting limestone desulphurization and low nitrogen combustion in furnace, selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) technology outside furnace and the integrated desulfurization and dust removal process of flue gas circulating fluidized bed (CFB-FGD), the unit realizes the technical route of ultra-low emission, and has good investment and operation economy, which can adapt to the development trend of environmental protection in the future. The CFB-FGD and dust removal system can further improve the operation economy of the boiler by setting pre-electrostatic precipitator (pre-ESP), designing double-tower and optimizing the single-tower switching mode, optimizing the pressure margin of the induced draft fan, and adopting the coordinated desulphurization operation mode inside and outside the furnace.

In order to solve the key problem that the heat transfer efficiency from high temperature oxidation zone in upper region to low temperature reduction zone in lower region is low in traditional metallurgical reduction reactor, a water simulation was adopted to optimize the mean residence time and to improve the transmission efficiency within the reactor. According to the modified Froude similarity, a water model experimental reactor with a ratio of 1:1 to the prototype was constructed. In the prototype, the feed port was used to feed preheated ore and flux. In order to simulate the effect of different feeding positions of the tracer on the mixing behavior in the molten pool, four points of tracer feeding position were arranged for a systematic study. At the same time, based on double-row side nozzle with thick slag layer in a C–H2 smelting reduction reactor, nine influencing factors, including relative angle between upper and lower side nozzles, were studied. The experimental results showed that the tracer feeding position had a great influence on the mean residence time, and the relative angle also had a great influence on tracer feeding position. Finally, through comprehensive analysis, the optimal condition parameters were obtained under different tracer feeding positions.

In this study, a spatial–temporal synthesis of BC aerosols and the affecting factors was conducted in urban Beijing. As observed, BC showed a spatial pattern with high concentration in south and low in north. BC concentration evidently decreased by approximately 61% between 2005 and 2017. From 2015 to 2017, the mass ratio of BC/PM2.5 dropped by 28%, which suggested a more efficient effect of control measures to BC than PM2.5. The BC/CO ratio dropped by 22%, which indicated the decreasing emission from fossil fuel sources. With regard to BC loading, the spectral dependence of absorption aerosol exhibited significant seasonal variations. High absorption Ångström exponent (α) was observed during heating season, which reflected the increasing contribution of brown carbon (BrC) to light absorption. Backward trajectory analysis showed that the levels of BC and PM2.5 were high in Cluster-South and Cluster-West. BrC absorption was high in Cluster-West, Cluster-Northwest and Cluster-Northeast, due to the biomass and coal burning for domestic heating and aging processes on a regional scale. The effects of emission control and transport variability on pollutant variation were estimated on the basis of the cluster analysis. Results indicated that the effect of emission reduction was the major reason for the decrease of BC from 2015 to 2017, which resulted in a 34% reduction of BC concentration. Meanwhile, transport variability caused a 15% reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Black carbon; Emission control; Transport variability","Aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Carbon; Cluster analysis; Coal combustion; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Light absorption; Optical properties; Reduction; Aerosol optical property; Backward trajectory analysis; Carbonaceous materials; Combustion emissions; Fossil fuel sources; Incomplete combustion; Spectral dependences; Transport variability; Bromine compounds; black carbon; coal; fossil fuel; fossil fuel; aerosol; black carbon; brown carbon; concentration (composition); emission control; meteorology; optical property; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric transport; biomass; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); heating; light absorption; meteorological phenomena; optical rotation; particle size; particulate matter; pollution transport; season; synthesis; aerosol; chemistry; climate; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; meteorology; procedures; soot; spatiotemporal analysis; Beijing [China]; China; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Beijing; Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Meteorology; Seasons; Soot; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083888933

Medium voltage DC (MVDC) distribution architectures have been proposed as potential candidates to transmit and distribute energy from generators to motors in these applications. However, the low impedance in MVDC systems results in extremely fast propagation speed of fault currents. Therefore, it is necessary to interrupt the DC fault in a very short period. This paper investigates a solid-state circuit breaker with an ultrafast interruption speed as a main breaker for a hybrid DC circuit breaker. A simulation model of the hybrid circuit breaker is established using PLECS software to evaluate the performance of the main breaker. A 1 kV solid-state main breaker prototype based on series and parallel connected insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) is built. Series and parallel connection of IGBTs are implemented to increase the voltage and current level. The maximum voltage across the solid-state circuit breaker is limited to 1.8 kV during current interruption. The solid-state main breaker prototype is experimentally tested under dynamic current conditions. The solid-state main breaker prototype successfully interrupts current of 400 A within 300 microseconds and presents good voltage balancing as well as current sharing performance. The experimental results show good agreement with the simulation results. © 2020 EPE Association.","DC circuit breaker; IGBT; Medium voltage DC-grid; Parallel operation; Protection device","Air pollution; Balancing; Computer software; Electric connectors; Electric ship equipment; Gas emissions; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); More electric aircraft; Timing circuits; Current interruption; Dc circuit breakers; Distribution architecture; Hybrid circuit breaker; More electric ships; Parallel connections; Parallel-connected; Solid State Circuit Breaker; Electric circuit breakers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094880615

However, studies on the anthropogenic influences on the hydrogeochemical evolution of karst groundwater are relatively rare. To assess hydrogeochemical formation and evolution, we focused on a typical karst groundwater system (Jinan, China) which is composed of cold groundwater (av. temperature 13–17 °C), springs and geothermal water (av. temperature &gt; 30 °C) and is significantly affected by human activities. The study was performed by means of water samples collecting and analyzing and isotope analysis (2H, 18O and 14C). The statistical analysis and inverse models were also applied to further understand geochemical processes and anthropogenic influences. The 2H, 18O and 14C results indicate that the cold karst groundwater is easily influenced and contaminated by the local environment, while geothermal water is relatively old with a slow rate of recharge. The hydrochemical types of cold karst groundwater are mainly HCO3–Ca and HCO3·SO4–Ca, while geothermal water hydrochemical types are SO4–Ca·Na and SO4–Ca. Groundwater Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3− and SO42− are mainly controlled by carbonate equilibrium, gypsum dissolution and dedolomitization. Groundwater Na+, K+ and Cl− are mainly derived from halite dissolution, and in geothermal water, they are also affected by incongruent dissolution of albite and K-feldspar. Anthropogenic nitrogen produces ammonium resulting in nitrification and reduction in CO2(g) consumption and HCO3− release from carbonate dissolution. Principal component analysis and inverse models also indicate that nitrification and denitrification have significantly affected water–rock interactions. Our study suggests that karst groundwater quality is dominated by water–rock interactions and elucidates the influence of anthropogenic nitrogen. We believe that this paper will be a good reference point to study anthropogenic influences on the groundwater environment and to protect karst groundwater globally. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Dedolomitization; Inverse model; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Water–rock interaction","ammonium; anthropogenic effect; aquifer; denitrification; human activity; hydrogeochemistry; isotopic analysis; karst hydrology; nitrification; water-rock interaction; China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong; carbon; Carbon-14; carbonic acid; chloride; ground water; oxygen; Oxygen-18; potassium; sodium; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; human; hydrology; natural spring; principal component analysis; procedures; temperature; theoretical model; water pollutant; water quality; Carbon Radioisotopes; Carbonates; China; Chlorides; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Humans; Hydrology; Models, Theoretical; Natural Springs; Oxygen Isotopes; Potassium; Principal Component Analysis; Sodium; Temperature; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074706399

This study examined the effects of Ag2S nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs) on the EW-mediated (Eisenia fetida and Pontoscolex corethrurus) soil N cycle. We used 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine the bacterial community and nitrification/denitrification-related gene abundance. The presence of either EWs or Ag significantly increased denitrification and N2O emissions. However, the addition of Ag2S to EW-inhabited soil reduced N2O emissions by 14-33%. Furthermore, Ag2S caused a low-dose stimulation but a high-dose inhibition to N2O flux from the EW gut itself. Accordingly, an increase in Ag in the EW gut caused a decrease in the relative abundance of denitrifiers in both the soil and the gut, especially for the dominant genus Bacillus. Ag2S also decreased the copy numbers of nitrification gene (nxrB) and denitrification genes (napA, nirS, and nosZ) in EW gut, leading to the observed decrease in N2O emissions. Collectively, applying Ag2S-containing sludge disturbs the denitrification function of the EW gut microbiota and the cycling of N in soil-based systems. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Agricultural robots; Bacteriology; Denitrification; Genes; Microorganisms; Nanoparticles; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Silver nanoparticles; Soil pollution; Soils; Sulfide minerals; Sulfur compounds; Agricultural soils; Anti-microbial properties; Bacterial community; Nitrous oxide emissions; Pontoscolex corethrurus; Quantitative polymerase chain reaction; Relative abundance; Soil micro-organisms; Silver compounds; napA protein; nirS protein; nitrous oxide; nosZ protein; nxrB protein; RNA 16S; silver nanoparticle; silver sulfide nanoparticle; sulfide; unclassified drug; nanoparticle; nitrous oxide; RNA 16S; silver derivative; silver sulfide; denitrification; digestive system; earthworm; inorganic compound; nanoparticle; nitrous oxide; antimicrobial activity; Article; Bacillus; denitrification; DNA extraction; earthworm; Eisenia fetida; exhaust gas; feeding behavior; intestine flora; microbial community; nitrification; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; Pontoscolex corethrurus; real time polymerase chain reaction; soil; animal; denitrification; genetics; microbiology; Oligochaeta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eisenia fetida; Microbiota; Pontoscolex corethrurus; Animals; Denitrification; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Nanoparticles; Nitrification; Nitrous Oxide; Oligochaeta; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Silver Compounds; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091126083

As the country with the highest CO2 emissions, China is facing unprecedented challenges: climate change, energy structure transformation and socio-economic development all pose complex dilemmas for policy makers. The Chinese government has introduced energy policy and emission reduction measures to achieve its climate change mitigation targets. However, overlap between these measures may generate great uncertainty about their performance. By using a multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this study examines the economic impacts of implementing a nationwide carbon market and a renewable energy subsidy in the power sector in China. The study finds that a renewable energy policy would increase the economic cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lead to a lower carbon price level if a carbon pricing mechanism were in place. However, the combination of the two policies indeed shows advantages in achieving emission reduction targets and renewable energy promotion targets. While an emission trading scheme is necessary for reducing emissions effectively, a renewable energy policy could promote the large-scale use of renewable energy in the electricity sector.

In China, the BB emission has changed substantially over the past decades while the multi-year variation held high uncertainty and the driving forces have addressed little attention. Here, this research aimed to conduct a comprehensive and systematic analysis of BB variation in China and provided precise and targeted BB emission reduction suggestions. The moving of high emission for BB from 2003 to 2014 was clearly identified, by the view of reliable emission estimation and anthropogenic impacts. Multiple satellite products, field survey, time varying biomass loading data and measured emission factors were adopted to better estimating BB emission and reducing the uncertainty. Social-economic analysis was added to assess the anthropogenic impacts on high emission variation quantitatively. Results showed that the cumulative BB emissions of OC, EC, CH4, NOX, NMVOC, SO2, NH3, CO, CO2, PM2.5 and PM10 during 2003-2014 were 1.6 × 104, 5.64 × 103, 3.57 × 104, 1.7 × 104, 5.44 × 104, 2.96 × 103, 6.77 × 103, 6.5 × 105, 1.15 × 107, 5.26 × 104 and 6.04 × 104 Gg, respectively. Crop straw burning (in-field and domestic) in northeast China plain (NEP), north China plain (NCP), northern arid and semiarid region and loess plateau were the key sources, averagely contributed 73% for all the pollutants emission. While domestic straw burning and firewood burning in Sichuan basin (SB), Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and southern China were main contributors, averagely accounting for 70% of all the pollutants emission. On regional level, high emissions were mainly found in SB, NCP and NEP. Temporally, high emissions were mainly found in crop sowing harvesting and heating seasons. From 2003 to 2014, the BB emission for different biomass species has changed significantly in different regions. High emission has gradually moved from SB to NCP and NEP. Firewood burning and domestic straw burning emission decreased by 47% and 14% in SB, respectively. In-field straw burning emission increased by 52% and 231% in NCP and NEP respectively and domestic straw burning emission increased by 62% in NEP. Emissions from heating season have decreased while emissions in corn harvest season were continuously increased. Analysis of Environmental kuznets curve, agricultural productivity level, human burning habits, rural energy structure and local control policies revealed the internal human driving strength of the variation for BB emission. The unbalanced development of social economy and the policy bias were primary drivers of limiting the BB management. BB emission will alleviate in NCP and aggravate in NEP. For the further emission reduction, effective measures for corn sources management, straw returning and rural energy utilization should be systematically considered. This research provides a clear evidence for the multi-year variation pattern of BB emissions, which is critical for pollution prediction, air quality modeling and targeted mitigation strategies for the key regions of China. © 2020 The Author(s)","Biomass burning; High emission variation; Human-driven forces; Multiple satellite data; Social-economic analysis","Agricultural robots; Air quality; Ammonia; Arid regions; Biomass; Crops; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy utilization; Productivity; Agricultural productivity; Air quality modeling; Anthropogenic impacts; Arid and semi-arid regions; Environmental Kuznets curves; Multiple satellites; Pollutants emissions; Systematic analysis; Uncertainty analysis; ammonia; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; methane; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; annual variation; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; emission control; satellite data; socioeconomic status; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; biomass; biomass burning; biomass energy; China; climate change; combustion; correlation analysis; energy consumption; geographic distribution; grassland; harvesting; heating; human; human impact (environment); nonhuman; particulate matter; pollutant; prediction and forecasting; priority journal; quantitative analysis; socioeconomics; sowing; air pollutant; biomass; environmental monitoring; China; Zea mays; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biomass; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085624478

Combining rational socioeconomic developments with effective control policies on particulate matter (PM) pollution, Dongguan successfully transformed to win-win situation in both high-speed economic development and rapid air quality improvement from 2005 to 2017. In this study, we applied a STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) model to examine the relationships between PM pollution and the selected indicators of socioeconomic development in Dongguan. We found that the growths of proportion of secondary industry, low-grade road density and GDP per capita contribute greatly to the increase of PM pollution, while the growths of proportion of tertiary industry and high-grade road density could significantly slow down the increase of PM pollution. In addition, the policies for controlling PM pollution (e.g. retiring Yellow-Label cars, designating no burning zone and reforming industrial boilers) had great positive influence on PM reduction. However, PM pollution was negatively correlated with the number of automobiles probably due to the rapid and continuous improvements in the vehicle emission standard. Dongguan's experience in its pursuit of such win-win situations within a short period of time can provide valuable guidance for other cities in China as well as many undeveloped and developing cities worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Pearl river delta; PM10; PM2.5; Socioeconomic development; STIRPAT model; Win-win situation","Air pollution control; Air quality; Economics; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Roads and streets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Air quality improvement; Continuous improvements; Developing cities; Industrial boilers; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter pollution; Socio-economic development; Tertiary industries; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084250721

Enhancing green total factor energy efficiency (hereafter GTFEE) is vital to emission reduction and to win-win industrial development. This study uses the panel data of 30 Chinese provinces for the period 2005–2016 to investigate the relationship between environmental regulation and China's GTFEE. The spatial Durbin model is employed to control for the possible spatial spillover effect. A dynamic threshold panel model that can effectively address the endogeneity problem and regional heterogeneity is utilized to examine the potential non-linear relationship between environmental regulation and GTFEE under different conditions of environmental decentralization. The estimation results indicate that there is a significant U-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and China's GTFEE. With the further expansion of environmental decentralization, the local government's autonomous choice of pollution control is improved. The improvement of environmental decentralization can lead to negative moderating effect of environmental regulation on GTFEE. Additionally, the regression results of dynamic threshold model show that environmental decentralization can increase the negative influences of environmental regulation on GTFEE. Interestingly, the non-linear impact of environmental regulation on GTFEE is dependent on the specific type of environmental decentralization. Higher degree of environmental decentralization can lead to an increase in the restraining effect of environmental regulation on GTFEE. However, an improvement in the decentralization of environmental supervision and environmental monitoring can increase the negative influences of environmental regulation on GTFEE. © 2018","Dynamic threshold panel model; Environmental decentralization; Environmental regulation; Green Total factor energy efficiency; Spatial Durbin model","Emission control; Energy efficiency; Green manufacturing; Economic transformation; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental supervision; Estimation results; Industrial development; Non-linear relationships; Spatial Durbin models; Total factor energy efficiencies; Environmental regulations; alternative energy; decentralization; endogenous growth; energy efficiency; renewable resource; spillover effect; total factor productivity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089213060

Here we present a modified ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to reduce the uncertainties of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions at one week and 5 km resolution by assimilating surface CO and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations. By decoupling analysis steps from ensemble simulations, the modified EnKF avoids filter divergence and enables reuse of costly ensemble simulations, making high-spatiotemporal-resolution inversion affordable. This method is tested by a set of observing system simulation experiments. By assimilating synthetic observations from 400 sites, the errors of CO and NOx emissions over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) in the a priori emission inventory are reduced by 78% and 76%, respectively. Further application of this method estimates the emission reductions during China's Victory day parade using real surface observations. The changes of the emissions in each city are identified by this method, which suggests that the CO and NOx emissions over BTH region during the parade are reduced by 36% and 44%, respectively. Using the inversed emission inventory, the biases of CO and NO2 simulations during the parade are reduced by 95% and 91%, respectively.

Street greening and buildings have an influence on the diffusion of air pollution from streets. For field measurements, many studies have analyzed the effect of street green space arrangement on the diffusion of air pollution, but these studies have neglected the patterns at the landscape scale. Other studies have analyzed the effects of the large scale of green space on air pollution, but the vertical distribution of street buildings and greening has rarely been considered. In this study, we analyzed the impact of the vertical distribution of urban street green space on summertime air pollution in urban centers on the urban scale for the first time by using a deep-learning method to extract the vertical distribution of street greening and buildings from street view image data. A total of 687,354 street view images were collected. The green index and building index were proposed to quantify the street greening and street buildings. The multilevel regression method was used to analyze the association between the street green index, building index and air pollution indexes. For the cases in this study, including the central urban areas of Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing, our multilevel regressions results suggested that, in the central area of the city, the vertical distribution of street greening and buildings within a certain range of the monitoring site is association with the summertime air pollution index of the monitoring site. There was a significant negative association between the street greening and air pollution indexes (radius = 1–2 km, NO2, p = 0.042; radius = 3–4 km, AQI, p = 0.034; PM10, p = 0.028). The street length within a certain range of the monitoring site has a positive association with the air pollution indexes (radius = 1–2 km, AQI, p = 0.072; PM10, p = 0.062). With the increase of the distance between streets and the monitoring sites, the association between streets and air pollution indexes decreases. Our findings on the association between the vertical structure of street greening, street buildings and summertime air pollution in urban centers can support urban street planning. © 2020 by the authors.

These changes alter the carbon balance of ecosystems through changes in vegetation productivity and ecosystem carbon turnover time (τeco). Even though numerous studies have drawn an increasingly clear picture of global vegetation productivity changes, global changes in τeco are still unknown. In this study, we analyzed the changes of τeco between the 1860s and the 2000s and their drivers, based on theory of dynamic carbon cycle in non-steady state and process-based ecosystem model. Results indicate that τeco has been reduced (i.e., carbon turnover has accelerated) by 13.5% from the 1860s (74 years) to the 2000s (64 years), with reductions of 1 year of carbon residence times in vegetation (rveg) and of 9 years in soil (rsoil). Additionally, the acceleration of τeco was examined at biome scale and grid scale.

This is due, in part, to it being a fossil fuel with associated greenhouse gas emissions, and its very poor long-term historical track record regarding gas flaring and fugitive methane and other light-hydrocarbon gas emissions. However, major environmental concerns have also arisen regarding the development of unconventional natural gas resources using hydraulic fracture stimulation, its large environmental and community impacts, water usage and potential contamination and induced seismic activity leading to increased surface impacts. There are however a number of technological opportunities identified and available for deployment for a number of years that could enable the industry to improve its sustainability credentials. Seriously developing these opportunities could convince public opinion that the natural gas sector should be part of long-term plans to develop and maintain a near-zero emissions energy sector. Most of the identified opportunities are obvious, such as eliminating flaring, improving production efficiency by gaining a better understanding of sub-surface reservoirs and fluid movements, and reducing its surface footprints, carbon capture sequestration and utilization, and more collaboration with the renewables sector to build hybrid power and energy storage plants. It is imperative for the natural gas sector’s long-term future that it fully embraces these opportunities and makes them visibly contribute to more eco-friendly energy supply-chain developments. © The Author(s) 2020.","Carbon capture sequestration utilization; Enhanced recovery; Fracture stimulation; Gas flaring/fugitive emissions; Induced seismicity; Natural-gas sustainability; Water usage contamination","Energy efficiency; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum deposits; Social aspects; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Energy supply chains; Environmental concerns; Hydraulic fracture stimulation; Long-term sustainability; Near-zero emissions; Production efficiency; Technological opportunity; Unconventional natural gas resources; Gas emissions; carbon sequestration; enhanced oil recovery; fracture mechanics; natural gas; sustainability",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091088987

Specifically, perceptions of climate change were assessed and advocacy activities were identified for climate change and/or other topics. Design/methodology/approach: Using convenience sampling, students (n = 440) from three universities in the Midwest, the USA, completed surveys assessing their level of agreement with activities related to civic engagement, climate change and policy. Semantic differential scales focused on “learning about climate change,” “advocating for climate change mitigation” and “advocating for climate change adaptation.” Three open-ended questions were used to identify student experiences with civic engagement and/or service-learning, as well as topics in which they advocate and how they advocate. Findings: Regarding advocacy in general, over 50% of the sample did not advocate for any topic, with 24.5% of students stating they advocated for the environment/climate change. Students who identified as female, democratic and 1st or 2nd year in school were more likely to be engaged with environmental advocacy. Regarding civic engagement, seniors were more actively engaged with their communities and also more likely to vote in local, state and national elections. Research limitations/implications: Time of data collection was a potential limitation with schools conducting data collection at different time periods. Students who identified more progressive politically were also more likely to participate in the study. Originality/value: While research exists regarding student civic engagement levels, this research project identified ways in which students engaged in advocacy, identifying potential links with civic engagement and enhanced participation in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Advocacy; Civic engagement; Climate change; Higher education; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089671408

However, losses in habitat diversity may reduce the functional diversity of microbial communities that drive this important filter function. We examined how habitat type and habitat diversity affects denitrification and the abundance and diversity of denitrifying and N2O reducing communities in illuminated shallow-water sediments. In a mesocosm experiment, cores from four habitats were incubated in different combinations, representing ecosystems with different habitat diversities. We hypothesized that habitat diversity promotes the diversity of N2O reducing communities and genetic potential for denitrification, thereby influencing denitrification rates. We also hypothesized that this will depend on the identity of the habitats. Habitat diversity positively affected ecosystem-level diversity of clade II N2O reducing communities, however neither clade I nosZ communities nor denitrification activity were affected. The composition of N2O reducing communities was determined by habitat type, and functional gene abundances indicated that silty mud and sandy sediments had higher genetic potentials for denitrification and N2O reduction than cyanobacterial mat and Ruppia maritima meadow sediments. These results indicate that loss of habitat diversity and specific habitats could have negative impacts on denitrification and N2O reduction, which underpin the capacity for nitrogen removal in coastal ecosystems. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

This approach, intended to develop a robust modelling framework to support water resources management under climate change conditions, comprises a regionalized parameterization of the water balance simulation model (WaSiM) for 98 catchments in high temporal (3 h) and spatial (500 m) resolution using spatially coherent information and an automatized calibration (dynamically dimensioned search-simulated annealing, DDS-SA) for storage components. The performance of the model was examined using common metrics (Nash & Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE)). The simulations provided the means for the calculation of a level of trust (LOT) by comparing observed and simulated high flows with a five, ten, and 20-year return period. These estimates were derived by the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) applying the peak over threshold (POT) sampling method. Results show that the model overall performs well with regard to the selected objective measures, but also exhibits regional disparities mainly due to the availability of meteorological inputs or water management data. For most catchments, the LOT shows moderate to high confidence in the estimation of return periods with the hydrological model. Therefore, we consider the holistic modelling approach applicable for climate change impact studies concerned with dynamic alterations in peak flows. © 2020 by the authors.","Bavaria; Dynamically dimensioned search; GPD; Holistic parameterization; Hydrological modelling; Peak flows; Return levels","Catchments; Climate models; Digital storage; Efficiency; Information management; Pareto principle; Runoff; Simulated annealing; Water management; Climate change impact; Dynamically dimensioned search; Generalized Pareto distribution; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological modelling; Regional disparities; Water balance simulation; Water resources management; Climate change; catchment; climate change; estimation method; holistic approach; hydrological modeling; peak flow; river basin; Bavaria; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091059014

As both vehicle technology and emissions legislation in Europe continue to evolve, Concawe has conducted a study to examine the opportunities that fuels can provide to further reduce emissions from light-duty diesel passenger cars. Three European diesel cars spanning Euro 5, Euro 6b and Euro 6d-TEMP emissions certification levels have been tested over the cold-start WLTC (Worldwide harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle) with 6 fuels: An EN590-compliant B5 (petroleum diesel containing 5% biodiesel by volume), a bio-derived paraffinic diesel, a 50:50 blend of the aforementioned fuels, a low density petroleum-derived B5, a B30 and the same B30 additized with a high dose of cetane number improver. Results have shown that low density fuels with high hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio are capable of delivering benefits in tank-To-wheels CO2 (carbon dioxide), CO (carbon monoxide), HC (hydrocarbons), other greenhouse gases and NOx (oxides of nitrogen), whereas no further benefits were measured in NH3 (ammonia) or in PN (particle number) at the low baseline levels produced by the vehicles. Compared to B5, B30 gave a significant increase in NOx at the tailpipe from the Euro 5 car and engine-out from the Euro 6d-TEMP car but no tailpipe detriments in NOx were measurable in either of the Euro 6 cars, due to the good performance of their NOx aftertreatment devices. The latter results show that some fuel qualities previously important to control emissions such as PN or NOx have become less impactful with the latest engine technologies. The addition of cetane number improver to the B30 did not reduce NOx. The findings suggest that high H/C ratio diesel fuels could offer benefits to both emissions affecting local air quality and to greenhouse gas emissions on a tank-To-wheels basis. The addition of higher FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) levels to fuels can be used to increase renewable fuel contribution resulting in no penalty in NOx emissions from newer technology vehicles. Compatibility of these fuels with the existing vehicle fleet would require further specific consideration. © 2020 SAE International.

However, achieving exclusive LPG use in households unaccustomed to this type of fuel, used in combination with a new stove technology, requires substantial behaviour change. We conducted theory-grounded formative research to identify contextual factors influencing cooking fuel choice to guide the development of behavioural strategies for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. The HAPIN trial will assess the impact of exclusive LPG use on air pollution exposure and health of pregnant women, older adult women, and infants under 1 year of age in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. Methods Using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) to guide formative research, we conducted in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, observations, key informant interviews and pilot studies to identify key influencers of cooking behaviours in the four countries. We used these findings to develop behavioural strategies likely to achieve exclusive LPG use in the HAPIN trial. Results We identified nine potential influencers of exclusive LPG use, including perceived disadvantages of solid fuels, family preferences, cookware, traditional foods, non-food-related cooking, heating needs, LPG awareness, safety and cost and availability of fuel. Mapping formative findings onto the theoretical frameworks, behavioural strategies for achieving exclusive LPG use in each research site included free fuel deliveries, locally acceptable stoves and equipment, hands-on training and printed materials and videos emphasising relevant messages. In the HAPIN trial, we will monitor and reinforce exclusive LPG use through temperature data loggers, LPG fuel delivery tracking, in-home observations and behavioural reinforcement visits. Conclusion Our formative research and behavioural strategies can inform the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of theory-informed strategies to promote exclusive LPG use in future stove programmes and research studies. © 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

This review begins with a synopsis of related themes around persistent and emerging pressures on freshwaters; environmental thresholds (or tipping points); 'safe' operating conditions; multiple stable states; regime shifts. A case is made for viewing and managing the resilience of water systems at nested scales. Indicators are needed to track evolving climate risks as well as to measure socio-ecological responses. Catchment properties can identify those river systems that are more or less likely to return to a pre-disturbance state; resilience further depends on institutional and social landscapes. Ideally, allied notions of resistance and reliability are applied alongside resilience to broaden the portfolio of adaptation measures. Water managers would also benefit from more consistent use of resilience terminology; incentives to build back better after catastrophes; strategic monitoring of incipient threats and tipping points; availability of long-term adaptation indicators; coordinated efforts to reduce non-climatic pressures on freshwaters (especially in headwaters); evidence-based, practical guidance on adaptation measures that build resilience. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation; Catchment; Climate change; Indicator; Resilience; Water management","Catchments; Risk assessment; Water; Water management; Catchment properties; Environmental threshold; Evidence-based; Operating condition; Practical guidance; Social landscapes; Socio-ecological; Through the lens; Climate change; catastrophic event; catchment; climate change; ecosystem resilience; long-term change; water management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090909525

The data obtained were analyzed using the SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats technique). The results showed that the highest potential to develop ratoon rice farming in Central Java is on rainfed land. Development of ratoon rice for climate change adaptation and mitigation is influenced by the characteristics of farmers, environmental conditions, irrigation systems, the activity of extension workers and farmer groups, the motivation of farmers to innovate. Therefore, the strategies suggested to develop the system are: to increase the role of extension workers and farmer groups, as well as agricultural production facilities, so that the motivation to maintain the local wisdom and accept technological innovations raise; and to minimize the decline in ratoon rice production by intensive farming management and specifically create ratoon rice farming area. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Human resource management; Irrigation; Motivation; Agricultural productions; Central Java Province; Climate change adaptation; Environmental conditions; Farming management; Irrigation systems; Qualitative research; Technological innovation; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092380560

Hence, a better comprehension of equations used to characterize the estimation of regional biomass is much needed. A total of 301 sample trees of both planted and natural larch from northeast China were used to construct the additive systems of general and dummy variable models using weighted nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (NSUR) to investigate the effect of forest origin on tree compartments and total biomass equations. Three different combinations of predictors were used in the two additive systems, and each biomass equation has its own specific weighting function to achieve the homoscedasticity in model residuals. Biomass partitioning, root-to-shoot ratio (RSR), and carbon concentration between the two origins were also analyzed. The results indicated that (1) the additive system of origin-based dummy variable model clearly outperformed the general additive model according to their respective predictors’ combinations and the difference between them were found to be significant; (2) based on the jackknife models’ validation, the two additive systems delivered good biomass predictions, of which the best models’ R2 were 0.939, 0.987, 0.910, 0.878, and 0.989 for root, stem, branch, foliage, and total biomass equations, respectively; (3) biomass allocations were varied between the two origins, and the RSR was higher in natural forests (0.32 ± 0.16) compared to plantations (0.25 ± 0.06) both averagely (±SD) and entirely across all diameter classes; (4) the mean carbon concentrations of root, stem, branch, and foliage observed in naturally regenerated trees were 1.81%, 2.90%, 1.23%, and 2.30% higher than those in plantations, respectively.

These two conditions introduce loss of orthogonality between the OFDM subcarriers, hence, degrades the system performance. Although OFDM can provide high spectrum efficiency, but due to its inherited rectangular pulse shape, the frequency spectrum produced is not very well localized, which blocks its coexistence with other systems in adjacent carriers. Compared to the conventional OFDM, filtered OFDM (f-OFDM) has a lower out-of-band (OOB) interference and spectrum leakage. Therefore, f-OFDM is attractive to be implemented in high mobility applications such as in HSR, as considered here.

We apply this framework to deep-time ecosystems made up of extinct plants by constructing plant functional types using fossil remains and simulating - as close as possible - the in vivo response of extinct taxa to their paleoclimatic environment. To accomplish this, foliar characteristics including maximum stomatal conductance, distance from leaf vein to stomata, and cuticular carbon and nitrogen were input as model parameters derived from measurements of wellpreserved Pennsylvanian-age fossil leaves. With these inputs, we modeled a terrestrial tropical forest ecosystem dominated by ""iconic"" plant types of the Pennsylvanian (~323-299 Ma) including arborescent lycopsids, medullosans, cordaitaleans, and tree ferns using a modified version of the process model BIOME-BGC, which we refer to as Paleo-BGC. Modeled carbon and water - and, for the first time, nitrogen - budgets of a tropical ecosystem from Euramerica driven by daily meteorology are simulated using the Global Circulation Model GENESIS 3.0. Key findings are: (1) lycopsids have the lowest daily leaf water potential, soil water content, surface runoff, and degree of nitrogen leaching indicating an intensive water use strategy compared to medullosans, cordaitaleans, and tree ferns that have increasingly lower simulated water use, greater surface, and nitrogen loss in this order; (2) modeled vegetation response to aridification, which was caused by reduced precipitation and intensified through the close of the Carboniferous and into the Permian shows that lycopsids and medullosans have the lowest tolerance for precipitation decrease compared to cordaitaleans and tree ferns, consistent with the paleobotanical record of occurrence of floral turnovers through the Middle Pennsylvanian through earliest Permian; (3) elevated atmospheric pO2, hypothesized as characteristic for the latter half of the Pennsylvanian and early Permian (~299-272 Ma), caused higher atmospheric pressure reducing plant transpiration, higher surface water runoff rates, and increased nitrogen export for all plant types simulated, manifested most strongly in the lycopsid dominated ecosystems - with overall only a small reduction in net daily assimilation (≈ 1 ~mol CO2m-2s-1). Both aridification and elevated atmospheric oxygen reduced transpiration, increased water retention in soils, with higher surface runoff. With more discharge, enhanced and higher short-term surface soil loss and silicate weathering would have been possible in broad regions of the paleotropics during the late Carboniferous and early Permian. These results are only obtainable by integrating multiple, fossil-derived measurements into the simulation framework of an ecosystem model that utilizes daily meteorology. © 2020 American Journal of Science.

Currently, ocean and land systems remove about half of the CO2 emitted by human activities; the remainder stays in the atmosphere. These removal processes are sensitive to feedbacks in the energy, carbon, and water cycles that will change in the future. Observing how much carbon is taken up on land through photosynthesis is complicated because carbon is simultaneously respired by plants, animals, and microbes. Global observations from satellites and air samples suggest that natural ecosystems take up about as much CO2 as they emit. To match the data, our land models generate imaginary Earths where carbon uptake and respiration are roughly balanced, but the absolute quantities of carbon being exchanged vary widely. Getting the magnitude of the flux is essential to make sure our models are capturing the right pattern for the right reasons. Combining two cutting-edge tools, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), will help develop an independent answer of how much carbon is being taken up by global ecosystems. Photosynthesis requires CO2, light, and water. OCS provides a spatially and temporally integrated picture of the “front door” of photosynthesis, proportional to CO2 uptake and water loss through plant stomata. SIF provides a high-resolution snapshot of the “side door,” scaling with the light captured by leaves. These two independent pieces of information help us understand plant water and carbon exchange. A coordinated effort to generate SIF and OCS data through satellite, airborne, and ground observations will improve our process-based models to predict how these cycles will change in the future. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.

Here, I document the geographic distribution of C. planatus and consider evidence concerning where this species may be native, particularly whether it is native to Florida. To evaluate the distribution of C. planatus, I compiled and mapped specimen records from >1500 sites. Although, C. planatus was originally described from Cuba, it remains uncertain whether it is native or exotic there. In addition to scattered records across tropical South America, C. planatus shows a largely continuous continental distribution from Panama through Central America and Mexico to southeastern Texas. Across this continental range, C. planatus shows notable color variation, suggesting that it is native to this region. In Texas, C. planatus records dating to before 1980 are spread across most of its known range. However, eight of the nine northernmost records date to 2014 or later, including all six records from the Houston area in East Texas. This pattern suggests that C. planatus is native to Texas, but populations there appear to have recently expanded, perhaps due to climate change. Camponotus planatus populations in Florida, the Bahamas, and Mississippi are probably non-native. In Florida, C. planatus was first found in Key West in 1887, but populations appear to have greatly expanded, particularly since 1980, and now extend as far north as Jacksonville. Due to continued climate change, C. planatus may soon be able to extend its range all along the Gulf coast from Texas to Florida. © 2020 American Entomological Society.

The underlying premise is that the world’s majority—who have the minority of financial capital—are living on the margins and are the most vulnerable and at risk from climate change. Such a reality, coupled with a deficit understanding of the majority world, is resulting in significant implications for how the ‘adaptation industry’ (those that fund, design and implement projects) go about their work. Drawing on research evaluating 15 community-based adaptation projects in Vanuatu we found that despite genuine attempts, projects invariably fell short of success, longevity and sustainability. We argue that the indifferent, albeit variable, success of most projects is attributable to the construction of the geographical scale of ‘community-based’ and the deficit view flowing down to the ‘community’ through hubris policy, funding guidelines and individual implementers. Our findings show that ‘experts’ are working in Pacific communities, conducting assessments that involve asking what ‘community’ needs are, going away to design projects, coming back and implementing projects, which communities are inevitably challenged to sustain once funding has ceased. We postulate that these limitations stem from such a formation of adaptation work that pejoratively fails to see Pacific Islanders in situ as the best litmus test of their own agendas, needs, aspirations and futures and in the best position to make decisions for themselves about what and how they might become more resilient. We claim from a growing body of evidence and new frontiers in research that, rather than adaptation being ‘community-based’, it needs to be ‘locally led’, not limited to ‘communities’, and should take place across different entry points and incorporate, as appropriate, elements of autonomous/Indigenous peoples ownership. © 2019, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Climate change; Community-based adaptation; Developing countries; Vanuatu","adaptive management; climate change; design; developing world; local participation; longevity; nongovernmental organization; ownership; risk assessment; sustainability; vulnerability; Vanuatu; climate change; geography; government; human; Vanuatu; Climate Change; Geography; Government; Humans; Vanuatu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075896531

This study enables higher spatial and temporal resolution inversions with spatial and temporal error structures similar to those used in other published inversions by representing the prior flux error covariances as a Kronecker product of spatial and temporal covariances and by using spectral methods for the spatial correlations. Compared to existing inversion systems that are forced to degrade the resolution of the problem in order to bring the dimensionality down to computationally tractable levels, this inversion framework is able to take advantage of mesoscale transport simulations and more of the complexity of spatial and temporal covariances in the surface CO2 fluxes. This approach was successfully implemented over one month with an identical-twin observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) using a set of assumptions about the prior flux uncertainties compatible both with continental-scale uncertainty estimates and with comparisons of vegetation models to flux towers. The demonstration illustrates the potential of the newly developed inversion system to use high-temporal-resolution information from the North American tower network, to extract high-resolution information about CO2 fluxes that is inaccessible to coarser resolution inversion systems, and to simultaneously optimize an ensemble of prior estimates. This demonstration sets the stage for regional flux inversions that can take full advantage of the high-resolution data available in tower CO2 records and mesoscale atmospheric transport reanalyses, include more realistic prior error structures, and explore specifying prior fluxes with ensembles. © 2020.

The government immediately issued emergency control measures to reduce the pollution, which provided a good opportunity to explore the impact of emission reduction on aerosol-radiation interaction. In this study, four tests were conducted, including the base1 simulation with emission reduction and aerosol-radiation interaction on, the base2 simulation with emission reduction and aerosol-radiation interaction off, the scenario1 simulation without emission reduction and aerosol-radiation interaction on and the scenario2 simulation without emission reduction and aerosol-radiation interaction off. We find that the aerosol-radiation interaction decreased the downward shortwave radiation and the temperature at 2 m, reduced the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) in the region, and increased the relative humidity at 2 m, which is favorable for pollution accumulation. Our results revealed that the interaction effect due to emission reductions increased downward shortwave radiation by an average of 0–5 W/m2, leading to increase in surface temperature of 0–0.05°C, increase in the daytime mean PBL high of 0–8 m, and decrease in daytime mean relative humidity at 2 m of 0.5%. We found that if there were aerosol-radiation interaction, it would enhance the effectiveness of emission control measures on air pollution control. The enhance of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 µm), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 µm), and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) emission reduction effects reached 7.62%, 6.90%, 11.62%, respectively, over this region. © 2020","Aerosol-radiation interaction; Emission reduction; Meteorological factors; Pollutant concentration","Aerosols; Air pollution; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Radiation; Aerosol-radiation interactions; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Emission control measures; Emission reduction; Interaction effect; Planetary boundary layers; Short-wave radiation; Surface temperatures; Particles (particulate matter); aerosol composition; aerosol formation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; nitrogen dioxide; pollution monitoring; temperature profile; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085090541

Focusing on climate change as a case study, this paper relates morally-motivated public good provision to the six moral foundations (MFs) identified by moral psychologists: Care, Fairness and Liberty (individual-focused), and Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity (group-focused). Using data from the European Social Surveys it is found that using the MFs in addition to standard explanatory variables improves the explanation of climate-friendly behaviors and endorsement of climate-friendly regulations. While the Fairness and Care foundations are strong and robust predictors of the dependent variables, the Loyalty foundation contributes positively only when neglecting the nature of climate change mitigation as a global public good. More generally, in contrast to the individual-focused MFs (that apply to all individuals), the group-focused MFs are of little direct relevance to climate change mitigation – consistent with the benefit from mitigation extending beyond the in-group (family, neighborhood, region, or nation) to which these MFs refer. Group-focused MFs are only of indirect relevance as their endorsement fosters general environmental concern. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Moral foundations; Moral motivation; Voluntary public good provision","climate change; ecological economics; economic theory; public goods; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084254948

Box 471, AL Wageningen, 6700, Netherlands","Wetlands are the most fragile and threatened ecosystems worldwide, and also one of the most rapidly declining. At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration. Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access. The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users. The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal. Wetland managers and data analysists from more than fifty wetland sites and river basins across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa investigated the benefits and limitations of this EO-based wetland mapping and monitoring approach. We describe research that applies the SWOS tools to test their potential for the mapping of wetlands in a case study based in Albania, and show its effectiveness to derive metrics relevant to the monitoring of SDG indicator 6.6.1. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Copernicus; Ramsar reporting; SDG reporting; Sentinel; Wetland decline; Wetland management and monitoring","Biodiversity; Climate change; Data handling; Decision making; Ecosystems; Mapping; Monitoring; Orbits; Satellites; Software design; Water supply; Carbon sequestration; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reductions; Earth observations; Ecological character; Ecosystem services; Local conservation; Monitoring approach; Wetlands; biodiversity; bioindicator; climate change; conservation management; data processing; decision making; demand analysis; ecosystem service; governance approach; river basin; satellite altimetry; satellite data; Sentinel; stakeholder; Sustainable Development Goal; terrestrial ecosystem; wetland; Africa; Albania; Middle East",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086631052

Field test was conducted in the area previously subjected to several accidental oil spills in the central European Russia. The effects of fresh pig manure and/or conventional NPK fertilizers on plant growth, hydrocarbon content and activities of catalase, dehydrogenase, urease, sucrose, and phosphatase were evaluated depending on an application rate. Fertilizer application resulted in restoration of plant cover and reduction of hydrocarbons by 13 to 46%. Oil pollution reduced activities of catalase, dehydrogenase, sucrase and phosphatase and increased urease activity. Manure application was more effective in regard to plant growth, hydrocarbon removal and enzymatic activity in comparison with mineral fertilizers.

Existing studies on precipitation pay more attention to the impact of natural and meteorological factors, and the research on the impact of urbanization on the spatial patterns of precipitation is still very deficient. Based on geographic detection, this study quantitatively analyzed the dominant, interaction, and sensitivity factors that affect precipitation changes in more than 150 urban units in Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) during the process of urbanization. The research findings show the following: 1O The dominant factors have seasonal differences in terms of the precipitation variation in Jing-Jin-Ji. The leading factors in summer were the change of radiation and relative humidity. The dominant factors in winter were the changes in radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed. On the annual scale, the dominant factors were the changes in relative humidity, aerosol optical depth, radiation, and wind speed. 2OWhether in summer, in winter, or on the annual scale, urbanization can enhance the explanatory power of spatial variation of urban precipitation through interaction with natural/meteorological factors, and all the dominant interaction factors show a nonlinear enhancement trend. 3O The night light intensity and urban heat island can greatly amplify the explanatory power of other factors, thus becoming the most sensitive factor in urbanization precipitation changes. The above research can provide a theoretical basis for the formulation of urban climate policies and urban planning. © 2020 by the authors.","Dominant factor; Geographical detector; Interacting factor; Precipitation; Urbanization","heat island; light intensity; nonlinearity; optical depth; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; sensitivity analysis; solar radiation; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; urban atmosphere; urbanization; wind velocity; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Jingjinji; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091698042

How exposed Africa is to the co-occurrence of these events is however virtually unknown. This study provides the first analysis of projected changes in the co-occurrence of five such compound climate extremes in Africa, under a low (RCP2.6) and high (RCP8.5) emissions scenario. These changes are combined with population projections for a low (SSP1) and high (SSP3) population growth scenario, in order to provide estimates of the number of people that may be exposed to such events at the end of the 21st century. We make use of an ensemble of regional climate projections from the Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations (CORE) project embedded in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) framework. This ensemble comprises five different Earth System Model/Regional Climate Model (ESM/RCM) combinations with three different ESMs and two RCMs. We show that all five compound climate extremes will increase in frequency, with changes being greater under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6. Moreover, populations exposed to these changes are greater under RCP8.5/SSP3, than RCP2.6/SSP1, increasing by 47- and 12-fold, respectively, compared to the present-day. Regions of Africa that are particularly exposed are West Africa, Central-East Africa, and Northeast and Southeast Africa. Increased exposure is mainly driven by the interaction between climate and population growth, and the effect of population alone. This has important policy implications in relation to climate mitigation and adaptation. ©2020. The Authors.

However, no physical mechanism has been proposed to explain this relationship. Here we advance the hypothesis that deep convection encroaching into regions that should be dominated by shallow clouds hampers the formation of shallow clouds in the present climate and reduces the magnitude of positive low-level cloud feedbacks, resulting in smaller values of climate sensitivity. We test this hypothesis first by performing sensitivity tests with the HadGEM2-A aquaplanet model subject to a uniform +4 K sea surface temperature (SST) perturbation, in which we vary the degree to which deep convection associated with the single/double ITCZ extends toward subtropical low-cloud regions. Experiments with more precipitation encroaching into the subtropics have weaker subtropical cloud radiative effects in the present-day simulations and less positive subtropical cloud feedbacks, consistent with our hypothesis. We test this hypothesis further by looking for the predicted relationships across multimodel ensembles of SST forced Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) experiments subject to a uniform +4 K SST increase. Relationships of the expected sign are found in the CMIP5 AMIP+4K experiments, but not all are statistically significant at the 5% level. We find no statistically significant support for our hypothesis in the currently available CMIP6 AMIP+4K experiments. ©2020.

The difference in TCR between the two experiments is 0.16 C, which is about half as large as the multimodel spread of TCR in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The TCR difference can be attributed to the difference in the preindustrial climatological state. In the case where deep-ocean mixing works to enhance ocean stratification in the Pacific intermediate-to-deep layers, because the Pacific water mass is transported to the Southern Ocean by the Pacific meridional overturning circulation, the subsurface stratification in the Southern Ocean is also enhanced and deep wintertime convection there is suppressed. Our study shows that in this case during CO2 increase, ocean heat uptake from the atmosphere to deeper layers is suppressed and TCR is estimated to be higher than the other case. Diminished accumulation of oceanic heat in the deep layer also leads to the sea level depression of ∼0.4 m in the Southern Ocean when atmospheric CO2 concentration has quadrupled. Together with convective and cloud-radiative processes in the atmosphere and oceanic mesoscale processes, microscale deep-ocean mixing can be one of the major candidates in explaining uncertainty in future climate projections. © 2020 The Author(s).

Research and policy measures have evolved since then, paying increasing attention to systemic change over individual behaviour. However, as individual behavioural change is constrained by the systems within which choices are made, more study is needed to understand better how systemic changes occur. Drawing on the experiences of the Sustainable Lifestyles and Education Programme of the UN-led One-Planet Network in collaborating with small collective actions for sustainable lifestyles, the paper analyses the needs and approaches for sustainable lifestyles and opportunities for the local actors to grow their capacities in developing ways of living sustainably. These experiences show that the pursuit of sustainable lifestyles is not a one-shot change in behaviour. It is a continuous process where actors identify and tackle locally specific opportunities for responsible and sustainable ways of living, and through a process of mutual learning and experimentation gradually shape shared visions of sustainable living. Systemic changes for sustainable living are ultimately neither about simply improving people's awareness or attitudes or replacing some components of the external systems. They are the creation of capacities and aspirations of people actively and continuously engaging to shape alternative systems of living. © 2020 by the authors.","Collective actions; One-planet network; Sustainable lifestyles","climate change; collective action; lifestyle; living standard; public attitude; resource depletion; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091709590

Increasing the renewable energy shares to 23% in 2030 is the strategic objective from the government. Rooftop PV is one of the solutions to reduce the emission, rooftop PV can be used in costumer not only for own use but also it can transfer to the grid. PLN, as the representative of government to perform the electricity business have some regulation for implementation of rooftop PV. If there are large amount of rooftop PV connected to the grid, it will impact the existing grid. Therefore, in order to maintain the reliability and the power quality supplied to the costumer, the hosting capacity is needed. Hosting capacity indicate the limit of the distributed generation that can be connected into the grid. This paper discusses the general overview of the regulation and technical procedure for rooftop PV installation. This paper reviews the hosting capacity in radial configuration feeder, Putri Betung in Aceh. By using the active power method, the hosting capacity in each point of load and also along the feeder can be obtained.

We compared vegetation response using long-term experiments in subtropical South Africa with published temperate Park Grass (UK) and Konza Prairie (USA) results. Location: Ukulinga, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Methods: Long-term experiments in the South African site included a fertilizer experiment (VFE) that was compared with Park Grass and a burning and mowing experiment (BME) that was compared with Konza Prairie. Results: We found consistent vegetation patterns of this subtropical grassland and the temperate grasslands at Park Grass and Konza Prairie. In the comparison of the burning and mowing experiments, species richness in the BME at Ukulinga declined across mowing treatments but did not change between control and intermediate burns as found at Konza Prairie. There was dominance by a few species in the subtropical grassland and the two temperate grasslands under high productivity and frequent burns. Annual burns resulted in lower species richness at both subtropical Ukulinga and temperate Konza Prairie. At both temperate Park Grass and Ukulinga, few species dominated in highly fertilized plots, both sites showed a negative effect of nitrogen amount, and there was a positive effect of lime on species richness. Conclusions: Consistent results from long-term series of subtropical and temperate grasslands suggest that there are similar community assembly rules regardless of different climatic conditions and different species pools. A possible underlying mechanism for community assembly at Ukulinga and Konza Prairie for both fertilization, burning and mowing may be shade tolerance. At Ukulinga and Park Grass, changes in species richness (negative effects of increasing nitrogen amount and positive effects of lime) were remarkably similar. Most of the common grass species in South Africa showed evidence of competition, supporting niche-based assembly rules. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science","burning; Cedar Creek; climate change; fertilization; fire; Konza Prairie LTER; long-term experiments; mowing; NUTNET; Park Grass experiment; subtropical grassland; temperate grassland","assembly rule; burning; dominance; fertilizer; grassland; mowing; nitrogen; shade tolerance; species richness; Kansas; Konza Prairie; KwaZulu-Natal; Pietermaritzburg; South Africa; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087637543

It is seldom discussed, however, how we should identify frontrunner cities from which low-carbon development experiences can be gleaned and then implemented in neighboring cities. This study, therefore, proposed a simple indicator—the “good neighbor index”—to identify frontrunner cities in low-carbon transformation based on economic and emission performance. Based on this indicator, we identified “good neighbors” in static and dynamic views for China. The results showed that the static good neighbors in 2015 were mostly large cities with higher incomes and better industrial structures whereas the dynamic neighbors achieved better economic growth and emission reductions from 2005 to 2015, though their economic and emissions statuses were generally worse. The good neighbor list is not consistent with the list of national low-carbon pilot cities, which has largely overlooked the experiences of some fast-growing cities. These results have policy implications for the Chinese government in terms of promoting the low-carbon transformation of cities.

The Chinese government has implemented targeted pollution control measures at the city level, emphasizing coordination among cities to prevent and control air pollution in key regions such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration. This study combined an inter-city multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model with an air quality dispersion model consisting of a weather research and forecasting (WRF) model and the CALPUFF model (WRF/CALPUFF) to study the inter-city economic consumption, pollutant emission and concentration among 13 cities in BTH urban agglomeration. NOx is chosen as an example. The combined effects of economic linkage and atmospheric transport show that NOx concentrations in cities in the BTH urban agglomeration are attributable to three consumption sources: a local contribution from the target city's own local economic consumption (average, 25%), and non-local consumption contributions, including other cities in the BTH urban agglomeration (average, 36%) and regions outside of BTH (average, 39%). Compared with the contributions to NOx concentrations calculated using only the MRIO model or atmospheric transport stimulation model, the results of this paper quantify that the consumption outside of a city could provide a greater impact on the city's air quality due to the combined effects of economic linkage and atmospheric transport. To avoid negative impacts of emission reduction targets on economic consumption, governmental regional pollution control policies should consider the combined effects of economic linkage and atmospheric transport. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric transport; Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei; Concentration; Emissions; MRIO; WRF/CALPUFF","air quality; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); economic analysis; emission; government; input-output analysis; pollution control; pollution policy; air quality; article; atmospheric transport; China; city; forecasting; linkage analysis; pollutant; pollution control; quantitative analysis; weather; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086435911

The pollution performances, including the indicators of energy intensity and emission intensities of SO2, NOx, and PM of the 54 enterprises are evaluated. After identifying the key enterprises, this study designs their emission reduction paths including three types of measures, and quantifies the emission reduction potential. The results show that: (1) The 54 enterprises have imbalanced pollution performances, as the values have difference of 2–4 orders of magnitude. 13, 10, and 19 enterprises are classified into level A, B, and C respectively. (2) The emission reduction paths of 24 key enterprises are designed, which can reduce 3441.21, 4507.85, and 1683.12 tons of SO2, NOx, and PM.

This paper is committed to finding efficient ways for China to reduce SO2 emissions with little impact on its socio-economic development. Data of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2017 were collected to assess the decoupling relationship between economic growth and SO2 emissions. The Tapio method was used. Then, the temporal trend of decoupling was analyzed and the Moran Index was introduced to test spatial autocorrelation of the provinces. To concentrate resources and improve the reduction efficiency, a generalized logarithmic mean Divisia index improved by the Cobb–Douglas function was applied to decompose drivers of SO2 emissions and to identify the main drivers. Results showed that the overall relationship between SO2 emissions and economic growth had strong decoupling (SD) since 2012; provinces, except for Liaoning and Guizhou, have reached SD since 2015. The decoupling indexes of neighboring provinces had spatial dependence at more than 95% certainty. The main positive driver was the proportion of the secondary sector of the economy and the main negative drivers were related to energy consumption and investment in waste gas treatment. Then, corresponding suggestions for government and enterprises were made. © 2020 by the authors.

Improving our comprehension of the paleoclimate variations and their driving mechanisms in this region has great significance for environmental protection and agricultural economic development. In order to provide more reliable data for future climate forecasting and reduce the effects of climatic disasters in NC, we established a 328-year stable oxygen isotope (Δ18O) chronology based on four Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. from Mt. Hasi, Gansu Province, and found that the tree-ring Δ18O inherited the signals of summer (July-August) monsoonal precipitation Δ18O (Δ18OP). Correlation function analysis indicated that the tree-ring Δ18O series responded significantly to the observed local relative humidity from July to August (RHJA) with r = -0.65 (n = 55, p &lt; 0.001). Based on the clear physiological mechanism, we reconstructed the RHJA variations from 1685 to 2012 using a transfer function. Our reconstruction was very stable and had strong spatial representativeness, it was significantly positively correlated with Asian summer monsoon (ASM) indices, indicating that our reconstruction reflected the variations of ASM to a large extent. The RHJA series successfully captured the weakening of the ASM since the 1930s. There was a close connection between the reconstructed sequence and the East Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). Further analyses revealed that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) may play important roles in the summer monsoon precipitation in NC. © 2020, by the authors.","Asian summer monsoon; ENSO; North China; PDO; Tree-ring","Agricultural robots; Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Forestry; Oceanography; Surface waters; Asian summer monsoons; Monsoonal precipitation; Pacific decadal oscillation; Physiological mechanisms; Pinus tabulaeformis carr; Sea surface temperature (SST); Stable oxygen isotopes; Summer monsoon precipitation; Atmospheric thermodynamics; agricultural economics; chronology; climate variation; economic development; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental protection; monsoon; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; paleoclimate; relative humidity; sea surface temperature; summer; tree ring; China; Gansu; Pinus tabuliformis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093973581

CFTR regulates an ATP release pore in many tissues, but the identity and regulatory mechanism of the pore are unknown. We investigated the role of CFTR in ATP release from primary cardiomyocytes and ventricular wall in vivo. Methods: Proteins involved in the signalling pathway for ATP release during simulated ischaemia (lactic acid treatment) were investigated using inhibitors and siRNA; colocalization was identified by coimmunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays; changes in near-membrane pH and calcium were identified with total internal reflection microscopy; in vivo ATP release was investigated using interstitial microdialysis of rat heart. Results: Lactic acid-induced CFTR-dependent ATP release from cultured cardiomyocytes and left ventricle in vivo. Lactic acid entry elevated near-membrane calcium, which involved Na/H- and Na/Ca-exchangers colocalized with CFTR. Calcium entry-induced CFTR activation, which involved cAMP, protein kinase A, FAK, Pyk2 and Src. Removal of extracellular bicarbonate abolished cardiomyocyte ATP release induced by lactic acid or CFTR activators. Bicarbonate stimulated cytochrome c expression, cytochrome c release and ATP release from isolated cardiomyocyte mitochondria. Pannexin 1 (Panx1) colocalized with CFTR. Lactic acid increased cardiomyocyte caspase activity: caspase inhibitors or Panx1 siRNA abolished cardiomyocyte ATP release, while pannexin inhibition abolished cardiac ATP release in vivo. Conclusion: During simulated ischaemia, CFTR-dependent bicarbonate entry stimulated ATP and cytochrome c release from mitochondria; in the cytoplasm, cytochrome c-activated caspase 3, which in turn activated Panx1, and ATP was released through the opened Panx1 channel. © 2020 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

This study develops a region-based structural decomposition analysis method to capture the spatial heterogeneity of driving factors between eastern, central, and western China from a temporal perspective. The results show that there is a clear declining trend both in the amount and growth rate of energy increase linked to the continuous decrease in the rate of national GDP growth. Historically, final demand was the largest driver of increased energy use during the whole period under investigation whilst the change in energy intensity and structural change are identified as the biggest contributors to reductions from 2007 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2012, respectively. From a spatial perspective, energy demands in eastern regions have grown most, followed by the western and central regions. The impacts of all driving factors were more local-dominant. The changes in production structure and final demand volumes generated the most significant spillover effects. The findings of this study enhance the understanding of dynamic evolution in energy-driven factors at the regional level, which is beneficial to making well-directed energy conservation policies by considering regional specificity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Driving factor; Energy; Multi-regional input-output mode; Spillover effect; Structural decomposition analysis","Emission control; Energy conservation; Dynamic evolution; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Energy intensity; Production structures; Regional disparities; Spatial heterogeneity; Spillover effects; Structural decomposition analysis; Factor analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087662306

This is because they have the advantages of high energy utilization efficiency and lower pollution emissions. However, there are many influencing factors, complicated structures, and fluctuations in renewable energy sources, which led to ineffective system scheme configurations. In particular, the fluctuations in meteorological elements, such as temperature and radiation under climate change, have increased the difficulty of forecasting user's load and estimating renewable energy output. This research used a five-star hotel in Shanghai, China, as a study case and established an improved version of operation optimization model of a solar hybrid CCHP system. There are two major innovations: (i) Regional climate simulation software PRECIS was applied to predict the temperature and radiation changes in this region over the next 80 years, and the predicted results were plugged as the inputs to the DeST software and solar system output calculation formulas to estimate the user load and the system output under climate change; (ii) the outputs from step (i) were incorporated into the operation optimization model of the hybrid system for generating appropriate operation schemes which could help adapt to climate change. The obtained results show that in the same RCP scenario, user-side cooling demand increases annually. In contrast, the heating demand decreases over time. Their variation degree in the RCP8.5 scenario exceeds those of the RCP4.5 scenario, which directly affect the system output. In addition to external meteorological elements, selected key parameters (such as step electricity price) and cascade utilization mechanism also affect equipments’ output. Compared with traditional optimization model based on historical meteorological data, the optimal operational scheme under climate change could effectively avoid imbalance between energy supply and demand caused by the extremely high-temperature event, and also reduce excessive energy supply under “warm winter” condition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CCHP with the solar system; Climate change; Load prediction; Operation optimization","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Computer software; Economics; Energy utilization; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Adaptation to climate changes; Complicated structures; Energy utilization efficiency; High temperature events; Meteorological elements; Operation optimization; Regional climate simulation; Renewable energy source; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086749300

In the presence of an iron or nickel containing case to house the molten carbonate electrolysis, or the presence of Fe or Ni in the electrochemical components, ferromagnetic CNTs can grow at the cathode. For example, EDS elemental analysis confirms the presence of iron in the CNTs, and XRD confirms the presence of iron carbide at the CNT nucleation site. The observed interlattice spacing of 0.20 nm of the iron carbide is distinct from the observed 0.36 nm graphene lattice spacing of the CNT walls. An excess iron release can be facilitated into the electrolyte using an iron rich alloy anode, such as Incoloy.

To comprehensively understand the influence of social inequality on climate change, the study analyzed the mechanism and pathways of the effects of education level on energy consumption, selecting typical indicators to reflect (i) the education quality within the population and (ii) the level of education development in order to evaluate the impact of education inequality and disparity. Under the framework of a STIRPAT model hypothesis, we investigated how the education level in Guangdong Province influenced energy consumption, using panel data from 2002 to 2017 and making a distinction between the Pearl River Delta region and the “non-Pearl River Delta” region. The empirical results show a significant disparity between the education level and energy consumption of the two regions. The education level has exerted significant effects in relation to energy consumption in the whole of Guangdong province. In cities with lower education levels, this impact was more obvious. However, in places with higher levels of education, this impact was overshadowed by other more significant factors, such as income level. The quality of the education within the population was found to increase energy consumption in the non-Pearl River Delta region, while this did not significantly impact on energy consumption within the Pearl River Delta. Our results hold implications for policy makers that they should adopt education methods and interventions to promote low-carbon knowledge and awareness that reflect the different stages of education development of regions. In this way, residents can be encouraged to develop low-carbon lifestyles, thereby reducing energy consumption and mitigating CO2 emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Education level inequality; Energy consumption; Guangdong province; Panel regression model; Pearl river delta region; STIRPAT model","economic growth; education; educational development; empirical analysis; environmental issue; lifestyle; mitigation; panel data; social problem; socioeconomic conditions; urbanization; adult; Article; awareness; carbon footprint; carbon utilization; China; climate change; conceptual framework; educational status; energy conservation; energy consumption; human; lifestyle; socioeconomics; urbanization; city; economic development; urbanization; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; China; Cities; Economic Development; Socioeconomic Factors; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084666449

Standard stations, installed by governments with a high cost, can provide reliable air quality information; whereas a large number of portable air monitoring sensors with low cost are widely used and output less precise results. In this paper, we propose a category-based calibration approach (CCA) using machine learning algorithms for such portable sensors. Compared with traditional methods that often learn a single regression model, CCA includes multiple regression models according to pollutant concentration categories, and builds a more accurate mapping from sensor readings to reference. Furthermore, CCA introduces two fault-tolerance modules: Classification tolerance and sample tolerance. The former mitigates the impact of misclassification for concentration category, and the latter improves the robustness of individual regression model. Our approach is evaluated on carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) from two cities of China. The experiment results show that CCA has a better performance than traditional calibration models in both accuracy and robustness. © 2020 IEEE.","air monitoring sensors; Air quality; category-based calibration; fault-tolerance strategy; machine learning","Air quality; Calibration; Carbon monoxide; Deterioration; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Accurate mapping; Air pollution monitoring; Misclassifications; Multiple regression model; Pollutant concentration; Quality information; Regression model; Traditional calibration; Fault tolerance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090231951

This study aims to quantitatively assess the direct and indirect effects of these drivers on species richness, phylogenetic and functional structure of bird assemblages. Location: Mainland China. Taxon: Birds. Methods: Ordinary least squares models and simultaneous autoregressive models were used to test the associations between glacial–interglacial climate anomaly, contemporary climate, plant species richness, elevation range and species richness, phylogenetic structure, functional structure of bird assemblages in mainland China. Structural equation models were used to distinguish between direct and indirect effects of these variables on bird diversity. Results: High bird species richness with phylogenetically and functionally clustered structure occurred in regions with more plant species and stable glacial–interglacial climate. Notably, the phylogenetically clustered bird assemblages were composed of young lineages. Contemporary precipitation and elevation range affected bird diversity through their indirect effects on plant species richness. Main Conclusions: These findings suggest that more plant species and stable glacial–interglacial climate may promote bird diversity through their effects on in situ diversification and species dispersal rate in southwestern China. Therefore, the well-preserved plant and bird diversity through the long-term climate fluctuations should be of great importance of biodiversity conservation in China. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Birds; China; functional structure; glacial–interglacial climate stability; phylogenetic structure; plant species richness; species diversification","assembly rule; avifauna; biodiversity; climate conditions; climate effect; dispersal; glacial-interglacial cycle; long-term change; niche; phylogenetics; species richness; China; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086094400

Recent research has indicated the need to operate engines at higher compression ratios and with low temperature combustion (LTC) to achieve the needed gains in engine efficiency and reductions in emissions. Because there is a lack of understanding of the chemistry of diesel fuel components and their mixtures at these LTC conditions, this limits the ability to develop predictive chemical kinetic models that can be used to optimize engine combustion. The current study aims to fill in gaps in fundamental combustion data on surrogate fuel mixtures relevant to diesel fuels. Specifically, four multicomponent diesel surrogates formulated by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) to emulate an ultra-low-sulfur research-grade #2 certification diesel fuel (CFA), namely V0a (4 components), V0b (5 components), V1 (8 components), and V2 (9 components), have been investigated in a rapid compression machine (RCM) through determination of total and first-stage ignition delay times. Autoignition characteristics of lean to rich fuel/O2/N2 mixtures, for the four CRC surrogates and CFA, have been measured using an RCM at LTC relevant pressures and temperatures, in the ranges of 10–20 bar and 650–1000 K, respectively. The equivalence ratios have been varied by independently changing the oxygen mole fraction and the fuel mole fraction in the test mixtures, thereby illustrating the individual effects of oxygen concentration and fuel loading on diesel autoignition. Autoignition results of these four CRC surrogates are compared among them and with those of CFA. Some degree of agreement in autoignition response between each CRC surrogate and CFA is observed, while discrepancies are also identified and discussed. In addition, a detailed chemical kinetic model for diesel surrogates has been developed and validated against these newly-acquired RCM data. This model shows reasonable agreement with the overall ignition delay time results of the current RCM experiments. Chemical kinetic analyses of the developed model were further conducted to help identify the reactions controlling the autoignition processes and the consumption of fuel components in CRC surrogates. © 2020","Autoignition; Chemical kinetic model; Diesel; Diesel surrogate; Low temperature combustion; Rapid compression machine","Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Efficiency; Fuels; Ignition; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Mixtures; Oxygen; Sulfur determination; Temperature; Auto-ignition process; Chemical kinetic model; Detailed chemical kinetic; Fuel-economy standards; High efficiency and low emission; Higher compression ratios; Low temperature combustion; Rapid compression machine; Fuel economy; diesel fuel; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; addition reaction; Article; bulk density; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; combustion; comparative study; compression; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; enthalpy; heat transfer; low temperature; mathematical model; oxygen concentration; partial pressure; pressure measurement; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086390208

Most countries have rapidly stopped almost all activities including industry, services and transportation of goods and people, thus decreasing air pollution in an unprecedented way, and providing a unique opportunity to study air pollutants. While satellite data have provided visual evidence for the global reduction in air pollution such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) worldwide, precise and quantitative information is missing at the local scale. Here we studied changes in particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), NO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) at 10 urban sites in Hangzhou, a city of 7.03 million inhabitants, and at 1 rural site, before city lockdown, January 1–23, during city lockdown, January 24-February 15, and during resumption, February 16–28, in 2020. Results show that city lockdown induced a sharp decrease in PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2 concentrations at both urban and rural sites. The NO2 decrease is explained by reduction in traffic emissions in the urban areas, and by lower regional transport in rural areas during lockdown, as expected. SO2 concentrations decreased from 6.3 to 5.3 μg m−3 in the city, but increased surprisingly from 4.7 to 5.8 μg m−3 at the rural site: this increase is attributed both to higher coal consumption for heating and emissions from traditional fireworks of the Spring Eve and Lantern Festivals during lockdown. Unexpectedly, O3 concentrations increased by 145% from 24.6 to 60.6 μg m−3 in the urban area, and from 42.0 to 62.9 μg m−3 in the rural area during the lockdown. This finding is explained by the weakening of chemical titration of O3 by NO due to reductions of NOx fresh emissions during the non-photochemical reaction period from 20:00 PM to 9:00 AM (local time). During the lockdown, compared to the same period in 2019, the daily average concentrations in the city decreased by 42.7% for PM2.5, 47.9% for PM10, 28.6% for SO2, 22.3% for CO and 58.4% for NO2, which is obviously explained by the absence of city activities. Overall, we observed not only the expected reduction in some atmospheric pollutants (PM, SO2, CO, NO2), but also unexpected increases in SO2 in the rural areas and of ozone (O3) in both urban and rural areas, the latter being paradoxically due to the reduction in nitrogen oxide levels. In other words, the city lockdown has improved air quality by reducing PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2, but has also decreased air quality by augmenting O3 and SO2. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air quality; CO; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Emission reductions; Hangzhou; Lockdown; NO2; O3; PM10; PM2.5; SO2",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086459959

In China, it has become the third largest energy consumption sector and generates substantial amounts of carbon emissions. In the present study, direct and indirect carbon emissions from the transportation industry throughout China’s 30 provinces during 1997–2017 were calculated. Further, to reveal the spatio-temporal characteristics of the relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth, the standard deviational ellipse and Tapio decoupling method were employed. The main results are as follows. (1) The total carbon emissions from the transportation industry increased from 132.79 million tons (Mt) in 1997 to 849.64 Mt in 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 9.72%; direct carbon emissions accounted for approximately 86% of the total. (2) Carbon emissions as well as the added value of the transportation industry had the same spatial distribution characteristics, presenting a northeast–southwest pattern during 1997–2017. Although their spatial distribution patterns were mainly in the north–south direction, the development in the east–west direction became increasingly obvious. (3) The decoupling index in the transportation industry was greater than 0.8 for most years, with an expansive negative decoupling state or an expansive coupling state. The differences in carbon emissions and economic growth between various provinces showed a spatio-temporal disparity of the decoupling states in the transportation industry. The obtained results are of considerable interest for China’s policymakers to set more reasonable carbon emission reduction goals and implement targeted policies according to the carbon emission situation at a local scale. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions; Standard deviational ellipse; Tapio decoupling analysis; Transportation industry","carbon emission; economic growth; growth rate; social development; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; traffic and transport; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086149630

As a tentative step in this work, we developed a simple relationship to predict the emission peak of Mn2+ only based on its three local-environmental-related parameters: the average bond length between Mn2+ and its ligand anions, ligand orbitals energy and the distortion of its crystal field by focusing on tetrahedral sites. With the relationship, it offers a possible and easier approach to access the emission peaks of Mn2+ in a tetrahedral site, as we find the emission energy increases dominantly with the increase of the bond lengths between Mn2+ and its ligand anions and decreases with the rise of the ligand orbitals energy, while the factor of crystal field distortion could make the emission of Mn2+ red-shifted normally in a margin of several dozens of meV with a rare exception for an extremely large crystal field distortion with larger red-shift about 100–200 meV. We believe this high prediction accuracy of Mn2+ emission peak energy could facilitate more experimental efforts in synthesizing new Mn2+ activated phosphor with target emission position in future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crystal field; First-principle calculation; Mn2+ emission","Bond length; Crystals; Forecasting; Inorganic compounds; Ions; Ligands; Light emission; Phosphors; Chemical trend; Crystal field distortions; Emission energies; Emission-peak energy; Experimental investigations; Luminescent property; Prediction accuracy; Tetrahedral sites; Red Shift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084958067

Sealing in-seam horizontal boreholes plays a vital role in CMM drainage. Reasonable sealing length is an important factor to achieve high extraction efficiency and reduce the cost of construction. To determine the minimum reasonable sealing length of drainage boreholes, the radius of the fracture zone was obtained based on the ideal elastoplastic model, and this radius was taken as the minimum sealing length. The influencing factors of the minimum sealing length were analyzed and engineering verification test was taken in Zhongmacun mine in Henan province, China. The research results show that the minimum reasonable sealing length should be longer for a larger radius of the coal roadway and the coal seam with a deeper buried depth, while the minimum reasonable sealing length can be shortened with the increase of uniaxial compressive strength and the supporting stress of the coal roadway. The 11.07 m of sealing length calculated by theories was basically consistent with the 12 m of sealing length verified by the method of drilling cuttings. The reasonableness of sealing length (12 m) was verified by the test results of methane concentration and flux within 40 days. All those outcomes can provide references for other mines to determine the minimum reasonable sealing length of in-seam boreholes for CMM drainage. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Coal mine methane; drill cuttings; elastic; minimum sealing length; plastic","Boreholes; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Compressive strength; Drainage; Elastoplasticity; Greenhouse gases; Infill drilling; Methane; Plastics; Coal and gas outburst; Drill cuttings; elastic; Elasto-plastic models; Extraction efficiencies; Methane concentrations; minimum sealing length; Uniaxial compressive strength; Coal mines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064634500

However, the poor ion transport between the cathode materials greatly hinders the capacity performance of ASSLBs. Herein, an electron/ion dual-conductive electrode framework is proposed for superior performance ASSLBs. Highly electronic conductive reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes interconnect with active materials in the cathodes, constructing a three-dimensional continuous electron transport network. The composite electrolyte penetrates into the porous structure of the electrode, forming a consecutive ionic conductive framework. Furthermore, the thin electrolyte film formed on the surface of the cathode effectively lowers the interfacial resistance with the electrolyte membrane. Highly electron/ion conductive electrodes, combined with the polyethylene oxide-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (PEO-LLZTO) composite electrolyte, show excellent capacity performance for both LiFePO4 and sulfur (lithium-sulfur battery) active materials. In addition, the LiFePO4 cathode demonstrates superior capacity performance and rate capability at room temperature. Furthermore, the relationship between the low Coulombic efficiency and Li dendrite growth has been revealed in this work. An effective layer is formed on the surface of Li metal by the simple modification of cupric fluoride (CuF2), which can stabilize the electrolyte/anode interface. Finally, high-performance ASSLBs with high Coulombic efficiency can be achieved.

This approach optimizes the equipment combination and installed capacities, as well as to produce the operational and economic results based on the system operation simulation on typical days in heating, cooling and regular seasons.

To explore low emission pathways and provide policy recommendations for the Shanghai energy system and the environmental system to reach the carbon dioxide (CO2) peak by 2030 and attain emission reduction targets for local air pollutants (LAPs), a regional energy-environment optimization model was developed in this study, considering system costs, socio-economic development and technology. To verify the reliability of the model simulation and evaluate the model risk, a historical scenario was defined to calculate the emissions for 2004-2014, and the data were compared with the bottom-up emission inventory results. By considering four scenarios, we simulated the energy consumption and emissions in the period of 2020-2030 from the perspective of energy policies, economic measures and technology updates. We found that CO2 emissions might exceed the amount of 250 million tons by the end of 2020 under the current policy, and carbon tax with a price of 40 CNY per ton of carbon dioxide is an imperative measure to lower carbon emissions. Under the constraints, the emissions amount of SO2, NOx, PM10, and PM2.5 will be reduced by 95.3-180.8, 207.8-357.1, 149.4-274.5, and 59.5-119.8 Kt in 2030, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.","CO2; Energy-environment system; LAPs; Shanghai; TIMES model","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Risk perception; Sulfur dioxide; Emission inventories; Emission reduction targets; Energy supply system; Environment optimization; Environmental systems; Policy recommendations; Regional energy consumption; Socio-economic development; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission inventory; energy use; modeling; scenario analysis; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092410080

However, uncertainties remain in the understanding of tropical forest leaf phenology at different spatial scales. Phenocams accurately characterize leaf phenology at the crown and ecosystem scales but are limited to a few sites and time spans of a few years. Time-series satellite observations might fill this gap, but the commonly used satellites (e.g. MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel-2) have resolutions too coarse to characterize single crowns. To resolve this observational challenge, we used the PlanetScope constellation with a 3 m resolution and near daily nadir-view coverage. We first developed a rigorous method to cross-calibrate PlanetScope surface reflectance using daily BRDF-adjusted MODIS as the reference. We then used linear spectral unmixing of calibrated PlanetScope to obtain dry-season change in the fractional cover of green vegetation (GV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at the PlanetScope pixel level. We used the Central Amazon Tapajos National Forest k67 site, as all necessary data (from field to phenocam and satellite observations) was available. For this proof of concept, we chose a set of 22 dates of PlanetScope measurements in 2018 and 16 in 2019, all from the six drier months of the year to provide the highest possible cloud-free temporal resolution. Our results show that MODIS-calibrated dry-season PlanetScope data (1) accurately assessed seasonal changes in ecosystem-scale and crown-scale spectral reflectance; (2) detected an increase in ecosystem-scale GV fraction (and a decrease in NPV fraction) from June to November of both years, consistent with local phenocam observations with R2 around 0.8; and (3) monitored large seasonal trend variability in crown-scale NPV fraction. Our results highlight the potential of integrating multi-scale satellite observations to extend fine-scale leaf phenology monitoring beyond the spatial limits of phenocams. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","BRDF correction; Individual tree crowns; Leaf phenology; MODIS; Multi-scale satellite observations; Non-photosynthetic vegetation; PlanetScope; Reflectance cross-calibration","Biogeochemistry; Drought; Ecosystems; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Tropics; Vegetation; Biogeochemical cycle; Linear spectral unmixing; Non-photosynthetic vegetation; Satellite observations; Satellite remote sensing; Spectral reflectances; Temporal resolution; Tropical evergreen forests; Forestry; calibration; dry season; evergreen forest; Landsat; MODIS; phenology; pixel; remote sensing; satellite data; surface reflectance; tropical forest; vegetation cover; Brazil; Para [Brazil]; Tapajos National Forest; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084846617

However, its fleetwide implementation is severely limited by the high equipment costs and lengthy setup procedures, posing a need to develop more cost-effective, efficient emission measurement methods, such as mobile chasing tests. We conducted conjoint PEMS-chasing experiments for twelve heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDTs) to evaluate the accuracy of mobile measurement results. Two data processing approaches were integrated to automate the calculations of fuel consumption-based emission factors of nitrogen oxides (NOX). With a total of 245 plume chasing tests conducted, and then averaged by vehicle and road types, we found that the relative errors of vehicle-specific emission factors using an algorithm developed for this project were within approximately ±20% of the PEMS results for all tested vehicles. Stochastic simulations suggested reasonable results could be obtained using fewer chasing tests per vehicle (e.g., 71% for freeways and 94% for local road, equivalent to two chase tests per vehicle). This study improves the understanding of the accuracy of the mobile chasing method, and provides a practical approach for real-time emission measurements for future scaled-up mobile chasing studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Diesel; Emission factors; NOx; Plume chasing; Vehicle emissions","Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Nitrogen oxides; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Efficient emission; Emission measurement; Heavy duty diesel vehicles; Mobile measurements; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Processing approach; Stochastic simulations; Vehicular emission; Air pollution control equipment; diesel fuel; nitrogen oxide; concentration (composition); cost analysis; emission control; mobile communication; nitrogen oxides; stochasticity; traffic emission; Article; calculation; controlled study; data processing; diesel engine; exhaust gas; measurement; measurement accuracy; measurement error; mobile monitoring; pollution monitoring; portable emission measurement system; priority journal; simulation; stochastic model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085508541

However, the important roles of microbial mediation in the biochar-induced SOC accumulation over the plant growth season have not been adequately explored. Here, we illustrated the interactive effects of biochar amendments and plant growth stages on the microbial community and SOC mineralisation. Materials and methods: A 3-year experiment was performed in a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) field with five treatments, including no fertilisation, conventional fertilisation, and conventional fertilisation with three rates of biochar amendments. Results and discussion: Biochar amendments significantly improved soil moisture capacity (SMC) but decreased nitrogen (N) availability. The bacterial and fungal biomasses were enriched under biochar amendments and at the rosette and vigorous stages of the crop growing season. Biochar amendments and plant growth stages substantially affected the microbial community structure, as determined by the ratios of bacteria to fungi (B/F) and Gram-positive bacteria to Gram-negative bacteria (GP/GN). Random forest modelling revealed that SMC and N availability were the important predictors of microbial community and SOC mineralisation. Structural equation modelling indicated that microbial biomass and community structure (the rations of B/F and GP/GN) were positively associated with SMC but negatively correlated with N availability.

Although there is increasing evidence that species and functional diversity, stand structural diversity, functional compositions, and elevation play roles in ecosystem functioning, the relative strengths of these drivers and the underlying mechanisms (mass-ratio hypothesis or niche complementarity hypothesis) are not clear. Aboveground carbon storage, species diversity, stand structural diversity, community-weighted mean (CWM), and functional diversity (FDvar) of 12 leaf traits were analyzed using data from 56 old-growth forest communities in the Dawei Mountain area of Southwest China. Multiple regression models were used to test the relative importance of the predictor variables and the structural equation model was used to explore the direct and indirect influences on aboveground carbon storage. High structural diversity moderately enhanced aboveground carbon storage. CWM leaf nitrogen concentration in young leaves weakly affected aboveground carbon storage. Our final multiple regression model showed that aboveground carbon storage is mostly affected by diameter at breast height (DBH) diversity, followed by FDvar of dry matter concentration in mature leaves and CWM nitrogen concentration in young leaves. The structural equation model indicated that elevation negatively affects aboveground carbon storage via diameter at breast height (DBH) diversity. Our results suggest that niche complementarity effects moderately drive aboveground carbon storage in tropical old-growth forests, but do not fully support the importance of the mass-ratio hypothesis. © 2020 by the authors.","Aboveground carbon storage; Elevation; Functional compositions; Niche complementarity; Old-growth forest; Stand structural diversity","Conservation; Digital storage; Nitrogen; Regression analysis; Tropics; Above-ground carbons; Diameter-at-breast heights; Ecosystem functioning; Functional compositions; Functional diversity; Multiple regression model; Nitrogen concentrations; Structural equation modeling; Forestry; aboveground biomass; carbon storage; complementarity; ecosystem function; leaf; niche; nitrogen; old-growth forest; stand structure; tropical forest; Carbon; Conservation; Forestry; Growth; Nitrogen; Regression Analysis; Storage; Tropics; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091257843

We aimed to reduce the dryer energy consumption and exhaust gas emission. Using clean electric energy instead of a conventional dryer heat source, the drying system can cyclically dry high-moisture grain with zero emissions. The experimental results indicate that the condensation effect is suitable when the ratio of the cool and hot air flows is 6:1 at a heat transfer coefficient of the condenser of 79.5 W/(m2.K) and a specific heat consumption of 3,916 kJ/kgH2O when compared with the Chinese standard of 7,500 kJ/kgH2O, that is, a maximum energy savings of 48%. This paper proposes a novel technological method and idea, studies the differences in energy efficiency, emissions reduction and clean production, and provides a reference for replacing the conventional grain dryer heat source of coal with electricity. Practical applications: This drying system is applied in circular grain drying; a corn drying experiment indicates that compared with the specific energy consumption stipulated by the national standards of China, the highest energy savings is 48%, and zero release nonpollution is shown.

Previous studies lack focus of carbon retention associated with meandering river migration. To fill the gap, this study concentrated on particulate organic carbon (POC) retention by point bars that built via hydrogeomorphic processes within meandering river corridors. We selected a typical meandering river (White River) in Zoige Basin of the Tibetan Plateau to conduct field works in the growing seasons of 2016, 2018, and 2019. We found (i) concentration of POC retained within point bars was 0.17%-2.52%, three to five times significantly lower than on general areas of floodplain, and did not show downstream trends; (ii) POC was homogeneously distributed within individual point bars, whereas the positions pioneer plants invaded had significantly higher concentrations; (iii) the order for POC concentration within the river corridor was: positions of bars without plants (1.08%) < positions of bars with pioneer plants (2.96%) < general area of floodplain (5.65%); (iv) the frequency of pioneer plants invasion increased downstream by advantage of the widened channel.

However, their carbon sequestration capacities are changing due to increased anthropogenic perturbations. Herein, we employ substantial datasets to study the characteristics of organic carbon (OC) from the East China Sea (ECS) in 2006 and 2018 and reveal the impacts of reservoir construction on the OC deposition in this region. We show that the distribution of sedimentary OC in the ECS is primarily controlled by riverine input and seabed erosion processes. Hydrodynamic processes influence the OC deposition due to both the scouring of fine-grained sediments and selective degradation of OC associated with the sediment mobilization. The deposition flux of OC in the ECS decreased by 48% after reservoir construction. These findings demonstrate that reservoir construction seriously affected the OC deposition in the ECS and may be applicable to river-dominated continental shelves worldwide. ©2020.

Our study shows that transportation-intensity effect is the main driving force behind CO2 emission reductions in developed countries, while the energy-intensity effect is key to reducing transportation CO2 emissions in developing countries.

The lighting control system can be broadly categorized into three main techniques: controller-, optimization-based control, and hybrid. This paper presents recent and significant state-of-the-art interior lighting system control techniques in commercial buildings. The review focuses on several key research, including sensing technologies, objective functions and constraints, techniques, tools, and energy performances. A survey trend analysis is presented graphically and the findings are discussed extensively. Based on the comprehensive review of lighting control techniques, it is found that the optimization-based control technique is widely used by 51% compared to other techniques as it has superior performance to achieve higher energy savings while satisfying visual comfort of occupants, and at the same time the technique solves multi-objective problems effectively. Moreover, future directions have been drawn based on the highlighted gaps toward intelligent and sustainable buildings. © 2020","Daylighting; Energy savings; Lighting control system; Lighting system control techniques; Optimization","Control systems; Daylighting; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent buildings; Lighting; Lighting fixtures; Network architecture; Office buildings; Optimization; Wireless sensor networks; Artificial intelligent; Electricity-consumption; Intelligent lightings; Lighting controls; Lighting systems; Multi-objective problem; Network-based architectures; Reduce energy consumption; Intelligent control",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081123224

The siting suitability of renewable SPP hybrid, firm power plants was assessed by employing the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. Para rubberwood distribution map, 1-km resolution Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) map, and high resolution (50 m) wind potential map are overlaid in possible regions for site selection. The inclusion of energy storage is also assessed in order to achieve the firm output of the optimized power plant, as per the requirement of the SPP policy. In total, 14 possible combinations of renewable SPP scenarios, ranging from 10 to 50 MW, were analyzed in order to identify an optimum scenario in terms of technical power potential, environmental suitability and socio-economic viability. The cost of each renewable SPP hybrid scenario was analyzed, as well as the annual energy production (AEP) for each scenario. The cost-benefit and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) were analyzed using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in the ranking of all scenarios. Results show that the optimum scenario is a 40 MW solar PV power plant, complemented with a 10 MW biomass power plant and with a substantial energy storage system (ESS). This configuration has the highest generation capacity, at over 1,200 PWh/yr, the lowest LCOE, at 11.2 US cents/kWh, and avoiding CO2eq emissions of nearly 38 ktonnes per year. The methodology developed, based on a cost-benefit analysis, levelized cost of energy and greenhouse gas emission reductions, can also be applied in other jurisdictions characterized by the availability of biomass, solar and wind resources for electricity generation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Energy storage; GIS-AHP; Hybrid; Power plant; Solar PV; Wind","Electric energy storage; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Site selection; Small power plants; Wind power; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Annual energy productions; Biomass power plants; Electricity generation; Generation capacity; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Response surface methodology; Substantial energy; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086761331

Carbon lost in form of carbon dioxide contributes to climate change corresponding to altered soil chemical properties and plant growth. Land-uses that minimize carbon loses are highly encouraged. Unfortunately, in the Kakamega-Nandi Forest Complex, the Kenyan government continues to promote shamba systems (now Plantation Establishment for Livelihood Improvement Scheme) where the forest adjacent communities are allocated bush land plots to provide land for small-scale agriculture, cash crop farming and planting of tree seedlings for a specified period of time inside the forest. Objective. This study analyzed six land-uses and their effect on the dynamics of soil chemical parameters using landsat images and recent soil geochemical surveys. Methodology. Land cover and vegetation changes were determined using a series of multispectral Landsat images. A total of seven sets of image datasets were downloaded from the Glovis web portal (http://glovis.usgs.gov/) for the years 1985 to 2015 with the cloud cover ranging from 1 to 10% taken in the dry season. The land-use/cover classification scheme adopted was based on expertise knowledge and literature of land-use/cover activities. Results. The results show that (i) small-small agriculture has increased while bush-land has decreased between 1985 and 2015; (ii) smallholder farming of maize, pasture and sugarcane depleted soil organic carbon whereas perennial tree plantations (regenerated forests) increased soil carbon stocks; (iii) nitrogen decreased in all tested land-uses except in maize plantations; (iv) phosphorus remained unchanged in all land-uses, potassium significantly decreased in tea plantations while sugarcane and regenerated forests land-uses had decreased soil calcium stocks. Implications. The study provides evidence for the review of the shamba system. Conclusion. The study has shown that land-use changes through the application of the shamba system alter the dynamics of soil chemical parameters key among them are soil organic carbon, nitrogen and calcium. Cultivation of annual crops decreases soil carbon stocks which may lead to an influx of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increased vulnerability to climate change. © 2020 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

These both drive woody plant state shifts, determining the location and the nature of the limit between open and tree or shrub-dominated landscapes. In order to adapt management to prevailing and future climate, we need to understand how browsing and climatic factors together affect the growth of plants at biome borders. To disentangle herbivory and climate effects, we combined long-term tree growth monitoring and dendroecology to investigate woody plant growth under different temperatures and red deer (Cervus elaphus) herbivory pressures at forest–moorland ecotones in the Scottish highlands. Reforestation and deer densities are core and conflicting management concerns in the area, and there is an urgent need for additional knowledge. We found that deer herbivory and climate had significant and interactive effects on tree growth: in the presence of red deer, pine (Pinus sylvestris) growth responded more strongly to annual temperature than in the absence of deer, possibly reflecting differing plant–plant competition and facilitation conditions. As expected, pine growth was negatively related to deer density and positively to temperature. However, at the tree population level, warming decreased growth when more than 60% of shoots were browsed. Heather (Calluna vulgaris) growth was negatively related to temperature and the direction of the response to deer switched from negative to positive when mean annual temperatures fell below 6.0°C. In addition, our models allow estimates to be made of how woody plant growth responds under specific combinations of temperature and herbivory, and show how deer management can be adapted to predicted climatic changes in order to more effectively achieve reforestation goals. Our results support the hypothesis that temperature and herbivory have interactive effects on woody plant growth, and thus accounting for just one of these two factors is insufficient for understanding plant growth mechanics at biome transitions. Furthermore, we show that climate-driven woody plant growth increases can be negated by herbivory. © 2020 The Authors.

Elevated engine-out temperatures and mass flows are effective at increasing the temperature of an aftertreatment system to enable efficient emission reduction. In this effort, experiments and analysis demonstrated that increasing the idle speed, while maintaining the same idle load, enables improved aftertreatment “warm-up” performance with engine-out NOx and particulate matter levels no higher than a state-of-the-art thermal calibration at conventional idle operation (800 rpm and 1.3 bar brake mean effective pressure). Elevated idle speeds of 1000 and 1200 rpm, compared to conventional idle at 800 rpm, realized 31%–51% increase in exhaust flow and 25 °C–40 °C increase in engine-out temperature, respectively. This study also demonstrated additional engine-out temperature benefits at all three idle speeds considered (800, 1000, and 1200 rpm, without compromising the exhaust flow rates or emissions, by modulating the exhaust valve opening timing. Early exhaust valve opening realizes up to ~51% increase in exhaust flow and 50 °C increase in engine-out temperature relative to conventional idle operation by forcing the engine to work harder via an early blowdown of the exhaust gas. This early blowdown of exhaust gas also reduces the time available for particulate matter oxidization, effectively limiting the ability to elevate engine-out temperatures for the early exhaust valve opening strategy. Alternatively, late exhaust valve opening realizes up to ~51% increase in exhaust flow and 91 °C increase in engine-out temperature relative to conventional idle operation by forcing the engine to work harder to pump in-cylinder gases across a smaller exhaust valve opening. In short, this study demonstrates how increased idle speeds, and exhaust valve opening modulation, individually or combined, can be used to significantly increase the “warm-up” rate of an aftertreatment system. © IMechE 2019.","exhaust valve opening modulation; gas exchange; high-speed idle; thermal management warm-up; variable geometry turbine; Variable valve actuation","Diesel engines; Emission control; Modulation; Particles (particulate matter); Speed; Temperature control; Exhaust valves; Gas exchange; High Speed; Variable geometry turbines; Variable valve actuation; Warm up; Exhaust gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076538495

To achieve climate change mitigation targets, reductions in energy-related and process emissions from industry are crucial. Methane pyrolysis could be used to produce low-carbon hydrogen (H2) for distributed energy end-uses and for industrial processes while generating a solid carbon product that can be permanently sequestered or sold as a manufacturing feedstock. This work analyzes methane pyrolysis via a molten media that continuously catalyzes the reaction and separates the produced carbon. We perform design optimization to evaluate the technoeconomics of this technology. We model a template small-scale 50 MW boiler (10.4 ktonne per year H2) as a base case for combustion applications, because such boilers are particularly challenging to decarbonize (are expensive to electrify and too small-scale for post-combustion CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS)). We find that the levelized cost of low-carbon energy is $11.09 per MMBTU, equivalent to an abatement cost of $115 per tonne CO2 avoided. In addition, we examine a policy-informed case study of H2 production at refineries subject to the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). In the absence of CO2 credits, the levelized cost of hydrogen is $1.75 per kg H2, but when LCFS credits are included at recent prices of $190 per tonne CO2 eq., we find a levelized cost of hydrogen as low as $0.39 per kg H2. Optimization was conducted under a range of economic sensitivities, finding that, as long as catalyst losses can be minimized, costs could be competitive with decarbonization methods such as CCS or other low-carbon H2 production pathways. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Boilers; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Combustion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Industrial emissions; Methane; Pyrolysis; Climate change mitigation; Distributed energies; Industrial processs; Industrial sector; Low carbon energies; Methane pyrolysis; Process emissions; Techno-Economic analysis; Costs; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; catalyst; climate change; combustion; hydrogen; methane; optimization; pyrolysis; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090086093

Methodological approaches to investigate the health impacts of air pollution on epidemics should differ from those used for chronic dis-eases, but the methods used in these studies have not been appraised critically. OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to identify and critique the methodological approaches of studies of air pollution on infections and mortality due to COVID-19 and to identify and critique the methodological approaches of similar studies concerning severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Published and unpublished papers of associations between air pollution and developing or dying from COVID-19 or SARS that were reported as of 10 May 2020 were identified through electronic databases, internet searches, and other sources. RESULTS: All six COVID-19 studies and two of three SARS studies reported positive associations. Two were time series studies that estimated associations between daily changes in air pollution, one was a cohort that assessed associations between air pollution and the secondary spread of SARS, and six were ecological studies that used area-wide exposures and outcomes. Common shortcomings included possible cross-level bias in ecological studies, underreporting of health outcomes, using grouped data, the lack of highly spatially resolved air pollution measures, inadequate control for confounding and evaluation of effect modification, not accounting for regional variations in the timing of outbreaks’ temporal changes in at-risk popu-lations, and not accounting for nonindependence of outcomes. DISCUSSION: Studies of air pollution and novel coronaviruses have relied mainly on ecological measures of exposures and outcomes and are suscepti-ble to important sources of bias. Although longitudinal studies with individual-level data may be imperfect, they are needed to adequately address this topic. The complexities involved in these types of studies underscore the need for careful design and for peer review. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

However, SC, to this day, is a widely implemented agricultural practice around the Amazon region due to its cultural, social, and economic relevance. In pristine indigenous communities, which have not experienced Western influence, SC will continue to be the main livelihood as part of the conservation of a patrimony of the humanity. Nevertheless, the main adverse effects of SC on ecosystems (i.e. forest degradation), particularly on Amazon forests, are our grounds to justify the implementation of public policies aiming to the substitution by agroforestry systems (AFS) as a sustainable food system. In this context, we propose linking AFS to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+ strategies) in shifting cultivation landscapes where there is high local-scale expansion and intensification of SC. AFS has higher potential as sustainable food systems for degraded forest rehabilitation and reduction of the expansion and intensification of SC. Consequently, AFS reduce deforestation of new forest areas for SC, meanwhile, sustainable management of second-growth forests could also be implemented through improved fallows, increasing the planting density of long-cycle agroforestry tree species. AFS should be implemented in local communities, in particular, those undergoing human-modified Amazon landscapes, where there is a high intensification of SC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon stocks; Complex agroforestry; Forest recovery; Old-growth forest; Second-growth forest; Slash and burn",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085874478

Here, Vilá et al. show how Ni impurities in electrolytes locally incorporate into the solid-electrolyte interphase of Li-metal anodes. These Ni impurities impair the electron and Li-ion transport properties, leading to premature failure. © 2020 The AuthorsDissolution of transition metals from high-voltage cathodes and their incorporation into the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) of carbonaceous anodes drastically reduces the lifetime of Li-ion batteries. The effects of dissolved transition metals on the performance of carbonaceous anodes are well characterized; however, the impact on Li-metal anode performance and the SEI is rarely considered. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to reveal the impact of dissolved Ni on the SEI formation process on Li-metal. A link between Ni incorporation into the SEI and the failure of Li-metal batteries is established. We find that Ni is reduced into its metallic state and incorporates as small clusters into the SEI, locally changing the chemistry and nanostructure of the SEI. These chemical and nanostructure changes locally modify the Li-ion and electron transport properties of the SEI, accelerating electrolyte decomposition, increasing formation of “dead” Li, and ultimately causing failure. © 2020 The Authors","battery failure; cryogenic electron microscopy; dead lithium; electrolyte decomposition; lithium metal anode; nickel dissolution; SEI chemistry; solid-electrolyte interphase; transition metal reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100545054

The herein developed protocol is based on state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations and excited-state decay rate theories (i.e., thermal vibration correlation function formalism), along with appropriate kinetic models which include all relevant electronic states. This protocol is validated for a series of azulene derivatives. For this series, we have computed absorption and emission spectra for both their first and second excited states, their radiative and nonradiative rates, as well as fluorescence yields from the two different excited states. All the studied azulene derivatives are predicted to exclusively display anomalous anti-Kasha S2 emission. A quantitative agreement for the herein computed excited-state spectra, lifetimes, and fluorescence quantum yields is obtained with respect to the experimental values. Given the increasing interest in anti-Kasha emitters, we foresee that the herein developed computational protocol can be used to prescreen dyes with the desired aforementioned anomalous photoluminescence properties.

The combustion and emission formation processes are closely correlated to the intake manifold O2 concentration. Consequently, the performance of the engine controllers can be improved if a model-based or sensor-based estimation of the O2 concentration is available. The paper addresses the modeling of the O2 concentration in a turbocharged diesel engine. Dynamic models, compared to generally employed steady state maps, capture the dynamic effects occurring over transients, when the major deviations from the stationary maps are found. Dynamic models positively affect the control system making it more effective and, exploiting information coming from sensors, they provide a more robust prediction performance. Firstly, a Nonlinear Output Error model (NOE), with simulation focus, fed with four inputs is presented. The considered nonlinear function set is the one of neural networks. The inputs are engine BMEP, engine RPM and EGR and VGT valves position. Two distinct datasets are used for training and validation of the NOE model. These sets are generated using GT-Power simulation software implementing a fine model of the engine, previously validated on experimental measurements taken on the real engine. Besides the transient validation, the NOE model was tested against GT-Power outputs on step tests involving the EGR and VGT actuators. At last the network output is compared with an O2 steady state map over a transient in normal and faulty conditions. The performance of the model is satisfactory in both conditions. Secondly, the potential benefits of installing an O2 sensor in the intake manifold is presented: a Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous input (NARX) model is considered and compared to the previously investigated NOE. The results prove that, exploiting the output coming from the O2 sensor, the model prediction capability significantly improves. © 2020SAE International.

Here, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to collect time-series of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 images and employed a phenology-based threshold classification method (PBTC) to map the natural bamboo distribution and estimate carbon stocks in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. We processed 337 collections of Landsat 8 OLI for phenological assessment and generated 121 phenological profiles of the average vegetation index for three vegetation land cover categories from 2015 to 2018. After determining the minimum and maximum threshold values for bamboo during the leaf-shedding phenology stage, the PBTC method was applied to produce a seasonal composite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for Landsat collections and assess the bamboo distributions in 2015 and 2018. Bamboo distributions in 2019 were then mapped by applying the EVI phenological threshold values for 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery by accessing 442 tiles. The overall Landsat 8 OLI bamboo maps for 2015 and 2018 had user’s accuracies (UAs) of 86.6% and 87.9% and producer’s accuracies (PAs) of 95.7% and 97.8%, respectively, and a UA of 86.5% and PA of 91.7% were obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery for 2019. Accordingly, carbon stocks of natural bamboo by district in Siem Reap at the province level were estimated. Emission reductions from the protection of natural bamboo can be used to offset 6% of the carbon emissions from tourists who visit this tourism-destination province. It is concluded that a combination of GEE and PBTC and the increasing availability of remote sensing data make it possible to map the natural distribution of bamboo and carbon stocks. © 2020 by the authors.

Until recently, little research has existed on how these technologies can be specifically applied to the monitoring of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) activities. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, we applied the recently developed phenology-based threshold classification method (PBTC) for detecting and mapping forest cover and carbon stock changes in Siem Reap province, Cambodia, between 1990 and 2018. The obtained PBTC maps were validated using Google Earth high resolution historical imagery and reference land cover maps by creating 3771 systematic 5 × 5 km spatial accuracy points. The overall cumulative accuracy of this study was 92.1% and its cumulative Kappa was 0.9, which are sufficiently high to apply the PBTC method to detect forest land cover change. Accordingly, we estimated the carbon stock changes over a 28-year period in accordance with the Good Practice Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We found that 322,694 ha of forest cover was lost in Siem Reap, representing an annual deforestation rate of 1.3% between 1990 and 2018. This loss of forest cover was responsible for carbon emissions of 143,729,440 MgCO2 over the same period. If REDD+ activities are implemented during the implementation period of the Paris Climate Agreement between 2020 and 2030, about 8,256,746 MgCO2 of carbon emissions could be reduced, equivalent to about USD 6-115 million annually depending on chosen carbon prices. Our case study demonstrates that the GEE and PBTC method can be used to detect and monitor forest cover change and carbon stock changes in the tropics with high accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.","Emission reductions; Forest carbon stocks; Google earth engine; Landsat TM; Landsat-8; PBTC; REDD+; Tropical forestry","Biology; Carbon; Climate change; Deforestation; Engines; Magnesium compounds; Assessment and monitoring; Classification methods; Cloud computing platforms; Forest cover change; Forest degradation; Forest-land cover change; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Reducing emissions; Mapping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092278141

In this context, it is important to minimize the cylinder bore distortions in cold and hot conditions. The cold bore distortion is primarily due to the assembly forces applied by the cylinder head bolts whereas the hot distortion is a resultant of local metal temperatures and structural rigidity. The present work describes the extreme optimization techniques used to reduce the bore distortion of a modern high power-density (60 kW / lit) diesel engine, Moreover, the benefits of reducing the bore distortion are quantified in terms of cylinder system friction, blowby rate, oil consumption (OC) and ash loading rate of the diesel particulate filter (DPF). An optimized torque plate honing is used to reduce the bore distortion in cold conditions. However, an extreme optimization of the cylinder bore structure and water jacket design was needed to control the hot bore distortion. With the reduced bore distortion, the engine could be optimized to have a reduced tangential force. The cumulative tangential force of all the piston rings could be reduced from 37 N to 23.5 N which could result in a significant reduction in the cylinder system friction. Moreover, the engine level measurements with and without the torque plate honing confirm that a significant reduction in blowby rate (approximately 20 %) and oil consumption (approximately 25 %) could be achieved with the torque plate honing. The results were found to be consistent with the vehicle level results of the oil consumption (g/km). Furthermore, the reduction in oil consumption could benefit the ash loading behaviour of the DPF. With the low bore distortion (LBD) engine, the ash loading rate of the DPF could be reduced significantly which is extremely important to have consistently higher regeneration intervals throughout the life of the vehicle. Thus, the development approach to have low bore distortion has resulted in multiple benefits and hence it is found to be useful in developing diesel engines with compliance to future regulations. © 2020 Mahindra & Mahindra.",,"Cylinder heads; Deflected boreholes; Diesel engines; Friction; Honing; Manufacture; Plates (structural components); Development approach; Diesel particulate filters; Emission regulation; High power density; Metal temperature; Optimization techniques; Structural rigidity; Tangential force; Loading",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093816372

The Brazilian scenario exhibits unique features, such as a powerful automotive sector with large investments in internal combustion engine technology and a well-established biofuels market based on flex-fuel technology. Although energy security, urban air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, and technological advantage have been common drivers for the adoption of electric vehicles worldwide, the Brazilian immediate motivations are dierent, and the biofuels business ecosystem is likely to transform the path for electromobility. High tag price and public charging infrastructure absence have deeply discouraged electric vehicles adoption. A lack of regulation and a national consensus about the role of electric vehicles have been notorious. In fact, only in 2018 did the electricity regulatory agency (ANEEL) issue a resolution permitting the sale of electricity for recharging. The objective of this review was to create an outlook of the Brazilian transportation landscape. We identified relevant players, public charging infrastructure initiatives, market and other barriers, and regulation actions by consulting academic literature, media sources, and reports. We do not claim to predict the evolution of electrification. Instead, we aim to consolidate the information which can be used for decision support or strategy definition among entrepreneurs or policymakers. The main findings here are the necessity of a model for electrification able to create a synergy with biofuels and the urgency of having well-defined policies on what Brazil wants from electromobility. © 2020 by the author.","Battery electric vehicles; Biofuels; Brazil; Charging infrastructure; Open standards","Automotive batteries; Biofuels; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Decision support systems; Electric utilities; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Academic literature; Automotive sector; Business ecosystem; Charging infrastructures; Decision supports; National consensus; Regulatory agencies; Urban air pollution; Battery electric vehicles",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091886083

ANME-1 are, however, often found as single cells, or only loosely aggregated with SRB, suggesting they perform a form of AOM independent of sulfate reduction. Oxidized metals and humic substances have been suggested as potential electron acceptors for ANME, but up to now, AOM linked to reduction of these compounds has only been shown for the ANME-2 and ANME-3 clades. Here, the effect of the electron acceptors anthraquinone-disulfonate (AQDS), a humic acids analog, and Fe3+ on anaerobic methane oxidation were assessed by incubation experiments with anoxic Black Sea water containing ANME-1b. Incubation experiments with13 C-methane and AQDS showed a stimulating effect of AQDS on methane oxidation. Fe3+ enhanced the ANME-1b abundance but did not substantially increase methane oxidation. Sodium molybdate, which was added as an inhibitor of sulfate reduction, surprisingly enhanced methane oxidation, possibly related to the dominant abundance of Sulfurospirillum in those incubations. The presented data suggest the potential involvement of ANME-1b in AQDS-enhanced anaerobic methane oxidation, possibly via electron shuttling to AQDS or via interaction with other members of the microbial community. © 2020 by the authors.

The procedure uses production and use volumes from registration dossiers and combines these with Specific Environmental Release Category data. The procedure was applied in a case study. Emission estimations were made for chemicals registered under the European Union chemicals regulations for industrial chemicals (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals [REACH]) and for the active ingredients of medicines and crop protection products. Emissions themselves cannot be validated. Instead, emission estimates were followed by multimedia fate modeling and mixture toxic pressure modeling to arrive at predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and toxic pressures for a typical European water body at steady state, which were compared with other such data. The results show that screening-level assessments could be performed, and yielded estimates of emissions, PECs, and mixture toxic pressures of chemicals used in Europe. Steady-state PECs agreed fairly well with measured concentrations. The mixture toxic pressure at steady state suggests the presence of effects in aquatic species assemblages, whereby few compounds dominate the predicted impact. The study shows that our screening-level emission estimation procedure is sufficiently accurate and precise to serve as a basis for assessment of chemical pollution in aquatic ecosystems at the scale of river catchments. Given a recognized societal need to develop methods for realistic, cumulative exposures, the emission assessment procedure can assist in the prioritization of chemicals in safety policies (such as the European Union REACH regulation), where “possibility to be used safely” needs to be demonstrated, and environmental quality policies (such as the European Union Water Framework Directive), where “good environmental quality” needs to be reached.

Air quality standards for Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) are commonly exceeded in Europe, particularly in urban areas with high density of traffic. Road transport contributed to 39% of NOx emissions, and 11% of PM emissions in the European Union (EU) in 2017. Measurements with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) showed that most Euro 5 and Euro 6b diesel vehicles emitted significantly more NOx on the road than their permissible limit in the laboratory type-approval test. In that context, EU Real Driving Emissions (EU-RDE) regulation aims at securing low on-road emissions of light duty vehicles under normal conditions of use. This paper assesses the tailpipe emissions performance of Euro 6d-TEMP gasoline and diesel passenger cars, type-approved after the entry into force of the RDE regulation in September 2017. Vehicles were tested by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the in-house research center of the European Commission, on RDE-compliant and non-compliant tests with an AVL-MOVE PEMS. Gaseous emissions (NO, NO2, NOx, CO, CO2) and particle number (PN) emissions are discussed for the complete test and the respective urban, rural, and motorway sections, with emphasis on cold-start emissions. The relationship between emissions and driving dynamics is also presented. Our results indicate that in order to meet the emission limits under the wide range of RDE driving conditions, vehicle manufacturers have been forced to implement performant after-treatment systems for NOx and PN, namely Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts and particle filters. It can be expected that the progressive fleet renewal from pre-RDE to post-RDE vehicles in Europe will help mitigate urban pollution and decrease the frequency of exceedances of the air quality standards. © 2020 SAE International.

A reliable EI is an important prerequisite for the identification of key emissions sources, as an input to modelling atmospheric transport and impacts of air pollutants, and the identification of appropriate mitigation policies. The publicly-available Global Atmospheric Pollution Forum Emission Inventory (GAPF-EI) tool meets the need of LMICs for a user-friendly tool allowing in-country practitioners to compile their own EIs. The species covered are SO2, NOX, CO, NMVOC, CH4, NH3, PM10, PM 2.5, black carbon, organic carbon and CO2. Output from the tool can therefore support the development of integrated air quality and climate change mitigation strategies. This tool incorporates default emission factors and inventory methods conforming with internationally recognised approaches. The GAPF-EI tool enables emissions to be estimated for technologies or practices that are often of little or no relevance to developed countries, but may represent key sources in LMICs. This paper describes the GAPF-EI tool and its application to Côte d'Ivoire where emissions from traditional biomass cookstoves, vegetation fires, traditional charcoal manufacture, road transport (including dust from unpaved roads) and open burning of municipal solid waste were found to be particularly important components of the inventory. The application of the GAPF-EI approach to Côte d'Ivoire has demonstrated its utility in addressing sources of particular relevance to LMICs in addition to providing a user-friendly, transparent and flexible EI preparation tool. © 2020","Air pollution; Climate change; Côte d'Ivoire; Emission inventory tool; Traditional technologies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086599487

Among those, the Neotropical alpine grassland above the tree line (c. 2,800 m), known as Páramo, is the fastest evolving biodiversity hotspot on earth, and one of the most threatened. Yet, predicting climate responses of typically slow-growing, long-lived plant linages in this unique high mountain ecosystem remains challenging. Here we coupled climate sensitivity modeling and adaptive potential inferences to efficiently assess climate vulnerability of Espeletia, Páramo’s most iconic, predominant and rapidly evolving plant complex. In order to estimate climate sensitivity, we first modeled the distribution of 28 Espeletia taxa under a niche conservatism scenario using altitude and five current (1970–2000) and future (2050 RCP 8.5) bioclimatic variables across 36 different Páramo complexes in the northern Andes (49% of the world’s Páramo area). As an alternative to range shifts via migration, we also computed the adaptive capacity of these Páramo complexes by considering three enhancing factors of the biodiversity’s adaptive potential as well as three environmental limiting factors of the populations’ plastic response. These predictors showed that diverse Páramos in the Eastern Cordillera were more vulnerable likely because the counteracting effects of the adaptive potential (r = −0.93 ± 0.01) were not sufficient to buffer higher distribution losses (r = 0.39 ± 0.01). Agriculture (r = −0.48 ± 0.01), mining (r = −0.36 ± 0.01), and rural population density (r = −0.23 ± 0.01) also weakened the adaptive capacity. These results speak for a limited persistence via migration in the short-term responses of Espeletia to climate change, even though the past population dynamics in concert with glacial cycling is indicative of a predominant role of range shifts. Furthermore, changing climate, together with a general inability to adapt, may eventually constrain the rapid diversification in the Espeletia complex. Our integrative modeling illustrates how future climate may impact plant populations in a mega diverse and highly threatened ecosystem such as the Páramo, and encourages carrying out similar estimates in diverse plant complexes across other high mountain and island-like ecosystems. © Copyright © 2020 Valencia, Mesa, León, Madriñán and Cortés.","adaptation; biodiversity hotspots; Espeletiinae Cuatrec.

Concerns have been risen for chromium effects on human and aquatic life because chromium has been accused for genotoxicity and carcinogenesis. Metals and their ions or complexes (and thus chromium substances) are included in the indicative list of main pollutants (Annex VIII of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)). Biological effects of chromium are strongly depended on chromium speciation. No universal CrIII or CrVI discharge limits to the aquatic environment have been suggested by the EU. International bodies within the EU, such as the Helsinki Commission and the Oslo-Paris Convention, have issued recommendations on chromium discharge levels. National CrVI and CrIII discharge limits vary in each EU Member State with respect to the receiving water body (marine water, lake, river, sewer system). The maximum discharge limit to the aquatic environment in EU is 1 and 5 mg L−1 for CrVI and Crtotal, respectively. The present work summarizes EU legislation, with respect to the discharge limits to the aquatic environment for CrVI and CrIII. EU national limits that are currently effective are presented and compared to the limits in other parts of the world, such as Australia, Asia, USA, Latin America and South Africa. It is wise that future perspective of chromium policy should differentiate between CrIII and CrVI discharge limits to the aquatic environment, as analytical techniques become more sensitive and chromium speciation specific, and environmental awareness rises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chromium; Discharge limit; Emission; Environmental quality standards; Legislation; Regulation","Environmental regulations; Laws and legislation; Trace elements; Water conservation; Water pollution; Aquatic environments; Biologically inert; Chromium emissions; Chromium speciation; Environmental awareness; Future perspectives; Receiving water bodies; Water Framework Directives; Chromium; chromium; chromium; ion; trace element; aquatic environment; aquatic organism; chromium; emission; genotoxicity; health impact; pollution effect; aquatic environment; Asia; Australia; Australia and New Zealand; comparative study; ecotoxicity; environmental policy; Europe; European Union; heavy metal poisoning; human; international organization; Review; South Africa; South and Central America; United States; World Health Organization; environmental monitoring; Europe; river; water pollutant; Africa; Australia; Europe; Latin America; South Africa; United States; Asia; Australia; Chromium; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Ions; Rivers; South Africa; Trace Elements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084058960

We employed hydrothermal treatment to remove Se element and upgrade low rank Huainan coal at 200–300 °C. Pyrolysis temperature given during coal treatment was evaluated to simulate coal transformation into high-rank industrial grade by emphasizing O/C ratio, removal of oxygen functional groups and moisture and chemical structure stability. Following hydrothermal treatment, different characterization techniques including XPS, FTIR, XRD and Raman spectroscopy were used to determine the chemical structure of coal. Findings revealed that hydrothermal treatment process has an important influence on the crystalline structures of low rank coals. The results of XRD and Raman spectroscopy analysis demonstrated much graphitized and aromatic microcrystalline structure. The chemical structure developed was orderly, stable and dense. Selenium XPS spectra comprising of 3D peaks has confirmed several oxidation states including selenide, selenates and oxide species. The removal proportion of Se was significant and increased up to 50.7% with increased HTT temperature (300 °C). This study provides some unique findings pertaining to solubility of sub-critical water and rate of change in pyrolysis temperature as determinant factors in the removal of Se. Our simulation model further concludes that transformation of low rank coal into high rank is a function of temperature treatment coupled with optimization of fixed carbon. We infer that hydrothermal treatment derived coal possesses sufficient lucid attributes to be considered as environmentally safe fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal gasification; Hydrothermal treatment; Low-rank coal; Selenium emission","Chemical stability; Emission control; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Microcrystals; Pyrolysis; Raman spectroscopy; Selenium; Structure (composition); X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Characterization techniques; Crystalline structure; Environmental limitations; Hydrothermal treatments; Microcrystalline structures; Oxygen functional groups; Pyrolysis temperature; Temperature treatments; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085617789

Spanning 20 years, the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) has been facilitating the research community to provide regional and grassroots results and solutions, while acting as a mechanism to encourage science-policy-stakeholder dialogue. This paper outlines the relevance of APN projects to IPCC policymaking by laying out knowledge products and lessons learned from the projects. It also narrates how regional research and capacity building assist in responding to the increasing urgency across climate change and the SDGs. A synthesis of project-generated knowledge was garnered from research and capacity development studies conducted under the auspices of APN to identify their scope and level of policy relevance. A combined typology and solution scanning with Likert scale as relevance rating was employed to categorize contribution against key themes of the IPCC sixth assessment report. Findings suggest 115 distinct and relevant projects completed mostly in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Temperate East Asia, with many of them asserting community-based adaptation and mitigation surrounding issues on ecosystems and biodiversity, extreme weather events, water-food-energy nexus, sustainable waste management, and climate education. Findings also show 163 knowledge products in which majority of them (66.87%) were peer-reviewed journal articles, 11.04% were reports, 7.98% were policy briefs, 6.75% were guidelines and tools, 4.91% were books and 2.45% were perspectives and opinions. With the evolving synergies between global climate targets and the SDGs, it is recommended that APN solidify its role in science-policy partnerships and networking by creating improved interlinkages for disseminating knowledge gaps filled and in replicating lessons learned and best practices found in APN knowledge products. In addition to science-policy dialogues and output synthesis, a regular review of APN research and capacity development outcomes will help in realizing these important aspects toward wider policy impact. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","IPCC; Knowledge gaps; Policy impact; Regional research; SDGs","water; capacity building; climate change; education; global change; global climate; Article; Asia; biodiversity; capacity building; climate change; ecosystem; extreme weather; global climate; human; Likert scale; priority journal; publication; research; waste management; ecosystem; Far East; Southeast Asia; Far East; South Asia; Southeast Asia; Asia; Asia, Southeastern; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085953756

Differently from traditional vehicles, they operate intermittently and generally follow routine driving cycles. In this paper, we model a 15-kW electric utility vehicle, adopting a backward-looking approach, widely used in literature to estimate the range of electric cars. The model requires a limited number of data, either supplied by the vehicle manufacturer or found in literature, as in case of the induction motor/generator efficiency and of the battery Peukert coefficient. The model can be used to assess the possibility of the vehicle to complete an assigned mission, as well as to optimize the vehicle's design and architecture. The model is validated on GPS data obtained through an experimental campaign where the electric utility vehicle was driven to depletion considering different routes, including the effect of slopes. A satisfactory correspondence with the experimental data was observed with maximum difference in the simulated average energy consumption lower than about 8%. Results of the simulations show that the range of the electric utility vehicle is about 110 km on urban flat cycle while it significantly reduces when slopes are included in portions of the routes. © 2020SAE International.

Worldwide data manifest large disparities in composition (10–20% hydrocarbons, 5–20% solids -including heavy metals- and water) and heating values. Treatment by landfarming/bioremediation, hazardous waste incineration, anaerobic digestion or disposal in hazardous waste landfills bears high costs and environmental impacts. Substitution of fossil fuels (petcoke) by refinery sludges in cement plants is investigated. Main impacts are quantified: energy efficiency and clinker production level, plant operation and capacity constraints, halogen presence in plant circuits, inclusion of alkalis and heavy metals in cement and atmospheric emissions. It is found that clinker losses may exceed one tonne clinker/tonne sludge. Environmental concerns, mainly increased NOx and Hg emissions, may restrict substitution. Guidelines are obtained for identifying efficient blends with renewable biogenic fuels (urban or agro-industrial biowaste). Blends of sludge from local refineries with renewable fuels are assessed for a local cement plant using about 1.65 × 105 tonnes fossil fuels/year (70% petcoke, 30% coal) to produce 1.5 × 106 tonnes clinker/year.

Commercial transport, and especially last mile delivery is expected to grow because of the rise of e-commerce. In this frame, electric light commercial vehicles (eLCVs) can be a promising low-emission solution. Literature holistically analysing the potential of eLCVs as well as related support policies is sparse. This paper attempts to close this research gap. To this aim, the total cost of ownership (TCO) comparisons for eLCVs and benchmark vehicles are performed and support measures that target the improvement of the eLCV TCO are analysed. Various eLCV deployment scenarios until 2030 are explored and their impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutant emissions as well as pollutant concentrations are calculated. It is found that while in several European Union (EU) countries eLCVs are already cost competitive, because of fiscal support, some remaining market barriers need to be overcome to pave the way to mass market deployment of eLCVs. High penetration of eLCVs alone can lead to a reduction of total transport CO2 emissions by more than 3% by 2030. For pollutant emissions, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), the reduction would be equal or even higher. In the case of PM, this can translate to reductions in concentrations by nearly 2% in several urban areas by 2030. Carefully designed support policies could help to ensure that the potential of eLCVs as a low-emission alternative is fully leveraged in the EU. © 2020 The Authors","eLCV; Electric vehicles; Emissions mitigation; Incentives; Last mile delivery; Total cost of ownership","Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Electric lighting; Light weight vehicles; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Commercial transport; Deployment scenarios; European Union countries; Light commercial vehicles; Particulate Matter; Pollutant concentration; Total cost of ownership; Transport emissions; Commercial vehicles; air quality; atmospheric pollution; benchmarking; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); electric vehicle; European Union; numerical model; traffic emission; transportation system; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087587869

After the reorganization of the RFD in 2002, the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation of Thailand, which then was separated from the RFD, has carried on this project and added the uniformly fixed grids ranging from 2.5 km × 2.5 km to 10 km × 10 km over the entire protected areas in Thailand. Throughout three project phases (2001–present), there are over 3,150 plots collected from 59 provinces, while the remaining 18 provinces do not have monitoring plots because of either the security issue or no forest covers. There were, based on altogether 24,605 occurrence records of trees with a diameter greater than 4.5 cm at breath high level from 363 species from 81 families and 222 genera.

The epidemiology of plant viruses will be altered in the future as a result of climate change. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, increased temperature, changes to water availability and more frequent extreme weather events will have direct and indirect effects on plant viruses through changes in hosts and vectors. Predicted climatic changes will affect the distribution and survival of plant viruses and their vectors, which are expected to increase in many geographic regions. Furthermore, climate change can affect the virulence and pathogenicity of plant viruses, consequently increasing the frequency and scale of disease outbreaks.

Methods: The measurement results obtained by the Regional Environmental Protection Inspectorate (REPI) in Kraków and our deposited particulate-matter (PM) analysis, as well as United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) methodology of risk assessment were used in the study. Results: Annual pollutant contents kept decreasing, with the exception of O3. However, the permissible annual levels were exceeded in the cases of PM10, PM2.5, and NO2. Increased contents of SO2, CO, C6H6, PM10, and PM2.5, as well as of As, Pb, Cd, Ni, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM particles during winter months indicated that house heating was the source of pollution. Due to no significant change in the monthly NO2 contents, this measurement was used as an indicator of traffic sources of pollution. In winter months, the allowable 24 h PM2.5 and PM10 contents were constantly exceeded. PM was identified as the most significant air pollutant. Enrichment factors revealed that deposited PM was enriched with heavy metals. The potential ecological risk (ERI) was determined to be very high for Cd, considerable for Zn, and low for As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Tl. The total non-carcinogenic risk indices (HQ) for both adults (HQ = 15.0) and children (HQ = 26.4) exceeded the acceptable value of 1. The total carcinogenic risk indices (CR) for both adults (CR = 1.51 × 10−4) and children (CR = 1.77 × 10−4) exceeded the acceptable level of 1 × 10−4. Conclusions: In the years 2005–2020, a general decreasing tendency of annual pollutant contents was observed. However, the permissible contaminant contents were still exceeded. PM2.5, BaP, PM10, and NO2 were determined as the most dangerous pollutants in inhalational pathway. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, understanding whether dispersal strategies are associated with climate is of utmost importance, particularly in areas greatly exposed to climate change. We examined alpine plant communities located in the mountain summits of the tropical Andes across a 4,000-km latitudinal gradient. We investigated species dispersal strategies and tested their association with climatic conditions and their evolutionary history. We used dispersal-related traits (dispersal mode and growth form) to characterize dispersal strategies for 486 species recorded on 49 mountain summits. Then we analysed the phylogenetic signal of traits and investigated the association between dispersal traits, phylogeny, climate and space using structural equation modelling and fourth-corner analysis together with RLQ ordination. A median of 36% species in the communities was anemochorous (wind-dispersed) and herbaceous. This dispersal strategy was followed by the barochory-herb combination (herbaceous with unspecialized seeds, dispersed by gravity) with a median of 26.3% species in the communities. The latter strategy was common among species with distributions restricted to alpine environments. While trait states were phylogenetically conserved, they were significantly associated with a temperature gradient. Low minimum air temperatures, found at higher latitudes/elevations, were correlated with the prevalence of barochory and the herb growth form, traits that are common among Caryophyllales, Brassicaceae and Poaceae. Milder temperatures, found at lower latitudes/elevations, were associated with endozoochorous, shrub species mostly from the Ericaceae family. Anemochorous species were found all along the temperature gradient, possibly due to the success of anemochorous Compositae species in alpine regions. We also found that trait state dominance was more associated with the climatic conditions of the summit than with community phylogenetic structure. Although the evolutionary history of the tropical Andean flora has also shaped dispersal strategies, our results suggest that the environment had a more predominant role. Synthesis. We showed that dispersal-related traits are strongly associated with a gradient of minimum air temperatures in the Andes. Global warming may weaken this key filter at tropical alpine summits, potentially altering community dispersal strategies in this region and thus, plant community structure and composition. © 2020 The Authors.

Dunant, Thiais, 94320, France","A study of the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) at Pd100−xCux solid solution type nanoalloys is presented. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry are used in combination with a cavity microelectrode (CME) for the first time. Low-distorted voltammetric signals obtained with the CME evidence that for alloys with low or moderate Cu content (up to 50 at%) the typical CO2RR inhibition peak, related to CO blocking Pd active sites, becomes a current plateau. Interestingly, the plateau height matches the theoretical value corresponding to the steady state current of a microdisc. This fact indicates a better tolerance of Pd100−xCux towards CO poisoning and also the attainment of a pseudo-steady state where mass transport should be controlled by diffusion. The synergy between Cu and Pd is thus established for the first time at the level of the voltammograms. The chronoamperometric responses exhibit three well defined regions corresponding to (1) double layer charging and diffusion/reaction establishment, (2) beginning of CO poisoning by formation of a CO adlayer and (3) final collapse of the catalytic activity at a critical time, tc, which depends directly on the bimetallic composition. A plot of tc vs. Pd content exhibits a clear volcano shape, from which ~ Pd72Cu28 is identified as a close to optimal composition in terms of CO tolerance and Pd35Cu65 as the composition from which the advantage of alloying Pd with Cu is lost. An in-depth analysis of the I/V response and its evolution with composition and time is performed in the CO2RR and CO stripping regions. As a result, the possibility of developing a method to further increase the catalyst lifetime based on periodical releasing of “CO-like” intermediates by CO stripping is proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cavity microelectrode; Chronoamperometry; CO stripping; Cyclic voltammetry; Solid solution nanoalloy","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Chronoamperometry; Copper; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrolytic reduction; Microelectrodes; Pollution control; Bimetallic compositions; Carbon dioxide reduction; Cavity microelectrode; Chronoamperometric response; Double layer charging; Electrochemical reductions; Electrochemical studies; Palladium nanoparticles; Palladium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087870951

Sweden has established ambitious energy goals, which include CO2 emissions reduction in the transport sector and high integration of renewables in the electricity sector. Coupling the two can be an enabling force towards fossil freedom. An increased share of electric vehicles is therefore a promising solution in this regard. However, there are challenges concerning the impact that a surge of electric vehicles would have on the electric infrastructure. Moreover, in Stockholm there is a shortage of power capacity due to limitations in the national transmission infrastructure, which further aggravates the situation. This paper develops a scenario-based simulation study to evaluate the impact of electric vehicle loads on the distribution grid of a Stockholm neighborhood. In this process, limiting factors and bottlenecks in the network were identified as being related to the peak power and transformer capacities for the years of 2025 and 2031. Two load management strategies and their potential to mitigate the power peaks generated from uncontrolled charging were investigated for the critical years. © 2020 by the authors.","Distribution system; Elecric vehicles; Flexible demand; Load management; Smart charging","Electric power plant loads; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Vehicle-to-grid; Electric infrastructures; Integration of renewables; Load management strategies; Local distribution networks; Scenario-based simulations; Transformer capacity; Uncontrolled charging; Vehicle penetration; Electric load distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092430346

Results show that, on a per capita basis, inhabitants of medium-large municipalities emit fewer carbon emissions than those settled in small ones (between 0.34 and 0.54 tCO2/cap depending on the year studied). This carbon unbalance is mainly explained by the higher direct carbon footprints of dwellers who reside in small municipalities and, in special, in rural zones. Furthermore, applying inequality measures through a consumption-based carbon footprint Gini coefficient, we show that both income and CO2 emissions inequality are lower in small municipalities. In the light of the findings, in Spain, the application of a carbon pricing on direct and indirect carbon footprints will be regressive, disproportionally affecting people of small municipalities and rural areas. Accordingly, household carbon inequalities must be contemplated to avoid poorly designed climate change mitigation policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Carbon pricing; Climate change; Inequality; Input-output analysis","Climate change; Emission control; Rural areas; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxation; Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Gini coefficients; Input output model; Paper analysis; Rural residential; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084743141

Understanding vegetation change and its response to climate variables and human activities are key tasks in predicting future environmental changes, climate changes and ecosystem evolution. This paper aims to explore the impact of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) water impoundment on the vegetation–climate response relationship in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) and its surrounding region. Firstly, based on the SPOT/VEGETATION NDVI and ERA5 reanalysis datasets, the correlation between climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) and NDVI was analyzed by using partial correlation coefficient method. Secondly, nonlinear fitting method was used to fit the mapping relationship between NDVI and climatic factors. Then, the residual analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of TGR impoundment on vegetation–climate response relationship. Finally, sensitivity index (SI), sensitivity variation index (SVI) and difference index (DI) were defined to quantify the variation of vegetation–climate response relationship before and after water impoundment. The results show that water impoundment might have some impacts on the response of vegetation–climate, which gradually reduced with increasing distance from the channel; comparing with the residual analysis method, the SI and DI index methods are more intuitive, and combining these two methods may provide new ideas for the study of the impact of human activities on vegetation. © 2020 by the authors.

The results show that alternative systems proposed will result in lower GWP than the existing waste management strategy. The MFA results reveal that the final weights of solid waste ending up in a landfill are 98.8, 101.9, 68.2, and 44.8 t yr- 1 for scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Increased rates of landfill diversion by increased recycling, composting, and incineration decreased the quantity of solid waste disposed to the landfill and improved the environmental profile of the park waste management system. The LCA results found landfilling to be the dominant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) burdens, while waste recycling was found to result in the reduction of GHG.

However, urgent social, economic, and environmental issues such as carbon sequestration, drought mitigation, and nutrient management are forcing us to seek answers to questions using incomplete soil data and/or inappropriate soil information. The United States (US) Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS), Soil and Plant Science Division has launched Soils2026, an ambitious initiative to provide a new inventory of soils and provisional ecological sites for all areas of the United States by 2026. Soils2026 aims to provide basic soil and ecological site information that will be useful to land managers, ecologists, modelers, and other natural resource professionals. This effort will rely heavily on digital soil mapping (DSM) to produce the next generation of raster-based soil information products for the interpretation of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties across the United States. The USDA-NRCS Digital Soil Mapping Focus Team was formed to support Soils2026 and includes collaborating members from the National Cooperative Soil Survey representing the NRCS, US Geological Survey, USDA Forest Service, West Virginia University, and New Mexico State University. The DSM Focus Team is applying the latest DSM methods to produce continuous soil property predictions and estimates of uncertainty for all areas of the United States. Initially, the 30-m resolution products will include predictions for 12 key soil properties at six depth intervals, conforming to GlobalSoilMap specifications, with the option to expand properties or add class predictions as user needs demonstrate. Interpretations for use and management will be derived from the continuous properties products and provided to users. Fundamental pedology and communication of soil knowledge will be the primary focus of this effort, yielding a framework for delivery of seamless raster-based soils data for all areas of the United States on yearly cycles. This framework will foster an environment of continuous improvement and support a complete, consistent, correct, comprehensive, and current inventory of the soil resources of the United States. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Digital soil mapping; Multiple soil classes; Soil property maps; Soil survey",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085052685

Reducing the number of deaths effectively, efficiently, and equitably relies on attributing them to specific emission sources, but so far, this has been done for only highly aggregated groups of sources, or a select few sources of interest. Here, we estimate mortality in the United States attributable to all domestic, human-caused emissions of primary PM2.5 and secondary PM2.5 precursors. We present detailed source-specific attributions in four alternate groupings relevant for identifying promising ways to reduce mortality. We find that nearly half of the deaths can be attributed to just five activities, all in different sectors. Around half of the deaths can be attributed to fossil fuel combustion, with the remainder attributable to combustion of nonfossil fuels, agricultural processes, and other noncombustion processes. Both primary and secondary PM2.5 are important, including PM2.5 from currently unregulated precursor pollutants such as ammonia. We suggest improvements in air quality can be realized by continued reductions of emissions from traditionally important sources and by novel strategies for reducing emissions from sources of emerging relative importance and research focus. Such changes can contribute to improved health outcomes and other environmental goals.

The photo-Fenton process operates efficiently at acidic pH; however, circumneutral operation was key to overcome drawbacks, such as acidification and neutralization steps, reagent costs, and the environmental footprint of chemical auxiliaries. This work revealed a remarkable reduction of total organic carbon for PQ (87%) and DQ (80%) after 300 min (at ca. 875 kJ L-1). Phytotoxicity assays confirmed that the treatment led to a considerable increase in the germination index for DQ (i.e., from 4.7% to 55.8%) and PQ (i.e., from 16.5% to 59.7%) using Cucumis sativus seeds. Importantly, treatment costs (DQ = USD$8.05 and PQ = USD$7.72) and the carbon footprint of the process (DQ = 7.37 and PQ = 6.29 kg CO2-Eqv/m3) were within the ranges that were reported for the treatment of recalcitrant substances at acidic conditions in CPC-type reactors. Life cycle assessment (LCA) evidenced that H2O2 and electricity consumption are the variables with the highest environmental impact because they contribute with ca. 70% of the carbon footprint of the process. Under the studied conditions, a further reduction in H2O2 use is counterproductive, because it could impact process performance and euent quality. On the other hand, the main drawback of the process (i.e., energy consumption) can be reduced by using renewable energies. The sensitivity study evidenced that carbon footprint is dependent on the energy share of the local electricity mix; therefore, the use of more renewable electrical energy sources, such as wind-power and photovoltaic, can reduce greenhouse gases emissions of the process an average of 26.4% (DQ = 5.57 and PQ = 4.51 kg CO2-Eqv/m3) and 78.4% (DQ = 3.72 and PQ = 2.65 kg CO2-Eqv/m3), respectively. Finally, from the economic and environmental points of view, the experimental results evidenced that photo-assisted treatment at circumneutral pH is an efficient alternative to deal with quaternary bipyridinium compounds. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; Circumneutral pH; Diquat; Ferrioxalate complexes; Life cycle assessment; Paraquat; Photo-Fenton",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092079314

To achieve these objectives, about 65 actor organizations were selected across seven regions and two city administrations in Ethiopia through a scoping study, extensive literature review, and snowball sampling. Structured questionnaires with closed and open-ended questions were designed to gather relevant information. Results were used to compute network size, density and centrality measures. Our findings show that climate services are regularly communicated to only 10% of the total districts (woredas) on average, with only a third of the actors involved in communicating these services. No single organization or institution plays a dominant role in production, translation, communication or governance of climate services, but a network of organizations and institutions are involved. Major challenges faced by the actors involved in production, translation and delivery of climate services included lack of human and financial resources and weak monitoring and evaluation systems.

With the global demand for electricity expected to increase significantly in the coming decades, the water demand in the power sector is also expected to rise. However, due to the ongoing global energy transition, the future structure of the power supply-and hence future water demand for power generation-is subject to high levels of uncertainty, because the volume of water required for electricity generation varies significantly depending on both the generation technology and the cooling system. This study shows the implications of ambitious decarbonization strategies for the direct water demand for electricity generation. To this end, water demand scenarios for the electricity sector are developed based on selected global energy scenario studies to systematically analyze the impact up to 2040. The results show that different decarbonization strategies for the electricity sector can lead to a huge variation in water needs. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) does not necessarily lead to a reduction in water demand. These findings emphasize the need to take into account not only GHG emission reductions, but also such aspects as water requirements of future energy systems, both at the regional and global levels, in order to achieve a sustainable energy transition. © 2020 by the authors.","Cooling technologies; Electricity sector; Meta-analysis; Renewable energy; Scenarios; Sustainable energy transition; Water consumption; Water-energy nexus","Decarbonization; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Electricity generation; Electricity sector; Future energies; Generation technologies; Global demand; Regional levels; Sustainable energy; Water requirements; Electric power generation; alternative energy; cooling; electricity generation; emission control; greenhouse gas; uncertainty analysis; water demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090891683

Evidence indicates volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be released before, during, and after manufacture. The chemical composition of a popular uncured styrene-based CIPP resin was examined, along with the VOCs that remained in the new cured composite. The roles of curing temperature and heating time in waste discharged into the air were examined. Uncured resin contained approximately 39 wt% VOCs. Multiple hazardous air pollutants were present, however, 61 wt% of the uncured resin was not chemically identified. A substantial mass of VOCs (8.87 wt%) was emitted into the air during manufacture, and all cured composites contained about 3 wt% VOCs. Some VOCs were created during manufacture. Curing temperature (65.5-93.3 °C) and heating time (25-100 min) did not cause different composite VOC loadings. High styrene air concentrations inhibited the detection of other VOCs in air.

In the past, detailed investigation of BC absorption has been hampered by systematic biases in the measurement instrumentation. We present airborne measurements of aerosol absorption and black carbon microphysical properties in highly aged biomass burning plumes measured 4-8 d from their source over the southeast Atlantic Ocean during CLARIFY-2017, using a suite of novel photoacoustic spectrometers to measure aerosol absorption at 405, 514, and 655 nm and a single-particle soot photometer to measure the BC mass concentration, size, and mixing state. These measurements are of sufficient quality and detail to provide constraint on optical schemes used in climate models for the first time in biomass burning plumes far from their source-an aerosol environment that is one of the most important climatically. The average absorption Ångström exponents (AAE) were 1.38 over the wavelength range from 405 to 514 nm and 0.88 over the range from 514 to 655 nm, suggesting that brown carbon (BrC) contributed to 11±2 % of absorption at 405 nm. The effective organic aerosol (OA) mass absorption coefficient (MAC) was 0:31±0:09 m2 g-1 at 405 nm. The BC particles were universally thickly coated, and almost no externally mixed BC particles were detected. The average MAC of BC was 20 ± 4, 15 ± 3, and 12 ± 2 m2g-1 at wavelengths of 405, 514, and 655 nm respectively, with equivalent absorption enhancements of around 1:85 ± 0:45 at all three wavelengths, suggesting that the thick coatings acted as a lens that enhanced light absorption by the BC. We compared the measured MAC and AAE values with those calculated using several optical models and absorption parameterisations that took the measured BC mass and mixing state as inputs. Homogeneous grey-sphere Mie models were only able to replicate MAC for some low (real and imaginary) values of the complex BC refractive index (mBC) at the shortest wavelength, but they would have to use unrealistically low values of mBC to accurately replicate the AAE. A core-shell Mie model was able to generate good agreement for MAC in the green-red end of the visible spectrum for most values of mBC. However, there are no possible values of mBC that produce MAC values that agree with our observations at all three wavelengths, due to a wavelengthdependent underestimation of the MAC of the underlying BC core. Four semiempirical parameterisations from the literature were also tested, linking the BC mixing state to either the MAC or absorption enhancement. Two of these schemes produced results that agreed within a few percent with the measured MAC at all three wavelengths, and the AAE agreed well when discounting the effects of BrC. Our results uniquely demonstrate the validity of absorption parameterisations, as well as the failings of Mie calculations, in this highly aged environment. We recommend that future work should conduct similar analyses in environments where BC has different properties; future studies should also investigate the impact of implementing these types of schemes within climate models as well as the impact of developing equivalent schemes for light scattering by soot particles at visible wavelengths. © 2020 Author(s).",,"aerosol property; biomass burning; black carbon; climate modeling; optical property; photometer; smoke; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southeast)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093507962

However, in those regions where coal is a dominating power generation fuel source, different opinions about whether EVs can help emission reduction exist. In other words, whether EVs can help emission reduction depends on the energy system configuration and the power generation mix. To achieve the overall emission reduction in both systems, a collaborative planning strategy for electricity and transportation systems is proposed. In the electricity distribution network, the renewable energy source is planned to cope with future demand growth due to the increasing use of EVs. In the transportation network, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are introduced to realize the coordinated development of different types of vehicles. The location of the hydrogen refueling stations can be planned, and the penetration ratio of internal combustion vehicles, EVs, and FCVs is optimized. The proposed planning model is verified on the 46-bus electricity distribution network and the 21-bus transportation network. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and subgradient methods are employed to solve the proposed optimization model. According to the simulation results, the proposed model can achieve the lowest emission since the electricity and transportation systems can cooperate well. © 2015 IEEE.","Distribution network; electric vehicles (EVs); energy system planning; hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs); transportation network","Climate change; Coal combustion; Electric utilities; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Integer programming; Renewable energy resources; Vehicles; Collaborative planning; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity distribution networks; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Hydrogen refueling stations; Mixed-integer linear programming; Renewable energy source; Transportation network; Electric network parameters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091803642

Quantifying its impacts, however, is difficult due to the uncertainties in estimating the strength and variations of volcanic emissions. Here we developed and evaluated a new approach to combine satellite SO2 detection and chemical transport modeling to assess the impact of the 2018 Mt. Kilauea eruption on air quality over Hawaii. During the sustained eruption of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii's Big Island from May to July 2018, considerable SO2 and PM2.5 enhancements were observed both from the ground and from space. We studied this case using an experimental version of the NOAA National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC) modeling system. Daily emissions of SO2 and ash were estimated using a combination of SO2 column density retrieved by Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Nadir-Mapper (NM) aboard the Suomi-NPP satellite and the NAQFC model with an inverse emission modeling approach. We found that the volcanic SO2 emission rates peaked at 15,000 mol/s from the Kilauea's East Rift zone and Summit. The formation and transport of volcanic smog, or Vog, was highly dependent upon the vertical distribution of the volcanic emission, controlled by the heat flux of emission sources. We conducted four model simulations with various emission settings, and compared them to satellite data (CALIOP, OMPS and VIIRS) and in-situ measurements. All the runs tended to underpredict the peak values of surface SO2 and PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter). The “No Plume Rise” run underestimated the Vog plume rise and downstream transport. Using fixed emission rate or removing the temporal variations (”3-Day Mean”) led to miss peak Vog effects or inconsistent transport pattern compared to the observations. Therefore, the Base simulation with daily-varying emission and plume rise was used to quantify the air quality effects of the Kilauea eruption. We found that the volcanic eruption elevated surface PM2.5 concentration by 30–40 μg/m3 in the southeast part of the Big Island, with peak values up to 300 μg/m3. The Vog effect on trace gases, such as O3, NOx, and non-methane hydrocarbons, were much weaker (&lt;1 ppbV), but extended to farther downstream. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Emission; Hawaii; SO2; Volcanic eruption","Air quality; Chemical detection; Heat flux; Inverse problems; Particulate emissions; Quality control; Satellites; Sulfur dioxide; Uncertainty analysis; Air quality impacts; Chemical transport models; In-situ measurement; National Air Quality Forecast Capability; Non-methane hydrocarbons; PM2.5 concentration; Regional chemical transport model; Vertical distributions; Volcanoes; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; emission; forecasting method; heat flux; pollutant transport; simulation; sulfur dioxide; vertical distribution; volcanic eruption; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; algorithm; altitude; Article; chemical reaction; comparative study; controlled study; exhaust gas; Hawaii; limit of detection; optical depth; particle size; particulate matter; photolysis; priority journal; smog; surface property; temperature measurement; uncertainty; volcano; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kilauea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086578653

Autumn and winter are the most heavily polluted seasons. It is essential to reduce the PM2.5 pollution in autumn and winter in this region for winning the blue sky defense war. The characteristics of PM2.5 pollution during autumn and winter in this region were analysed and crucial issues in atmospheric pollution prevention were identified from the perspectives of time, space and pollution sources, using a combination of techniques including air quality observation, emission inventory, PM2.5 source apportionment and air quality model simulation. The results showed that average PM2.5 concentrations in autumn and winter were twice that in spring and summer, and frequent heavy pollution elevated PM2.5 concentration significantly. Six cities including Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, Anyang and Baoding, located along the south-western transport channel in the region, have great effects on regional air quality. The severe PM2.5 pollution in this region could be attributed to heavy industrial structure, large NOx emissions from mobile sources, re-burn of loose coal, insufficient dust control and impacts from cities out of the region. Suggestions for air pollution control in autumn and winter in this region were proposed. More efforts should be devoted to the most vulnerable links in the key cities. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this study, based on the traffic conditions of 2013 in Dublin, Ireland, the impact of a change in transport infrastructure, a traffic regulation change, speed limit changes and fleet composition changes on air quality and air pollution related public health were assessed. Two pollutants are considered in this study: NO2 and PM2.5. A traffic model, emissions model, dispersion model and a health impact model were adopted. The construction of new infrastructure and changes in traffic management were predicted to have contrasting effects on different parts of the city, bringing little benefit to the city as a whole. The mortality incidence change brought about by changes in NO2 concentration due to reductions in speed limits were predicted to be an increase of 22.4 deaths in 2013. A fleet composition change from diesel to petrol vehicles was predicted to reduce the PM2.5 and NO2 concentration and relevant mortality incidence for the whole city.

This paper reviews several available data-driven approaches that answer urban sustainability questions. One such approach is applied to identify energy consumption and rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation potential in New York City at the electricity network level with the objective of improving the city's resilience to expected impacts of climate change. Electric system resilience is, in part, dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of consumption and potential sustainable energy generation which is investigated here by separating the city into 68 electricity networks and evaluating their generation-consumption interaction pattern. The analysis reveals that New York City could be home to about 10 GWp of rooftop solar installations—sufficient to cover approximately 25% of annual city electricity consumption and 53% of daylight hour consumption. Localized electricity import–export dimensions are explored for each of the 68 electricity networks and we identify an excess 3.1 TWh electricity supply per year if the entire technical potential of rooftop solar PV is deployed. This excess electricity supply is roughly equivalent to an annual $734 million value which could benefit low-income areas in the city.

Besides, longer dry spells are compromising the reliability of local agricultural practices. The present study provides a comprehensive investigation about the benefits induced by using indigenous rainwater harvesting techniques (RWHT) against hydrometeorological threats affecting the Sahelian areas. Different RWHT have been tested in term of runoff retention, infiltration increase into the root zone, and soil water stress mitigation. To achieve these purposes, hydrological processes at the field scale have been investigated using a two-dimensional distributed hydrological model. To make the study representative of the whole Sahelian areas, several simulations were carried out adopting a wide range of input parameters based on conventional values of those areas. The results reveal that RWHT may lead to a runoff retention up to 87% and to double the infiltration. Intercepting and storing runoff, RWHT increase the water content in the root zone and the right design can diminish the crop water stress. Furthermore, the results show that adopting RWHT makes it possible to extend the growing season up to 20 days, enhancing the yield. These benefits contribute to the reduction of the climate-related water stress and the prevention of crop failure. © 2020 by the authors.

One potential solution to reduce these emissions is the use of battery electric vehicles. Although a number of life cycle assessments have been conducted for these vehicles, the influence of a transport system-wide transition has not been addressed sufficiently. Therefore, we developed a method which combines life cycle assessment with an agent-based transport simulation and synthetic electric-, diesel- and gasoline-powered vehicle models. We use a transport simulation to obtain the number of vehicles, their lifetime mileage and road-specific consumption. Subsequently, we analyze the product systems' vehicle production, use phase and end-of-life. The results are scaled depending on the covered distance, the vehicle weight and the consumption for the whole life cycle. The results indicate that the sole transition of drive trains is insufficient to significantly lower the greenhouse gas emissions. However, sensitivity analyses demonstrate that there is a considerable potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with higher shares of renewable energies, a different vehicle distribution and a higher lifetime mileage. The method facilitates the assessment of the ecological impacts of complete car-based transportation in urban agglomerations and is able to analyze different transport sectors. © 2020 by the authors.","Agent-based traffic simulation; Battery electric vehicles; Environmental engineering; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability; Urban mobility; Urban transportation","ecological impact; electric vehicle; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; simulation; transportation system; Berlin; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091695309

Here, field measurements and LiDAR data were used to estimate aboveground carbon stocks and economic benefits of Avicennia marina in the Auckland Region, New Zealand, where the mangrove area has increased at an annual rate of 3.2% since 1940. Multiple allometric equations were explored to determine best fits for different growth forms (tall and dwarf mangroves) that minimised uncertainty in conversions of tree size to aboveground carbon stock estimates. Across the Auckland Region, the mean total aboveground carbon stock (including trees, seedling, pneumatophores and woody debris) was 40.2 Mg C ha−1 with over 75% contained in tree biomass. Total aboveground carbon stocks varied considerably between mangrove growth form (tall and dwarf mangroves) and hydrodynamic conditions (estuarine, riverine and delta mangroves). Total aboveground carbon storage across the Auckland Region amounted to 384,451 Mg C with an economic value of US$ 70 million. This study demonstrates that LiDAR data can be used to produce reliable and high-resolution tree carbon stock estimates in estuaries characterised by spatially variable distributions of dwarf mangroves.

Removing an aquatic invasive species following arrival is almost impossible, and preventing introduction is a more viable management option. Bigheaded carp are an invasive fish spreading throughout the Midwestern United States and are threatening to enter the Great Lakes. This review outlines the development of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) as a non-physical barrier that can be used to deter the movement of fish and prevent further spread. Carbon dioxide gas could be used as a deterrent either to cause avoidance (i.e., fish swim away from zones of high CO2), or by inducing equilibrium loss due to the anesthetic properties of CO2 (i.e., tolerance). The development of CO2 as a fish deterrent started with controlled laboratory experiments demonstrating stress and avoidance, and then progressed to larger field applications demonstrating avoidance at scales that approach real-world scenarios. In addition, factors that influence the effectiveness of CO2 as a fish barrier are discussed, outlining conditions that could make CO2 less effective in the field; these factors that influence efficacy would be of interest to managers using CO2 to target other fish species, or those using other non-physical barriers for fish. © 2020 by the author.

These so called 'blue carbon' ecosystems have 3-5 times capacity of storing and sequestering carbon compared to terrestrial vegetation. This paper attempts to provide the estimation of baseline or Business as Usual (BAU) scenario for blue carbon ecosystems which would be required if formal emission inventory of 'blue carbon' ecosystems is to be implemented. The result shows mangrove degradation occurs both during base years of 2000 - 2016 and during the projected emission period of 2017 - 2030. Mangrove conversion to aquaculture pond is the main cause of degradation, contributing up to 72.50 % of the total carbon emission. Blue carbon climate change mitigation by mangrove rehabilitation can only reduce up to 6 % of carbon emission from baseline in 2030. Significant emission reduction of 73,38% from BAU emission in 2030 can only be achieved through integration of mangrove rehabilitation, silvofishery practice and the prevention of mangrove conversion to other land-uses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Coastal zones; Emission control; Land use; Climate change mitigation; Ecosystem services; Emission inventories; Emission reduction; Mangrove conversion; Mangrove rehabilitations; Sequestering carbon; Terrestrial vegetation; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091919689

Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the mechanism behind the driving effect of urban development on transportation emissions is a crucial prerequisite for coordinated development of low-carbon urban transportation and cities. Based on the oil product allocation method, this paper estimates the transportation emission in Beijing from 1995 to 2016. Then based on the understanding of the driving mechanism, this paper applies the urban allometric scaling law to analyze the relationship between city size and transportation emission. Finally, the driving mechanism is analyzed using the STRIPAT model. The results reveal a superlinear relationship between transportation emission in Beijing and the expansion of the city, as the former outgrew the latter. Population size, urbanization, economic size, industrial structure, spatial scale and infrastructure construction are positive driving factors of transportation emission, whereas progress of energy technologies as a negative driving factor can restrain the growth of transportation emission. Urbanization has the most significant impact on urban transportation emission, and economic size contributes the most to the growth of transportation emission. Based on the results, we make a few policy recommendations for low-carbon urban transportation of Beijing, which include: improving transportation efficiency in the process of urbanization; promoting energy conservation and emission reduction while pursuing economic development so as to decouple transportation emission from urban development; restricting unordered urban expansion and updating the concept of transportation infrastructure supply; and developing energy technologies to improve energy efficiency. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Beijing; carbon emission; STIRPAT model; urban development; Urban transportation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100497235

Although it is known that the organization and subcellular localization of carboxysomes are dependent on external light conditions and are highly relevant to their functions, how carboxysome organization and function are actively orchestrated in natural diurnal cycles has remained elusive. Here, we explore the dynamic regulation of carboxysome positioning and carbon fixation in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 in response to diurnal light-dark cycles, using live-cell confocal imaging and Rubisco assays. We found that carboxysomes are prone to locate close to the central line along the short axis of the cell and exhibit a greater preference of polar distribution in the dark phase, coupled with a reduction in carbon fixation. Moreover, we show that deleting the gene encoding the circadian clock protein KaiA could lead to an increase in carboxysome numbers per cell and reduced portions of pole-located carboxysomes.

Numerous strategies have been considered by the Chinese government to mitigate carbon emissions in recent years. Accurate and timely estimation of spatiotemporal variations of city-level carbon emissions is of vital importance for planning of low-carbon strategies. For an assessment of the spatiotemporal variations of city-level carbon emissions in China during the periods 2000-2017, we used nighttime light data as a proxy from two sources: Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) data and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS). The results show that cities with low carbon emissions are located in the western and central parts of China. In contrast, cities with high carbon emissions are mainly located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Half of the cities of China have been making efforts to reduce carbon emissions since 2012, and regional disparities among cities are steadily decreasing. Two clusters of high-emission cities located in the BTH and YRD followed two different paths of carbon emissions owing to the diverse political status and pillar industries. We conclude that carbon emissions in China have undergone a transformation to decline, but a very slow balancing between the spatial pattern of high-emission versus low-emission regions in China can be presumed. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; DMSP-OLS; NPP-VIIRS; Spatiotemporal variations","Orbits; Thermography (imaging); Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Low-carbon emissions; Low-carbon strategies; Regional disparities; Spatio-temporal variation; Visible infrared imaging radiometer suites; Yangtze river delta; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091843622

To provide more accurate carbon prediction results for policymakers and market participants, a hybrid carbon price prediction model combines empirical mode decomposition, variational mode decomposition, and long short-term memory network is proposed.

First, the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed model are optimal in comparison experiments. In the Beijing carbon market, the MAPE, RMSE, and R2 of the proposed model improved by 63.98%, 66.07%, and 12.24%, respectively, compared with the worst model. Second, the secondary decomposition can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. In the Beijing dataset, the combination of empirical mode decomposition and variational mode decomposition improved the MAPE, RMSE, and R2 values of the model by an average of 35.52%, 46.57%, and 8.94%.

Since these ecosystems occupy a third of the earth's land area, the immediate loss of carbon and the post fire reduction in carbon sequestration will significantly affect regional and global carbon budgets. However, there are few studies that quantify the recovery of ecosystem carbon production post fire in semi-arid ecosystems. In January 2014, a wildfire caused severe loss and damage to plants in a semi-arid Eucalyptus woodland in South Australia. The carbon flux of the woodland was monitored pre- and post-fire from an in-situ eddy covariance flux tower. Daily net ecosystem production (NEP), ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP), together with environmental variables collected in 2012 and 2013 (pre-fire) were used to generate machine learning regression algorithms. Subsequently, the algorithms were used to simulate Reco, GPP and NEP at the same site without fire from the environmental variables, which is referred to as modelled carbon fluxes. Changes in the difference between the modelled fluxes and the actual post-fire measured fluxes were used to investigate the recovery of Reco, GPP and NEP during four years after the fire (April 2014–March 2018). We found that the woodland was a carbon source throughout the first year and in the hot and dry months of the second year, but was a carbon sink in the third and fourth year after the fire. The recovery of NEP to pre-fire levels was estimated to take approximately 35 months (30–43 months at 95% confidence interval). Post fire measured GPP responded more strongly to rainfall events than indicated by the modelled values which suggests that carbon sequestration by new leaf growth is more responsive to rainfall than equivalent mature leaf area of this woodland. After four years, both measured Reco and GPP rates were still lower than modelled rates indicating that the mass of carbon and its turnover in the ecosystem was not yet at pre-fire levels. We conclude that full recovery from fire in this woodland, and likely in similar ecosystems, is strongly influenced by the incident rainfall regime after fire and will take five years or more, especially if total annual rainfall is less than the long term average. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian additive regression trees; Ecosystem carbon flux; Eddy covariance; Recovery; Semi-arid woodland; Wildfire","carbon flux; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; growth; leaf area; net ecosystem production; rainfall; semiarid region; wildfire; woodland; Australia; South Australia; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087208788

Reducing manufacturing pollution emissions is critical to manufacturing sustainability. This article explores the influence of heterogeneous environmental regulation and foreign direct investment (FDI) on manufacturing pollution emissions, based on the micro data of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. The results show that FDI significantly increases manufacturing pollution emissions, and both expenditure-style environmental regulation and investment-style environmental regulation have an inverted U-shaped relationship with manufacturing pollution emissions. Moreover, the expenditure-style environmental regulation can only restrain the manufacturing pollution emissions caused by FDI in the current period, while the investment-style environmental regulation is not only effective in the current period, but also plays a role in the lag period. Further research finds that both expenditure-style environmental regulation and investment-style environmental regulation have significant industrial and regional heterogeneity in reducing manufacturing pollution emissions caused by FDI.

The combination of these factors, taking into account cutting and harm to forests from fires and other human activities, as a result leads to tremendous degradation of forest ecosystems. In modern conditions, the forest pathological stands condition in Russia is determined on the basis of data from forest pathological surveys and state forest pathological monitoring. For the current period (2020), disappointing statistics remain on the reproduction of the Siberian silkworm population (Dendrolimus superans sibiricus Tscetv.) nd the negative consequences for taiga forests. Modern climatic changes on a planetary scale have a significant impact on mass outbreaks of dangerous phytophage. In the near future, adaptation measures in the field of forest pathological monitoring should be based on risk factors when planning forest protection measures, a diverse selection of adaptation options and adopting a flexible forest management system at the regional level. In this paper, we consider one of the methods for improving forest pathological monitoring, based on the principles of covering as large a territory as possible with remote sensing data (ERS) combined with predictive models based on GIS that allow predicting the risk of mass reproduction of the Siberian silkworm based on the previously studied factorial dependence. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Animals; Biotechnology; Cell proliferation; Ecosystems; Environmental technology; Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Risk management; Climatic changes; Forest ecosystem; Forest management systems; Forest protection; Human activities; Predictive models; Regional levels; Remote sensing data; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091344007

To reduce this problem requires effective, evidence-based exposure-reduction strategies. Little information is available on the penetration of outdoor PM2.5 into day-care environments. Our study attempted to address the following objectives: to measure indoor infiltration factor (Finf) of PM2.5 from outdoor PM2.5 and to determine the building parameters that modify the indoor PM2.5. We collected indoor/outdoor 1-min PM2.5 from 50 day-care classrooms. We noted mean Finf ± SD of 0.65 ± 0.22 in day-care rooms which are naturally ventilated and lower Finf ± SD values of 0.47 ± 0.18 for those that are air-conditioned: values which are lower than those reported in Singapore residences. The air exchange rates were higher in naturally ventilated rooms (1.47 vs 0.86 h−1). However, fine particle deposition rates were lower for naturally ventilated rooms (0.67 ± 0.43 h−1) compared with air-conditioned ones (1.03 ± 0.55 h−1) presumably due to composite rates linked to the filters within the split unit air-conditioners, higher recirculation rates, and interior surfaces in the latter.

Design/methodology/approach: The study conducted a household survey with 433 respondents in Lijiang to documents adaptation measures. The authors used a multivariate probit model to quantify five categories of adaptation measures against a set of household features, extension and information, resources, social network, financial assets and perception variables. Findings: The most significant determinants consisted of information on early climate warnings and impending hazards, ownership to land and livestock, irrigation membership in community-based organisations, household savings, cash crop farming and perceptions of climate change and its related hazards. Adaptation strategies and policies highlighting these determinants could help to improve climate change adaptation in the region. Originality/value: This study quantified the determinants of adaptive strategies and mapped important determinants for the region that will provide farmers with the appropriate resources and information to implement the best practices for adapting to climatic changes. The method and findings could be useful and easily replicable for future agriculture policies. © 2020, Nani Maiya Sujakhu, Sailesh Ranjitkar, Hua Yang,Yufang Su, Jianchu Xu, and Jun He.","Adaptation; Adaptation barrier; Climate change perceptions; Income diversification; Lijiang; Sustainable livelihood","adaptive management; climate change; household survey; perception; policy implementation; quantitative analysis; strategic approach; China; Lijiang; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088124669

We explore a variety of atmospheric compositions, pressures, and rotation states for both ocean-covered and completely desiccated planets in order to assess the planet's potential for habitability. For all 20 of our simulated cases, we use our climate model outputs to synthesize transmission spectra, combined-light spectra, and integrated broadband phase curves. These climatologically informed observables will help the community assess the technological capabilities necessary for future characterization of this planet - as well as similar transiting planets discovered in the future - and will provide a guide for distinguishing possible climate states if one day we do obtain sensitive spectral observations of a habitable planet around an M star. We find that TOI-700 d is a strong candidate for a habitable world and can potentially maintain temperate surface conditions under a wide variety of atmospheric compositions. Unfortunately, the spectral feature depths from the resulting transmission spectra and the peak flux and variations from our synthesized phase curves for TOI-700 d do not exceed 10 ppm. This will likely prohibit the James Webb Space Telescope from characterizing its atmosphere; however, this motivates the community to invest in future instrumentation that perhaps can one day reveal the true nature of TOI-700 d and to continue to search for similar planets around less distant stars. © 2020.

Powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic studies confirm the phase purity of the crystals. Raman analysis reveals that the intensity and line-width of Raman bands increase significantly with beta irradiation indicating the formation of structural defects in YAlO3 lattice. The optical properties are studied through UV–visible absorption, and photoluminescence emission and excitation spectroscopies under pre- and post- beta irradiation. The optical studies indicate the presence of Sm and Cr impurities by exhibiting characteristic emission lines in the orange red region. Further, a systematic study on the thermoluminescence (TL) characteristics of the crystal is also carried out at different doses of beta irradiation. The crystals exhibit a prominent TL glow peak at 239 °C for less than 5 Gy doses while a weak second glow peak evolves at higher doses. Also, the crystals show a nearly linear dose response in the studied range from 0.1 to 10 Gy. The glow curve analysis reveals that the TL emission obeys the first order kinetics model. Based on the optical studies, the plausible mechanism for the TL glow curve is discussed in terms of the intrinsic defects and impurities that are present in the crystal. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Optical floating zone; Photoluminescence; Raman spectroscopy; Thermoluminescence; X-ray diffraction; YAlO3 single crystal","Aluminum compounds; Crystal impurities; Defects; Irradiation; Optical properties; Single crystals; Spectroscopic analysis; Thermoluminescence; Characteristic emission; Excitation spectroscopy; First order kinetics; Optical floating zones; Photoluminescence emission; Powder X ray diffraction; Raman spectroscopic study; Structural and optical properties; Yttrium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088031007

As a result, much effort has gone into creating or restoring areas supporting microbial denitrification, which permanently removes nitrate from urban ecosystems. However, denitrification is a facultative process, with complex spatiotemporal drivers and limitations, making it difficult to predict where or when denitrification will occur. This is particularly true in urban systems, where drivers and limitations can differ greatly from those of native systems. In this study, we examine novel urban ecosystems in a unique geographic setting, investigating limitations and spatiotemporal drivers of denitrification in accidental wetlands (AW) located in a desert city (Phoenix, AZ). These wetlands were unintentionally created by runoff generated in Phoenix and exiting storm pipes into a dry riverbed. Previous work in native, nonurban Arizona wetlands (NW) found that monsoon floods and plant patches are important spatiotemporal drivers of denitrification. While we found that AW had high potential to process nitrate, denitrification patterns in AW exhibit different drivers from NW. As predicted, denitrification potential in AW was greater under plant patches, but surprisingly, this was not only due to the plants alleviating carbon limitation as both vegetated and unvegetated patches were not carbon limited. Contrary to predictions, monsoon floods did not increase denitrification potential, and perennially inundated AW had the highest denitrification potential, suggesting less temporal variation in denitrification in AW than in NW.

To better understand the dynamics and kinetics of forest soil carbon storage under long-term drought, a rainfall-reduction experiment was established in a subtropical evergreen forest of eastern China. Soil organic carbon (SOC) composition, microbial carbon metabolism and the interactions with soil microbial community structure were investigated across different soil aggregate size fractions. After five years' treatment of rainfall reduction, a significant loss of large macroaggregates, as well as an increase of microaggregates by over 100% was observed. Meanwhile, drought changed the composition of SOC, reducing the non-hydrolyzed carbon and humin contents in large- to medium-size macroaggregates. Microbial metabolizing capacity of polymeric compounds was also reduced especially in the above aggregate fractions, whereas the utilization of small-molecular compounds was more impacted in small macroaggregates and microaggregates. The changes in carbon metabolizing patterns were further associated with the abundance changes of specific microbial taxa, revealing the microbially mediated mechanism of soil carbon metabolism under long-term drought. In addition, carbon metabolism in microaggregates was particularly sensitive to the changes of soil moisture, suggesting long-term drought may continually influence the functional resistance of the microbial communities. Taken together, our results provide insights into how biotic and abiotic processes together influence the SOC metabolizing processes, continued monitoring and investigation of which shall contribute to better understanding of the dynamics and kinetics of SOC storage under the impact of long-term drought. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biolog assays; Carbon metabolism; Microbial communities; Soil aggregates; SOM composition","Aggregates; Drought; Forestry; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Rain; Soil moisture; Tropics; Microbial carbons; Microbial communities; Molecular compounds; Northern Hemispheres; Polymeric compounds; Soil microbial community structure; Soil organic carbon; Subtropical forests; Organic carbon; carbon; organic carbon; polymer; carbon; bacterium; drought; evergreen forest; extreme event; metabolism; microaggregate; polymer; soil carbon; soil organic matter; subtropical region; Article; carbon metabolism; carbon storage; chemical composition; China; controlled study; drought; evergreen; forest; kinetics; microbial community; microbial metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); soil chemistry; soil microflora; drought; forest; microbiology; soil; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Carbon; China; Droughts; Forests; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085542702

Several studies have shed light on the effects of flow stabilisation on riparian woody species, but other life forms exposed to intensified inundation have been overlooked. Furthermore, studies from a functional perspective are scarce. We evaluated the functional response of riparian vegetation along the shores of the Three Gorges Reservoir on the Yangtze River in China to unnaturally long annual flooding (>7 months) after the first year of filling. We aimed to answer the following: (1) can we derive well-defined flow-response guilds from the riparian zones of the Yangtze River? and (2) which plant traits and guilds are favoured or disfavoured by the unnaturally long flooding environment? Woody and herbaceous species were inventoried in 12 reaches along the shorelines of the Three Gorges Reservoir and another 12 reaches along the free-flowing Yangtze River. We performed a cluster analysis to derive riparian guilds using abundance data (projective coverage) from 40 riparian plant species and 13 responsive traits. Structural composition and functional diversity of the unnaturally and naturally flooded riparian vegetation were compared. Unnaturally long flooding substantially reduced species richness, but it did not change the riparian vegetation cover. This novel flooding reduced functional diversity, mostly owing to the loss of stress-tolerant woody species and competitive perennial herbs. However, competitive annual herbs and flood-tolerant riparian herbs, as the most abundant functional guilds, were favoured even under such long-term hypoxic conditions. These guilds under regulation revealed a high functional resilience to prolonged flooding along the upstream reaches of the Yangtze River. Flooding tolerance and the capacity to synchronise germination and growth with short-exposure periods underlie the plant species changes. Our findings are useful for anticipating the effects of long-lasting inundation on riparian areas triggered by flow regulation or warmer climates. The functional perspective lends confidence that our conclusions can be generalised to other geographical regions despite not sharing the same species pool. Finally, the plant species that showed a high flooding tolerance should be considered for the restoration of riparian areas affected by the Three Gorges Reservoir. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","flow regulation; impoundment; plant trait; riparian zone; river",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085871692

This paper selects Beijing (economic center and leader of emission reduction in China) as a case to examine the decoupling process during the period 2000–2015 through a sectoral decomposition analysis. This paper proposes the decoupling of carbon emission from economic growth or sectoral output by defining the Tapio decoupling elasticity, and combined the decoupling elasticity with decomposition technique such as Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index approach. The results indicate that agriculture and industrial sectors presented strong decoupling state, and weak decoupling is detected in construction and other industrial sectors. Meanwhile, transport sector is in expansive negative decoupling while trade industry shows expansive coupling during the study period. Per-capita gross domestic product, industrial structure, and energy intensity are the most significant effects influencing the decoupling process. Agriculture and industry are conducive to decoupling of carbon emissions from economic output, while transport and trade are detrimental to the realization of strong decoupling target between 2000 and 2015. However, construction and other industrial sectors exerted relatively little minor impact on the whole decoupling process. Improving and promoting energy-saving technologies in transport sector and trade sector should be the key strategy adjustments for Beijing to reduce carbon emissions in the future. The study aims to provide effective policy adjustments for policy makers to accelerate the decoupling process in Beijing, which, furthermore, can lay a theoretical foundation for other cities to develop carbon emission mitigation polices more efficiently. © The Author(s) 2019.","Beijing; Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method; Low-carbon economy; sectoral analysis; Tapio decoupling elasticity","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Elasticity; Emission control; Energy conservation; Renewable energy resources; Beijing; Climate change mitigation; Decomposition technique; Divisia index method; Energy-saving technologies; Gross domestic products; Low carbon economy; Sectoral analysis; Economic analysis; carbon emission; climate change; decomposition analysis; economic growth; energy intensity; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; industrial structure; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076500493

Yet few studies have considered the role of political institutions at the national level. Comparative political institutional theory argues that a country's party system, executive-legislative arrangement, and electoral rules affect elected officials’ incentives and behaviour. This study utilizes this theory to explain how Chile's national elected officials responded to the country's extreme drought in 2010–2015. Results indicate that ideologically distinct alliances, a strong president, and legislators’ competing incentives to cater to different interests resulted in adaptive policy solutions that only partially addressed the shortcomings that drought exposed. The findings of this study show how politics can underlie technical decision-making on climate change, help to account for the continued inadequacies of Chilean water reform even in the face of new climate extremes, and demonstrate the utility of the comparative political institutional lens for explaining national strategies for climate adaptation. Applying this lens to other country cases and climatic events will advance knowledge on how differences in electoral incentives and policy processes systematically shape climate adaption policy. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate adaptation; drought; Institutions; politics","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; extreme event; institutional framework; national planning; national politics; political development; political theory; strategic approach; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075511384

Graphitic carbon nitride tubes (GCNTs) combine visible-light sensitivity, high charge carrier mobility, and exceptional chemical/photochemical stability, imparting this material with unrivaled photocatalytic activities in photosynthetic processes, such as water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction.

Closely-packed arrays of aligned GCNTs show great promise as multifunctional membrane materials for the light energy conversion and storage, light-driven pumping of liquids, selective adsorption, and electrochemical applications. These emerging applications require synthetic routes to GCNTs with highly controlled morphological parameters and composition to be available.

As such, it is difficult to decide which mitigation and adaptation measures are the most suitable in a given country and which should be prioritized in planning and implementation. The objective of the paper is to present farmer and expert rankings of potential adaptation measures in Serbia's agriculture, to compare the two perspectives, and to propose priority measures. Twenty-four measures are identified as most appropriate for adaptation to climate change in Serbia. Farmers (141) provided feedback on priority measures by responding to an online questionnaire, while experts evaluated the measures through a two-stage multicriteria decision-making analysis (MCDA). Applying AHP, ten experts first assessed seven criteria identified as most relevant, including: level of responsibility, category, implementation timeframe, multifunctionality, technical skills, cost-benefit ratio, and the mitigation effectiveness of the measure. In the second stage, the measures were evaluated against the criteria and ranked by TOPSIS. The outcomes of the study indicate that the MCDA ranking was slightly different from that resulting from farmers’ feedback. There is direct agreement on two of the first five priority measures (use of multi-purpose river reservoirs for water supply and agricultural technologies), and six of the first 10 measures – the most closely ranked are irrigation and antihail netting. However, there is a considerable difference in the case of measures that farmers and stakeholders do not recognize as significant because they either do not see a direct benefit for them (e.g. restoration of wetlands or vegetation and afforestation to prevent flooding or erosion), or they cannot implement the measures due to topography (e.g. use of drainage ditches for irrigation). The applied methodology shows that planning of adaptation measures requires consultation of experts in different fields and appreciation of numerous criteria, in order for decisions to be sustainable and applicable in practice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Farmers’ perceptions; Multi-criteria analysis; Prioritization","Agricultural robots; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Irrigation; Reforestation; Reservoirs (water); Topography; Water supply; Adaptation to climate changes; Agricultural system; Agricultural technologies; Climate change adaptation; Cost benefit ratio; Multi criteria decision making; Multifunctionality; Online questionnaire; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; environmental planning; expert system; farmers attitude; implementation process; prioritization; Serbia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084436331

We used a spatiotemporal approach to investigate soil erosion in Svalbarðstunga, Iceland (66°N, 15°W), a degraded rangeland. We used three complementary datasets: (a) high-resolution unmanned-aerial vehicle imagery collected from 12 sites (total area ~0.75 km2); (b) historical imagery of the same sites; and (c) a simple, spatially-explicit cellular automata model. Sites were located along a gradient of increasing altitude and distance from the sea, and varied in erosion severity (5–47% eroded). We found that there was no simple relationship between location along the environmental gradient and the spatial characteristics of erosion. Patch-size frequency distributions lacked a characteristic scale of variation, but followed a power-law distribution on five of the 12 sites. Present total eroded area is poorly related to current, site-scale levels of environmental stress, but the number of small erosion patches did reflect site-level stress. Small (&lt;25 m2) erosion patches clustered near large patches. The model results suggested that the large-scale patterns observed likely arise from strong, local interactions, which mean that erosion spreads from degraded areas. Our findings suggest that contemporary erosion patterns reflect historical stresses, as well as current environmental conditions. The importance of abiotic processes to the growth of large erosion patches and their relative insensitivity to current environmental conditions makes it likely that the total eroded area will continue to increase, despite a warming climate and reducing levels of grazing pressure. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cellular automata; grazing; Iceland; patch-size distributions; sheep; soil erosion; UAV","Antennas; Cellular automata; Soils; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cellular automata modeling; Environmental conditions; grazing; Icelands; sheep; Soil erosion; Spatial characteristics; Spatio-temporal approach; Erosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081275226

REDD+ has been conceived as an international framework to encourage voluntary efforts in developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon removals from forest activities. It was designed as an international framework under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to enable the generation of emission reductions and removals (ERRs) at the national-and, provisionally, the subnational-level and is, thus, primarily a creature of international law. However, in defining forest carbon ERRs, the international framework competes with national emission trading systems and domestic REDD+ legislation as well as private standards that define units traded on the voluntary carbon market. As results-based and carbon market systems emerge, the question remains: Who can claim participation in REDD+ and voluntary carbon market projects? The existence of different international, national and private standards that value ERRs poses a challenge to countries that participate in REDD+ as well as to communities and private actors participating in voluntary carbon market projects. This paper seeks to clarify the nature and limitation of rights pertaining to REDD+ market transactions. It also links the notion of carbon rights to both carbon markets and government's decision on benefit sharing. Applying a legal lens, this paper helps to understand the various claims and underlying rights to participate in REDD+ transactions and addresses ambiguities that can lead to conflict around REDD+ implementation. The definition of carbon rights and the legal nature of carbon credits depend on local law and differ between countries. However, by categorizing carbon rights, the paper summarizes several legal considerations that are relevant for regulating REDD+ and sharing the financial benefits of transacting ERRs. © 2020 by the authors.","Avoided deforestation; Benefit sharing; Carbon rights; Emissions trading; REDD+; Voluntary carbon markets","Commerce; Deforestation; Developing countries; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Benefit sharing; Emission reduction; Emission trading systems; Financial benefits; Forest activities; Forest degradation; Market transactions; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Carbon; carbon emission; deforestation; developing world; emission control; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; United Nations; Carbon; Commerce; Deforestation; Developing Countries; Environmental Regulations; Greenhouse Gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091225072

Paradoxically, Colombia is also the sixth largest coal exporter globally, and its government has adopted policies to further increase the country’s production of coal and other fossil fuels. This article explores to what extent the national government reproduces a powerful paradigm–namely, that fossil fuel extraction is necessary for development–and how this resonates at the sub-national level. We find that the government’s narrative has evolved to accommodate Colombia’s changing national circumstances and public criticism. Though counternarratives exist, they have struggled to propose credible nationwide alternatives to extractive-based development, thus reinforcing the belief that extraction-based development is unavoidable. We describe how government narratives constitute an obstacle to both supply-side policies to restrict fossil fuel development and to transitional assistance policies to adjust to shifts in the global coal market. Key policy insights The view that fossil fuel extraction is necessary for development is a powerful barrier to supply–side climate policy. This view also hinders the formulation of transitional assistance policy. Empirical evidence that fossil fuel extraction seldom leads to equitable development is not enough to overcome this view. Narratives on fossil fuel-based development continuously adjust to prevailing economic development paradigms and contemporary development challenges. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coal; Colombia; extractivism; narratives; transition","coal production; economic development; environmental economics; environmental policy; extraction; fossil fuel; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079120086

Using the guest's photophysical behavior in solution as a benchmark, a comprehensive study using a variety of typical TADF organic light-emitting diode hosts with different characteristics provides a clearer understanding of guest-host interactions and what affects emitter performance in solid state. We investigate which are the key host characteristics that directly affect charge-transfer (CT) state energy and singlet triplet energy gaps. Using time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we use the CT state energy distribution obtained from the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the emission band and correlate this with other photophysical properties such as the apparent dynamic red shift of CT emission on-set to estimate the disorder-induced heterogeneity of D-A dihedral angles and singlet triplet gaps. Further, the delayed emission stabilization energy value and time-dependent CT band fwhm are shown to be related to a combination of host's rigidity, emitter molecule packing, and the energy difference between guest and host lowest energy triplet states. Concentration dependence studies show that emitter dimerization/aggregation can improve as well as reduce emission efficiency depending on the characteristics of the host. Two similar host materials, mCPCN and mCBPCN, with optimum host characteristics show completely different behaviors, and their hosting potential is extensively explored. We demonstrate that type I and type III TADF emitters behave differently in the same host and that the materials with intrinsic small ΔEST have the smallest disorder-induced CT energy and reverse intersystem crossing rate dispersion.

The importance of such an analysis becomes even more evident when considering if the system's state would change due to either the effectuation of a policy measure or a shift in the external drivers of the system.

These important sites represent cultural heritage and contain unique past environmental, ecological, and climate information. Stewardship of these cultural resources is generally limited to mitigation and salvage of immediately threatened sites, with little forethought given to secondary impacts of climate change. Secondary impacts are defined in this paper as climate-driven resettlement and associated development and may result in destruction of archaeological sites via resettlement of affected populations. The United Nations predicts increases above existing rates of resettlement of climate-affected communities from areas in which in situ infrastructure adaptations are not economically feasible, legal, or physically possible. Resulting development will likely disturb archaeological sites in interior regions. These cultural, environmental, and climate archives may be lost if urgent, unplanned climate-driven resettlement overwhelms state and local protections. Thus, planning for climate-driven resettlement should include standard methods for assessing threats to archaeological sites. Using Southern Maine as a pilot study, we report a trial methodology for identifying towns likely to experience rapid increases in population and infrastructure development related to climate-driven resettlement. Socioeconomic and demographic data, land cover change analyses, and archaeological records are combined in this risk assessment framework. The products are town-level maps that identify archaeological sites threatened by secondary impacts of climate change (climate-driven migration). This tool enables prioritization of threatened sites prior to potential destruction by large-scale migration and associated economic development and makes timely development compliance with federal and state legislation more likely. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Archaeology; Climate change; Climate-driven resettlement; Cultural resource management; Migration; Sea-level rise","climate change; climate effect; cultural heritage; cultural influence; human settlement; infrastructural development; migration determinant; nature-society relations; state role; Maine; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085289087

A seasonal cycle in community compensation depth (Zc), a key parameter involved in the estimation of biological production in ecosystem models is been retrieved without any prior information. Zc typically is assumed to be a constant in ecosystem models but in reality it undergoes a seasonal cycle as evidenced by observations and model simulations. To retrieve the seasonality in compensation depth via inversion, the Indian Ocean is divided into 8 key regions and Zc is optimized for each climatological month in each region. The data-based inversions with surface ocean pCO2 and upper ocean phosphate as observational constraints retrieve a seasonal cycle in Zc consistent with what is identified by the biological parameterization in our earlier study (Sreeush et al., 2018). When implemented in the model, the data-based estimation of Zc significantly reduce the RMSE of CO2 flux and pCO2 over major parts of the Indian Ocean as compared to that of a process-based estimation of Zc from Sreeush et al. (2018). The results here demonstrate that surface ocean pCO2 data, as compared to upper ocean phosphate, offers a stronger observational constraint on the estimation of biology in upwelling regions. Surface ocean pCO2 is an integrated response to the solubility and biological pumps and it is apparent that the constraint imposed by pCO2 is able to cascade through the system to improve estimates of the community compensation depth and translate to reduced biases in various other biogeochemical variables. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cyclo-stationary Bayesian inversion; Export and new production; Indian ocean carbon cycle; Upwelling zones; Varying compensation depth","Bayesian networks; Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Bayesian approaches; Bayesian inversion; Biological production; Indian ocean; Integrated response; New production; Ocean biogeochemistry models; Varying compensation depth; Oceanography; Bayesian analysis; biogeochemistry; biological production; biological pump; carbon dioxide; phosphate; upper ocean; upwelling; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069607107

After political changes, the Czech government put forward a research program to determine if air pollution is really affecting human health. This program, later called the “Teplice Program”, was initiated in collaboration with scientists from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). This cooperation made possible the use of methods on the contemporary level. The very high concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter of 10 micrometers or less (PM10), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in the air showed, for the first time, the impact of air pollutants on the health of the population in mining districts: adverse pregnancy outcomes, the impact of air pollution on sperm morphology, learning disabilities in children, and respiratory morbidity in preschool children. A surprising result came from the distribution of the sources of pollution: 70% of PM10 pollution came from local heating and not from power plants as expected. Thanks to this result, the Czech government supported changes in local heating from brown coal to natural gas. This change substantially decreased SO2 and PM10 pollution and affected mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality. © 2020 by the author.

Among the main barriers that slow down the GPPBR, a lack of knowledge of the parties involved can be highlighted. Faced with this scenario, the aim of this article is to provide a compilation, as a preliminary state of the art, of the most important environmental measures to bring to the GPPBR specifications. The methodology used for this compilation and critical analysis consisted of a systematic search for laws, regulations and guides prepared by Spanish public administrations, as well as looking into other international information sources, mainly collected from the EU. Despite the fact that related technical information is abundant, it is scattered and at times impractical. This study can be useful as a basis for both drafting specifications and highlighting the need to develop other specific and advanced technical procedures to assist GPPBR professionals. © 2020 by the authors.","Circular economy; Construction; Energy; Environmental; Green; Green public procurement; Innovation; Renovation; Sustainable","building; environmental planning; European Union; methodology; public administration; regulatory approach; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091367543

The recent developments in materials and technologies of HRESs are cost-effective and are more suitable power options for isolated rural areas. Many researchers have reported to have enhanced the performance of HRESs across India. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive review of various HRESs that have been reported for their performance evaluation with respect to economic distance limit, techno-economic sensitivity, and optimum analysis. Also, different hybrid combinations are compared based on the factor of Net Present Cost (NPC), Cost of Energy (COE), renewable fraction, maximum renewable penetration, operational cost, and/or emission. Some case studies on various combinations of HRES for telecommunication application, rural electrification and water distillation are discussed and compared. It is concluded from the comprehensive review that there is scope for further studies on hybrid system across the country with adoption of different and newer combinations, materials and thermodynamic approaches.

Incorporating the parameters of probability distribution with covariates, such as time or climate indices, has become a common way to develop drought index considering nonstationarity. However most previous drought studies emphasized more on the linear relationship between distribution parameters and related covariates, which may neglect the inherent nonlinear relationship and lost useful information for drought assessment. Our study aims to develop a Nonstationary Standardized Precipitation Index (NSPI) with distribution parameters nonlinearly varying with potential influencing climate indices. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB) of China are selected as the case study area to examine the performance of the NSPI with the performance of the traditional standardized precipitation index (SPI). Results indicate that the NSPI (with climate indices as covariates) is more robust than both the NSPI (with time as the covariate) and the traditional SPI. Furthermore, the nonlinear dependence of distribution parameters on climate indices considered in the nonstationary model can be more suitable for drought assessment than the linear dependence of distribution parameters. Besides, there exists a higher frequency of extreme drought by the NSPI than the SPI in recent decades in most regions of the MLRYRB. Although the NSPI is a little computationally expensive with more required inputs of climate variables, it can depict the influence of changing environment on the drought occurrence, thus can be a feasible alternative for drought assessment considering nonstationarity in view of future change and provide valuable support for further studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Meteorological drought; Nonlinear dependence; Nonstationarity; Standardized Precipitation Index","Climate change; Drought; Probability distributions; Stream flow; Watersheds; Distribution parameters; Feasible alternatives; Hydrometeorological variables; Middle and lower reaches of the yangtze rivers; Middle and lower reaches of yangtze rivers; Non-linear relationships; Non-stationary model; Standardized precipitation index; Climate models; covariance analysis; drought; environmental assessment; global change; hydrometeorology; precipitation intensity; probability; China; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085739590

Aiming at the cultural diversity of micro subjects, this paper introduces the provincial dynamic index of cultural diversity and, from the perspective of environmental regulation, combines environmental regulation types such as energy regulation, economic regulation, and administrative regulation, to empirically study the impact of cultural difference on carbon emission reduction. We found that cultural diversity had a significant negative impact on carbon emission effects, and there is a one-way Granger causality between the two. Cultural diversity and environmental regulations exerted a synergistic impact on carbon emission effects. Through specific mechanism tests, the intermediary effect of environmental regulations was confirmed. Cultural diversity influenced carbon emission effects through the mediation of environmental regulations. From the perspective of the refined characteristics of different regions, possible cultural diversity in the southern region and regional energy consumption characteristics significantly affected carbon emission effects. On the basis of the conclusions reached in this empirical research, we put forward the following policy suggestions: emphasis should be placed on the function of culture and other non-institutional factors in the practice of environmental regulations; bottom-up environmental protection incentives must be strengthened, and required expression channels should be perfected; the role of various environmental regulations must be given full play in the process of carbon emission reduction. © 2020 by the authors.

To understand how maize yield loss is affected by global warming, daily precipitation and temperatures, together with provincial agricultural data sets, were analyzed. The results showed that the accumulated temperature, an important factor in agricultural productivity, increased by 5% in 1991-2017, compared to 1961-1990, and that the frequency of low temperatures decreased by 14.8% over the same time period. An increase in drought by 21.6% was observed from 1961-1990 to 1991-2017, caused by decreased growing-season precipitation by -4 mm/decade. In addition, days with heavy rain in August and September increased slightly in Northeast China. In general, maize growth responded positively to the increased thermal conditions; in 1961-1990, 22.7% of observed maize yield-loss cases were due to low temperatures, but only 10% in 1991-2017. However, during the same time, the number of drought-induced yield loss cases increased from 27.3% to 46.7%. Moreover, yield loss cases caused by heavy rainstorms increased from 4.5% to 13.3%, indicating that heavy rainstorms have become an increasing threat to agriculture in Northeast China over the last three decades. In total, at least 70% of cases of provincial yield losses in Northeast China over the last three decades could be attributed to climatic factors. The frequency of climate hazards has changed under global warming, resulting in new challenges for agriculture. While drought and low temperatures were the primary causes for climate-induced yield losses before the 1990s, negative impacts from extreme events, mainly drought but also heavy precipitation, have increased in the last three decades, associated with global change. Farmers, agricultural scientists, and government policy makers could use these results when planning for adaptation to climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Drought; Low temperature; Maize","adaptation; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; global warming; government; growing season; maize; China; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092351291

China is a vast country with substantial economic level and air quality disparities among cities. Consequently, policy-makers face challenges in implementing regional collaborative governances. Here, we use the bivariate local indicator of spatial association (LISA) statistic to reveal the spatial heterogeneous relationship between local per capita GDP and nearby air quality, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5). This study was conducted in 256 prefecture-level cities for the year 2015. The results show that 20, 28, 30, 28, and 187 cities were identified as the HpcgdpHpm2.5, LpcgdpLpm2.5, LpcgdpHpm2.5, HpcgdpLpm2.5, and ‘not significant’ typologies, respectively. Furthermore, LpgdpHpm2.5 cities are mainly located in the northern China, whereas HpcgdpLpm2.5 cities are mainly distributed in the Guangdong provinces. The underlying causes may be attributed to the differences in economic structures. We found that LpgdpHpm2.5 cities has approximate 60% more coal-fired power plants, 2.3 times iron and steel plants than those of HpgdpLpm2.5 cities, whereas the latter attracted 5.1 times as much investment capitals from foreign, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as the former. This indicates the industries of HpgdpLpm2.5 cities have higher technology levels and lower emission intensities. Thus, policy makers should accelerate economic transformation, especially in Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces. Overall, our findings suggest that not only bivariate LISA statistic is a simple and useful approach to distinguish city typologies, but also provide the evidences for those cities responsible for air quality of adjacent cities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bivariate local indicator of spatial association (LISA); City typologies; Nearby air quality; Per Capita GDP","Coal; Decision making; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Investments; Iron and steel plants; Steelmaking; Coal-fired power plant; Economic structure; Economic transformation; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Guangdong Province; Investment capital; Regional collaborative; Spatial associations; Air quality; air quality; emission; Gross Domestic Product; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; correlational study; economic development; electric power plant; energy resource; environmental economics; Hong Kong; Macao; particulate matter; per capita gross domestic product; Taiwan; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Henan; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084831463

In this study, a factorial sensitivity analysis method has been proposed to screen out statistically significant schemes and interactions, which assists in selecting the optimized physical scheme combination from a long-term perspective with affordable computational costs. The Regional Climate Model (RegCM) is used as an example to illustrate how the approach works. In detail, all schemes are fully tested through 120 experimental runs based on a factorial design; the contributions and statistical significance (P value) of individual schemes and their interactions to temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction are then quantified. The performance of the proposed approach is then demonstrated through a case study of Canada. The results indicate that there exist considerable spatial and temporal simulated variations associated with different scheme combinations. It is also suggested that individual physical schemes have dominant influences on simulated variations, but some effects explained by their interactions are statistically significant and thus cannot be neglected. In particular, the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme, moisture scheme, and land surface model are found to be the dominant factors affecting the uncertainties of temperature, precipitation, and wind speed in future climate projections over Canada, respectively. Furthermore, the potential relationships between the vegetation cover conditions and the sensitivity of physical schemes are explored. The proposed approach is an attempt to analyze the sensitivity influenced by not only individual physical schemes and also their multilevel interactions. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

The purpose of such pilot project is to promote low-carbon development and encourage policy innovation, but the role of nested structure has not been fully appreciated. Based on the survey data of low-carbon pilot cities, this paper finds that nested structure has a positive impact on policy innovation and discusses the impact on policy innovation from three dimensions: the nested pilot, the nested policy and the nested department. Heckman selection Model and Possion Model are used to make an empirical analysis of the factors influencing policy innovation and used a case study to explore the mechanism. The results show that the nested structure has a positive effect on policy innovation in pilot projects of low-carbon cities with weak incentives and weak constraints. Specifically, the participation of local governments in low-carbon related pilot projects, the number of low-carbon policies introduced by local governments, and the participation of local government departments in the process of low-carbon governance have a positive impact on policy innovation.

The NDR is instantiated with two neural networks: feedforward neural network (FFNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), which have different ways of processing traffic information in the near past, and are compared in terms of their performances. The NDR is implemented within a microscopic traffic simulation (S-Paramics) for a real-world network in West Glasgow, where the off-line training of the NDR amounts to a simulation-based optimization aiming to reduce delay, CO2 and black carbon emissions. The emission calculations are based on the high-fidelity vehicle dynamics generated by the simulation, and the AIRE instantaneous emission model.

Although S-CO2 is reported as a powerful cleaning agent, the performance of a power system operating with S-CO2 will also inevitably degrade over time. Previous researchers have shown that turbomachinery deterioration could be a major subject regarding the system performance degradation. Nevertheless, no quantitative evaluation has yet been made so far. In this study, the impact of the performance degradation of the S-CO2 turbomachinery on the overall performance of the system is analyzed quantitatively. The concept of Health Parameter is used to simulate turbomachinery degradation. To quantify the impact, an S-CO2 direct-cycle small modular reactor is selected as a target system. A transient analysis platform is built using a nuclear system safety analysis code and the deep neural network (DNN)-based S-CO2 turbomachinery off-design performance model. System dynamics are evaluated for primary frequency control ability and secondary loadfollowing capability. Results show that the control problems during the transient state can occur when the output fluctuations are large and the performance degradation is severe. It has been confirmed that even control failures of the PID controllers can occur. Therefore, the performance degradation of turbomachinery must be monitored and considered, for an operation strategy for S-CO2 systems.

As well as following up on the Indonesian Government's commitment to reduce carbon emissions, a Presidential decree Perpres Number 18 of 2016 concerning the Acceleration of the Development of Waste-Based Power Plants was made. It is expected that the construction of Waste-Based Power Plants from landfills can reduce the budget deficit in handling municipal waste while maintaining environmental preservation. This research calculates the potential of landfill gas that can be produced from the landfill waste dumps of Jatibarang, as well as the capacity of electrical energy that can be produced. Furthermore, with several types of plant scenarios used, it can be seen the economic feasibility of the construction of a Waste Based Power Plant in Jatibarang landfill. The landfill gas potential and economic feasibility for this study are calculated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Inventory Software and LFG-CostWeb from LandGEM.

Estimated ages for samples that contain a mixture of young and old groundwater will be particularly sensitive to model parametrization as relatively small additions of modern 14C from recent recharge can mask the presence and amount of old groundwater. A novel multi-model approach based on inverse geochemical modeling and lumped parameter modeling of age tracers (3H, 3Hetrit, and SF6) was used to better constrain 14C dilution caused by dissolution of carbonates in the unsaturated zone or shallow parts of the Glacial aquifer, which extends over 2000 miles across the northern contiguous United States. Calibration of 14C inverse geochemical models to LPM computed 14C concentrations in modern water indicated that 14C of soil zone and shallow aquifer carbonates were not 14C-dead (0 pmC), as is typically assumed for 14C correction models. 14C of such carbonates was on average about 53 pmC (ranged 0–110 pmC, n = 72). This information was used to correct 14C concentrations for water recharged entirely before 1950 and water that is a mixture of pre- and post-1950 water. The multi-model approach developed here was compared to an analytical 14C-adjustment model (Revised Fontes and Garnier) that assumed solid carbonates were 14C-dead. 14C corrections using the analytical adjustment model tended to over-correct final 14C concentrations by 21 pmC and underestimates mean ages by 40% for groundwater mixtures. In fact, 14C corrections based on analytical model yielded negative ages (14C &gt; 120 pmC) in nearly 36% of mixed samples. This work presents a new approach to constraining 14C corrections and age estimates of mixtures of young and old groundwater. The new method is applied to three well networks distributed across the spatially expansive Glacial aquifer. © 2020","Geochemical correction; Groundwater age; Mixed groundwater sources; Radiocarbon; Soil processes","Aquifers; Carbonates; Glacial geology; Groundwater resources; Inverse problems; Mixtures; Uncertainty analysis; Correction approaches; Correction models; Geochemical models; Geochemical process; Groundwater ages; Inverse Geochemical modeling; Lumped parameter modeling; Model parametrization; Hydrochemistry; concentration (composition); correction; dissolution; estimation method; geochemistry; groundwater; parameterization; radiocarbon dating; recharge; soil water; vadose zone; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084632051

It has the potential to reduce carbon monoxide emissions from the SI engines due to its high hydrogen-To-carbon ratio. However, short running distance is an issue of the NGVs. In this work, methodologies to improve the fuel economy of a heavy-duty commercial truck under the Japanese Heavy-Duty Driving Cycle (JE05) is proposed by numerical 1D-CFD modeling. The main objective is a comparative analysis to find an optimal fuel economy under three variable mechanisms, variable valve timing (VVT), variable valve actuation (VVA), and variable compression ratio (VCR). Experimental data are taken from a six-cylinder turbocharged SI engine fueled by city gas 13A. The 9.83 L production engine is a CR11 type with a multi-point injection system operated under a stoichiometric mixture. For minimizing optimal valve strategy selections and engine testing procedures, a one-dimensional engine model is developed in GT-Power software using experimental data and engine specifications provided by a project partner. The model is built using the same theory as of spark-ignition engines. Knock prediction is based on the Shell model, and a spark timing optimization logic is coupled to the model. In-cylinder pressure, rate of heat release, brake mean effective pressure, and maximum brake torque spark ignition timings are well reproduced, as compared with that of 12 experimental operating points under engine speed and load variations. In order to build a baseline brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) map in the driving cycle, the simulation model is used to generate 51 BSFC points, as proposed in the JE05 cycle under speed-Torque changes. From the baseline engine model, the average fuel economy of the heavy-duty natural gas truck is 4.14 km/L. 0.5 % and 2.43% of simulated fuel economy improvements are found when the engine is operated under VVT and VVA mechanisms (fixed lifts), respectively. Significant fuel economy improvement is achieved at about 6.31% under VCR engine operation compared with the baseline engine model. © 2020 SAE International.

This framework is then applied to a real-world case at the urban neighbourhood scale in order to illustrate how social learning unfolded in a grassroots transdisciplinary coproduction process focused on climate action. We find that a social practice perspective illuminates the material and nonmaterial dimensions of the relationship between social learning and transdisciplinary coproduction. In decoupling these properties from individual human agency, the SPT perspective affords a means of tracing their emergence among social actors, generating a deeper understanding of how social learning arises and effects change, and sustainability can be reinforced. © 2020 by the authors.","Social learning; Sustainability transitions; Transdisciplinary coproduction","analytical framework; grassroots level; interdisciplinary approach; learning; neighborhood; social development; sustainability; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091183482

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are produced at various stages of the process (including for instance, from fuel used in dredging equipment). One substantial and site-dependent source of GHG emissions is associated with carbon stock losses resulting from the disturbance and extraction of fill from vegetated marine ecosystems. In this article we focus on these sources of GHG emissions and assess, for the first time, the potential carbon loss from mangrove ecosystems caused by land reclamation activities. To this end, we take a case study of a regionally significant, large-scale reclamation project in Jakarta Bay, Indonesia. The extent of mangroves likely to be impacted by the project was estimated by analysing land satellite (LANDSAT) imagery in the period before and after the start of reclamation activities. The carbon stored in the affected areas was then estimated using field measurements to determine total stocks (biomass and soil organic carbon). Mangroves in the study area at Serang (where sand mining is designated) and Angke (adjacent to deposition site) were estimated to store on average 203.64 Mg C ha−1, and 531.53 Mg C ha−1 respectively. The lower carbon stocks at Serang are a consequence of sand mining that occurred there in 2003. The regrown mangroves at Serang are smaller than that at Angke. The near-surface soil organic carbon (SOC) content at Serang was less than at Angke, 17% and 43% of the total respectively. Results also reveal that around 75% of total carbon stocks in both sites are in the form of SOC. We suggest that collating this sort of information about carbon stocks in sites impacted by land reclamation activities can help development planners identify opportunities to reduce GHG emissions. To illustrate, long-term carbon losses due to land reclamation in the case study area could be reduced if dredging is limited to 1 m depth and mangrove areas are actively rehabilitated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon stock; Land reclamation; Mangroves; Satellite mapping","Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Organic carbon; Reclamation; Satellite imagery; Affected area; Biomass and soils; Dependent sources; Dredging equipment; Field measurement; Industrial development; Mangrove ecosystems; Reclamation project; Land reclamation; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; dredging; extraction method; greenhouse gas; industrial development; land reclamation; mangrove; marine environment; satellite imagery; vulnerability; Greater Sunda Islands; Jakarta; Jakarta Bay; Java; Sunda Isles; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087381800

Tm3+-RENPs displayed photoluminescence from the UV to near-infrared (NIR), and the dominant high-photon-order upconversion emission of these RENPs was tunable by Tm3+ doping. Similarly, Er3+- and Ho3+-RENPs with green and red upconversion showed wide color tuning, depending on the doping amount and excitation power density. From steady-state power plot and photoluminescence decay studies we have observed respective changes in upconversion photon order and average lifetime that attest to a number of cross-relaxation processes occurring at higher RE3+ doping concentration. Particularly in the case of Tm3+-RENPs, cross-relaxation promotes four- and five-photon order upconversion emission in the UV and blue spectral regions. The quantum yield of high-order upconversion emission was on par with classic Yb3+/Tm3+-doped systems, yet due to the high number of sensitizer ions in the LiYbF4 host these RENPs are expected to be brighter and thus better suited for applications such as controlled drug delivery or optogenetics. Overall, LiYbF4:RE3+/LiYF4 RENPs are promising systems to effectively generate high-order upconversion emissions, owing to excitation energy confinement within the Yb3+ network and its efficient funneling to the activator dopants. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Infrared devices; Lithium compounds; Nanoparticles; Photoluminescence; Photons; Rare earths; Spectrum analyzers; Thulium alloys; Ytterbium compounds; Cross-relaxation process; Doping concentration; Energy confinement; Excitation power density; Photoluminescence decay; Rare earth nanoparticles; Spectral characterization; Up-conversion emission; Controlled drug delivery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090080045

The primary factor that determines the efficiency of the charge mode and the technological process is the coefficient of excess carbon in the furnace bath. The fluctuations in the effective capacity of the furnace; its distribution over the zones of the arc, charge, and melt; and the active resistances of these zones are caused by the regular deviations of this coefficient from unity. Such deviations are induced by uncontrolled changes in the humidity of the reducing agents. Carbon deficiency and excess modes affect the state of charge and melt zones and the distribution of electric energy on the arc discharge power. Transient processes that occur when the composition of the charge on the dosing unit is changed, as well as the direct supply of the reducing agent to the furnace mouth and reflecting changes in the charge zone conductivity, are studied. Results reveal that transient processes are accompanied by high material and energy losses and their duration, depending on the volume of the bath and the effective capacity of the furnace, can exceed 4 h. On the basis of the analysis of the changes in charge conductivity and arc power, the negative consequences of the layer-by-layer charge loading method adopted for smelting industrial silicon are presented; these consequences are based on the alternation of charge supply, with an excess and shortage of the reducing agent. In the absence of reliable methods for the continuous monitoring of the moisture content of reducing agents in the charge stream, the coefficient of carbon excess must be evaluated by changing the resistance of the melt zone, which reflects changes in the size of the carbide layer that is formed due to the imbalance of silicon carbide and silicon monoxide. Such evaluation can determine the degree of imbalance of the reducing agent in the mixture and apply the currently required control effect on the composition of the charging material in a timely manner. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","control of the furnace mode; electric mode of the furnace; furnace bath; industrial silicon; ore-thermal furnace; process control in the charge; silicon; silicon reduction","Carbon; Electric power distribution; Energy dissipation; Ferroalloys; Furnaces; Moisture control; Silicon carbide; Active resistance; Carbon deficiencies; Continuous monitoring; Conversion process; Effective capacity; Electric energies; Technological process; Transient process; Reducing agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091538136

Present study was undertaken to assess the heavy metal load in Yamuna water and surrounding soils of the river bank and its impact on soil enzyme activities. Long term impact of irrigation by Yamuna water on the activities of various soil enzymes namely dehydrogenase (DHA), urease (UA), fluroscein diacetate (FDA), aryl sulphatase (ASA), nitrate reductase (NRA), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) were assessed. The sensitivity of soil enzymes to heavy metals were observed as DHA>UA>ASA>NRS. Total organic carbon, easily oxidisable soil organic carbon, available phosphorus and available potassium in different sites varied significantly. Total heavy metal contents in soils showed a decreasing order: Fe>Mn>Zn>Cr>Ni>Cu>Pb>Co>As>Cd and the DTPA extractable heavy metal contents followed the order: Mn>Cu>Pb>Zn >Fe>Ni>Cd>Cr>Co>As.

These technologies can create more employment opportunities in rural as well as urban areas and supplement conventional energy sources in addition to reducing carbon emission. For starting a new business, economic feasibility needs to be assessed in terms of break-even analysis and economic attributes. Banks provide loans only on the basis of economic attributes of the project. Therefore, an attempt has been made to determine the various economic indicators for a unit of three novel solar thermal devices namely, animal feed solar cooker, non-tracking solar cooker and solar dryer for guiding new entrepreneurs. The different economic parameters such as break-even point, net present value, pay back period, benefit-cost ratio, annuity and internal rate of return were determined and found highly profitable while judging the economic viability of the solar devices business. On the basis of break-even-analysis, fabrication and sale of only 37 units annually is sufficient to reach a state of no profit and no loss. The net average annual benefit accrued from this business fabricating 100 units annually is INR 189 800 ($ 2 673). In addition, this business can play a vital role in providing employment to four persons. It also has a great potential to reduce CO2 emission. © 2020, Int.

Such processes can inform strategies for human timescale carbon storage to mitigate climate change impacts and thus more detailed knowledge of sulfur incorporation into biomass species is needed. Until recently, detailed chemical characterization of sulfurized organic matter was only possible by analyzing individual building blocks obtained after desulfurization reactions. In this study, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS), with atmospheric pressure photoionization in positive ion mode, (+) APPI, was used to investigate the chemical composition of sulfur rich crude oils and to obtain mechanistic insights into the sulfur incorporation reactions happening during early diagenesis. Contrary to expectations, (+) APPI FTICR-MS data show that sulfurized lipids (with up to 6 sulfur atoms and up to m/z 1100) occur as free molecules in these oils, rather than within a macromolecular network linked by (poly)sulfide bridges. In contrast to the mature Peace River (Canada) oils, the thermally immature Rozel Point (USA) and Jianghan Basin (China) oils show a carbon number preference in sulfurized species resembling biogenic precursor molecules, which highlights the importance of S-bound molecules as geochemical proxies for early diagenetic processes. This study indicates that sulfur incorporation reactions involve the formation of S-cyclic structures in which the double bond equivalent is ≥ the number of S atoms. Collision induced dissociation (CID-) FTICR-MS experiments suggest the occurrence of intermolecular sulfur incorporation reactions, but only as a mechanism that is secondary to intramolecular sulfur addition. The CID-FTICR-MS experiments indicated that steroid sulfurization typically yields S-bearing cyclic structures and that thiol/thioether groups may be present throughout the chemical matrix but only to a minor extent. In addition, CID-FTICR-MS also confirms the occurrence of sulfurized alkenones in low maturity oils. Knowledge of organic sulfur molecule formation informs routes for carbon dioxide removal technologies that could be used to sequester carbon in the geosphere and/or hydrosphere in the form of recalcitrant organic species. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; Crude oil; FTICR-MS; Organic geochemistry; Organosulfur compounds","Atmospheric pressure; Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Chemical bonds; Climate change; Crude oil; Digital storage; Drug products; Fourier series; Mass spectrometry; Molecules; Organic compounds; Positive ions; Sedimentology; Sulfur; Atmospheric pressure photo ionization; Carbon dioxide removal; Chemical characterization; Collision induced dissociation; Desulfurization reaction; Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry; Macromolecular networks; Sedimentary organic matter; Sulfur dioxide; carbon storage; chemical composition; chemical reaction; diagenesis; geochemistry; mass spectrometry; organic matter; Canada; China; Hunan; Jianghan Basin; Peace Basin [Canada]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088019731

At the domestic scale, WEF trade-offs are fairly limited; while all sectors require considerable amounts of energy, the requirements for water and food production are modest compared to other uses. At the international scale, revenues from oil exports in the GCC allow the region to compensate for low food production and scarce water availability. This dependency is dynamic over time, increasing when oil prices are low and food prices are high. We show how reducing domestic trade-offs can lead to higher exposure internationally, with rice imports originating in regions where groundwater is being depleted. However, Saudi Arabia's increased wheat imports, after reversing its food self-sufficiency policy, have had limited effects on groundwater depletion elsewhere. Climate change mitigation links the WEF nexus to the global scale. While there is great uncertainty about future international climate policy, our analysis illustrates how implementation of measures to account for the social costs of carbon would reduce the oil and gas revenues available to import food and desalinate water in the GCC. © 2020 The Author(s).

Compared to the same period in 2017–2019, the daily O3 mean concentrations increased at urban stations by 24% in Nice, 14% in Rome, 27% in Turin, 2.4% in Valencia and 36% in Wuhan during the lockdown in 2020. This increase in O3 concentrations is mainly explained by an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O3 titration by NO. Strong reductions in NO2 mean concentrations were observed in all European cities, ~53% at urban stations, comparable to Wuhan (57%), and ~65% at traffic stations. NO declined even further, ~63% at urban stations and ~78% at traffic stations in Europe. Reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 at urban stations were overall much smaller both in magnitude and relative change in Europe (~8%) than in Wuhan (~42%). The PM reductions due to limiting transportation and fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings were partly offset by increases of PM emissions from the activities at home in some of the cities. The NOx concentrations during the lockdown were on average 49% lower than those at weekends of the previous years in all cities. The lockdown effect on O3 production was ~10% higher than the weekend effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan, while for PM the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Southern Europe (~6% of difference). This study highlights the challenge of reducing the formation of secondary pollutants such as O3 even with strict measures to control primary pollutant emissions. These results are relevant for designing abatement policies of urban pollution. © 2020","Air quality; Coronavirus; Lockdown; Ozone; Risk assessment","Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Office buildings; Ozone; Reduction; Commercial building; European cities; Mean concentrations; Ozone pollution; Primary pollutants; Southern Europe; Urban pollutions; Weekend effects; Air pollution; fuel; nitric oxide; ozone; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; emission inventory; ozone; policy approach; policy development; quarantine; respiratory disease; urban area; urban pollution; viral disease; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; Europe; pandemic; particulate matter; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quarantine; titrimetry; traffic and transport; urban area; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Alpes Maritimes; China; Comunidad Valencia; France; Hubei; Italy; Lazio; Nice; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; Spain; Valencia [Comunidad Valencia]; Valencia [Valencia (PRV)]; Wuhan; Coronavirus; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084858597

It is also endorsed as a healthy means of transportation in terms of reducing the risk of developing a range of physical and psychological conditions. However, people might not be aware of the negative health impacts of cycling near heavy traffic. This study aimed to compare personal exposure with particulate air pollution among cyclists commuting in Perth, Western Australia. The study involved 122 number of cyclists riding bicycles in four different routes: two routes within community areas (Route 1 and Route 2) and two routes near freeways (Route 3 and Route 4). The participants were males and females aged between 20 and 55 years with the selection criteria including non-smokers who cycle at least 150 km/week—ideally along one of the four study routes. Personal exposure of respirable particulate air pollution during cycling at the high and low level of exertions (self-perceived) were assessed. Ambient concentrations of selected air pollutants were also measured at each cycling route. We found that Route 3 appeared to be the most polluted route and concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide exceeded the Australian standards. This study concluded that personal exposure to respirable particles was influenced by the speed, time of cycling and seasonal variation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Ambient air pollution; Bicycle route; Criteria air pollutant; Cyclist; Particulate matter; Road traffic","atmospheric pollution; commuting; concentration (composition); greenhouse gas; nitrogen dioxide; noise pollution; particulate matter; physical activity; pollution exposure; psychology; sulfur dioxide; traffic congestion; Perth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087722138

In order to assess the air pollution reduction effect of the coal substitution policy in Liaoning Province, this paper proposes a data grouping grey model with a fractional order accumulation (FDGGM (1,1)). The empirical analysis results show that the new grey model can predict the monthly coal consumption more accurately than the traditional DGGM (1,1) model. The MAPEs of the training set in the FDGGM(1,1) and DGGM(1,1) models are 4.58% and 5.48%, and the MAPEs of the test set are 23.89% and 33.78%, respectively. And the policy achieves a great success based on the FDGGM(1,1) model. During the policy implementation period (from January 2015 to December 2018), the coal consumption in Liaoning Province decreased by 27.2501 million tons, while the emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx fell by 0.714, 0.2316 and 0.2017 million tons, respectively.

The well-known Sequential Quadratic Programming mathematical method (SQP-Hessian approach) presents some limitations to achieve fuel consumption and emissions control optimization, as it is not able to find the global minimum, and it generally shows efficient results in local exploitation searches. The usage of a combined Modified Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (MABC) with the SQP approach is proposed in this work to obtain better optimal solutions and overcome these limitations. The optimization is performed with boundary conditions, considering that the optimized vehicle performance has to satisfy Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) constraints. The weighting factor of the vehicle's performance parameters in the objective function is varied, and optimization is carried out for two different driving cycles, namely Federal Test Procedure (FTP) and Economic commission Europe-Extra Urban Driving Cycle (ECE-EUDC), using the MABC and MABC with SQP approaches. The MABC with SQP approach shows better performance in terms of fuel consumption and emissions than the pure heuristic approach for the considered vehicle with similar boundary conditions. Moreover, it does not present significant penalties for final battery charging and it offers an optimized size of the key vehicle's components for different driving cycles. © 2020 by the authors.

Since IAMs produce least-cost pathways, technoeconomic parameters constitute one of the basic parameters. Traditionally, IAMs dealt with technologies with slowly-changing, relatively homogeneous manner. Since technologies are rapidly evolving, and the pattern of technological development is regionally heterogeneous, the IAM community must embrace a new strategy to treat their underlying technoeconomic parameters. Here we illustrate such challenges by reviewing the treatment and performance of IAMs with respect to some of the rapidly changing technologies (e.g., solar, wind, and batteries). Our review shows that IAMs have difficulty in updating the cost of the rapidly changing technologies. We then articulate a new strategy, drawing upon the lesson from the current model intercomparison projects and climate sciences. We argue that a loose network of modeling groups across the globe should create a database of technological parameters in a standardized format and standard evaluation tool, perhaps to be facilitated by the IAM Consortium. Such a framework would contribute to the review of the progress toward the Paris Agreement goals. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Best available database; Climate change mitigation; Energy scenario; Evaluation tool; Integrated assessment model; Technology-policy interaction","Climate change; Basic parameters; Climate science; Current modeling; Integrated assessment models; Standard evaluations; Techno-economics; Technological development; Technological parameters; Climate models; climate change; integrated approach; international agreement; numerical model; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084497009

Carbon clusters are modeled based on atom probe tomography (APT) observations. To express a transition process of carbon configurations from solid solution state to carbon cluster state to precipitation state during aging process, we reduce a carbon presence area with a fixed number of carbon atoms, i.e., the carbon concentration can be continuously increased. The MD simulations can represent the age hardening/softening tendency observed in the experiment and the carbon cluster state shows the maximum strength where the dislocation passes through the carbon cluster not by the Orowan but by the cutting mechanism. The MD analysis found that partial clusters in the carbon cluster act as the main resistance to dislocation passage; the biased distribution of carbon atoms is also confirmed in the actual observed carbon clusters by APT. A new interaction mechanism between dislocation and carbon clusters is developed based on the phenomena in the MD simulations and the availability is discussed. ©2020 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.","Carbon cluster; Dislocation; Mechanical property; Molecular dynamics; Precipitation hardening; Solid-solution hardening","Age hardening; Atoms; Edge dislocations; Low carbon steel; Molecular dynamics; Temperature; Atom-probe tomography; Atomic simulations; Carbon concentrations; Cutting mechanisms; Interaction mechanisms; Low temperature aging; Molecular dynamics simulations; Solid-solution state; Carbon clusters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094840403

The barely exergonic process that just conserves sufficient energy for a modest lifestyle involves chemically challenging reactions catalyzed by complex enzyme machineries with unique metal-containing cofactors. The basic strategy of the methanogenic energy metabolism is to covalently bind C1 species to the C1 carriers methanofuran, tetrahydromethanopterin, and coenzyme M at different oxidation states. The four reduction reactions from CO2 to methane involve one molybdopterin-based two-electron reduction, two coenzyme F420-based hydride transfers, and one coenzyme F430-based radical process. For energy conservation, one ion-gradient-forming methyl transfer reaction is sufficient, albeit supported by a sophisticated energy-coupling process termed flavin-based electron bifurcation for driving the endergonic CO2 reduction and fixation.

To understand the functions of various proteins in Clonorchis sinensis physiology and human clonorchiasis, the ESPs and tegument proteins of C. sinensis were identified. Supernatants containing ESPs from adult C. sinensis after culture for 6 h were harvested and concentrated. The tegument was detached using a freeze/thaw method and successively extracted using various extraction buffers. The outer surface proteins of C. sinensis were labeled with biotin, and the biotinylated proteins were purified. The ESP, tegument and labeled outer surface proteins were identified and analyzed by high-resolution LC-MS/MS. The identified proteins were compared with those of other flukes, and the protein functions associated with pathogenesis, carcinogenesis and potential vaccine antigens and drug targets were predicted and analyzed. A total of 175 proteins were identified after the 6-h culture of C. sinensis ESPs. A total of 352 tegument proteins were identified through sequential solubilization of the isolated teguments, and a subset of these proteins were localized to the surface membrane of the tegument by labeling with biotin. Thirty identified proteins, including annexins, actin and tetraspanins, were identified as potential immunomodulators and promising vaccine antigens. Interestingly, among the 352 tegument proteins, as many as 155 were enzymes, and most were oxidoreductases, hydrolases or transferases. A comparison of the outer surface proteins of C. sinensis with those of other flukes indicated that flukes have some common outer surface proteins, such as actin, tetraspanin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and annexin. Granulin, thioredoxin peroxiredoxin, carbonyl reductase 1 and cystatin were identified in the C. sinensis proteome and predicted to be related to liver disease and cancer. The analysis of the C. sinensis proteome could contribute to a more in-depth understanding of complex parasite-host relationships, improve the diagnosis of clonorchiasis and benefit research on the pathogenesis and development of novel interventions, drugs and vaccines to control C. sinensis infection. © Copyright © 2020 Shi, Yu, Liang, Huang, Ou, Wei, Wan, Yang, Zhang and Jiang.","biotinylation; C. sinensis; cholangiocarcinoma; proteomics; tegument","actin; annexin; cell surface protein; excretory secretory product; glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP); glutathione transferase; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; granulin; matrix protein; peroxiredoxin; protein; proteoheparan sulfate; proteome; succinate dehydrogenase; tetraspanin; thioredoxin; unclassified drug; uridine phosphorylase; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bioinformatics; biotinylation; clonorchiasis; Clonorchis sinensis; controlled study; fluorescence microscopy; gene ontology; host parasite interaction; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein determination; protein purification; rat; tandem mass spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092092418

Herein, it is reported that atomic cobalt species (ACS) anchored 2D tellurium nanosheets (Te NS) can act as a highly active single-atom cocatalyst for boosting photocatalytic H2 production and CO2 reduction reactions under visible light irradiation, wherein Te NS serves as the ideal support material to bridge the light absorbers and ACS catalytic sites for efficient electron transfer. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy reveals that the ACS are built by a Co center coordinated with five Co-O bonding, which are anchored on Te NS through one Co-Te bonding. The strong mutual interaction between the Te NS and ACS alters the electronic structure of Te NS, inducing the introduction of intermediate energy states, which act as trap sites to accommodate the photogenerated electrons for promoting photocatalytic reactions. This work may inspire further capability in designing other Te-based single-atom-catalysts for highly efficient solar energy conversion. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","cocatalysts; photocatalysis; single-atom-catalysts; tellurium nanosheets","Atoms; Catalysts; Cobalt metallography; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Energy conversion; Hydrogen production; Light; Nanosheets; Photocatalytic activity; Reaction intermediates; Solar energy; Tellurium compounds; X ray absorption; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; High catalytic performance; Intermediate energies; Mutual interaction; Photocatalytic reactions; Photogenerated electrons; Support interaction; Support materials; Visible-light irradiation; Tellurium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088979136

The climate of southern Africa is predicted to be severely affected by such changes. With agriculture noted as the continent's largest economic sector, issues such as food security and land degradation are in the forefront. In the light of such concerns we review the current literature to investigate if agroforestry systems (AFS) are a suitable response to the challenges besetting traditional agricultural caused by a changing climate. The benefits bestowed by AFS are multiple, offering ecosystem services, influence over crop production and positive impacts on rural livelihoods through provisioning and income generation. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps remain. We identify outstanding questions requiring further investigation such as the interplay between trees and crops and their combination, with a discussion of potential benefits. Furthermore, we identify deficiencies in the institutional and policy frameworks that underlie the adoption and stimulus of AFS in the southern African region. We uphold the concept that AFS remains an appropriate and sustainable response for an increased resilience against a changing climate in southern Africa for the benefit of livelihoods and multiple environmental values. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon; Climate-smart agriculture; Conservation agriculture; Environmental benefits; Food security; Social development; Southern African Development Community (SADC); Sustainable land use; Trees","adaptation; agricultural economics; agroforestry; climate change; climate effect; crop production; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; food security; livelihood; rural area; Southern Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091357508

Resources, historic development context, production, and greenhouse gas emissions of the steel sector in Ukraine are analyzed in relation to relevant patterns in the European Union, China, Russia, and worldwide. Several Best Available Technologies, suitable for deployment in Ukraine, are analyzed covering the experience of their implementation in various regions of the world, and their potential for saving energy and cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Two options of modernization with several differently diffused key Best Available Technologies related to sintering, ironmaking, steelmaking, and casting are elaborated, revealing the possibility of cutting the sector’s CO2 emissions in the range of 15.2%–21.8%. Further emissions reduction is possible using a wider range of Best Available Technologies including those related to power generation, rolling mills, etc. The strategic approaches to the sector’s modernization are discussed in the context of global scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency, placing particular emphasis on innovative ironmaking technologies. Modernization of iron and steel industry in Ukraine using Best Available Technologies is analyzed in view of short-term goals and a future need for more radical industrial transformations including commercialization of the novel smelting-reduction ironmaking technologies with higher potential of CO2 emissions reduction.

The emissions from the vehicles are currently counted amongst the main sources of air pollution in Delhi. This affects the quality of air. The emission criterion of various pollutants that are emitted from vehicles is evaluated through various International models, which include various vehicles, their modes of pollutants emitted while driving and other factors that are affecting the weather. The approximate emission of pollutants such as Carbon Monoxide (CO) and/or Particulate Matter (PM), from a variety of vehicles and different fuel types, has undergone diurnal variation over the years, depending on the time of the day. This study presents the emission factor of gaseous pollutants Hydrocarbons (HC), Carbon Monoxides (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) of 181 four-wheeler cars from different companies containing different types of fuels. The measurement of gaseous pollutants is performed for Delhi, the most polluted city in India. The various facts and data were calculated and analyzed with reference to the standard values set by the national schemes of the Pollution and Environment. Based on this statistical data obtained and analyzed, the scenarios regarding future vehicle growth rate and its impact on air quality are mentioned to overcome emission problems. Therefore, it is important to develop and deploy methods for obtaining real-world measurements of vehicle emissions, to estimate the pollutants. The analysis shows that few parameters need to be a concern for reducing the pollutants emission by vehicles. These major parameters are the high survival rates, decrease in annual mileage and major enforcement for three-to-five-year-old vehicles. This study shows that many old vehicles are used in different regions of the country, regardless of many notifications of banning old vehicles by the Government of India.

One such alternative source is solar energy but due to intermittent nature a thermal energy storage (TES) is required in order to deal with heat flux that varies throughout the day so as to supply a constant power. In the present study, the characterization of the sensible heat thermal energy storage (SHTES) packed with sensible heat storage material are considered. The size of pebbles varies between 20-25mm with porosity of the SHTES as 40%. The flow rate is 40 LPM and TES was charged for 8 hours. It has been noticed that when the temperature of the inlet air is around 180 C, the temperature of the top surface of the TES is around 70 C which states that for TES high thermal conductivity materials are required so that charging and discharging can take place at faster rate. The azimuthal and axial variation of temperature is also shown and it is concluded that even after low thermal conductivity of the material azimuthal variation can be neglected for the sake of modeling the TES. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092005271

Vegetation around urban area act as a sink where such metal enriched particles generally deposit on the foliar surfaces, however, role of vegetation in uptake of metals adhered on the atmospheric particulate matter is yet not explored properly and is important to study to evaluate their role as bio-remediator. The undertaken work examines the foliar surface of Morus alba for its potential to deposit and accumulate atmospheric heavy metals. Further, to understand foliar uptake mechanism and translocation of atmospheric metal enriched on particulate matter a simulated experiment was conducted by labeling the known particle size (45 μm and 120 μm) with radio labeled 65Zn, applied on the tagged leaf with two particle loads, 25 mg and 50 mg. The study showed that owing to its rough foliar surface with trichomes and grooves, Morus alba efficiently trap heavy metal enriched particles and was capable of accumulating metals from particulate matter into different plant parts. It was recorded that 65Zn adhered on different size particles was taken up by tagged leaf of mulberry and majorly translocated to the lower stem and roots. It was also inferred from the study that both particle size and particle load significantly affect the foliar uptake and translocation of atmospheric heavy metal. The study focuses on the fact that urban avenue trees are capable of taking up atmospheric heavy metals and can play a crucial role in improving air quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Foliar uptake; Heavy metal; Morus alba; Particulate matter; Zinc-65","Air quality; Deposits; Heavy metals; Particle size; Vegetation; Zinc; Atmospheric heavy metals; Atmospheric metals; Atmospheric particulate matter; Particulate Matter; Processing activity; Simulated experiments; Suspended particulate matters; Toxic heavy metals; Particles (particulate matter); cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; heavy metal; iron; lead; manganese; nickel; zinc; zinc 65; tracer; zinc; biological uptake; experimental study; foliage; heavy metal; particle size; radionuclide; suspended particulate matter; tracer; translocation; zinc; air pollution; Article; controlled study; foliar; groove; heavy metal poisoning; leaf morphology; Morus alba; nonhuman; particle size; particulate matter; phytoremediation; plant leaf; plant root; plant stem; plant structures; radiation dose; radiolabeling; simulation; surface area; suspended particulate matter; toxic concentration; trichome; air pollutant; bioremediation; chemistry; metabolism; Morus; particulate matter; pharmacokinetics; plant leaf; Morus (plant); Morus alba; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biodegradation, Environmental; Morus; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Radioactive Tracers; Zinc; Zinc Radioisotopes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084214565

Building defects, such as heat losses, moisture, and air leakages, inevitably causes inefficient space heating or cooling, which accounts considerably towards this high energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In order to meet the EU's 2050 carbon reduction targets, building inspection techniques need to be revolutionised. Current methods rely on terrestrial or hand-held infrared thermography (IRT) to detect building defects. However, for a large-scale inspection, these methods are generally labour-intensive, time-consuming, costly and often inefficient. The aim of this paper is to highlight the possibility of integrating various state-of-the-art technologies and computational methods with IRT including drones, photogrammetry and AI. This paper presents a comprehensive review of relevant scientific papers and recent developments in such technologies that can retrofit the existing manually intensive methods. Among the findings of this research, feasibility of monocular thermographic photogrammetry integrated on a drone (quadcopter) promises a time-efficient, cost-effective and near-autonomous solution to large-scale building inspections. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy audit; Building inspection; Drone 3D mapping; Infrared thermography; Photogrammetry; Real-time thermal modelling","Buildings; Cost effectiveness; Drones; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Inspection; Meteorological problems; Photogrammetry; Building inspections; Carbon reduction; High energy consumption; Labour-intensive; Large scale buildings; Scientific papers; State of the art; State-of-the-art technology; Energy conservation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086520960

The results show that 1. In terms of time, the concentration of PM2.5 in Hebei Province showed an overall upward trend from 2000 to 2015, with the highest in winter and the lowest in summer. The daily variations show double peaks at 8:00-10:00 and 21:00-0:00 and a single valley at 16:00-18:00. 2. In terms of space, the concentration of PM2.5 in Hebei Province is high in the southeast and low in the northwest, and the pollution spillover initially decreases and then increases. 3. In the past 16 years, the level of intensive land use in Hebei Province has increased annually, but blind expansion still exists. 4. Decoupling theory and the spatial lag model show that land use intensity, land input level and land use structure are positively correlated with PM2.5 concentration, land output benefit is negatively correlated with PM2.5 concentration, and PM2.5 concentration and land intensive use level have not yet been decoupled; thus, the relationship is not harmonious.

This study shows an effort to introduce alternative home-produced concrete for small paving areas such as sidewalks, backyards, or fixing the existing concrete and discusses the economic evaluation of the alternative concrete for home purpose. The materials being used in this study are available locally or are easily purchased. The primary objective of the study is to analyze the compressive strength and conduct economic analysis of alternative home-produced concrete with different mix designs. Wood ash, fly ash, and recycled aggregate concretes are the alternative concrete types discussed in this study. Fly ash can replace Portland cement up to 30% without losing significant compressive strength of the concrete. Furthermore, fly ash is less expensive than Portland cement and can reduce the cost of concrete by saving approximately 15%. Wood ash can be used up to 25% in concrete without losing considerable strength which saves approximately 13% of cement cost. The use of recycled concrete aggregates saves only about 1% CO2 emission compared to regular concrete while fly ash saves more than 28.5% and wood ash saves almost 24.5%. They can replace natural aggregates up to 100%, but there is only a 5% saving. In addition, an equivalent cost of USD 13.47 for one cubic yard of concrete could be saved by using 30% fly ash concrete when considering reduced emitted CO2eq from the material production. © 2020 by the authors.","Cement replacement; CO2 emission factors; Compressive strength; Economic analysis; Fly ash concrete; Recycled aggregate concrete; Sustainability; Wood ash concrete","aggregation; carbon emission; cement (construction material); compressive strength; concrete structure; economic analysis; fly ash; wood ash",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090414047

Tin selenides such as SnSe and SnSe2 are earth-abundant, environmentally friendly, chemically stable, and capable candidates as the negative electrode for SIBs, in which the capacity is provided by a conversion reaction together with the alloying mechanism. However, these materials suffer from low conductivity, drastic volume changes, and aggregation of particles during the electrochemical reaction, which lead to poor cycling performance, hindering their practical application. The combination of tin selenide with conductive carbon is an effective strategy to overcome the issues mentioned above. Herein, we report tin selenide/N-doped carbon composite as an anode material for SIBs fabricated by solvothermal synthesis followed by a dry solid state method and calcination. The as-prepared tin selenide/N-doped carbon composite electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 460 mAh g−1 and maintained a discharge capacity of 348 mAh g−1 at the end of the 100th cycle at a current density of 200 mA g−1, which is almost 3.5 times higher in discharge capacity than the pristine electrodes. Moreover, the composite electrode exhibits outstanding rate capability compared to pristine tin selenide with a discharge capacity of 234 mAh g−1 even at a high current density of 1600 mA g−1. N-doped carbon provides improved conductivity as well as buffering the volume change during sodiation/desodiation, resulting in an overall enhancement of electrochemical performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","N-doped carbon; Sodium-ion batteries; Solvothermal synthesis; Tin selenide","Alloying; Anodes; Carbon carbon composites; Doping (additives); Electric discharges; Layered semiconductors; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal ions; Selenium compounds; Tin compounds; Conversion reactions; Discharge capacities; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical reactions; Energy storage systems; High current densities; Initial discharge capacities; Solvothermal synthesis; Sodium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083741720

Second, Saudi Arabia is on its way to start replacing its dependence on crude oil by becoming a world leader in carbon-based value-adding products, like advanced chemicals, allowing it in the near future to reduce its oil production.

Little is known about the comparative characteristics of these interventions, including their relative efficacy, potentials and emissions reductions. A more systematic understanding is required to delineate the urban mitigation space and inform decision-making. Here, we utilize bibliometric methods and machine learning to meta-analyze 5635 urban case studies of climate change mitigation. We identify 867 studies that explicitly consider technological or policy instruments, and categorize these studies according to policy type, sector, abatement potential, and socio-technological composition to obtain a first heuristic of what is their pattern. Overall, we find 41 different urban solutions with an average GHG abatement potential ranging from 5.2% to 105%, most of them clustering in the building and transport sectors. More than three-fourth of the solutions are on demand side. Less than 10% of all studies were ex-post policy evaluations. Our results demonstrate that technology-oriented interventions in urban waste, transport and energy sectors have the highest marginal abatement potential, while system-wide interventions, e.g. urban form related measures have lower marginal abatement potential but wider scope. We also demonstrate that integrating measures across urban sectors realizes synergies in GHG emission reductions. Our results reveal a rich evidence of techno-policy choices that together enlarge the urban solutions space and augment actions currently considered in global assessments of climate mitigation. © 2020 The Author(s).

Ecosystem change is a major environmental problem challenging sustainable coastal development worldwide, and this study shows baseline trends and shifts in ecological processes in coastal ecosystems under environmental stress. The concentrations and fluxes of biogeochemical elements over the last 3,500 years indicate that important changes in ecosystem dynamics occurred over the last 1,000 years, in particular after ~1900's, probably related to establishment of seagrass meadows in the area and to local and regional human activities (industry and coastal development), respectively. The establishment of seagrasses ~1,000 years ago in the area of study is supported by the appearance of Posidonia fibres from ~40 cm soil depth until the core top, higher δ13C values indicating a larger contribution of seagrass-matter to the soil organic carbon pool, and increased concentration of fine sediments driven by the effect of seagrass canopy in enhancing sedimentation. The comparison of organic carbon, nutrients and metal concentrations and fluxes between pre- and post-establishment of seagrasses shows that seagrass establishment resulted in up to 9-fold increase in the soil biogeochemical sink. In ~1900's, shifts in the concentrations of metals, carbonates, organic carbon, sediment grain size, and δ13C and δ15N values of the organic matter were detected, demonstrating an alteration in seagrass ecosystem functioning following the onset of European settlement. Anthropogenic activities, and in particular the construction of a causeway in 1970's, enhanced seagrass soil organic carbon and metal accumulation rates by 36- and 39-fold, respectively, showing that human-made structures can enhance the biogeochemical sink capacity of seagrasses. Here we reconstruct the impact of human activities on seagrass ecosystem dynamics and blue carbon, which can inform local management of Cockburn Sound and seagrass conservation for climate change mitigation and adaptation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blue carbon; Coastal ecosystems; Conservation; Eutrophication; Management; Palaeoecology","Biogeochemistry; Bridges; Climate change; Coastal engineering; Ecosystems; Forestry; Organic carbon; Sediments; Soil pollution; Soils; Anthropogenic activity; Climate change mitigation; Coastal infrastructure; Ecosystem functioning; Environmental problems; Environmental stress; Metal concentrations; Soil organic carbon pools; Plants (botany); carbon 13; carbonic acid derivative; metal; nitrogen 15; organic carbon; organic matter; carbon; anthropogenic effect; carbon sink; coastal structure; coastal zone; conservation management; eutrophication; industrialization; paleoecology; seagrass; Article; biogeochemistry; coastal waters; comparative study; concentration (parameter); environmental change; environmental stress; Europe; human; human activities; industrialization; nonhuman; nutrient concentration; particle size; Posidonia; Posidonia sinuosa; sea pollution; seagrass; sedimentation; soil depth; soil pollution; species conservation; Western Australia; ecosystem; sediment; soil; Australia; Cockburn Sound; Western Australia; Posidonia; Posidonia sinuosa; Carbon; Ecosystem; Geologic Sediments; Industrial Development; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083639041

Without the contextual knowledge on these factors, the expansion of rubber plantation would remain unproductive. This study thereby aimed to evaluate the current and future suitable habitat distributions of rubber using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. A total of 148 field-based presence locations and environmental variables (soil, bioclimatic, topography, and land use) were used to predict the suitable areas of rubber plantations using HadGEM2-ES climate model. Medium and high climatic representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (4.5 and 8.5) were selected to predict the suitable habitats for the years 2050 and 2070. Among various factors, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of warmest quarter, and soil exchangeable H+ contributed significantly to the distribution of rubber. Currently, 1119 km2 and 2716 km2 were predicted as high and moderately suitable areas respectively. It is predicted with increase rates in the high suitable areas, 49.96% and 328.95% by 2050 and 2070 respectively under RCP 4.5. This result indicates that the medium climate change of RCP 4.5 may have a direct positive effect on the expansion of habitat suitability of rubber. We also found potential areas for rubber cultivation in Jinghong and Mengla townships, where the further expansion is anticipated with desirable land-use planning by conserving reserve forest and native vegetation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Conservation; Habitat suitability; MaxEnt; Rubber plantation","Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Expansion; Forecasting; Land use; Population distribution; Rubber; Soils; Topography; Annual mean temperatures; Annual precipitation; Contextual knowledge; Environmental variables; Habitat distribution; Habitat suitability; Land Use Planning; Species distribution modeling; Rubber plantations; proton; rubber; climate modeling; concentration (composition); cultivation; land use planning; maximum entropy analysis; plantation; rubber; topographic mapping; Article; China; climate; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; entropy; environmental factor; environmental planning; environmental protection; environmental temperature; forest management; Hevea brasiliensis; land use; native species; nonhuman; plantation; precipitation; prediction; seasonal variation; soil chemistry; soil property; species cultivation; species distribution; species habitat; topography; vegetation; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; soil; China; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Rubber; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089821821

The correct model equations used for all calculations presented in Seidel et al., (2018), are: [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Equation numbers refer to the corresponding equations in Seidel et al., (2018). The corresponding surface coverages are: [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Through fitting to experimental data using global optimization it was found that parameters [Formula presented] and [Formula presented] in these general expressions are zero for the conditions considered in Seidel et al., (2018). Experimental data in Seidel et al., (2018) were taken from Vollbrecht, (2007) as stated correctly in our paper. An explanation was missing for the prefactor of the reverse water–gas shift reaction (RWGS), Eq. (13), which is [Formula presented] and not [Formula presented]. The explanation is as follows: according to the elementary reaction steps given in Seidel et al., (2018), and in contrast to the CO- and CO2-hydrogenation reactions, the RWGS reaction needs for the first two elementary steps, i.e. CO2 adsorption followed by reduction of adsorbed CO2 to CO, first an oxidized and afterwards a reduced surface center located close by. Therefore, the probability for this reaction to take place is not proportional to the product of the total amount of reduced and oxidized surface centers [Formula presented]. This probability was found to be higher if the number of oxidized centers is reduced, because this increases the chance that the reduced center for the following reaction step is in the vicinity of an oxidized center. From the experimental data it was found that this is modeled best with a prefactor [Formula presented] for the relevant range [Formula presented]. Hence, this prefactor was used throughout the paper. A maximum coverage of 90% of reduced surface centers is assumed and ensured with a correction factor of −0.1 in Eq. (22) Seidel et al., (2018). For the steady-state case as stated correctly in Eq. (24) of Slotboom et al., (2020). In the dynamic case this is ensured by replacing two times the factor (1−ϕ) in Eq. (28) of Seidel et al., (2018) by the factor (0.9−ϕ). The equilibrium constants for the reaction rates of the detailed and the simplified kinetic models in Seidel et al., (2018) have been proposed by Kuznetov and were taken from Vollbrecht, (2007); Skrzypek et al., (1994). Since both publications are not available online, we want to supplement the expressions here for the convenience of the reader [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Moreover, there were typographic errors in Eqs. (5), (6) and Eqs. (31), (32). The correct equations are: [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Finally, it is worth mentioning that our simplified kinetic model in Seidel et al., (2018) aims at dynamic simulation whereas in Slotboom et al., (2020) focus is on steady states. Further, in contrast to Slotboom et al., (2020) [Formula presented] were fitted separately to experimental data in Seidel et al., (2018) as described in our paper. Our simplified kinetic model is particular useful for dynamic simulation under varying feed conditions due to the catalyst dynamics involved. An interesting field of application is therefore methanol production from fluctuating renewable resources as indicated by the title of the article. © 2020",,,Erratum,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084194237

Since the beginning of the 20th century, these forests ecosystems have been threatened by several factors, including human intervention, climate change, wildfires, pathogens, and pests. Several studies have demonstrated the primary role of the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi Ronds in the widespread decline of cork oaks in Portugal, Spain, southern France, and Italy, although other congeneric species have also been occasionally associated. Between 2015 and 2019, independent surveys were undertaken to determine the diversity of Phytophthora species in declining cork oak stands in Sardinia (Italy). Rhizosphere soil samples were collected from 39 declining cork oak stands and baited in the laboratory with oak leaflets. In addition, the occurrence of Phytophthora was assayed using an in-situ baiting technique in rivers and streams located throughout ten of the surveyed oak stands. Isolates were identified by means of both morphological characters and sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA. In total, 14 different Phytophthora species were detected. Phytophthora cinnamomi was the most frequently isolated species from rhizosphere soil, followed by P. quercina, P. pseudocryptogea, and P. tyrrhenica. In contrast, P. gonapodyides turned out to be the most dominant species in stream water, followed by P. bilorbang, P. pseudocryptogea, P. lacustris, and P. plurivora. Pathogenicity of the most common Phytophthora species detected was tested using both soil infestation and log inoculation methods. This study showed the high diversity of Phytophthora species inhabiting soil and watercourses, including several previously unrecorded species potentially involved in the decline of cork oak forests. © 2020 by the authors.","Cork oak; Oak decline; Oomycetes; Phytophthora cinnamomi","Climate change; Ecology; Forestry; Soils; Surveys; Ecological values; Human intervention; Inoculation method; Internal transcribed spacers; Mediterranean region; Morphological characters; Rhizosphere soils; Rivers and streams; Plants (botany); deciduous tree; fungus; parasite infestation; population decline; rhizosphere; species diversity; stand structure; Ecology; Forestry; Mediterranean; Quercus Suber; Sardinia; Soil; Surveys; Italy; Sardinia; Oomycetes; Phytophthora; Phytophthora cinnamomi; Phytophthora gonapodyides; Phytophthora quercina; Quercus suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091287441

This is particularly relevant in coastal communities with high exposure to natural disasters, such as those in the Caribbean region, especially given projections of increased frequency and severity of storms as a consequence of climate change. In this study, Puerto Rican fishers’ perceptions of the effects of climate change on their fishing activity were compared before and after two major hurricanes severely impacted the island in the fall of 2017. Data was collected through the use of surveys conducted in 12 different fishing communities in Puerto Rico at two different time periods: pre-storms (August 2016–January 2017) (N = 212) and post-storms (May–June 2018) (N = 75). Results show that fishers demonstrated higher concern in the post-storms period for climate change in general as well as for other environmental changes attributed to climate change, particularly the impacts of storms and increased air temperature. Our analyses also investigate factors influencing fishers’ concerns about climate change. Comparisons between fishers’ perceptions in the pre- and post-storms periods allow for an increased understanding of the impacts of extreme events on fishers’ subjective vulnerability to climate change and other environmental transformations. These changes in perception are likely to influence fishers’ future adaptative behavior and they provide opportunities for the implementation of collaborative strategies to increase awareness of climate change impacts and develop strategies to maximize climate change resilience in fishing communities. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate change; fisheries; hurricanes; Puerto Rico; vulnerability","Disasters; Fisheries; Hurricanes; Storms; Adaptive capacity; Air temperature; Climate change impact; Coastal communities; Collaborative strategies; Environmental change; Fishing activities; Natural disasters; Climate change; climate change; extreme event; fishery; fishing community; hurricane event; natural disaster; perception; vulnerability; Puerto Rico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088829544

Investigations limited to the most common tree-ring proxy of ring width can be difficult to interpret, however, because radial growth is affected by multiple environmental processes. Furthermore, studies of living trees may miss important effects of drought on tree survival and forest changes. Stable carbon isotopes can help distinguish drought from other environmental factors that influence tree-ring width and forest stand condition. We quantified tree-ring radial expansion and stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) in riparian cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia and P. angustifolia x P. trichocarpa) along Snake Creek in Nevada, USA. We investigated how hydrological drought affected tree growth and death at annual to half-century scales in a partially dewatered reach (DW) compared to reference reaches immediately upstream and downstream. A gradual decline in tree-ring basal area increment (BAI) began at DW concurrent to streamflow diversion in 1961. BAI at DW diverged from one reference reach immediately but not from the other until nearly 50 years later. In contrast, tree-ring δ13C had a rapid and sustained increase following diversion at DW only, providing the stronger and clearer drought signal. BAI and δ13C were not significantly correlated prior to diversion; after diversion they both reflected drought and were correlated for DW trees only. Cluster analyses distinguished all trees in DW from those in reference reaches based on δ13C, but BAI patterns left trees intermixed across reaches. Branch and tree mortality were also highest and canopy vigor was lowest in DW. Results indicate that water scarcity strongly limited cottonwood photosynthesis following flow diversion, thus reducing carbon assimilation, basal growth and survival. The dieback was not sudden, but occurred over decades as carbon deficits mounted and depleted streamflow left trees increasingly vulnerable to local meteorological drought. © 2020","Basal area increment; Drought; Riparian forest; Stream dewatering; Tree-ring proxy; δ13C","Carbon; Cluster analysis; Drought; Isotopes; Rivers; Stream flow; Basal area increment; Carbon assimilation; Environmental factors; Environmental process; Hydrological droughts; Meteorological drought; Stable carbon isotope ratio; Stable carbon isotopes; Forestry; carbon; carbon; oxygen; annual variation; carbon isotope; deciduous tree; growth response; reconstruction; riparian vegetation; stable isotope; tree ring; Article; basal area increment; canopy; carbon fixation; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; cluster analysis; controlled study; dewatering; dieback disease; drought; environmental factor; flow; hydrology; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant growth; Populus; Populus angustifolia; Populus trichocarpa; priority journal; riparian ecosystem; survival; tree ring radial growth; forest; Nevada; Populus; tree; Nevada; United States; Populus; Populus angustifolia; Populus trichocarpa; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Droughts; Forests; Nevada; Oxygen Isotopes; Populus; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085636660

On the one hand, the quantity of hydrocarbon (HC) raw emissions is important for emission predictions as well as for the exhaust after treatment. On the other hand, HC emissions are also important for predicting combustion efficiency and thus fuel consumption, since a part of unreleased chemical energy of the fuel is still bound in the HC molecules. Due to these reasons, a simulation model for predicting HC raw emissions was developed for diesel engines based on a phenomenological two-zone model. The HC model takes three main sources of HC emissions of diesel engines into account: Firstly, it contains a sub-model that describes the fuel dribble out of the injector after the end of injection. Secondly, HC emissions from cold peripheral zones near cylinder walls are determined in another sub-model. This peripheral zone sub-model also considers the influence of the cylinder wall temperatures on HC emissions, which makes it also suitable for the evaluation of cold start conditions. To simplify the calibration process, the peripheral zone sub-model is coupled to an existing nitrogen oxide (NO) peripheral zone model. Thirdly, HC emissions from overmixed regions are considered. In these regions, the air-fuel mixture is too lean and consequently the temperatures are too low for HC to fully oxidize.

Climate forecasting centres around the globe now routinely run global climate models (GCMs) to provide ensemble forecasts. However, raw GCM forecasts require post-processing to improve their reliability and to enable systematic integration with crop models. Post-processing to meet crop model input requirements is highly challenging and simple bias-correction methods can perform poorly in this regard. As a result of the difficulties, GCM forecasts are often sidelined in favour of other inputs such as climate analogues. In this study, we evaluate two variants of a recently-developed post-processing method designed to systematically and reliably calibrate and downscale GCM forecasts for use in crop models. In one variant, local GCM forecasts of rainfall, temperature and solar radiation are post-processed directly. The second variant is a novel adaption in which the predictive input is instead the GCM's forecast of a large-scale climate pattern, in this case related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The post-processed climate forecasts, which are in the form of ensemble time series, are used to drive an APSIM-sugar model to generate long-lead forecasts of biomass in north-eastern Australia from 1982 to 2016. A rigorous probabilistic assessment of forecast attributes suggests that local GCM forecast calibration provides the most skilful forecasts overall although the ENSO-related forecasts give more skilful biomass forecasts at certain times, implying model combination could be worthwhile to maximise skill. The generated biomass forecasts are unbiased and reliable for short to long lead times, suggesting that the downscaling methods will be of value to trial in a range of crop forecast applications, and support the quantitative, meaningful use of GCM forecasts in agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM; Crop yield; Ensemble forecasting; Forecast verification; Sugarcane","biomass; calibration; crop yield; downscaling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; general circulation model; global climate; solar radiation; weather forecasting; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085546486

The amount of materials required year by year depends on population levels, the use of technologies in production systems, investment into public infrastructure, and the lifestyle choices and consumption behaviours of households. The level of global material use has important consequences for environmental pressures and impacts of socio-economic activities. Using materials more efficiently has positive implications for the economy and allows for reduced pressure on climate change, biodiversity loss, resource supply systems and waste management. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) structure assumptions of future population growth, economic activity and urbanisation into five core narratives and allow for greater comparability of scenario assumptions and assessments of future natural resource requirements and pollution levels. In this study we explore the future of global material use across the five SSPs using economic modelling with industry sector, country detail and technology extensions and provide a summary of global material demand scenarios. The challenge faced to reduce global material flows is determined by the material requirements of different levels of population, global economic growth, the potential to improve material intensity of production systems, and consumer behaviour. Under the scenarios, global material flows vary between 134 billion tonnes for SSP1 and 282 billion tonnes for SSP5 by 2060. A middle of the road SSP2 scenario projects material demand of 176 billion tonnes by 2060, which is twice the level of 2017’s global material use. Despite yearly average improvements in material efficiency of 0.8% between 2015 and 2060, our results demonstrate the level of ambition that is required to curb the increasing pressures on natural resource supply systems and their environmentally detrimental consequences. This study presents five alternative baseline scenarios which assume a continuation of historical trends in the way in which production, consumption and material use are interacting. Efforts to reduce global demand of primary materials need be stepped up to manage the global economy within planetary boundaries. This can be modelled by introducing ambitious policy settings which was, however, not the purpose of this study. © 2020","Global material use; Integrated modelling; Resource efficiency; Shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs); Sustainable development goals (SDGs)","Biodiversity; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Investments; Natural resources; Ores; Population statistics; Waste management; Economic activities; Environmental pressures; Global economic growth; Material efficiency; Material requirements; Nonmetallic minerals; Public infrastructures; Resource requirements; Industrial economics; consumption behavior; economic activity; global economy; infrastructure; investment; lifestyle; population growth; socioeconomic conditions; urbanization; article; biodiversity; climate change; consumer attitude; human; narrative; natural resource; population growth estimation; sustainable development; urbanization; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084653429

We use a modelling chain whose outputs are familiar and used operationally, for example to issue flood warnings. With two different versions of a hydrological model, we show that (1) the higher spatial resolution between the global and regional climate model is necessary to realistically simulate the high spatial variability of precipitation in this mountainous region and (2) only with hourly data are we able to capture the fast flood-generating processes leading to the peak streamflow. The higher resolution regional atmospheric model captures the fact that with the passage of an atmospheric river, some valleys receive high amounts of precipitation and others not, while the coarser resolution global model shows uniform precipitation in the whole region. Translating the event into the future leads to similar results: while in some catchments, a future flood might be much larger than a present one, in others no event occurs as the atmospheric river simply does not hit that catchment. The use of an operational flood warning system for future events is expected to facilitate stakeholder engagement. © 2020 The Authors","AROME; Atmospheric river; Climate change; Dynamical downscaling; EC-Earth; Extreme precipitation; Flood; Storyline approach; Western Norway","atmospheric moisture; catchment; flood forecasting; mountain region; precipitation (climatology); spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086606652

Despite navigators are becoming more and more powerful and precise in estimating road and traffic conditions, there is still room for improving their effectiveness in route planning. On the other hand, urban areas, thanks to Information and Communication Technologies, are becoming smarter and smarter, enough to be termed as smart cities since they are able to provide advanced smart services, among which mobility ones. The context of this paper is the integration of such two systems and technologies, merging smart navigation solutions and smart city services to obtain value added services improving route planning effectiveness by achieving a trade-off between the two. To this purpose, a smart navigation system that actively interacts with the smart city infrastructure facilities for route planning is developed. The Smart City Navigation System (SCiNaS) thus implemented provides a solution that, starting from the information obtained by the smart city traffic light management system, is able to ""catch""a green wave on the planned route just acting on the vehicle speed by directly interacting with its cruise control. A detailed model of a powertrain c-segment car demonstrated that the proposed solution, SCiNaS, is able to improve both the traveled time and the fuel consumption while reducing the gas emissions.

The adoption of precision viticulture and the best available techniques aiming at sustainable production, minimizing the impact on natural resources and reducing production costs, has therefore been a goal of winegrowers. In this work, the water footprint (WFP) in the wine sector was evaluated, from the vineyard to the bottle, through the implementation of a methodology based on field experiments and life cycle assessment (LCA) on two Portuguese case studies. Regarding direct water footprint, it ranged from 366 to 899 L/FU (0.75 L bottle), with green water being the most significant component, representing more than 50% of the overall water footprint. The approach used in the current study revealed that although more than 97.5% of the water footprint is associated with vineyard, the winery stage is responsible for more than 75% of the global warming potential indicator. A linear correlation between the carbon footprint and the indirect blue water footprint was also observed for both case studies. Climate change is expected to cause an earlier and prolonged water stress period, resulting in an increase of about 40% to 82% of blue WFP. © 2020 by the authors.","Life cycle assessment; Sustainable wine production; Water use efficiency; Wine chain; Winery wastewater","Bottles; Carbon footprint; Deterioration; Global warming; Sustainable development; Wine; Best available techniques; Field experiment; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Linear correlation; Mediterranean region; Methodological approach; Sustainable production; Life cycle; climate change; climate effect; correlation; footprint; life cycle analysis; numerical model; sustainability; wastewater; water use efficiency; wine; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092345212

Due to climate warming and land use shifts, fire patterns are changing and fire impacts increasing in many of the world's regions. Reducing uncertainties in carbon budgeting calculations from fires is therefore fundamental to advance our current understanding and forecasting capabilities. Here we study 20 chamber burns from the FIREX FireLab experiment, which burnt a representative set of North American wildland fuels, to assess the following: (i) differences in carbon emission estimations between the commonly used “consumed biomass” approach and the “burnt carbon” approach; (ii) pyrogenic carbon (PyC) production rates; and (iii) thermal and chemical recalcitrance of the PyC produced, as proxies of its biogeochemical stability. We find that the “consumed biomass” approach leads to overestimation of carbon emissions by 2–27% (most values between 2% and 10%). This accounting error arises largely from not considering PyC production and, even if relatively small, can therefore have important implications for medium- and long-term carbon budgeting. A large fraction (34–100%) of this PyC was contained in the charred fine residue, a postfire material frequently overlooked in fire carbon research. However, the most recalcitrant PyC was in the form of woody charcoal, with estimated half-lives for most samples exceeding 1,000 years. Combustion efficiency was relatively high in these laboratory burns compared to actual wildland fire conditions, likely leading to lower PyC production rates. We therefore argue that the PyC production values obtained here, and associated overestimation of carbon emissions, should be taken as low-end estimates for wildland fire conditions. © 2020.

Yet, the drivers of fires are often poorly understood by various stakeholders in spatially expansive and temporally dynamic landscapes. Further, perceptions about the main cause of fires vary amongst stakeholders, which amplify ongoing challenges from policies being implemented inconsistently across different governance levels. Here, we develop a spatially and temporally-explicit typology of fire prevalence across Kalimantan, Indonesia, a region with significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. Based on livelihood information and data on climate, soil type and forest degradation status, we find that in intact forest the density of fires in villages that largely coincide with oil palm concessions was twice as high as in villages outside the concessions across all years. Fires occurring in degraded land on mineral soil across all years were also most prevalent in villages with industrial plantations (oil palm or timber). On the other hand, in degraded peatland, where fires are most intense during dry years induced by the El Niño episodes, occurrence rates were high regardless of village primary livelihoods. Based on these findings we recommend two key priorities for fire mitigation going forward for policy across different governance levels in Kalimantan: degraded peatland as the priority area and industrial plantations as the priority sector. Our study suggests a fire prevention and mitigation approach, which accounts for climate, land type and village livelihood, has the potential to deliver more effective means of management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fire typology; Industrial plantations; Peatland; Policy discourse; Spatio-temporal analysis; Subsistence livelihoods; Zero burning","annual variation; climate change; El Nino; forest fire; landscape change; peatland; policy implementation; soil type; spatiotemporal analysis; village; Borneo; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088376944

Studies have highlighted cement replacement is a popular method of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and replacing virgin materials in concrete. These options incur cost implications through sophisticated designs and technologies. The importance of maintaining a balance between environmental and economic benefits of a green design is critical for the decision making stakeholders in a construction project. However, designers often lack the resources and tools to initiate informed decision making for the optimum selection of a green material. In order to systemize the optimising process, the current study suggests a multi-objective optimisation based decision making framework for optimising the cement replacement materials in concrete. The study aims to present a sustainable criterion optimisation framework that could well be adopted to assess the sustainability of green materials in concrete production. A case study using fly ash geopolymer concrete in Melbourne demonstrated a reduction of 3.63% to 41.57% and 23.80% to 30.25% can be achieved for GHG emissions and production cost respectively if the developed optimisation based framework is implemented. The scenario results highlighted around 3% to 8% GHG and cost increase if material is not available locally. A similar approach can be utilised to optimise the environmental and cost savings of other cement replacement materials. Further studies are encouraged on comparing environmental and cost savings of other cement replacement materials using the developed framework. The framework will be valuable for designers in making decisions on sustainable cement replacement materials. © 2020","Concrete; Construction; Cost; Fly ash; Geopolymer; Greenhouse gas emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085030042

However, it is common to use air pollutant concentrations in statistical models without considering this characteristic of the data and, therefore, without control of common statistical problems, such as spurious correlations and subcompositional incoherence. This paper now proposes a daily multivariate spatio-temporal model with a compositional approach. The air pollution spatio-temporal model is based on a dynamic linear modelling framework with Bayesian inference. The novel modelling methodology was applied in an urban area for carbon monoxide (CO, mg·m−3), sulfur dioxide (SO2, μg·m−3), ozone (O3, μg·m−3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2, μg·m−3), and particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5, μg·m−3). The proposal complemented and improved the conventional approach in air pollution modelling. The main improvements come from a fast multivariate data description, high spatial-correlation, and adequate modelling of air pollutants with high variability. © 2020 The Author(s)","Air quality; Atmospheric science; CoDa; Compositional data; Engineering; Environmental analysis; Environmental chemical engineering; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental statistics; Modelling; Statistics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090574528

As the urban population continues to grow, a greater quantity of people risk exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), and therefore also risk adverse health effects. In many cities, there is scope for further improvement in air quality through targeted urban policy interventions. The objective of this protocol is to detail the methods that will be used for a systematic evidence map (SEM) which will identify and characterize the evidence on policy interventions that can be implemented at the urban-level to reduce traffic emissions and/or TRAP from on-road mobile sources, thus reducing human exposures and adverse health impacts. Methods: Articles will be searched for and selected based on a predetermined search strategy and eligibility criteria. A variety of databases will be searched for relevant articles published in English between January 1, 2000 and June 1, 2020 to encompass the interdisciplinary nature of this SEM, and articles will be stored and screened using Rayyan QCRI. Predetermined study characteristics will be extracted and coded from included studies in a Microsoft Excel sheet, which will serve as an open access, interactive database, and two authors will review the coded data for consistency. The database will be queryable, and various interactive charts, graphs, and maps will be created using Tableau Public for data visualization. The results of the evidence mapping will be detailed via narrative summary. Conclusion: This protocol serves to increase transparency of the SEM methods and provides an example for researchers pursuing future SEMs. © 2020 The Authors","City; Emissions; Health; Intervention; Policy; Traffic-related air pollution; Urban","Air quality; Data visualization; Database systems; Economics; Risk management; Roads and streets; Scanning electron microscopy; Urban planning; Adverse health effects; Eligibility criterion; Interactive database; On-road mobile sources; Policy intervention; Search strategies; Traffic emissions; Traffic-related air pollution; Health risks; air quality; atmospheric pollution; database; emission control; policy analysis; policy approach; pollution exposure; pollution policy; risk assessment; traffic emission; urban policy; air pollution; data visualization; human; human experiment; narrative; review; software; air pollutant; city; exhaust gas; policy; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Humans; Policy; Traffic-Related Pollution; Vehicle Emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085755746

The main objective of the Horizon 2020 ""DownToTen""project was to develop a robust methodology and provide policy recommendations towards the particle number (PN) emissions measurements in the sub-23 nm region. In order to achieve this target, a new portable exhaust particle sampling system (PEPS) was developed, being capable of measuring exhaust particles down to at least 10 nm under real-world conditions. The main design target was to build a system that is compatible with current PMP requirements and is characterized by minimized losses in the sub-23 nm region, high robustness against artefacts and high flexibility in terms of different PN modes investigation, i.e. non-volatile, volatile and secondary particles. This measurement setup was used for the evaluation of particle emissions from the latest technology engine and powertrain technologies (including vehicles from other Horizon 2020 projects), different fuel types, and a wide range of exhaust aftertreatment systems. Results revealed that in most cases (non-volatile), PN emissions down to 10 nm (SPN10) do not exceed the current SPN23 limit of 6×1011 p/km. However, there are some cases where SPN10 emissions exceeded the limit, although SPN23 were below that. An interesting finding was that even in the latter cases, the installation of a particle filter could significantly reduce PN emissions across a wide particle size range, fuels, and combustion technology. DownToTen results are being used to scientifically underpin the Euro 7/VII emission standard development in the EU. The method developed and the results obtained may be used to bring in the market clean and efficient vehicle technologies, improve engine and emission control performance with different fuels, and characterize size-fractionated particle chemistry to identify the formation mechanisms and control those in a targeted, cost-effective fashion. © 2020 SAE International.

Here, we present the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into C2 products such as ethylene and ethanol with high selectivity using a self-assembled cuprous coordination polymer nanoparticle (Cu-SCP). The features of the Cu-SCP catalyst are the arrangement of Cu atoms in close proximity, similar to that in metallic Cu, and a stable Cu(I) oxidation state throughout the reaction due to the coordination of ligands with Cu atoms, which inhibits conversion into Cu metal particles. The Cu-SCP also exhibits activity for C2 production that is superior to that of a Cu metal electrode, without modification of the carbon particles and/or ionomers or continuous flow of the highly alkaline electrolyte, which will simplify the fabrication of a CO2 electrolyzer.

These measures, which include restricting movement, have environmental consequences. This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 measures on air pollutant concentrations measured in urban areas and traffic stations on both the European and Asian sides of Istanbul during March 2020. Significant reductions in pollutants: 32–43% (PM10), 19–47% (PM2.5), 29–44% (NO2), 40–58% (CO) and 34–69% (SO2) were calculated. The clearest reductions at the traffic stations were in NO2 which originates primarily from vehicle exhaust. The reduction of NO2 at the traffic station on the European side was found higher comparing the Asian side. The average concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CO during peak traffic hours were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) decreased under COVID-19 measures. The results indicate that due to the measures taken in Istanbul and across Turkey and to control the spread of the virus, anthropogenic activities such as industry, vehicle traffic and sea transport have decreased, and consequently, air pollution has been significantly reduced. These pollutant levels demonstrate the anthropogenic contribution to air pollution and can inform clean air actions in Istanbul and in others cities throughout the world. © The Author(s).","Air pollution; COVID-19; Istanbul; NO2; Traffic","Air pollution; Diseases; Nitrogen oxides; Urban growth; Viruses; Air pollutant concentrations; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenic contribution; Average concentration; Environmental consequences; Pollutant levels; Vehicle exhausts; Vehicle traffic; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); disease spread; human activity; severe acute respiratory syndrome; spatiotemporal analysis; urban pollution; urban site; Asia; Europe; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey; SARS coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089796558

We predicted that the influence of warming on the stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated [CO2] in prairie plants would operate primarily through direct and indirect effects on soil water. Methods: We measured light-saturated photosynthesis (Anet), stomatal conductance (gs), maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate (Vcmax), maximum electron transport capacity (Jmax) and related variables in four C3 plant species in the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment in southeastern Wyoming. Measurements were conducted over two growing seasons that differed in the amount of precipitation and soil moisture content. Results: Anet in the C3 subshrub Artemisia frigida and the C3 forb Sphaeralcea coccinea was stimulated by elevated [CO2] under ambient and warmed temperature treatments. Warming by itself reduced Anet in all species during the dry year, but stimulated photosynthesis in S. coccinea in the wet year. In contrast, Anet in the C3 grass Pascopyrum smithii was not stimulated by elevated [CO2] or warming under wet or dry conditions. Photosynthetic downregulation under elevated [CO2] in this species countered the potential stimulatory effect under improved water relations. Warming also reduced the magnitude of CO2-induced down-regulation in this grass, possibly by sustaining high levels of carbon utilization. Conclusions: Direct and indirect effects of elevated [CO2] and warming on soil water was an overriding factor influencing patterns of Anet in this semi-arid temperate grassland, emphasizing the important role of water relations in driving grassland responses to global change. © 2020 Botanical Society of America","acclimation; Artemisia frigida; downregulation; Hesperostipa comata; leaf nitrogen; Pascopyrum smithii; photosynthesis; soil moisture; Sphaeralcea coccinea","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate effect; grassland; photosynthesis; prairie; soil moisture; soil water; stomatal conductance; water relations; United States; Wyoming; Artemisia frigida; Hesperostipa comata; Pascopyrum smithii; Sphaeralcea coccinea; carbon dioxide; climate; climate change; ecosystem; grassland; photosynthesis; soil; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Grassland; Photosynthesis; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090944300

However, little is known about bicycle adoption in lower-income countries where air pollution is high and cycling infrastructure is poor. Understanding the drivers of cycling adoption in developing economies can increase the efficiency of transport policies while reducing local air pollution, improving health, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this study is to identify the factors affecting cycling uptake in a low-income country using the city of Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan as a case study. The analysis is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, a questionnaire-based survey of 900 respondents, factor analysis, and a logit model. In contrast to studies carried out in developed countries, this study finds that students are less likely to adopt cycling than other population groups. Other findings suggest that support for public transport, a desire for regular exercise and perceptions of the environmental benefits of cycling increase the probability of the use of cycling as a mode of transport in a low-income country. The paper also identifies positive and negative perceptions of cycling among cyclists and non-cyclists. © 2020 by the authors.","Cycling adoption; Cycling barriers; Cycling mobility; Mobility; Transport","atmospheric pollution; developing world; factor analysis; greenhouse gas; perception; public transport; questionnaire survey; research work; transportation infrastructure; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092460719

Recent technoeconomic reports suggested economically feasible target products of CO2 electroreduction and the relative influence of key performance parameters such as faradaic efficiency (FE), current density, and overpotential in the practical industrial-scale applications. Furthermore, fundamental factors, such as available reaction pathways, shared intermediates, competing hydrogen evolution reaction, scaling relations of the intermediate binding energies, and CO2 mass transport limitations, should be considered in relation to the electrochemical CO2 reduction performance. Intensive research efforts have been devoted to designing and developing advanced electrocatalysts and improving mechanistic understanding. More recently, the research focus was extended to the catalyst environment, because the interfacial region can delicately modulate the catalytic activity and provide effective solutions to challenges that were not fully addressed in the material development studies. Herein, we discuss the importance of catalyst-electrolyte interfaces in improving key operational parameters based on kinetic equations. Furthermore, we extensively review previous studies on controlling organic modulators, electrolyte ions, electrode structures, as well as the three-phase boundary at the catalyst-electrolyte interface. The interfacial region modulates the electrocatalytic properties via electronic modification, intermediate stabilization, proton delivery regulation, catalyst structure modification, reactant concentration control, and mass transport regulation.

This paper assesses how climate change will alter high streamflow events by changing both the prevalence of different driving mechanisms (i.e. 'flood generating processes') and the magnitude of differently generated floods. We present an analysis of simulated changes in high streamflow events in selected basins in the hydroclimatically diverse Pacific Northwestern United States, classifying the events according to their mechanism. We then compare how the different classes of events respond to changes in climate at the annual scale. In a warmer future, high flow events will be caused less frequently by snowmelt and more frequently by precipitation events. Also, precipitation-driven high flow events are more sensitive to increases in precipitation than are snowmelt-driven high flow events, so the combination of the increase in both frequency and magnitude of precipitation-driven high flow events leads to higher flood likelihood than under each change alone. Our comparison of the results from two emissions pathways shows that a reduction in global emissions will limit the increase in magnitude and prevalence of these precipitation-driven events. © 2020 The Author(s).

According to the present domestic and foreign procedures evaluation of toxic emissions quantity is done in terms of integrated specific parameters. These are calculated on the basis of engine testing results obtained in a specified range of operation modes. The investigation results obtained for the operation process of uprated locomotive engine 12D49M (12CHN26/26 rated at 2200 kW) have shown prevailing of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in total toxic emissions in modes close to standard power. At partial loads CO emissions prevail. Thus, in the first case reduction of integrated toxic parameters can be achieved through measures aimed at decreasing NOx emissions (such as reduction of maximal cycle and local temperatures). In the second case measures reducing CO emissions (such as increase of actual cycle temperatures) are effective. Meanwhile it is known that the reduction of actual cycle temperatures results in a worse indicated efficiency of the engine and, consequently, in its worse fuel efficiency. To avoid this phenomenon correction of heat release phase with simultaneous reduction of cylinder pressure growth rate is necessary. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

The measures taken to control the spread of the virus and the slowdown of economic activities have significant effects on the environment. Therefore, this study intends to explore the positive and negative environmental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, by reviewing the available scientific literatures. This study indicates that, the pandemic situation significantly improves air quality in different cities across the world, reduces GHGs emission, lessens water pollution and noise, and reduces the pressure on the tourist destinations, which may assist with the restoration of the ecological system. In addition, there are also some negative consequences of COVID-19, such as increase of medical waste, haphazard use and disposal of disinfectants, mask, and gloves; and burden of untreated wastes continuously endangering the environment. It seems that, economic activities will return soon after the pandemic, and the situation might change. Hence, this study also outlines possible ways to achieve long-term environmental benefits.

In our research, we will use numerical simulation data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 project to explain how climate conditions changed and will continue to change during the period from 1950 to 2100 in the Pannonian Basin. The control period from 1961 to 1990, which we will use to define deviation of the numerical simulations from an approximately real state, will be defined using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis data for near-surface air temperature and precipitation from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre. We will show how Köppen–Geiger climate types are changing by changing the near-surface air temperature and precipitation and whether a change in vegetation cover accompanies this change. Reduction of vegetation should lead to intensifying of climate hazards such as reduced rainfall and increasing surface temperatures. We will also compare the climate types obtained from the measured data from the Global Meteorological Stations in the southern region of the Pannonian Basin that includes the frame of Northern Serbia. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate; CMIP5; Köppen–Geiger; Pannonia; Precipitation; Temperature","air temperature; climate classification; climate modeling; CMIP; computer simulation; land cover; precipitation (climatology); vegetation cover; weather forecasting; Pannonian Basin; Serbia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086745749

Two isomers of 1, namely, 1-cis characterized by the proximity of Cl to OH and 1-trans, are identified. The interconversion between 1-cis and 1-trans is clarified by DFT calculations, which reveal two transition states. The energetically lower pathway displays a non-negligible barrier of 75.5 kJ mol-1. The 1e- electrochemical reduction of 1 affords the neutral intermediate 1-OPh, formally derived by reductive deprotonation and loss of Cl- from 1. 1-OPh, which exhibits an entropically favored intramolecular Re-O bond, has been isolated and characterized. The detailed electrochemical mechanism is demonstrated by combined chemical reactivity, spectroelectrochemistry, spectroscopic (IR and NMR), and computational (DFT) approaches. Comparison with previous Re and Mn derivatives carrying local proton sources highlights that the catalytic activity of Re complexes is more sensitive to the presence of local OH groups. Similar to Re-2OH (2OH = 4-phenyl-6-(phenyl-2,6-diol)-2,2′-bipyridine), 1 and Mn-1OH display a selective reduction of CO2 to CO. In the case of the Re bipyridine-type complex, the formation of a relatively stable Re-O bond and a preference for phenolate-based reactivity with CO2 slightly inhibit the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO, resulting in a low TON value of 9, even in the presence of phenol as a proton source.

This paper reviews deliberative democracy and framing where they have been applied to examine public engagement on climate change. Integrating insights from these fields can help develop a practice of deliberative framing for managing climate change mitigation and adaptation actions at local scales, to complement national and international efforts. This could assist with community-based agenda setting toward greater justice and the public good.

However, the detection of this emission is severely affected by distortions, due to processes of light re-absorption both in the leaf and in the canopy. Even though some advances have been made to correct the signal in the far-red, the whole spectral range needs to be addressed, in order to accurately assess plant physiological state. In 2018, we introduced a model to obtain fluorescence spectra at leaf level, from what was observed at canopy level. In this present work, we publish a revision of that physical model, with a more rigorous and exact mathematical treatment. In addition, multiple scattering between the soil and the canopy, and the fraction of land covered by vegetation have also been taken into consideration. We validate this model upon experimental measures, in three types of crops of agronomic interest (Pea, Rye grass and Maize) with different architecture. Our model accurately predicts both the shape of fluorescence spectra at leaf level from that measured at canopy level and the fluorescence ratio. Furthermore, not only do we eliminate artifacts affecting the spectral shape, but we are also able to calculate the quantum yield of fluorescence corrected for re-absorption, from the experimental quantum yield at canopy level. This represents an advance in the study of these systems because it offers the opportunity to make corrections for both the fluorescence ratio and the intensity of the observed fluorescence. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Canopy-level fluorescence; Fluorescence quantum yield; Light re-absorption; Modeling; Plant fluorescence; Remote sensing","Budget control; Chlorophyll; Quantum yield; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Fluorescence ratio; Fluorescence spectra; Light re-absorption; Mathematical treatments; Physical model; Physiological state; Spectral shapes; Fluorescence; carbon budget; experimental study; fluorescence; grass; model validation; physiology; scattering; Pisum sativum; Secale cereale; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084341111

The current study addresses the development of self-compacting concrete, replacing part of the cement (the primary source of CO2 emissions) by metakaolin and wastes derived from two industrial sectors operating in the “Galicia–North of Portugal Euroregion”: wood manufacturing and natural stone quarrying. A study was carried out at the mortar level to investigate the effect of the mix design variables on several engineering properties of the self-compacting concrete. Statistically designed experiments reveal that an increase in water/powder volume ratio has a dominant effect on the fresh state properties, whereas the water/cement weight ratio has a dominant effect on the hardened state properties. A like-for-like comparison of the proposed quaternary blends and previously studied binary/ternary blends indicates that these mixtures exhibit improved self-compacting ability, greater compressive strength, and can offer interesting opportunities to reduce the unit cost and environmental impact of self-compacting concrete per m3. Four different mortar mixtures were optimised to achieve excellent self-compacting ability yet with distinct compressive strength levels at 28 days (65, 70, 75, and 80 MPa). A single measure of the material efficiency is proposed herein to reflect the engineering properties improvement (workability, compressive strength, and durability) over its economic (unit cost) and environmental impact. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass ash; Granite powder; Material efficiency; Metakaolin; Statistical factorial design; Waste minimisation","Binary mixtures; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Compressive strength; Concrete industry; Concrete mixtures; Concrete products; Cost engineering; Efficiency; Industrial emissions; Mortar; Portland cement; Waste management; Circular economy; Designed experiments; Engineering properties; Industrial sector; Material efficiency; Resource efficiencies; Supplementary cementitious material; Sustainable waste management; Self compacting concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084552139

However, when using fossil fuels, the effects on the environment have been shown to be quite harmful, according to data from the IPCC, the UN body responsible for controlling carbon dioxide emissions and causing the atmosphere to heat up or the greenhouse effect. Thus generating energy from renewable sources is important to create a future scenario of technological and economic development without damage to our habitat. In this work, we analyze data from intensive swine farming in the Northwest Mesoregion of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to present the wasted energy potential by not transforming the biogas from the activity into electricity and how much this volume of gas generates from dioxide carbon equivalent directly into the atmosphere. By analyzing this region, with data from the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock, it was possible to determine an energy potential above 13 thousand cubic meters per hour (13,000 m3/h) of biogas, which means an energy potential for transformation of 37 MWh and an emission of CO2 greater than 6.5 tCO2e/h, in a conversion between the potential of Methane (21 times more polluting than CO2) contained in the biogas in a concentration around 60% and that brings a considerable calorific power to transform this biogas into electricity. For this purpose, the rules of Aneel Resolution 482/2012 and revised by 687/2015 will be used, which allows energy compensation for renewable energy thrown directly into the electricity distribution network from the application of biodigesters. Through the analysis carried out it was possible to determine that there is a high potential to generate electricity and reduce the emission of gases that cause the greenhouse effect in this region, as it concentrates, a large volume of swines in intensive livestock. © 2020 IEEE.","Biodigestor; De-carbonization; Distributed Generation; Potential Energy; Renewable Energy","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Electric utilities; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Metadata; Carbon dioxide emissions; Dioxide carbons; Electricity distribution networks; Energy compensation; Energy from renewable sources; Generate electricity; Renewable energies; Rio Grande do Sul; Greenhouse effect",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100842849

Although the impacts of climate change on water resources have been relatively well explored for the Mediterranean climatic region, the specific consequences for reservoirs and, in particular, water availability and irrigation issues have been less studied. The objective of this work is two-fold: (i) to assess the impacts of future climate changes on water resources availability, quality (focusing on phosphorus loads as this is the limiting nutrient for eutrophication) and irrigation needs for two multipurpose reservoirs in southern Portugal; (ii) to suggest climate change adaptation strategies, especially for the agricultural sector. To this end, the SWAT model was first calibrated against existing data on reservoir inflows as well as phosphorus loads. Then, SWAT was run with climate derived EURO-CORDEX models (RCA4/RACMO22E) for four periods (1970–2000, 2010–2040, 2040–2070 and 2070–2100). Water availability was analysed using the Water Exploitation Index (WEI) that was calculated for both reservoirs combining changes of inflows and irrigation requirements. The results indicated that climate change will negatively impact water availability in both reservoirs, especially under RCP8.5. In the case of the Monte Novo reservoir, future domestic water supply could be constrained by water quality problems related with phosphorus loads. For Vigia reservoir, the high water exploitation will lead to water scarcity problems, mainly as this reservoir on present-day conditions is restrictive on irrigation requirements. Adaptation strategies such as the implementation of high end technology (e.g. soil moisture and plant water stress probes, satellite imagery and drones to evaluate water stress – NDVI) as well as the renewal of the irrigation network and adequate crop selection can help attenuating the effects of climate change on the water resources in this region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alentejo multipurpose reservoirs; Climate change; SWAT modelling; Water availability; WEI – Water exploitation index","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Eutrophication; Irrigation; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Reservoirs (water); Satellite imagery; Soil moisture; Water quality; Water resources; Water supply; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Domestic water supply; Irrigation requirements; Multipurpose reservoirs; Seasonal precipitations; Water quality problems; Water resources availability; Climate change; phosphorus; climate change; climate effect; irrigation; Mediterranean environment; reservoir; water availability; water quality; water resource; Article; climate change; crop; demography; environmental impact; eutrophication; geographic distribution; Portugal; priority journal; water availability; water conservation; water management; water supply; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085555658

However, the extent to which adding Earth system components changes or improves the simulation of the physical climate is not well understood. Here we present a broad multivariate evaluation of the North Atlantic climate system in historical simulations of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) performed for CMIP6. In particular, we focus on the mean state and the decadal time scale evolution of important variables that span the North Atlantic climate system. In general, UKESM1 performs well and realistically simulates many aspects of the North Atlantic climate system. Like the physical version of the model, we find that changes in external forcing, and particularly aerosol forcing, are an important driver of multidecadal change in UKESM1, especially for Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. However, many of the shortcomings identified are similar to common biases found in physical climate models, including the physical climate model that underpins UKESM1. For example, the summer jet is too weak and too far poleward; decadal variability in the winter jet is underestimated; intraseasonal stratospheric polar vortex variability is poorly represented; and Arctic sea ice is too thick. Forced shortwave changes may be also too strong in UKESM1, which, given the important role of historical aerosol forcing in shaping the evolution of the North Atlantic in UKESM1, motivates further investigation. Therefore, physical model development, alongside Earth system development, remains crucial in order to improve climate simulations. ©2020.

These emissions can reach hundreds of kg CH4 per year per well and are important to include in greenhouse gas emission inventories and mitigation strategies. Emission estimates are generally based on single, short-term measurements that assume constant emission rates over both short (hours) and longer (months/years) time periods. To investigate this assumption, we measure CH4 emissions from 18 abandoned oil and gas wells in the USA and the UK continuously over 24 h and then make repeat 24 -h measurements at a single site over 12 months. While the lack of historical records for these wells makes it impossible to determine the underlying leakage-pathways, we observed that CH4 emissions at all wells varied over 24 h (range 0.2-81,000 mg CH4 hr−1) with average emissions varying by a factor of 18 and ranging from factors of 1.1–142. We did not find a statistically significant relationship between the magnitude of emissions and variability or that variability is correlated with temperature, relative humidity or atmospheric pressure. The results presented here suggest high CH4 emission events tend to be short-lived, so short-term (&lt; 1 h) sampling is likely to miss them. Our findings present the dynamic nature of CH4 emissions from abandoned oil and gas wells which should be considered when planning measurement methodologies and developing greenhouse gas inventories/mitigation strategies. Incorporation of these temporal dynamics could improve national greenhouse gas emissions inventories. © 2020","Abandoned wells; Long-term; Methane; Oil and gas wells","Abandoned wells; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric pressure; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Natural gas wells; Constant-emissions; Greenhouse gas emission inventories; Greenhouse gas inventory; Historical records; Measurement methodology; Methane emissions; Mitigation strategy; Temporal dynamics; Gas emissions; abandoned land; emission inventory; gas well; greenhouse gas; measurement method; methane; mitigation; oil well; pollution control; strategic approach; temporal variation; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087945552

Vast amounts of C are stored in northern high latitude soils, and rising temperatures in the Arctic threaten to thaw permafrost, making relatively inaccessible C sources more available for mineralization by soil microbes. Few studies have characterized how microbial community structure responds to thawing permafrost in the context of varying soil chemistries associated with contrasting tundra landscapes. We subjected active layer and permafrost soils from upland and lowland tundra sites on the North Slope of Alaska to a soil-warming incubation experiment and compared soil bacterial community profiles (obtained by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) before and after incubation. The influence of soil composition (characterized by mid-infrared [MIR] spectroscopy) on bacterial community structure and class abundance was analyzed using redundancy and correlation analyses. We found increased abundances of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes [Sphingobacteriia] post incubation, particularly in permafrost soils. The categorical descriptors site and soil layer had the most explanatory power in our predictive models of bacterial community structure, highlighting the close relationship between soil bacteria and the soil environment. Specific soil chemical attributes characterizing the soil environments that were found to be the best predictors included MIR spectral bands associated with inorganic C, silicates, amide II (C[dbnd]N stretch), and carboxylics (C–O stretch), and MIR peak ratios representing C substrate quality. Overall, these results further characterize soil bacterial community shifts that may occur as frozen environments with limited access to C sources, as is found in undisturbed permafrost, transition to warmer and more C-available environments, as is predicted in thawing permafrost due to climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","16S rRNA sequencing; Arctic tundra soil incubations; Bacterial community structure; Mid-infrared spectroscopy; Permafrost carbon; Soil organic matter chemistry","Amides; Bacteria; Climate change; Landforms; Predictive analytics; RNA; Silicates; Thawing; Bacterial community structure; Chemical attributes; Correlation analysis; Gammaproteobacteria; Microbial community structures; North Slope of Alaska; Soil bacterial community; Soil microbial community; Permafrost; abundance; active layer; arctic environment; bacterium; community structure; microbial community; mineralization; permafrost; soil chemistry; soil microorganism; thawing; tundra soil; Alaska; North Slope; United States; Alphaproteobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Gammaproteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088231015

We set up a quantitative model to analyze efficient levels of SRM deployment against the climatic and economic background conditions projected by the various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) baseline scenarios for the year 2050. The model combines three features of the data: i) SRM deployment is regionally uneven in the way it affects grid-cell temperature and precipitation, ii) temperature and precipitation affect Gross Value Added (GVA) at the grid-cell level and the effect for both takes the form of an inverted U-shape relationship, implying that optimal temperature and precipitation levels with respect to output do exist, and iii) different assumptions about economic growth and its distribution over regions, as projected by the SSPs, increase the relative share of global GVA for currently rather poor countries with high average temperatures. We find that in global terms, economically efficient levels of SRM are affected more by region-specific economic growth projections than by regional climate-change impacts. Globally, the economically efficient SRM level is proportional to the (global) GVA-weighted mean temperature increase, which varies considerably according to the various growth projections (for equal climatic background conditions). Achieving the optimal temperature in each scenario is constrained by the influence of SRM on precipitation. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate engineering; Climate-change winners and losers; Governance; Solar radiation management","Climate change; Developing countries; Background conditions; Gross value added; Growth projections; Optimal temperature; Precipitation level; Quantitative modeling; Radiation management; Regional climate changes; Economics; climate change; climate effect; economic growth; environmental economics; precipitation (climatology); solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090573816

The dominant approach has been to invest in technological innovations that increase household energy efficiency. This article moves beyond this approach, first by emphasising the need to prioritise reducing energy demand over increasing energy efficiency and, second, by addressing the challenge of energy consumption at the level of the community, not the individual household. It argues that energy consumption is shaped in and by social communities, which construct consciousness of the energy implications of lifestyle choices. By analysing a specific type of community, a digital community, it looks at the role that communication on online discussion boards plays in the social process of questioning energy needs and shaping a “decent lifestyle”. The article explores three social processes of community interaction around energy practices – coercive, mimetic, and normative – questioning the ways in which they contribute to the activation of energy discursive consciousness. In conclusion, the article reflects on the potential implications of these social processes for future research and interventions aimed at reducing energy demand. To illustrate how the three selected social processes influence one another, the article builds on the results of a research project conducted in Amsterdam, analysing the potential contribution of online discussion boards in shaping energy norms in the Sustainable Community of Amsterdam Facebook group. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Community-oriented energy policies; Decency; Decent lifestyle; Energy discursive consciousness; Energy needs; Online discussion boards",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084701099

The emergent constraint approach has seen broad application in recent years, including studies constraining the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) using the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP). Most of these studies were based on ordinary least squares (OLS) fits between a variable of the climate state, such as tropical temperature, and climate sensitivity. Using our Bayesian method, and considering the LGM and mPWP separately, we obtain values of ECS of 2.7K (0.6-5.2, 5th-95th percentiles) using the PMIP2, PMIP3, and PMIP4 datasets for the LGM and 2.3K (0.5-4.4) with the PlioMIP1 and PlioMIP2 datasets for the mPWP. Restricting the ensembles to include only the most recent version of each model, we obtain 2.7K (0.7-5.2) using the LGM and 2.3K (0.4-4.5) using the mPWP. An advantage of the Bayesian framework is that it is possible to combine the two periods assuming they are independent, whereby we obtain a tighter constraint of 2.5K (0.8-4.0) using the restricted ensemble. We have explored the sensitivity to our assumptions in the method, including considering structural uncertainty, and in the choice of models, and this leads to 95% probability of climate sensitivity mostly below 5K and only exceeding 6K in a single and most uncertain case assuming a large structural uncertainty. The approach is compared with other approaches based on OLS, a Kalman filter method, and an alternative Bayesian method. An interesting implication of this work is that OLS-based emergent constraints on ECS generate tighter uncertainty estimates, in particular at the lower end, an artefact due to a flatter regression line in the case of lack of correlation. Although some fundamental challenges related to the use of emergent constraints remain, this paper provides a step towards a better foundation for their potential use in future probabilistic estimations of climate sensitivity. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Bayesian analysis; climate change; climate effect; ensemble forecasting; numerical model; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091823923

It was found that the flue gas/fly ash partitioning behaviors of chlorinated aromatics could be essentially described by their octanol-air partition coefficients (KOA) and strongly affected by the flue gas temperature. Above 93% of chlorinated aromatics formed in boiler section was partitioned into the flue gas and transported into the subsequent flue gas cleaning system, in which above 92% of Cl3–8DDs, Cl3–7DFs, Cl5–10Bs and Cl4–8Ns in flue gas was removed by the discharge of fly ash. The results of mass flux calculation indicated that the memory effect in flue gas cleaning system remarkably elevated the emission levels of chlorinated aromatics, especially the less chlorinated ones. The memory effect should mainly result from the direct chlorination mechanism mediated by the deposited particles. In addition, activated carbon injection could cause an obvious increase in PCBs emission. The obtained results provided some important implications for further reducing the emission of highly toxic chlorinated aromatics. © 2020","Chlorinated aromatics; Dioxins; Distribution behavior; Municipal solid waste incineration; Removal efficiency","Activated carbon; Aromatization; Flue gases; Flues; Fly ash; Gases; Municipal solid waste; Naphthalene; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Activated carbon injection; Chlorinated aromatics; Flue gas cleaning; Flue gas temperatures; Octanol air-partition; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans; Polychlorinated naphthalene (PCNs); Waste incineration; activated carbon; aromatic compound; dibenzofuran; octanol; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated naphthalene; activated carbon; chlorination; emission control; incineration; municipal solid waste; partitioning; PCB; PCDD; PCN; pollutant removal; Article; ash; combustion; gas; incineration; mass spectrometry; municipal solid waste; partition coefficient; priority journal; quality control; temperature; waste component removal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085253903

But so far, no industrial oil or gas flow is discovered in igneous rocks in Brazilian onshore basins. At present, in some literatures published by some researchers, cases of igneous reservoirs in Brazil are inaccurate. The lithology of reservoirs in the Igarape Cuia oil and gas field, the oil and gas field of Urucu and the Barra Bonita gasfield, were previously thought to be volcanic rocks, but now are clastic rocks according to studies, and the igneous rocks in these three oil and gas field can only be acted as indirect and direct cap rocks. Furthermore, igneous rock reservoirs in the Campos Basin and Santos Basin in the Brazilian offshore are briefly analyzed. The representative Badejo oilfield in the Campos Basin has igneous rock reservoirs dominated by basalts which are intercalated with thin layers of volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks, the storage space are vesicules, fractures and vugular pores, and the porosity of hydrocarbon bearing interval basalt reservoirs ranges from 10% to 15%. In addition, for the Santos Basin, igneous rocks in this basin are dominated by basic rocks, some alkaline intrusive rocks develop good micro spaces, mainly crystal moldic pores, inter- and intra-crystal dissolution pores and fractures, better reservoir intervals are often concentrated such as at sections near to unconformity surfaces and can have porosity of 6%–9% or higher; local pre-salt igneous rock reservoirs in the Santos Basin have the necessary conditions for hydrocarbon accumulation and it will be a new target layer for hydrocarbon exploration. © 2020 Chinese Petroleum Society","Badejo oilfield; Brazil; Campos basin; Igneous reservoirs; Offshore; Pre-salt igneous rocks; Santos basin",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087970879

Efforts to reduce N from agricultural sources largely rely on voluntary efforts by farmers to reduce inputs and improve uptake by crops. However, research has failed to comprehensively depict farmers’ N decision-making processes, particularly when engaging with uncertainty.Through analysis of in-depth interviews with US corn (Zea mays L.) growers, this study reveals how farmers experience and process numerous uncertainties associated with N management, such as weather variability, crop and input price volatility, lack of knowledge about biophysical systems, and the possibility of underapplying or overapplying. Farmers used one of two general decision-making management strategies to address these uncertainties: heuristic-based or data-intensive decision-making. Heuristic-based decision-making involves minimizing sources of uncertainty and reliance on heuristics and personal previous experiences, while data-intensive decision-making is the increased use of field- and farm-scale data collection and management, as well as increased management effort within a given growing season. © 2020 Soil Conservation Society of America.

The conversion of waste biomass into biochar could help to mitigate CO2 emissions, reduce the generation of CH4 emissions, and increase the carbon sequestration in the soil for sustainable climate-smart agriculture. In this study, biochar was produced from animal manure through the pyrolysis process at different temperatures, and its effect on the water-holding capacity of different types of soils and maize growth was determined. From a total of 60 ​kg dried cow manure, 20 ​kg biochar with the percentage turnover of 33% was obtained and percent yield of biochar was found to be associated with pyrolytic temperature. The water-holding capacity of sandy loamy soils was found to be increased by 1.5% by mass for each 1% biochar addition in the soil. At a higher percentage of biochar in soil, the water holding capacity was found maximum but the germination percentage was lowest because biochar holds the soil nutrients. In conclusion, manure-based biochar addition could enhance the water holding capacity of the soil and improve crop yield by conserving the rainfall water in arid regions. © 2020 The Authors","Biochar: water holding capacity; Biomass; Environmental pollution; Pyrolysis; Soil quality; Waste valorization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102428663

Such strategies can present significant challenges in highly modified and intensively farmed regions where forest land use opportunity and establishment costs are high. This article evaluates the economics of land-use change via active afforestation for local carbon abatement in the Australian state of South Australia, a region with high supply costs representative of long-established temperate farming regions. We found that there is no economically viable abatement below $38 tCO2e−1, however up to 154 Mt CO2e of abatement could be available up to prices of $50 tCO2e−1. Variation in current Australian Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) policy parameters related to permanence and crediting periods were also assessed. Recent ERF contracts involve a 100-year land-use change commitment (permanence period) and a 25-year crediting period where payments for growth in carbon from the land-use change is contracted. We compared outcomes of this arrangement to a scenario with equal 100-year permanence and crediting periods. We found substantial differences in carbon supply at some price points for a 25 rather than a 100-year crediting period. Under ERF parameters the first economically viable revegetation options occur at $42 tCO2e−1, however, we found a 69 percent reduction in economically viable supply at a carbon price of $50 tCO2e−1. The results highlight the role offset crediting policy can have on dis-incentivising land-use change and the need for landholders to be compensated fully for temporal opportunity costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Australia; Carbon neutral; Climate change mitigation; Emissions reduction fund (ERF); Land use change","abatement cost; afforestation; carbon sequestration; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; forest cover; governance approach; Australia; South Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086567884

The local alteration of solvation structures gets reflected in the vibrational spectroscopic signal. Although it is possible to detect this microscopic feature by modern infrared spectroscopy, bulk phase spectra often come with a formidable challenge of establishing the connection of experimental spectra to molecular structures. Theoretical spectroscopy can serve as a more powerful tool where spectroscopic data cannot provide the microscopic picture. In the present work, we build a theoretical spectroscopic map based on a hybrid quantum-classical molecular simulation approach using a methane-water system. The single oscillator O-H stretch frequency is well correlated with a collective variable solvation energy. We construct the spectroscopic maps for fundamental transition frequencies and also the transition dipoles. A bimodal frequency distribution with a blue-shifted population of transition frequency illustrates the presence of gas like water molecules in the hydration shell of methane. This observation is further complemented by a shell-wise decomposition of the O-H stretch frequencies. We observe a significant increase in the ordering of the first solvation water molecules, except those which are directly facing the methane molecule. This is manifested in the redshift of the observed transition frequencies. Temperature dependent simulations depict that the water molecules facing the methane molecule behave similarly to the high temperature water, and a few of the first shell water molecules behave more like cold water. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Blue shift; Facings; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrophobicity; Infrared spectroscopy; Methane; Molecular structure; Solvation; Frequency distributions; High-temperature water; Hydrogen bond networks; Molecular simulations; Spectroscopic signals; Temperature dependent; Theoretical spectroscopies; Transition frequencies; Molecules",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090375977

Abstract: Rice holds the key to future food security. In rice-growing areas, temperature has already reached an optimum level for growth, hence, any further increase due to global climate change could significantly reduce rice yield. Several mapping studies have identified a plethora of reproductive tissue-specific and heat stress associated inconsistent quantitative trait loci (QTL), which could be exploited for improvement of heat tolerance. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis on previously reported QTLs and identified 35 most consistent meta-QTLs (MQTLs) across diverse genetic backgrounds and environments. Genetic and physical intervals of nearly 66% MQTLs were narrower than 5 cM and 2 Mb respectively, indicating hotspot genomic regions for heat tolerance. Comparative analyses of MQTLs underlying genes with microarray and RNA-seq based transcriptomic data sets revealed a core set of 45 heat-responsive genes, among which 24 were reproductive tissue-specific and have not been studied in detail before. Remarkably, all these genes corresponded to various stress associated functions, ranging from abiotic stress sensing to regulating plant stress responses, and included heat-shock genes (OsBiP2, OsMed37_1), transcription factors (OsNAS3, OsTEF1, OsWRKY10, OsWRKY21), transmembrane transporters (OsAAP7A, OsAMT2;1), sugar metabolizing (OsSUS4, α-Gal III) and abiotic stress (OsRCI2-7, SRWD1) genes. Functional data evidences from Arabidopsis heat-shock genes also suggest that OsBIP2 may be associated with thermotolerance of pollen tubes under heat stress conditions. Furthermore, promoters of identified genes were enriched with heat, dehydration, pollen and sugar responsive cis-acting regulatory elements, proposing a common regulatory mechanism might exist in rice for mitigating reproductive stage heat stress. These findings strongly support our results and provide new candidate genes for fast-track development of heat-tolerant rice cultivars. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Bioinformatics; High temperature; Marker-assisted breeding; Meta-analysis; Oryza sativa","plant protein; gene expression regulation; genetic database; genetics; genomics; growth, development and aging; heat; heat shock response; heat tolerance; metabolism; Oryza; phenotype; physiological stress; physiology; plant development; plant gene; promoter region; quantitative trait locus; reproduction; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Genomics; Heat-Shock Response; Hot Temperature; Oryza; Phenotype; Plant Development; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Quantitative Trait Loci; Reproduction; Stress, Physiological; Thermotolerance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087698701

Greenhouse agriculture is considered to be a viable alternative and sustainable solution, which can combat the future food crisis by controlling the local environment and growing crops all year round, even in harsh outdoor conditions. However, greenhouse farms persist many challenges for efficient operation and management. The evolving Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which encompass the smart sensors, devices, network topologies, big data analytics, and intelligent decision is believed to be the solution in addressing the key challenges facing the greenhouse farming, such as greenhouse local climate control, crop growth monitoring, crop harvesting and etc. This paper reviews the current greenhouse cultivation technologies as well as the state-of-the-art of IoT technologies for smart greenhouse farms. The paper also highlights the major challenges that need to be addressed. © 2017 IEEE.","agriculture; greenhouse farming; IoT; RFID; sensors; smart farming","Advanced Analytics; Agricultural robots; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Data Analytics; Food supply; Greenhouses; Intelligent well technology; Intelligent decisions; Internet of Things (IOT); Local environments; Operation and management; Population explosion; State of the art; Sustainable agriculture; Sustainable solution; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089623481

If fossil fuel owners do not cooperate in CO 2 emission reduction efforts, the only strategy to reduce their fossil fuels’ use is to exploit the interconnectedness of production given by international trade. We compare a Pigouvian approach, namely a subsidy for renewable energy prices, and a Coasian supply-side strategy, buying extractive rights over fossil fuel deposits abroad. Using a dynamic North–South trade model with endogenous innovation, we show how these policies, designed to prevent an environmental disaster, have different cost and welfare profiles. If fossil fuel deposits can be purchased at their market price, the supply-side policy achieves the highest welfare. If instead the fossil fuel owners require a full compensation for their income loss, subsidies for renewable energy inputs can result in higher welfare, but only if the resource-rich region has less advanced technologies for green energy production than the countries implementing the policy. © 2020, The Author(s).","Directed technical change; Energy; Fossil fuels; Supply-side policies; Trade","Costs; Deposits; Disaster prevention; Emission control; Energy policy; Fossil fuel deposits; Fuel economy; International trade; Advanced technology; Carbon emissions; CO2 emission reduction; Environmental disasters; Fossil fuel resources; Green energy production; Green innovations; Renewable energies; Fossil fuels; alternative energy; carbon emission; coal; economic conditions; energy policy; fossil fuel; global economy; green economy; market conditions; policy implementation; price determination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088278388

Here we present a multiproxy paleoecological record from a compressed peat, uncovered at Casaletto Ceredano, N-Italy, spanning the interval from 33 to 30.5 kyr cal BP. Stratigraphically, it underlies a fluvioglacial belt attributed to the Last Glacial Maximum. The peat records a floodplain swamp community with tree birch and tall sedges, pine woodlands in upland areas, and only limited patches of open vegetation. Plant macrofossils – bark, charcoal, wood and fruits – establish the predominant role of Betula pubescens group (downy birch) in the anoxic wetland, thanks to its ability to enhance gas exchange through a distinctive type of bark lenticels. A fire-induced birch-to-pine cycle is repeated twice along the 2500 years-time span covered by the peat layer. The climate reconstructed from modern pollen analogs compares to northern boreal zone, with Tjuly < 15 °C, excluding warm-temperate trees. A major flood sealing the swamp with minerogenic silt is precisely dated to 30,497 ± 594 yr cal BP (2σ uncertainty). Here, the pollen record shows a substantial forest withdrawal, and development of grasslands and semideserts, pointing to co-factorial action of increased climate continentality and of river dynamics.

Two amorphous Mg-rich silicate phases were identified upon activation. A rapid and complete carbonation of a highly reactive amorphous silicate phase was observed under moderately low pressure and temperature conditions (50−120 °C, 6 bar). Carbonation of this phase yielded to the formation of carbonates and a Si-rich passivating phase. On the other hand, the other amorphous silicate phase remained unaltered upon carbonation, fixing a significant amount of Mg within its disordered structure. The presence of poorly reactive intermediate Mg-rich silicate and Si-rich phases might be responsible for the yet unanswered relatively low carbonation efficiencies obtained via direct carbonation of activated lizardite. These limiting factors are considered to reduce the carbonation yield significantly more than the nucleation of forsterite during thermal activation. Analogous experiments carried with different meta-serpentines yielded the formation of distinct carbonate phases. The different distribution of highly and poorly-reactive amorphous phases among the different activated materials might have played an important role in the accelerated formation of magnesite (which was observed to occur once hydromagnesite formation reached a steady state) and the transformation of nesquehonite to dypingite-like phases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Activated serpentine; Amorphous materials; CO2 sequestration; Magnesite formation; Mineral carbonation","Chemical activation; Kaolinite; Magnesite; Serpentine; Silicates; Silicon; Activated materials; Amorphous phasis; Amorphous silicates; Different distributions; Disordered structures; Hydromagnesite; Reactive intermediate; Thermal activation; Carbonation; amorphous medium; forsterite; lizardite; magnesite; magnesium; serpentine; silicate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087876838

The formation of YAG nanophosphor is confirmed by XRD patterns and TEM images revealing crystalline size in the range of 40–50 nm. The absorption peaks of the doubly doped sample are the conflation of the absorption due to both the Pr3+ and Sm3+ ions. The laser excitations by 405 and 450 nm yield sharp and intense emissions in the orange-red region due to the combinatorial emission of both the doped species. Results were estimated from the powder sample as well as homo and hetro-layered structures. The emission intensity was found to improve with the number of layers. The intensity of characteristic emission peaks of Sm3+ ions was found to reduce in presence of Pr3+ ions. XPS analysis reveals a change in valance state of Pr3+ to Pr4+ and Sm3+ to Sm2+ ion, which is reported to be responsible for the emission intensity reduction. The dual-beam excitation of Pr and Sm doped layer yield bright emission of both the species although the 0.8Sm@0.1Pr layers yields a combinatorial emission with modified intensity. The time-resolved emission spectroscopy indicates the weak interaction between the doped species.

Therefore, understanding the climatic drivers and ultimately predicting these low-frequency variations are important. Extreme sea level indicators are used to represent the variations in 100-year return water levels, estimated with a nonstationary extreme value analysis. Here, we develop prediction models in the frequency domain. Extreme sea level indicators (response) and potential predictors (traditional climate indices, sea level pressure [SLP], or sea surface temperature [SST]) are decomposed into subseries corresponding to predefined frequencies using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and regression models are formulated for each frequency separately. In the case of traditional climate indices, subseries of climate indices that provide the highest correlation with the corresponding subseries of indicators are used in the regression models, and original indicators are reconstructed by aggregating predicted subseries. Tailored climate indices are developed for each frequency band by averaging wavelet decomposed subseries of SLP or SST from grid locations where correlations with corresponding decomposed subseries of extreme sea level indicators are highest and robust. Models with wavelet filtered climate indices reproduce the variability and general trends of the indicators. The use of tailored indices further improves the model performance in predicting extreme sea level variations. Model performance in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency statistics varies from 0.54 to 0.93. Prediction of extreme sea level indicators using tailored indices derived from SLP and SST of initialized decadal climate model simulations is also tested to facilitate progress toward forecasting extreme sea level variations at decadal time scales. ©2020.

Carbon (‘C’) sequestering through agroforestry is one of the ways to mitigate the carbon reduction and provide safeguards to the environment for livelihood. The present study was conducted on Grewia optiva tree which is dominated in agroforestry systems of Tehri Garhwal Himalaya (Uttarakhand) in different villages at three altitudes, i.e., upper altitudes (UA), middle altitude (MA), and lower altitude (LA) ranged from 500 to 1500 m amsl. Soil moisture, water holding capacity (WHC), bulk density (BD), and soil organic carbon (SOC) reported highest in LA compared to MA and UA, which might be because of all eroded material deposited in LA. Further, nitrogen storage in UA is higher due to comparatively low temperature significantly lower the microbial activities for N2O emission than MA and LA. The low nitogen in LA might be due to higher nitrification and/or denitrification rate. The same also supported by low carbon content (energy sources to microbial activity) in LA. The density of Grewia optiva in agroforestry was high in LA; however, total tree carbon was highest in MA (20.8 t/ha) followed by UA (20.4 t/ha) and LA (19.1 t/ha) while annual shoot carbon was highest in LA (2.43 t/ha) followed by MA (1.08 t/ha) and UA (0.77 t/ha). Further, carbon credit likely to be earned from the agroforestry under G. optiva is estimated as 553,702 Euro.

When the climate change indicators are very visible in the region, many-sided concerns upshot thereby, especially encircling the species composition change, biodiversity loss, frequent environmental stresses, food security, landslides, snowstorms, agro-biodiversity, livelihood and human health. Other than the general footprints, climate change negatively impacts the overall performance of the plants either directly or indirectly by changing the intensity and frequency of abiotic stress factors. As diverse plant species growing in higher altitudes of the region are open to very unfavourable and harsh conditions, especially low temperature, these provide insights into different adaptive mechanisms for abiotic stress tolerance and can be dissected for the same. From time to time, efforts have been made to develop stress resilient crops or climate smart agriculture. A holistic approach comprising the fields of agricultural biotechnology, socio-cultural integrity and crop ecology is going to provide an excellent insight into climate change mitigation strategies and plant abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms in the delicate ecosystem.

For this purpose, we compiled a detailed emission inventory following SNAP categories focusing on the detailed representations of road traffic and shipping emissions. The emission inventory was applied to a global-to-local Chemistry Transport Model (CTM) system to simulate hourly NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations with a horizontal grid resolution of 500 m. To simulate urban-scale pollutant concentrations we used the coupled prognostic meteorological and chemistry transport model TAPM. The comparison of modelled to measured hourly values gives high correlation and small bias at urban and background stations but large underestimations of NO2 and PM2.5 at measurements stations near roads. Simulated contributions of road traffic emissions to annual mean concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 is highest close to highways with relative contributions of 50% for NO2 and 40% for PM2.5. Nevertheless, the urban domain is widely affected by road traffic, especially in the city centre. Shipping impact focuses on the port and nearby industrial areas with contributions of up to 60% for NO2 and 40% for PM2.5. In residential areas in the north of the port, shipping contributes with up to 20–30% for NO2 and PM2.5. Our simulation resulted in 14% of the population of Hamburg being exposed to hourly NO2 concentration above the hourly limit of 200 μg/m³, &lt;1% to annual NO2 concentrations above the annual limit of 40 μg/m³, and 39% to PM2.5 concentrations above the annual WHO limit of 10 μg/m³. The calculation of the population-weighted mean exposure (PWE) to NO2 and PM2.5 reveals mean exposures of 20.51 μg/m³ for NO2 and 9.42 μg/m³ for PM2.5. In terms of PWE to NO2, traffic contributes 22.7% to the total and is 1.6 times higher than the contribution of shipping (13.9%). In total, traffic and shipping contribute with 36.6% to the NO2 PWE in Hamburg in 2012. When it comes to PM2.5, traffic contributes 18.1% and is 5.3 times higher than the contribution from shipping (3.4%). In total, traffic and shipping contribute 21.5% to the PM2.5 PWE in Hamburg in 2012. Two local scenarios for emissions reductions have been applied. A scenario simulating decrease in shipping emissions by instalment of on-shore electricity for ships at berth, revealed reduction potentials of up to 40% for total NO2 exposure and 35% for PM2.5 respectively. A road traffic scenario simulating a change in the fleet composition in an inner city zone, shows lower reduction potentials of up to 18% for total exposure to NO2 and 7% for PM2.5 respectively. The discussion of uncertainties revealed high potentials for improving the emission inventories, chemical transport simulation setup and exposure estimates. Due to the use of exposure calculations for policy support and in health-effect studies, it is indispensable to reduce and quantify uncertainties in future studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical transport modelling; NO2; PM2.5; Population exposure; Road traffic; Shipping; TAPM; Transport emissions; Urban air pollution","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Roads and streets; Ships; Uncertainty analysis; Urban transportation; Chemistry transport model; Emission inventories; PM2.5 concentration; Pollutant concentration; Population exposure; Reduction potential; Relative contribution; Road traffic emissions; Nitrogen oxides; nitric oxide; air quality; concentration (composition); emission inventory; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollution exposure; road traffic; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; air pollutant; air quality; Article; city; exhaust gas; highway; human; industrial area; meteorology; particulate matter; population exposure; priority journal; residential area; shipping; simulation; Hamburg",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087342704

Ships emit substantial amounts of sulfur dioxides, nitrogen dioxides, and particulate matter in the vicinity of coasts, threatening the health of the coastal population, especially in harbour cities. Reductions in emissions due to shipping have been targeted by several regulations. Nevertheless, effects of these regulations come into force with temporal delays, global ship traffic is expected to grow in the future, and other land-based anthropogenic emissions might decrease. Thus, it is necessary to investigate combined impacts to identify the impact of shipping activities on air quality, population exposure, and health effects in the future. We investigated the future effect of shipping emissions on air quality and related health effects considering different scenarios of the development of shipping under current regional trends of economic growth and already decided regulations in the Gothenburg urban area in 2040. Additionally, we investigated the impact of a large-scale implementation of shore electricity in the Port of Gothenburg. For this purpose, we established a one-way nested chemistry transport modelling (CTM) system from the global to the urban scale, to calculate pollutant concentrations, population-weighted concentrations, and health effects related to NO2, PM 2.5, and O3. The simulated concentrations of NO2 and PM 2.5 in future scenarios for the year 2040 are in general very low with up to 4ppb for NO2 and up to 3.5 μgm -3 PM 2.5 in the urban areas which are not close to the port area. From 2012 the simulated overall exposure to PM 2.5 decreased by approximately 30% in simulated future scenarios; for NO2 the decrease was over 60%. The simulated concentrations of O3 increased from the year 2012 to 2040 by about 20%. In general, the contributions of local shipping emissions in 2040 focus on the harbour area but to some extent also influence the rest of the city domain. The simulated impact of onshore electricity implementation forshipping in 2040 shows reductions for NO2 in the port of up to 30%, while increasing O3 of up to 3%. Implementation of onshore electricity for ships at berth leads to additional local reduction potentials of up to 3% for PM 2.5 and 12% for SO2 in the port area. All future scenarios show substantial decreases in population-weighted exposure and health-effect impacts. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; exhaust emission; harbor; health impact; health risk; maritime transportation; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; shipping; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091822924

These strategies are likely to simultaneously improve local air quality, leading to public health and monetary co-benefits. We quantify and monetarily value the health impacts of eliminating emissions from the City of Boston, and in doing so, highlight the importance of considering health impacts alongside environmental impacts of local climate action. We simulated at a 4 km resolution how the elimination of anthropogenic emissions from the City of Boston would impact air quality within a 120 km by 120 km study domain. We then estimated how this change in air quality would impact a number of annual health outcomes, as well as the associated monetary savings. We found that eliminating anthropogenic emissions from Boston would result in a decline in PM2.5 concentration across the entire study region ranging from 8.5 µg m-3 in Boston to less than 1 µg m-3 elsewhere in the domain. In addition, we estimate that summer ozone would increase for the Greater Boston Area and areas west, and decrease elsewhere. The monetary impact of the change in air quality on health is estimated to be a $2.4 billion per year savings across the full domain and $1.7 billion within Suffolk County only, about 1.4% of the gross domestic product of the county. These monetary impacts are driven primarily by reduced incidence of mortality. We estimate that 288 deaths would be avoided per year across the study domain from eliminating Boston anthropogenic emissions, about six deaths avoided, annually, per 100 000 people. Within Suffolk County, we estimate that 47 deaths would be avoided per 100 000 people, around 16% of all-cause premature mortality. We also found a net decrease in cardiovascular and respiratory illness. Across the study domain, these health benefits would be disproportionately conferred upon people of color. © 2020 The Author(s).

In the absence of sufficiently stringent demand-side policies, supply-side injunctions provide a potential avenue to expedite the decline of coal. In many coal-producing jurisdictions, the law provides grounds to revoke coal mining permits. Recent plans to phase out coal use in Germany provide an interesting testing ground for this concept. We study the case of permits granted to RWE Power AG to continue operating Europe’s largest opencast lignite mine, situated at the 12,000-year-old Hambach Forest in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). We conduct two complementary assessments: (i) a legal analysis finding that German law provides several grounds for the revocation of coal mining permits, particularly when linked to quantifiable damages to local ecosystems and communities; and (ii) an economic analysis using natural capital accounting to quantify the environmental and societal costs associated with alternative scenarios of continued and halted mining activity. We find the net present value of gains from immediately halting operations at the Hambach lignite mine to be €98–208 billion over 34-years, equivalent to 13–30% of NRW’s annual GDP. Health-related savings from avoided air pollution are 6.5 times greater than costs of replacing lost capacity with new renewable energy and battery storage infrastructure and two orders of magnitude greater than costs of compensating laid-off mining workers. Key policy insights The revocation of coal mining permits could be a legally plausible and replicable means of expediting the decline of coal. Natural capital accounts highlight the third-party costs of coal mining, quantifying the often-ignored health-related damages from polluting activities. Legal criteria adopted by agencies when assessing coal mining permits should be modified to accurately reflect considerations of climate change, local ecology, human health, and national policy. Independent and externally reviewed natural capital assessments should be required as standard protocol for the issuance of fossil fuel exploitation permits. Debates about appropriate levels of compensation to coal companies for premature mine closures should factor in the implicit and explicit subsidies such companies have received in the past. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coal phase out; fossil fuel permits; German climate policy; Hambach Forest; natural capital accounting; Supply-side climate policy","climate change; coal mine; coal mining; economic analysis; environmental legislation; environmental policy; lignite; opencast mining; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079736563

The objective was to conduct a data-driven study of greenhouse gas emissions associated with FB feedstock harvesting operations in the Northeast United States. Deterministic and stochastic LCA models were built to simulate the current FB bioenergy feedstock supply chain in the Northeast US with a cradle-to-gate scope (forest harvest through roadside loading) and a functional unit of 1.0 Mg of green FB feedstock at a 50% moisture content. Baseline LCA, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty analyses were conducted for three different FB feedstock types—dirty chips, clean chips, and grindings—enabling an empirically driven investigation of differences between feedstock types, individual harvesting process contributions, and literature comparisons. The baseline LCA average impacts were lower for grindings (4.57 kg CO2eq/Mg) and dirty chips (7.16 kg CO2eq/Mg) than for clean chips (23.99 kg CO2eq/Mg) under economic allocation, but impacts were of similar magnitude under mass allocation, ranging from 24.42 to 27.89 kg CO2eq/Mg. Uncertainty analysis showed a wider range of probable results under mass allocation compared to economic allocation. Sensitivity analysis revealed the impact of variations in the production masses and total economic values of primary products of forest harvests on the LCA results due to allocation of supply chain emissions. The high variability in fuel use between logging contractors also had a distinct influence on LCA results. The results of this study can aid decision-makers in energy policy and guide emissions reductions efforts while informing future LCAs that expand the system boundary to regional FB energy pathways, including electricity generation, transportation fuels, pellets for heat, and combined heat and power. © 2020 The Authors.

In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between temperature and growth of seven Eucalyptus genotypes in eight sites across a 3500 km latitude gradient in South America. From 18 months after planting until 72 months of age, climatic data and tree diameter increments at breast height (1.3 m above ground level) were monitored in each site intensively (every 15-30 days). The optimum temperature to growth varied among genotypes, ranging from 18 to 22 °C. The minimum annual temperature required for growth was 6 °C, while the maximum was 31 °C. The results at a monthly scale indicate that the minimum temperature to growth is between 7 °C and 23 °C, while the monthly maximum temperature is between 15 °C and 31 °C. When we used annual temperature or large temporal scales, we potentially minimize the effects of climate on plant metabolism; this should be taken into account in process based-models. The study results enhance our understanding of the influence of air temperature on tree growth dynamics. The Eucalyptus genotypes most planted in Brazil and Uruguay have specific thermal demands for growth maintenance and different optimal temperatures for maximum growth. Understanding variation in growth under different climatic conditions would facilitate accurate prediction of forest productivity based on thermal requirements. In addition, the data presented here could facilitate tree breeding by enhancing phenotypic analyses based on ecophysiological factors during the selection process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Dendrometer; Meteorological seasonality; Process-based models","Climate models; Productivity; Tropics; Accurate prediction; Annual temperatures; Climatic conditions; Forest productivity; Minimum temperatures; Phenotypic analysis; Temperature thresholds; Thermal requirements; Forestry; air temperature; ecophysiology; evergreen tree; forestry production; genotype-environment interaction; growth response; plantation forestry; subtropical region; temperature effect; Eucalyptus; Forestry; Genotypes; Growth; Processes; Productivity; Temperature; Tropics; South America; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086075358

Especially, the optimal partitioning theory suggests that plants preferentially allocate photosynthates toward the above-or below-ground parts to acquire the limiting resources to maximize their growth rate and optimize resource use under environmental change. However, it remains elusive on how NPP allocation changes and regulates community water-use efficiency (WUEc) under climate warming. In this study, we conducted a manipulative warming experiment with three levels of warming treatments (control, + 1.5 °C and + 2.5 °C) to explore the response of NPP allocation and its regulation on WUEc in an alpine meadow. Results showed that above-ground NPP (ANPP) and below-ground NPP (BNPP) responded differently to warming. On average, W1.5 (+ 1.5 °C) and W2.5 (+ 2.5 °C) treatments increased BNPP by 28.98% and 33.28% and increased NPP by 20.05% and 38.70%, respectively, across 4 years. Whereas no consistent warming effect on ANPP was observed across years. The fraction of BNPP to total NPP (fBNPP) responded positively to warming under low ambient temperature and community biomass while it responded negatively under high ambient temperature and community biomass. Notably warming-induced changes in fBNPPnegatively correlated with warming-induced changes in WUEc. These results suggested that warming effect on NPP allocation was largely contextually dependent and implied important biological regulation on WUEc.

Previous studies mainly focused on modeling key phenological transition dates (e.g. discrete timing of spring bud-break and fall senescence) based on aggregated climate variables (e.g. mean temperature, growing-degree days). We developed and evaluated a Bayesian Hierarchical Space-Time model for Land Surface Phenology (BHST-LSP) to synthesize remotely sensed vegetation greenness with climate covariates at a daily temporal scale from 1981 to 2014 across the entire conterminous United States. The BHST-LSP model incorporated both temporal and spatial information and exhibited high predictive power in simulating daily phenological development with an overall out-of-sample R2 of 0.80 ± 0.17 and 0.72 ± 0.20 for spring and fall phenology, respectively. The overall out-of-sample normalized root mean square errors were 9.3% ± 6.1% and 9.9% ± 5.2% between the observed and predicted vegetation greenness for spring and fall phenology, respectively. We found that a fast increase of temperature can accelerate the speed of spring green-up while a slow decrease of temperature can lead to a decelerated fall brown-down. Increasing accumulated precipitation can benefit daily phenological development over an entire growing season, while extreme rainfall events can have the opposite effects. More frequent frost events could slow spring leaf expansion and accelerate fall leaf senescence. Impacts of extreme heat events were complex and depended on water availability. Cropland in the Midwest as well as evergreen needleleaf forest along the coastal regions showed relatively strong resistance to drought events compared to other land cover types. The BHST-LSP model can be used to forecast vegetation phenology given future climate projection, thus providing valuable information for adopting climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian hierarchical model; Climate change; Continuous development; Extreme weather events; Land surface phenology; Vegetation index","Climate models; Drought; Extreme weather; Mean square error; Rain; Vegetation; Weather information services; Climate change adaptation; Extreme weather events; Future climate projections; Land surface phenology; Root mean square errors; Temporal and spatial; Vegetation greenness; Vegetation phenology; Climate change; Bayesian analysis; climate change; extreme event; land cover; phenology; rainfall; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation type; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086699753

Here, we project the changes of weather conditions conducive to winter haze episodes in Beijing by 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C global warming using Haze Weather Index (HWI) and data of ensemble simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) low-warming experiment. Compared to present day (2006–2015), the frequency in winter season is projected to increase by 14% for regular haze episodes (HWI > 0) and 21% for severe haze episodes (HWI > 1) at the 1.5 °C global warming. Projections shows larger increases of 27% for regular and 18% for severe haze events at the 2 °C global warming. The additional warming of 0.5 °C largely enhances the persistence of weather conditions conducive to haze episodes. The increased temperature contrast between near-surface and mid-troposphere in eastern Asia accounts for 57% and 81% of the change in HWI by 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming, respectively. Considering increased haze weather potential caused by climate warming, we suggest that additional efforts in emission reductions of carbon dioxide and air pollution are necessary to mitigate haze episodes in Beijing. © 2020 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)","1.5 °C global warming; 2 °C global warming; China; Community earth system model (CESM); Haze",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092146207

The uncertainties in the estimated emission amounts are much larger from natural than anthropogenic sources. A method was developed in the present study to quantify the contributions of natural surface mercury emissions to ambient gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) concentrations through application of positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis with temperature and NH3 as indicators of GEM emissions from natural surfaces. GEM concentrations were continuously monitored at a 2-hourly resolution at a regional background site in the Yangtze River Delta in eastern China during 2015-2018. Annual average GEM concentrations were in the range of 2.03-3.01 ng m-3, with a strong decreasing trend at a rate of -0.32±0.07ng m-3 yr-1 from 2015 to 2018, which was mostly caused by reduced anthropogenic emissions since 2013. The estimated contributions from natural surface emissions of mercury to the ambient GEM concentrations were in the range of 1.00-1.13 ng m-3 on annual average, with insignificant interannual changes, but the relative contribution increased significantly from 41 % in 2015 to 57 % in 2018, gradually surpassing those from anthropogenic sources. © Author(s) 2020.",,"anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); emission; environmental assessment; mercury (element); China; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092295596

Such interactions are important for Fe and carbon exports as they can dissolve the Fe-OC through Fe reduction. Here we studied the reduction of ferrihydrite-OC (Fh-OC) following incubation with microbes from agricultural and natural peatlands under differing nitrogen availability, with high-throughput sequencing to identify microbial mechanisms. Our results showed that in agricultural peatlands, high nitrogen levels (&gt;100 mg kg−1) modified the composition and abundance of iron-reducing bacteria, increasing reduction rates of Fh-OC (0.09–0.20 kg Fe day−1 ha−1) above the low N treatments (&lt;100 mg kg−1) (p &lt; 0.05). However, reduction rates of Fh-OC and iron-reducing community in natural peatlands were far less affected.

When a partial discharge or local overheating occurs inside the GIS, SF6will decompose and produce various by-products (including SO, SOF, COS, HS, SOF and etc) that are toxic and corrosive. The reduction of SF6 gas concentration and the generation of corrosive gases will lead to a decrease in the internal insulation strength of GIS. By monitoring the concentration of SF6in GIS, it can help us to judge the operating status of GIS and prevent fault. In this paper, we build a gas Raman spectroscopy gas detection platform. The light source of the detection platform is a solid-state laser with a wavelength of 532nm and a laser power of 1.5W. A self-designed gas cell is used to contain the gas to be measured. A spectrometer and CCD are used to collect Raman signals. Based on this Raman spectroscopy gas detection platform, a Raman spectroscopy study of SF6was carried out. Under 1 atmosphere pressure, Based on the built Raman detection platform, Raman spectroscopy of SF6with a concentration of 99.99% was obtained. By analyzing the Raman spectroscopy obtained, the characteristic Raman spectral lines of SF6was determined as 774cm-1. And the Raman spectroscopy of SF6 under the pressure of gradient distribution was obtained. The Raman spectra of SF6with gradient pressure, laser power were obtained. By analyzing the Raman spectroscopy of SF6obtained under different pressure and laser power, it is found that the characteristic peak intensity of Raman of SF6is highly linear with pressure and laser power. The highly linear relationship between the Raman peak intensity of SF6and various conditions shows that Raman spectroscopy has great advantages in the quantitative analysis of SF6. This research laid the foundation for Raman spectroscopy to monitor the decomposition of SF6, indicating that Raman spectroscopy has great potential in this field. © 2020 IEEE.","degradation of SF6; quantitative analysis; Raman spectroscopy","Corrosion; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Electric switchgear; Gas detectors; Gases; Partial discharges; Raman spectroscopy; Solid state lasers; Spectrometers; Sulfur hexafluoride; Atmosphere pressure; Characteristic peaks; Different pressures; Electrical equipment; GIS-Gas insulated switchgear; Gradient distributions; Linear relationships; Raman spectral lines; SF6 insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099397293

Considering more focus on production-side emissions, it requires to identify what drove changes in pollutant emissions during this period from demand-side. This study is devoted to revealing the contributions to changes in SO2 emissions during 2010-2015 from three dimensions including final demand, driving effect and supply chain. Based on the harmonized input-output framework and emission datasets, demand-driven accounting, structural decomposition analysis and structural path decomposition analysis are conducted progressively. The results indicate that fixed capital formation and exports were the main drivers of demand-driven emissions during the study period, contributing more than 60% in the total. Changes in emission intensity and per capita final demand were the effects with most prohibiting and promoting impacts on emissions, decreasing 9.98 million tons (Mt) and increasing 5.99 Mt, respectively. The supply chain contributed most to increasing emissions was “Manufacture of nonmetallic mineral products → Construction → fixed capital formation” mainly affected by increased emission intensity; that contributed most to decreasing emissions was “Production and Supply of Power and Heat → urban residential consumption” mainly affected by decreased emission intensity. Some policy implications targeting the three dimensions are discussed accordingly. The quantified contributions and uncovered driving mechanism regarding SO2 emissions may assist in facilitating more complete air pollution control strategies from multiple dimensions in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Final demand; Input-output; SO2 emissions; Structural path decomposition (SPD)","Air quality; Mineral industry; Public policy; Quality control; Sulfur dioxide; Supply chains; Air quality improvement; Multiple dimensions; Nonmetallic minerals; Policy implications; Pollutant emission; Residential consumption; Structural decomposition analysis; Sulfur dioxide emissions; Air pollution control; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; data set; decomposition analysis; demand analysis; emission control; input-output analysis; path analysis; policy approach; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; supply chain management; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; construction and demolition waste; human; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; policy; power supply; socioeconomics; statistical analysis; structural decomposition analysis; structural path decomposition analysis; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085286137

The majority of EU effort towards reducing emissions is aimed at vehicle manufacturers, mandating development of more efficient engines in order to reduce emissions. We propose a complementary approach to help reach the EU goals. Due to the need for motorists to repeatedly stop and accelerate while driving in urban areas, overall emission rates are observed to be higher in these environments than on open motorways. As a result, management algorithms that focus on harmonising the flow of traffic in urban centres have the potential to greatly reduce urban emission rates. In this paper, we propose a set of functionalities in form of ”use cases” in order to illustrate the inefficiencies of urban traffic flow by utilising cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. The major contribution of this paper is in addressing the potential positive impact of such measures. The results and the expected effects of the algorithms were determined using a microscopic traffic simulation model. Importantly, this approach also addresses the transition phase, when only a limited number of cooperative and automated vehicles1 (CAVs) will be introduced into traffic, resulting in a mix of automated and non-automated vehicles on the roadways.

The latest breakthrough idea for producing hydrogen fuel is by utilizing biomass in bioelectrochemical systems, which is Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC). MEC is a method for producing hydrogen gas that is managed from organic materials, including from wastewater. In addition to very low energy consumption, the MEC system is able to use sludge waste as a substrate for the bacterial community to be implemented. The rate of hydrogen production with MEC is relatively lower when compared to air fermentation and electrolysis methods. Efforts that can be made to increase hydrogen production are by operating the MEC system at optimal distance between electrodes. One of the major problems that arises from the use of the MEC system is methanogens, the methane-producing bacteria. This methanogen consumes biohydrogen produced at the cathode which cause the loses of biohydrogen production in MEC system. In this research, biological control methods is utilized in bioelectrode by enriching it with denitrifier bacteria to inhibit the growth of methanogens. The MEC reactor is carried out in configuring a single-chamber MEC. Variation in denitrifier bacteria used and distance between electrodes aim to find the optimal conditions. The composition of the reactor chamber gas head is supported by using Gas Chromatography to analyze hydrogen and methane reserves. The addition of Pseudomonas stutzeri as biological control of methanogenesis could reduce the methane up to 76.28% compared to the control reactor at the first cycle. The presence of Pseudomonas stutzeri was also able to increase the H2 produced 128% higher compared to the control reactor. With the electrode spacing 0.5 cm, the H2 produced 65% was higher than the MEC reactor with 1 cm-electrode spacing. The 0.5 cm space was the optimum space for this experiment since it still supported the growth of the exoelectrogen bacteria and reduced the internal resistance within the MEC system. © 2020 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092036419

In 2012, the government introduced a low-carbon energy strategy to reduce the production of air pollutants, including anthropogenic CO2e, and to increase the share of clean energy up to 50% of total consumption by 2050. As a contribution to this strategy, the techno-economic performance of the fixed-slope on-grid Photovoltaic (PV) power plants in Kazakhstan and both the one-or two-axis solar tracking systems solar parks are compared. The aim is to determine to what extent the more effective but more expensive tracking systems might be a suitable standard in future PV power stations in the country. For this purpose, the existent fixed-slope 50 MWp Burnoye-1 commercial solar power plant located in the Jambyl region, Kazakhstan, is used as a benchmark. As expected, solar panels with tracking systems produce more electricity year-round compared to those with fixed slopes; one-and two-axis tracking systems led almost to the same amount of electricity export to the grid. Furthermore, PV power stations with one-and two-axis tracking technology could reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 10 ktCO2e per year. However, using one or two-axis tracking systems lead to an increase in the ratio of extra-cost to extra-energy production of around 26% and 33%, respectively. Moreover, that means that both tracking scenarios are not economically competitive compared to fixed panels. Nevertheless, if a tracking system has to be considered, the results of this work demonstrate that one-axis tracking should be preferred as they reduce GHG emissions while having a higher electricity generation compared to the fixed system. © 2020, Aalborg University press.

To ensure that food systems are sustainable, as well as nourishing, one solution often suggested is to shorten their supply chains toward a regional rather than a global basis. While such regional systems may have a range of costs and benefits, we investigate the mitigation potential of regionalized urban food systems by examining the greenhouse gas emissions associated with food transport. Using data on food consumption for 7108 urban administrative units (UAUs), we simulate total transport emissions for both regionalized and globalized supply chains. In regionalized systems, the UAUs' demands are fulfilled by peripheral food production, whereas to simulate global supply chains, food demand is met from an international pool (where the origin can be any location globally). We estimate that regionalized systems could reduce current emissions from food transport. However, because longer supply chains benefit from maximizing comparative advantage, this emission reduction would require closing yield gaps, reducing food waste, shifting toward diversified farming, and consuming seasonal produce. Regionalization of food systems will be an essential component to limit global warming to well below 2 °C in the future.

However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms at work when bacterioplankton metabolize distinct components of the DOM pool is still limited. We, therefore, conducted seawater culture enrichment experiments with ecologically relevant DOM, combining both polymer and monomer model compounds for distinct compound classes. This included carbohydrates (polysaccharides vs. monosaccharides), proteins (polypeptides vs. amino acids), and nucleic acids (DNA vs. nucleotides). We noted pronounced changes in bacterial growth, activity, and transcription related to DOM characteristics. Transcriptional responses differed between compound classes, with distinct gene sets (“core genes”) distinguishing carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. Moreover, we found a strong divergence in functional transcription at the level of particular monomers and polymers (i.e., the condensation state), primarily in the carbohydrates and protein compound classes. These specific responses included a variety of cellular and metabolic processes that were mediated by distinct bacterial taxa, suggesting pronounced functional partitioning of organic matter. Collectively, our findings show that two important facets of DOM, compound class and condensation state, shape bacterial gene expression, and ultimately select for distinct bacterial (functional) groups. This emphasizes the interdependency of marine bacteria and labile carbon compounds for regulating the transformation of DOM in surface waters. © Copyright © 2020 Pontiller, Martínez-García, Lundin and Pinhassi.","bacterial metatranscriptomics; brackish water system; carbohydrates; functional partitioning; labile DOM compounds; microcosms; nucleic acids; proteins","alkaline phosphatase; caryophyllene; dissolved organic matter; genomic DNA; glucose 1 phosphate adenylyltransferase; glutamate dehydrogenase; glycosyltransferase; maltodextrin; oligosaccharide; polysaccharide; RNA 16S; sea water; spermidine; thymidine triphosphate; transcriptome; Actinobacteria; algal bloom; amino acid metabolism; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; biofilm; carbohydrate metabolism; coastal waters; controlled study; DNA extraction; enzyme activity; Gammaproteobacteria; gene expression; gene sequence; genetic variability; marine environment; medical staff; microbial community; nonhuman; phytoplankton; polyadenylation; protein synthesis; Proteobacteria; Psychrobacter; RNA extraction; Shewanella; stoichiometry; sulfur bacterium; twitching motility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092392878

In many models, low-frequency density variability down the western boundary of the Atlantic basin is linked to changes in the buoyancy forcing over the Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG) region, and this is found to explain part of the geostrophic AMOC variability at 26N. In this study, using different experiments with an ocean general circulation model (OGCM), we develop statistical methods to identify characteristic vertical density profiles at 26 N at the western and eastern boundaries, which relate to the buoyancy-forced AMOC. We show that density anomalies due to anomalous buoyancy forcing over the SPG propagate equatorward along the western Atlantic boundary (through 26 N), eastward along the Equator, and then poleward up the eastern Atlantic boundary. The timing of the density anomalies appearing at the western and eastern boundaries at 26N reveals2-3-year lags between boundaries along deeper levels (2600-3000 m). Record lengths of more than 26 years are required at the western boundary (WB) to allow the buoyancy-forced signals to appear as the dominant empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode. Results suggest that the depth structure of the signals and the lagged covariances between the boundaries at 26N may both provide useful information for detecting propagating signals of high-latitude origin in more complex models and potentially in the observational RAPID (Rapid Climate Change programme) array. However, time filtering may be needed, together with the continuation of the RAPID programme, in order to extend the time period. © Author(s) 2020.",,"atmospheric circulation; buoyancy forcing; general circulation model; Kimmeridgian; meridional circulation; North Atlantic Deep Water; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (East); Atlantic Ocean (North); Labrador Sea; Norwegian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092328083

As shallow deposits are rapidly depleting, underground mines are growing deeper to reach resources situated at greater depths. This creates an immense challenge in air-conditioning as the heat emissions to mine ambient increases substantially as mines reach to deeper levels. A system-level design analysis is performed to couple PV with a refrigeration plant capable of generating 200 tonne of ice per day to help to mitigate this issue. Generated ice can directly be used in cooling deep underground mines via different types of direct heat exchangers. State-of-the-art technology is used in developing the model which aims to decrease the size and cost of a conventional refrigeration system run on a diesel generator. Costs associated with deploying a solar system are computed as per the recent market value. Energy savings, carbon emissions reduction, and net annual savings in employing the system are quantified and compared to a diesel-only scenario. In addition, two different energy storage strategies: an ice storage system and a battery storage system, are compared. A detailed economic analysis is performed over the life of the project to obtain the net cash flow diagram, payback period, and cumulative savings for both systems. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is proposed to highlight the effect of solar intensity on solar system size and the area required for installment. The study suggests that the use of solar PV in mine refrigeration applications is technically feasible and economically viable depending on the sun-peak hours of the mine location. Additionally, the economics of deploying an ice storage system compared to the battery storage system has a better payback period and more cumulative savings. © 2020 by the authors.","Deep mine cooling; Ice thermal energy storage; Renewable energy in mining; Solar electric refrigeration; Solar PV design; Solar-powered ice maker; Techno-economic assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090207676

The rarity of Medieval sites, systematic excavations and multi-disciplinary work in the subcontinent obscure the impact of two distinct climate anomalies − the ‘Medieval Warm Period’ (‘MWP’, 740 − 1150 CE), followed by the ‘Little Ice Age’ (‘LIA’, 1350 − 1850 CE). The finds from the archaeological site indicate the presence of winter and summer crops, suggesting the region was likely warm and mild humid during pre-Medieval period (ca. 600 − 800 CE). During Medieval times (between ca. 800 − 1300 CE), a diversification of the crop assemblage suggests that the region was under a warm and humid climate, corresponding to the ‘MWP’, driving increased monsoon precipitation. During the post-Medieval period (ca. 1350 − 1800 CE), drought-resistant millets and other summer pulse crops indicate the region probably experienced weak SW monsoon precipitation coinciding with globally recognised ‘LIA’. These interpretations are supported through phytolith data from the archaeological deposit broadly indicating two phases, the first being a period of diversified agricultural/anthropogenic activity (ca. 600 − 1350 CE), followed by a period dominated by drought-resistant crops (ca. 1350 − 1800 CE). Pollen data from a proximal lake corroborate the warm and humid phase ca. 800 − 1400 CE, with strong representation of warm−humid favouring tropical forest taxa, followed by non-arboreal indicators of a drier more open landscape ca. 1500 − 1800 CE.

We conducted a high-carbon carburizing treatment that led to approximately 1.2 mass% carbon at the surface. Further heat treatment consisted of austenitization, quenching in oil, and low-temperature annealing. To transform large amounts of retained austenite into martensite and to stabilize the existent retained austenite, some specimens were cryogenically treated in liquid nitrogen. The resulting microstructures were analyzed as a function of carbon content in the gradient by means of scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction analysis. Nanoindentation was used to study locally the mechanical behavior and stability of retained austenite at the carburized surface. To better analyze the deformation behavior during indentation, atomic force microscopy was applied to measure the topography of individual indentation imprints and the deformation pattern around the indents. The results show that nanoindentation is suitable for mechanically induced phase transformation of retained austenite into martensite, which leads to pronounced pop-ins in the load-displacement curves at specific critical loads. The occurrence of pop-ins, and, thus the phase transformation is highly dependent on the local microstructure of the carburized specimens. The main influencing factors are the local amount of retained austenite in the deformed region and, predominantly, the crystallographic orientation of retained austenite. (001)-Oriented retained austenite is highly metastable, whereas (111) orientations show mostly stable austenitic deformation behavior with only isolated mechanically induced retained austenite transformation during indentation. Cryogenic treatment transformed larger amounts of retained austenite into martensite. However, even after cryogenic treatment, (111)-oriented retained austenite could undergo mechanically induced transformation into martensite. Furthermore, we used the progression of hardness as a function of indentation depth and topography images to analyze the extent of retained austenite transformation and the complex compound deformation/transformation behavior of preexisting martensite and retained austenite. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Case-hardening steel; Nanoindentation; Phase stability; Phase transformation; Retained austenite","Austenitic transformations; Carbon; Case hardening; Deformation; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Indentation; Liquefied gases; Low temperature operations; Martensite; Microstructure; Nanoindentation; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature; Topography; Crystallographic orientations; Deformation behavior; Electron backscatter diffraction analysis; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Induced phase transformation; Load-displacement curve; Low temperature annealing; Transformation behavior; Austenite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087001028

Consequently, significant N2O emissions have been recorded during real wastewater treatment in high rate algal ponds (HRAPs). While data scarcity and variability prevent meaningful assessment, the magnitude reported (0.13-0.57% of the influent nitrogen load) is within the range reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for direct N2O emissions during centralised aerobic wastewater treatment (0.016-4.5% of the influent nitrogen load). Critically, the ability of microalgae to synthesise N2O challenges the IPCC's broad view that bacterial denitrification and nitrification are the only major cause of N2O emissions from wastewater plants and aquatic environments receiving nitrogen from wastewater effluents. Significant N2O emissions have indeed been repeatedly detected from eutrophic water bodies and wastewater discharge contributes to eutrophication via the release of nitrogen and phosphorus. Considering the complex interplays between nitrogen and phosphorus supply, microalgal growth, and microalgal N2O synthesis, further research must urgently seek to better quantify N2O emissions from microalgae-based wastewater systems and eutrophic ecosystems receiving wastewater.

Prior work argued for reducing WWR to reduce operating energy consumption. The objective of this study is to comprehensively assess the environmental, economic, and social effects of various WWR levels using a triple-bottom line approach. A building information model of the US DOE's large office (12 story) prototype building was developed using Autodesk Revit®. The Tally® Revit application and DOE's EnergyPlus™ were used to perform life cycle assessment (LCA) and assess implications on HVAC equipment sizing, embodied energy of materials, and distribution of operational energy. Designs altering WWR from a baseline of 40% were compared in three different climate zones of the United States. Results showed that increasing the WWR in large office buildings leads to increases in environmental impacts, occupant dissatisfaction, and the life cycle cost for the three different climate zones studied. Most reductions in energy use and environmental impacts were approximately 1% from the baseline scenario for the office building under study. The results imply that while reductions in the WWR do result in improvements across the suite of metrics assessed, other design strategies need to be employed either in conjunction with, or separate from, in order to meet target energy consumption and environmental impact reduction goals within this building program, such as Architecture 2030 Challenges. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building resilience; EnergyPlus; Life cycle assessment; Occupant comfort; Triple bottom line; Window-to-wall ratio","Architectural design; Ecodesign; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; HVAC; Life cycle; Office buildings; Sustainable development; Walls (structural partitions); Building Information Model - BIM; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Operating energy consumption; Operational energy; Performance aspects; Sustainability assessment; Triple Bottom Line; Window-to-wall ratio; Environmental impact; building; energy use; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; sustainability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089411869

Utilizing sustainable solutions are therefore in key position for decarbonizing the non-road sector. To this day, the diesel engines dominate the markets because of their high efficiency. However, the simplicity and cost effectiveness of the spark-ignited engines together with renewable fuels are suggested to bring several advantages compared to the diesel engine. E.g. ethanol and bio methane are relatively simple to produce from agricultural residuals and wastes, and the raw materials are easily available around the world. Additionally, stoichiometric engines would only require a three-way catalyst (TWC) to fulfil Stage V emission regulations. A bi-fuel (BF) and dual-fuel (DF) engine operating on both ethanol and biogas could potentially offer a flexible option for e.g. farmers, as they could produce the fuels locally and simultaneously increase the sources of income. The largest technical challenges concerning spark-ignited (SI) engines compared to its diesel counterparts are mainly related to lower engine efficiency. Furthermore, the differences in SI fuels characteristics set limitations on regular SI engines for flexible fuel operation. The main focus of this paper was therefore to study possible methods for developing a flexible spark-ignited non-road engine fulfilling Stage V emission requirements. The studied test engine was a port fuel injected (PFI) SI-conversion based on a commonly used non-road diesel engine for agricultural applications. The engine was equipped with two injectors per cylinder, one directed into the swirl port, the other to the tangential flow port. Additionally, a single gas injection mixer was added to distribute gaseous fuel for all cylinders at once. Four different injection methods were studied: Single liquid fuel injection separately in both swirl and tangential ports, dual port liquid injection and dual-fuel mode, utilizing simultaneously ethanol and methane. The results are compared against Stage V requirements. © 2020 SAE International.

The energy flows have been visualised quantitatively in Sankey diagrams, while the quality of the available energy is presented in the form of a grand composite curve. High temperature flue gas from ferrosilicon (FeSi) production at Elkem Rana represent the largest heat source available for utilisation. A theoretical assessment of potential applications for this energy is presented and includes: (1) electricity production; (2) local biocarbon production, where surplus heat is utilised for drying of wood chips; (3) post combustion carbon capture, where surplus heat is utilised for solvent regeneration. The results indicate that increasing the current energy recovery from 400 GWh to >640 GWh is realistic. The increase in energy recovery can be used for reducing the carbon footprint of the industrial park. Investment in a common utility network for surplus heat may lower the threshold for establishing other energy clients at MIP. These are possibilities which may be investigated in more detail in future work. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

One of its key functions is the retention and release of various chemical compounds, primarily governed by the sorption process, which strongly affects the environmental fate of nutrients and pollutants. Sorption largely depends on the composition of SOM, as well as its structure, dynamics and the thermodynamic conditions. Although several approaches are available, experimental characterization of sorption mechanisms is not easy. Computational models for predicting sorption coefficients often require a wealth of experimental data for training and are only applicable to compounds and conditions related to the training dataset. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the sorption of a range of small organic compounds. As a model SOM system we use the standard Leonardite humic acid (LHA) sample, which physicochemical properties have recently been characterized computationally in detail. This model allowed us to estimate sorption propensities of the systems at two different hydration levels (water activities close to 0 and 1), showing a remarkable correlation with experimental data. Importantly, this molecular modelling approach based on perturbation free-energy calculations is rigorously derived from statistical thermodynamics and requires no experimental sorption data for training. It is therefore in principle applicable to any SOM model or thermodynamic condition. Moreover, the power of MD simulations to provide high-resolution insight into atomistic and molecular interactions was employed to explore how sorbate molecules associate with the LHA matrix and which contacts they form. The heteroatoms of both sorbate and sorbent play an important role and water molecules are identified as further key players in facilitating the sorption process. Highlights: Modelling of the sorption processes in soil organic matter at atomistic level. Rigorous, physics-based approach applicable to a range of SOM systems and conditions. Remarkable level of matching with experimental data with additional insight into the molecular mechanism. Interactions between the sorbate and local environment strongly affects the sorption process. © 2019 The Authors.

Early inquiry suggests preexisting conditions are key risk factors contributing to COVID-19 mortality and air pollution exposure could exacerbate this relationship. Building on prior research linking deaths from respiratory viruses to air pollution exposures, we investigate how 2014 National Air Toxics Assessment hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) respiratory hazard quotient and respiratory hazard index are related to COVID-19 mortality. Our focus on HAPs builds upon the knowledge base linking poor air quality to COVID-19 mortality, since most (if not all) earlier studies only include criteria pollutants. Herein, we examine the relationship between HAP exposure and US-based COVID-19 mortality, while controlling for socioeconomic status, population health indicators, and exposure to PM2.5 and ozone. We fit county-level negative binomial mixed models, predicting COVID-19 mortality as a function of HAP respiratory toxicity levels and relevant covariates. We include models for combined exposure to HAPs, as well as for specific pollutants. We find that an increase in the respiratory hazard index is associated with a 9% increase in COVID-19 mortality. Although differing in magnitude, this association holds for individual HAPs acetaldehyde, and diesel PM. These findings help us to understand variation in US-based COVID-19 mortality rates, reinforce existing research linking air pollution to mortality, and emphasize the importance of regulatory efforts to limit air pollution exposure risk. © 2020 The Author(s).

To this end, we utilize an optimization framework based on a mixed integer linear program that selects, sizes, and operates technologies in the MES to satisfy electric and thermal demands, while minimizing annual costs and CO2 emissions. We conduct a comprehensive uncertainty analysis that encompasses the entire set of technology (e.g. cost, efficiency, lifetime) and context (e.g. economic, policy, grid carbon footprint) input parameters, as well as various climate-referenced districts (e.g. environmental data and energy demands) at a European-scope. Minimum-emissions MES, with large amounts of renewable energy generation and high ratios of seasonal thermal-to-electrical demand, optimally achieve zero operational CO2 emissions by utilizing PtH2 seasonally to offset the long-term mismatch between renewable generation and energy demand. PtH2 is only used to abate the last 5–10% emissions, and it is installed along with a large battery capacity to maximize renewable self-consumption and completely electrify thermal demand with heat pumps and fuel cells. However, this incurs additional cost. Additionally, we show that ‘traditional’ MES comprised of renewables and short-term energy storage are able to decrease emissions by 90% with manageable cost increases. The impact of uncertainty on the optimal system design reveals that the most influential parameter for PtH2 implementation is (1) heat pump efficiency as it is the main competitor in providing renewable-powered heat in winter. Further, battery (2) capital cost and (3) lifetime prove to be significant as the competing electrical energy storage technology. In the face of policy uncertainties, a CO2 tax shows large potential to reduce emissions in district MES without cost implications. The results illustrate the importance of capturing the dynamics and uncertainties of short- and long-term energy storage technologies for assessing cost and CO2 emissions in optimal MES designs over districts with different geographical scopes. © 2020 The Author(s)","Global sensitivity analysis; Multi-energy systems; Optimization with uncertainty; Power-to-hydrogen; Renewable energy; Seasonal energy storage","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Fuel cells; Heat pump systems; Hydrogen storage; Integer programming; Optimal systems; Platinum compounds; Renewable energy resources; Electrical energy storages; Energy storage technologies; Heat pump efficiency; Mixed integer linear program; Multi-energy systems; Optimization framework; Renewable energy generation; Seasonal energy storages; Uncertainty analysis; carbon emission; demand analysis; design method; detection method; efficiency measurement; emission control; energy storage; power generation; uncertainty analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087025983

Over the following days and weeks, strong reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution were reported in many regions of Spain. A substantial part of these reductions was obviously due to decreased local and regional anthropogenic emissions. Yet, the confounding effect of meteorological variability hinders a reliable quantification of the lockdown's impact upon the observed pollution levels. Our study uses machine-learning (ML) models fed by meteorological data along with other time features to estimate the ""business-as-usual""NO2 mixing ratios that would have been observed in the absence of the lockdown. We then quantify the so-called meteorology-normalized NO2 reductions induced by the lockdown measures by comparing the estimated business-as-usual values with the observed NO2 mixing ratios. We applied this analysis for a selection of urban background and traffic stations covering the more than 50 Spanish provinces and islands. The ML predictive models were found to perform remarkably well in most locations, with an overall bias, root mean square error and correlation of C4 %, 29% and 0.86, respectively. During the period of study, from the enforcement of the state of alarm in Spain on 14 March to 23 April, we found the lockdown measures to be responsible for a 50% reduction in NO2 levels on average over all provinces and islands. The lockdown in Spain has gone through several phases with different levels of severity with respect to mobility restrictions. As expected, the meteorology-normalized change in NO2 was found to be stronger during phase II (the most stringent phase) and phase III of the lockdown than during phase I. In the largest agglomerations, where both urban background and traffic stations were available, a stronger meteorology-normalized NO2 change is highlighted at traffic stations compared with urban background sites. Our results are consistent with foreseen (although still uncertain) changes in anthropogenic emissions induced by the lockdown. We also show the importance of taking the meteorological variability into account for accurately assessing the impact of the lockdown on NO2 levels, in particular at fine spatial and temporal scales. Meteorology-normalized estimates such as those presented here are crucial to reliably quantify the health implications of the lockdown due to reduced air pollution. © Author(s) 2020.",,"atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; disease control; governance approach; meteorology; mixing ratio; nitrogen dioxide; pollution effect; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; viral disease; Spain; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092277598

Alternative fuel (BSW) are briquettes obtained by carbonization and densification of agricultural solid wastes. Two laboratory methods, water boil test (WBT) and controlled kitchen test (CCT) were used to analyze the performance of this approach by comparing the proposed improved stove (ICS-G) with the traditional one (TCS), when using both types of fuels: charcoal and BSW. Results indicate that consumption of charcoal decreases by 61% using the improved ICS-G stove instead of the traditional TCS. Similar fuel savings are obtained when using BSW fuels. BSW fuel allows for a carbon monoxide (CO) emission reduction of 41% and 67%, and fine particles (PM) in a 84% and 93%, during the high and low power phases of the tests, respectively. Use of BSW fuel and ICS-G stove instead of the TCS stove with charcoal, provides a cooking time reduction of 18%, savings of $353.5 per year per family in the purchase of fuel, and an emission reduction of 3.2 t CO2/year. family. © 2020 by the authors.","Alternative fuel; Cook stove; Gasification; Sustainability","alternative fuel; cooking appliance; laboratory method; solid waste; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091390211

In response, this paper incorporates new economic geography factors such as agglomeration production and industrial (trade) association into the analysis framework of carbon emission performance factors through China’s provincial panel data and conducts empirical research. It has been found that large-scale industrial production under economic agglomeration is conducive to improving carbon emission performance and that different forms of agglomeration at different degrees of agglomeration correspond to different carbon emission performances. As the degree of agglomeration increases, the effect of reducing emissions by specialized agglomeration decreases while the effect of reducing emissions by diversified agglomeration increases. Specialized agglomeration externalities and diversified agglomeration externalities can coexist at the same time, depending on the appropriate degree of agglomeration. There is a strong negative environmental efficiency effect in the provinces with close commodity trade links, which has triggered environmental dumping and pollution transfer between provinces. In the work of energy conservation and emission reduction, we must attach great importance to the hidden carbon in domestic merchandise trade and the resulting intergovernmental environmental game, and furthermore, give full play to the “self-purification” effect of aggregate production on energy conservation and emission reduction. © 2020 by the authors.

Numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of these devices are usually computationally expensive since they imply a multi-scale problem. In this work, gaseous non-reactive unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes and large eddy simulations of a gaseous-fueled radial-swirled lean direct injection combustor have been carried out through CONVERGE™ CFD code by solving the complete inlet flow path through the swirl vanes and the combustor. The geometry considered is the gaseous configuration of the CORIA lean direct injection combustor, for which detailed measurements are available. The emphasis of the work is placed on the demonstration of the CONVERGE™ applicability to the multi-scale gas turbine engines field and the determination of an optimal mesh strategy through several grid control tools (i.e., local refinement, adaptive mesh refinement) allowing the exploitation of its automatic mesh generation against traditional fixed mesh approaches. For this purpose, the normalized mean square error has been adopted to quantify the accuracy of turbulent numerical statistics regarding the agreement with the experimental database. Furthermore, the focus of the work is to study the behavior when coupling several large eddy simulation sub-grid scale models (i.e., Smagorinsky, Dynamic Smagorinsky, and Dynamic Structure) with the adaptive mesh refinement algorithm through the evaluation of its specific performances and predictive capabilities in resolving the spatial-temporal scales and the intrinsically unsteady flow structures generated within the combustor. This investigation on the main non-reacting swirling flow characteristics inside the combustor provides a suitable background for further studies on combustion instability mechanisms. © IMechE 2020.","adaptive mesh refinement; CONVERGE™; Gas turbine combustor; large eddy simulation; non-reactive flow; turbulent swirling flow; U-RANS","Combustion; Combustors; Computational fluid dynamics; Emission control; Error statistics; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Large eddy simulation; Mean square error; Mesh generation; Numerical analysis; Oil field equipment; Adaptive mesh refinement; Adaptive mesh refinement algorithms; Automatic mesh generation; Combustion instabilities; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Fuel efficiency improvement; Normalized mean square error; Predictive capabilities; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084081836

As arctic carbon (C) stocks predominantly are located belowground, the effects of greater plant productivity on soil C storage will significantly determine the net sink/source potential of these ecosystems, but vegetation controls on soil CO2 efflux remain poorly resolved. In order to identify the role of canopy-forming species in belowground C dynamics, we conducted a girdling experiment with plots distributed across 1 km2 of treeline birch (Betula pubescens) forest and willow (Salix lapponum) patches in northern Sweden and quantified the contribution of canopy vegetation to soil CO2 fluxes and belowground productivity. Girdling birches reduced total soil CO2 efflux in the peak growing season by 53%, which is double the expected amount, given that trees contribute only half of the total leaf area in the forest. Root and mycorrhizal mycelial production also decreased substantially. At peak season, willow shrubs contributed 38% to soil CO2 efflux in their patches. Our findings indicate that C, recently fixed by trees and tall shrubs, makes a substantial contribution to soil respiration. It is critically important that these processes are taken into consideration in the context of a greening arctic because productivity and ecosystem C sequestration are not synonymous. © 2020 The Authors.

However, in recent decades, these discussions have intensified due to increased confidence in scientific research highlighting adverse effects, increased knowledge breadth in climate science, and heightened public and political awareness and engagement on the topic. Climate change is now acknowledged as one of the biggest challenges and threats to modern lifestyles. Nature-based solutions (NBS), as a mediator and mitigator to adverse climate change effects, is an emerging area of expanding research collateral and practitioner literacy. To highlight current NBS knowledge, existing knowledge gaps, and research trends, a Quantitative Systematic Literature Review (QSLR) was undertaken (n = 54). This QSLR reveals the short temporal span of articles relating to NBS as a response to climate change, with most articles being of a research style format. NBS research focus areas were found to be dominated by ecological and infrastructure approaches to climate change mitigation, and ecological and technical positions were found to be most topical across the current climate change literature. Multiple knowledge gaps were identified by the review, namely the lack of broader conceptual approaches and knowledge acquisition regarding climate change responses via NBS, as well as the psychological relationship humans share with NBS and climate change, adverse or otherwise. These knowledge gaps highlight where future research inquiry may be directed to increase the value and completion of this research area. It is hoped that this QSLR will assist in increasing the profile of NBS in the multidisciplinary and complex response to anthropogenic climate change, as well as contribute to the growth in investment and implementation of NBS assets for a rigid and resilient global future. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation; Nature-based solutions; NBS; PRIMSA; Systematic review; Urban resilience","anthropogenic effect; climate change; complexity; conceptual framework; data acquisition; interdisciplinary approach; investment; lifestyle; literature review; psychology; research work",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091697881

But a key question is if the cure will not be worse than the disease? In this work, the economic feasibility of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethylene is assessed and it is demonstrated that from a Capital expenditure and Operational expenditure point of view the electrochemical production of ethylene from CO2 is not feasible under the current market conditions. Even in the case that the renewable electricity price would be zero, the feasibility is hampered by the state-of-the-art catalyst performance (selectivity) and the cost of the electrochemical reactor. Turning the installation on and off, if this would be even practically possible, is not interesting because our study shows that because of the high Capital expenditure, the payback time of the process would become unacceptably high. Finally, because of the high electricity requirement, this Carbon Capture and Utilization process has a lower CO2 avoidance potential than the substitution of gray electricity by green electricity. This means that today the available green electricity would best be used to close coal and gas based power plants instead of powering the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethylene. © Copyright © 2020 Pappijn, Ruitenbeek, Reyniers and Van Geem.","carbon capture and utilization; CO2 conversion; electrocatalysis; ethylene; renewable and sustainable energy","Aliphatic compounds; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Capital expenditures; Economic feasibilities; Efficient technology; Electrochemical conversion; Electrochemical reactor; Electrochemical reductions; Operational expenditures; Renewable electricity; Costs; alternative energy; carbon monoxide; carbon sequestration; catalysis; electrochemistry; ethylene; feasibility study; power plant; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092542126

Their well-defined size and shape, controlled by organic ligands, are ideal to identify the parameters relevant to the activity, selectivity and stability in catalysis. However, the impact of the native surface ligands during catalysis still remains poorly understood, as does their fate. CuNCs are among the state-of-the-art catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work, we study CuNCs that are capped by different organic ligands to investigate their impact on the catalytic properties. We show that the latter desorb from the surface at a cathodic potential that depends on their binding strength with the metal surface, rather than their own electroreduction potentials. By monitoring the evolving surface chemistry in situ, we find that weakly bound ligands desorb very rapidly while strongly bound ligands impact the catalytic performance. This work provides a criterion to select labile ligands versus ligands that will persist on the surface, thus offering opportunity for interface design.

TETRD is recorded by using zero-order diffraction of emission grating in TCSPC instrument. TETRD decay curve has entire wavelength dependent decay information buried in it. Cut-off filters are used to avoid scattering contamination. Two existing approaches are used for analysing the interconnected TETRD data. (i) First, global analysis: for discretely decaying multiple components, TETRD dataset is analyzed using global analysis. The normalized pre-exponentials (αi) and relative amplitudes (fi) recovered from global analysis reflect the individual component emission more faithfully and resembles with steady-state spectral data as well. (ii) Second, stretched exponential fitting (StrEF): for continuous lifetime distribution systems, StrEF (I(t) = I0 exp[−(t/τ)1/h]) has been used to analyse TETRD data. The average lifetime (τ) of StrEF matches well with the average lifetime of multi-exponential fitting, the heterogeneity factor (h) of StrEF is an additional parameter, which informs about local heterogeneity in the system. It is shown that the lifetimes obtained with TETRD matches well with the lifetimes obtained using conventional time resolved emission spectra (TRES). TETRD holds advantage in rapid data acquisition and facilitates inclusion of another variable (like concentration, solvent composition, pH, excitation wavelength etc.) into experimental design. Further, with the use of an appropriate data analysis tool, the multi-component decay profiles can be resolved conveniently. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Humic fluorescence decay; Multi-component fluorescence decay; Multi-fluorophoric systems; Total emission decay","Data acquisition; Decay (organic); Emission spectroscopy; Continuous lifetime distributions; Excitation wavelength; Individual components; Rapid data acquisition; Stretched exponential; Time-resolved emission spectra; Time-resolved fluorescence; Zero-order diffraction; Distributed database systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087658639

The results indicated changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of-2.04 ± 1.57 μg m-3 and ozone of-3.07 ± 2.86 ppb. If the air quality improvements persist over a year, it could potentially lead to 3970-8900 prevented premature deaths annually (note: the estimates of prevented premature deaths have large uncertainties). Public transit demand showed dramatic declines (~80%). The pandemic provides an opportunity to exhibit how substantially human behavior could impact on air quality. To address both the pandemic and climate change issues, better strategies are needed to affect behavior, such as ensuring safer shared mobility, the higher adoption of telecommuting, automation in the freight sector, and cleaner energy transition. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; Climate change; COVID-19; Shared mobility; Telecommuting","air quality; climate change; disease spread; ozone; particulate matter; public health; spatiotemporal analysis; virus; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090431282

The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) has been an unprecedented phenomenon in the arena of transnational initiatives in climate action at local level. The initiative has expanded tremendously over the past 10 years, covering more than 9 600 local authorities and 327 million inhabitants as of June 2019. This study analyses policies and measures adopted and implemented by local authorities, signatories to the CoM, as reported in their Monitoring Emission Inventories (MEI). More than 12 000 policies reported in 315 MEIs have been assessed. The policies adopted in municipalities across Europe have been classified according to two criteria: (1) the type of policy tool and (2) the field of action. The aggregated policies have then be correlated with the grouping of signatories according to three “contextual” drivers. The contextual drivers allow identifying the factors that may influence the distribution of climate and energy policies and successful examples and methodologies that may be replicated in other cities with comparable characteristics and similar contexts. Overall, results show that the most common policies cover municipal assets and structures. The policies adopted by local governments do change with the population and, therefore, the focus on municipal assets changes with the increase of population, while local authorities’ Gross Domestic Products and climatic conditions have limited influence on the selection and distribution of policies in the framework of this study. © 2020 The Author(s)","Cities; Covenant of Mayors; Dataset; MEI; Mitigation; Policies","Climate change mitigation; Climatic conditions; Emission inventories; Gross domestic products; Local authorities; Local government; Municipal assets; Policies and measures; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085653194

The main approach used in Brazil defines the suitable area for growth considering soil and climate data, without considering the capacity of local management in reducing yield-limiting factors. Thus, the aim of this study is to characterize homogenous areas using sugarcane actual yield, climate, total plant-available soil water capacity (TASW), and production intensity data. The study was conducted in the Goiás state, totalizing 246 counties. The first step was to group areas based on actual yield obtained from 1973 to 2016. The groups were characterized considering climate (rainfall and air temperature), soil (TASW), and sugarcane production data. Actual sugarcane yield formed eight homogenous groups, numbered 1–8, containing 12 and 50 counties each group. The counties groups with a higher yield have a higher production intensity. They are near mills, have a higher TASW, and are divided in traditional and recent expansion areas. The counties groups with a lower yield have a lower TASW and a higher air temperature. Hotter regions are in the western and northern state border. New areas of expansion were available near current sugarcane mills within areas with a higher TASW. Thus, preferential regions were defined by associating edaphoclimatic conditions with high yield. These areas can receive support to improve sugarcane production. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate; Cluster analysis; Homogenous regions; Production intensity; Saccharum officinarum L; Soil water content",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082706485

Here, we introduce the machine-assisted adsorption process learning and emulation (MAPLE) framework, a generalized data-driven surrogate model that fully emulates operation of an adsorption process at the cyclic steady state. This framework is based on a dense feedforward neural network trained with a Bayesian regularization technique. This framework is generalized for a wide range of inputs which include the adsorbent properties, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm parameters, and operating conditions. The MAPLE framework can then be used to predict key performance indicators such as product purity, recovery, energy, and productivity for any arbitrary adsorbent and operating condition almost instantaneously. The key differentiator of the current work lies in the incorporation of the adsorption isotherm as an input, which is specifically beneficial for rapid screening of large adsorbent databases. A CO2 capture case study is used to illustrate this methodology. A relatively small computational training effort (2000 core hours) is required to train MAPLE with an average prediction accuracy (test RAdj2 ≥ 0.995) for all the four key performance indicators across a wide range of adsorbents/adsorption characteristics. The simulation and optimization time is brought down from 1500 core hours per adsorbent to ≤1 core min per adsorbent. The ability of this framework for rapid screening of adsorbents for postcombustion CO2 capture is also illustrated.

The crystal structure, microstructure and optical properties of the powders annealed at 800 °C and 1000 °C for 1 h were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns show the presence of the expected crystalline phase for each compound. Reflectance spectra for all compounds exhibit a broad absorption band below 425 nm ascribed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) O2− → Ti4+ fundamental state. The Yb3+ excitation spectra for all titanates show a broadband being also compatible with the LMCT O2− → Ti4+ state, indicating the energy transfer from the host to the Yb3+. Interestingly, the excitation band edges follow the same order as that of the optical bandgap energy of the investigated titanates. A conspicuous excitation band in the CaTiO3:Yb3+ provides evidence about the importance of intrinsic defects in the energy transfer process from the host to Yb3+. Photoluminescence emission and diffuse reflectance spectra in the visible and NIR, reveal an emission band that overlaps with the absorption band of the Yb3+, explaining reasonably well the energy transfer process from the host to Yb3+.

For both finite and periodic silicene structures, the electronic properties of carbon-doped monolayers are dramatically changed by controlling the doping sites in the structures, which is related to the amount of disorder introduced in the lattice and electron-electron correlation effects. By changing the position of the carbon dopants, we found that a Mott-Anderson transition is achieved. Moreover, the band gap is determined by the level of lattice disorder and electronic correlation effects. Finally, these structures are ferromagnetic even under disorder which has potential applications in Si-based nanoelectronics, such as field-effect transistors (FETs).

Thus, the present study focused on examining the experiences with CC and its risks to cage fish culture, and phenotypic structure of a typical endemic fishery in fish cage-installed (FCI) and fish cage-free (FCF) lakes. Using a structured questionnaire, fisherfolks of typical FCI and FCF lakes in southwestern Nigeria were consulted for their local experiences regarding CC variables, effects on cage aquaculture and the occurrence of caged fish in their fish catches. For phenotypic structure analysis, size cohorts of cage-cultured (CCU) and wild-caught (WC) Oreochromis niloticus from FCI (CCUFCI and WCFCI), and WC from FCF (WCFCF) were obtained and analysed for phenotypic differences (p <.05) and mix-up through cluster/linkage analysis. Respondents experienced unpredictable climatic conditions, increased rainfall fluctuations and declining rainfall (86.4; 47.1%, 50.0; 64.7%, 100.0; 88.2%, in FCI and FCF lakes, respectively), indicating that CC affects cage culture, induces cage damage and floods, and results in caged fish escapes (40.9; 35.3%, 81.8; 11.8%, 95.5; 41.2% in FCI and FCF lakes, respectively), while caged fishes occur in fisherfolks’ catches (63.6% FCI). Phenotypically, WCFCF and WCFCI were similar, but differed from CCUFCI for pre-dorsal length. WCFCF and WCFCI differed for caudal peduncle lengths. In addition, some individuals of CCUFCI clustered with WCFCI and WCFCF, rather than their population cohorts. Climate change impacts on FCA lakes have implications regarding caged fish escapes. Phenotypic structures indicated a possible mix-up of caged and wild O. niloticus populations.

Since then, to prevent its propagation, the Moroccan government declared a state of health emergency. A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities, limiting population's mobility and prohibiting almost all avoidable activities. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants (mainly PM10, NO2 and SO2) in Salé city (North-Western Morocco) during the lockdown measures. In this context, a continuous measurement of PM10, SO2 and NO2 was carried before and during the Covid-19 lockdown period. As a consequence of the security measures and control actions undertaken, the emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial production were significantly reduced, which contribute to the decrease in the concentrations of the studied pollutants. The obtained results showed that the difference between the concentrations recorded before and during the lockdown period were respectively 75%, 49% and 96% for PM10, SO2 and NO2. PM10 levels were much less reduced than NO2. The three-dimensional air mass backward trajectories, using the HYSPLIT model, demonstrated the benefits of PM10 local emission reductions related to the lockdown were overwhelmed by the contribution of long-range transported aerosols outside areas. In addition, noteworthy differences in the air mass back trajectories and the meteorology between these two periods were evidenced. © 2020","Covid-19; Lockdown; Morocco; NO2; PM10; SO2","Emission control; Air mass back trajectories; Backward trajectory; Continuous measurements; Control actions; Industrial production; Security measure; State of health; Vehicle exhausts; Nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; long range transport; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; viral disease; aerosol; air and air related phenomena; air pollutant; ambient air; Article; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; environmental impact; exhaust gas; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); air pollution; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; Morocco; pandemic; particulate matter; virus pneumonia; Morocco; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Morocco; Nitrogen Dioxide; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085101250

Mineralization stores CO2 by converting it into a thermodynamically stable solid. Beyond storing CO2, the products of CO2 mineralization can potentially substitute conventional products in several industries. Substituting conventional production increases both the economic and the environmental potential of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) by mineralization. The promising potential of CO2 mineralization is, however, challenged by the high energy demand required to overcome the slow reaction kinetics. To provide a sound assessment of the climate impacts of CCU by mineralization, we determine the carbon footprint of CCU by mineralization based on life cycle assessment. For this purpose, we analyze 7 pathways proposed in literature: 5 direct and 2 indirect mineralization pathways, considering serpentine, olivine, and steel slag as feedstock. The mineralization products are employed to partially substitute cement in blended cement. Our results show that all considered CCU technologies for mineralization could reduce climate impacts over the entire life cycle based on the current state-of-the-art and today's energy mix. Reductions range from 0.44 to 1.17 ton CO2e per ton CO2 stored. To estimate an upper bound on the potential of CCU by mineralization, we consider an ideal-mineralization scenario that neglects all process inefficiencies and utilizes the entire product. For this ideal mineralization, mineralization of 1 ton CO2 could even avoid up to 3.2 times more greenhouse gas emissions than only storing CO2. For all mineralization pathways, the carbon footprint is mainly reduced due to the permanent storage of CO2 and the credit for substituting conventional products.

Water electrolysis generates H2 and O2 and involves an exchange of thermal energy. In this manuscript, we investigate specific traditional heavy industrial processes that have previously been performed in nitrogen-rich air environments. We show that the individual process streams may be holistically integrated to establish new decarbonized industrial processes. In new process configurations, CO2 capture is facilitated by avoiding inert gases in reactant streams. The primary energy required to drive electrolysis may be obtained from emerging renewable power sources (wind, solar, etc.) which have enjoyed substantial industrial development and cost reductions over the last decade. The new industrial designs uniquely harmonize the intermittency of renewable energy, allowing chemical energy storage. We show that fully integrated electrolysis promotes the viability of decarbonized industrial processes. Specifically, new process designs uniquely exploit intermittent renewable energy for CO2 conversion, enabling thermal integration, H2 and O2 utilization, and sub-process harmonization for economic feasibility. The new designs are increasingly viable for decarbonizing ferric iron reduction, municipal waste incineration, biomass gasification, fermentation, pulp production, biogas upgrading, and calcination, and are an essential step forward in reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

To qualify vehicles must prove they meet certain emissions limits over a pre-described drive cycle. One of the key factors that will impact vehicle performance is the operation of the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, a large consumer of energy in the system, thus it is vital to have an understanding of the thermal behavior of the cabin and HVAC loads required to maintain comfortable conditions. This paper outlines a lumped parameter model of a generic city bus for use in determining such loads and assisting in the creation of control strategies to minimize energy consumption. Using steady state analysis it is possible to determine the average power consumption required to maintain an internal cabin temperature over a single MLTB drive cycle. Dynamic analysis shows that by changing the HVAC strategy it is possible to reduce the energy consumption by removing the need to operate the system at full power for the entire duration of the cycle. By implementing a hysteresis based control strategy that over heats the environment then switches to a low power mode to allow the temperature to recover the model was able to demonstrate potential energy savings of up to 26.6% when compared to the baseline case operating at a constant steady power output. © 2020 University of Split, FESB.","drive cycle; energy; HVAC; thermal modelling; vehicle","Buses; Consumer behavior; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; HVAC; Potential energy; Vehicle performance; Control strategies; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Local authorities; Low emission vehicles; Lumped parameter modeling; Steady-state analysis; Thermal behaviors; Thermal modelling; Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096639697

Southern Transdanubia in western Hungary may serve as a unique ‘laboratory’ for targeted investigations, as north Balkan and central European characteristics overlap in the region. Site-based studies of recently excavated late 6th millennium cal BC Neolithic settlements provide insights into possible patterns in the development of longhouse architecture and settlement layout, different combinations of material culture and their alterations, and technology transfer on a regional scale. In order to gain a more complex view of these themes, three micro-regions have been selected around key sites for further study of different vantage points between Lake Balaton and the Dráva/Drava river. The southernmost one is located in the Southern Baranya Hills, the second along the Danube on the northern fringes of the Tolna Sárköz and in the adjacent section of the Sárvíz valley, while the third lies in the central section of the southern shore of Lake Balaton. Field surveys including the systematic collection of surface finds complemented by geomagnetic prospections can contribute significantly to the reconstruction of settlement clusters. Absolute chronology has become an important research focus due to larger sets of radiocarbon dates interpreted within a Bayesian framework. The two dominant scenarios for the start of the westward expansion of the LBK are hard to harmonise with each other. An approach that estimates the beginning of the process around 5500 cal BC at the latest gains support from a west-central European perspective. In contrast, recent radiocarbon dating programmes with formal modelling of AMS series within a Bayesian framework estimate the appearance of the LBK west of the Carpathian basin hardly before 5350–5300 cal BC. The latter view provides the potential of harmonising the Neolithisation of central Europe with the emergence of the Vinča culture, at least in its northernmost region. Beyond this debate, ancient DNA analyses have enriched the discussions on migration, demic diffusion and the scale of hunter-gatherer contribution to the process with fresh arguments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Absolute chronology; aDNA; Geomagnetic survey; Micro-regional research; Neolithisation process; Western Hungary","accelerator mass spectrometry; chronology; field survey; geomagnetism; magnetic survey; material culture; Neolithic; radiocarbon dating; technology transfer; Carpathian Basin; Hungary; Lake Balaton; Transdanubia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091711693

Sulfate loading stimulates microbial sulfate reduction and production of toxic and bioaccumulative MeHg. Controls on regional Hg emissions have been successful in reducing Hg deposition and MeHg production in wetlands in other areas, but this has not been the case for the Everglades as the Hg deposited here appears to come from unknown global sources of emissions. We posit that reductions in sulfate loading to the Florida Everglades can be an effective alternative approach used to reduce MeHg production. This study tested this hypothesis (1) by evaluating temporal trends in MeHg concentrations in response to a reduction in sulfate loading at a site in central Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3 and (2) using ecosystem-scale models to predict the effects of reductions in sulfate loading on sulfate concentrations in surface water and MeHg Risk. At the WCA site, we report a decline in sulfate concentrations (from about 9 mg/L in the late 1990s to levels of < 1 mg/L by 2001) due to changes in water delivery as part of Everglades restoration. Concurrent with the decline in sulfate, declines in MeHg concentrations in surface water and fish and wading bird tissues were observed at this site. These results suggest the efficacy of reducing MeHg production and bioaccumulation in the ecosystem through a reduction in sulfate loading. A previously developed model was used to predict the effects of reductions in sulfate loading (97%, 33%, and 10% reduction scenarios) on sulfate concentrations in surface water and MeHg Risk in the Everglades. The model identified areas of the ecosystem where MeHg Risk is most sensitive to the reductions in sulfate loading. Results show that reductions of > 33% in sulfate loading will significantly benefit the Everglades by reducing MeHg Risk. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Everglades; Methylmercury; Mitigation; Modeling; Sulfur","atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric deposition; bioaccumulation; carbon emission; concentration (composition); methylmercury; sulfate; United States; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079716095

HFC is mostly used in passenger cars and urban buses. HFC technology is also being introduced to railway transport. Hydrogen-powered trains are an attractive alternative to diesel trains, in particular on nonelectrified railways-where roughly 70% of the world's 200 000 locomotives operate today-and in the markets of Europe and the US (together about 55 000 diesel locomotives today). Besides avoiding carbon emissions, hydrogen trains reduce noise and eliminate local emissions of NOX and particulates. Since they use significant amounts of hydrogen, the required infrastructure is limited and can be immediately utilised. Hydrogen-powered trains are already being introduced for light-rail vehicles and regional railways-such as the trams produced by the China South Rail Corporation. Other models, including regional trains by Alstom, are expected to be deployed in the coming years. By 2030, one in ten trains sold for currently nonelectrified railways could be powered by hydrogen, by 2050, one in five trains running on nonelectrified railways or one in ten trains overall could run on fuel cells. Presently, two Coradia Lint trains are operated in Germany. In Poland by the end of 2018, 19 235 km of railways were used, of which 7 341 km (38%) were nonelectrified lines, mostly single-Track (63%). Commodity transport was performed with 1470 electrical locomotives, 2070 diesel locomotives and 170 other rail transport vehicles. The objective of the article is to analyse the rationality of introducing HFC technology in Poland e.g. in terms of reduced CO2 emissions, based on current French, Romania, Spanish and Dutch experiences in multiple units and Latvian, German and Polish in shunters or Estonian, German and Swedish in mainline locomotives. The case study presented in this article focuses primarily on reducing CO2 emissions from Multiple Units. © 2020 SAE International.

Maintaining systems productivity with alternative N sources i.e manure and composts could be a strategy also to mitigate N2O emissions. In this paper, we present the effect of different N sources (organic and chemical) on field N2O emissions and how these emissions are associated with soil available N forms (NH4+ and NO3−) in three different rain-fed crops namely barley, pea and vetch grown in Cyprus for two growing seasons. The daily emissions ranged from −3.11 to 12.3 g N–N2O/ha/day, while cumulative emissions ranged from 119 g N–N2O/ha to 660 g N–N2O/ha depending on crop and nitrogen source type. The emissions showed a seasonal pattern and WFPS has been identified as a critical soil parameter controlling daily N2O emissions. The daily N2O fluxes in the current study derives mainly from nitrification irrespectively crop type or nitrogen source type. Specific emission factors for each crop cultivated under different N source type were calculated and ranged from 0.03% ± 0.02–0.34% ± 0.09. The application of manure and chemical fertilizers cause similar intensity of N2O emissions while compost exhibited the lower emission factors. These findings suggest that composts could be integrated in a nutrient management strategy of rain-fed crops with less N2O emissions. The high background emissions found suggest also that other factors than external inputs are associated with N2O emissions and further studies including the response of microbial community structure and their contribution and association with N2O emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Emission factors; N2O; Nutrient management","fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; organic nitrogen; rain; nitrogen; crop plant; emission; fertilizer application; global warming; growing season; nitrous oxide; rainfed agriculture; strategic approach; Article; barley; common vetch; compost; crop; Cyprus; fertilizer application; field emission; growing season; manure; nitrification; nonhuman; pea; plant growth; soil analysis; agriculture; crop; ecosystem; soil; Cyprus; Mediterranean Region; Hordeum; Pisum sativum; Vicia; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Cyprus; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Rain; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086509024

Up to now, the lack of criteria that identify the available cooling resources and the level of performance of technical solution has represented the major obstacle. To address these issues, the authors propose a new set of indicators to fully inform the decision-making process of the bioclimatic design of fully space-conditioned buildings in a hot and humid climate. This set of indicators provides an overview of the exploitable environmental resource (external air through external convection, natural ventilation and sky radiation cooling) referred as the Environmental Resource Indicators and of the capacity of the building to exploit those resources referred as the Building Performance Indicators. The indicators are implemented for a very basic two-story residential building in the hot, humid climate of Djibouti. The case study shows not only the ability of the indicators to reflect the bioclimatic performances of the buildings but also their ability to give an overview of the building heat exchanges, from which the implication of improper bioclimatic solutions on building cooling consumptions can easily be identified. These indicators are a means to help choose which technical solutions are most suited to the local climate, which is very useful for designers and architects in the early stages of building design. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioclimatic approach; Building design; Building indicators; Climate indicators; Environmental resources; Hot climate","Air conditioning; Atmospheric radiation; Decision making; Energy utilization; Ventilation; Bioclimatic approach; Building design; Climate indicators; Environmental resources; Hot climate; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082568716

A frequency-constrained stochastic unit commitment model is employed to optimally schedule EV charging and discharging as well as the provision of frequency response (FR) in an electricity system, while respecting the vehicles' energy requirements and driving schedules. Through case studies we demonstrate that an EV with vehicle to grid (V2G) capability can reduce system costs in a future GB electricity grid by up to £12, 000 per year, and reduce CO2 emissions by 60 tonnes per year, mainly due to reduced curtailment of wind power. The paper also quantifies the changes in the benefits of fleet V2G resulting from variations in FR delivery time, the penetration of wind or the uptake of alternative flexibility providers. Finally, a battery degradation model dependent on an EV's state of charge is proposed and implemented in the stochastic scheduling problem.

In this study, we estimated the overall-ecosystem carbon stocks under different land cover types in some parts of Southwestern Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Soil carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were measured at 0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm soil depths for four land covers (forests (FOR), plantations (TP), woodlands (WD) and croplands (CP)). The aboveground biomass carbon (Mg C ha−1) followed the order: FOR (118.19 Mg C ha−1) &gt; TP (64.57 Mg C ha−1) &gt; WD (31.09 Mg C ha−1) &gt; CP (17.31 Mg C ha−1). Soil organic carbon (SOC) and STN concentration in all land uses decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) with depth increment. Total SOC stock in 0–30 cm soil layer follows the order: FOR land use (93.62 Mg C ha−1) &gt; TP (60.87 Mg C ha−1) &gt; WD (55.21 Mg C ha−1) &gt; CP (50.23 Mg C ha−1). The majority of carbon stocks in our study area were concentrated in the aboveground and soil carbon pool. Overall, the total carbon stock (TCS) of FOR was 163.67 Mg C ha−1, 152.86 Mg C ha−1 and 107.98 Mg C ha−1, respectively, greater than that of CP, WD and TP, respectively. This result indicated that forests stored larger amount of TCS compared to croplands and woodlands. As such, agroforestry, forest plantations and forestry should be given serious considerations as strategies to sequester carbon. Land use management practices and disturbance history are major factors impacting changes in carbon storage among land use systems. Improved knowledge of these and their spatial and temporal variability is very important in understanding the global change in soil carbon stocks and in enhancing human capacity to implement mitigation and adaptation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Carbon pools; Land use change; Luvisol; Nigeria; Soil carbon and nitrogen concentration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089435120

Considering that CH4 emissions are dependent on the structure and abundance of microbial communities, we hypothesized that different vinasse transportation systems would harbor different microbial community composition, resulting in distinct CH4 patterns. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing with real-time PCR to evaluate the composition and abundance of microorganisms in the two main systems of vinasse storage and transportation (i.e. open channels and tanks systems) in Brazil. Our results showed higher microbial diversity and CH4 emissions in channel system, especially in the uncoated section. Significant differences in microbial community structure, diversity, and abundance between the uncoated/coated open channel and tanks indicated a clear selection at taxonomic and functional levels, especially in relation to CH4 production. These responses included higher methanogens diversity in the uncoated section of the channel and are in agreement with the methanogen abundance determined by mcrA and mba genes copy number (1.5 × 107 and 4.3 × 1010) and subsequent positive correlation with CH4 emissions (R2 = 0.8). The most representative methanogen genus across the samples was Methanobrevibacter. The results observed herein shows that the use of the coating in the bottom of channels and tanks prevent the growth and development of a methanogen-related community. We concluded that the improvements in vinasse storage and transportation systems would significantly change the microbial community and reduce CH4 emissions, thereby making bioethanol a greener biofuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas; Methanogens; Microbial ecology; Sugarcane Co-Product","bioethanol; methane; RNA 16S; methane; RNA 16S; abundance; biofuel; correlation; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; species diversity; air pollution; Article; Brazil; community structure; controlled study; environmental sustainability; greenhouse gas; high throughput sequencing; Methanobrevibacter; methanogen; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial gene; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; sugarcane; taxonomy; traffic and transport; vinasse; greenhouse gas; Brazil; Methanobrevibacter; Brazil; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084416081

Growing scientific exactitude on causes and effects of climate change makes humanity's response to it an urgent and critical need. Nigeria like many countries around the world is facing difficult times owing to the new environmental realities produced by the menace. Responding to climate change requires humanity's best social, political, scientific, and technological efforts. To achieve this, this paper notes that digitalization can be a veritable climate change response tool in Nigeria. Dwelling on Schumpeter's theory of innovation and the political economy approach, the paper argues that digitalization holds positives for Nigeria's hitherto unimpressive climate change response but may not be practicable due to the social, economic and political contradictions that are producing unfavourable outcomes within the Nigerian state. This situation explains why mitigation and adaption efforts have not produced satisfactory results, a situation that puts citizens' wellbeing in harm's way in critical areas such as agriculture, housing, healthcare, and energy among others. The paper concludes that digitalization would make mitigation and adaptation wholesome and enhance the adequacy of climate change policies and programmes towards sustainable development in Nigeria. It then comes up with policy suggestions that can help mainstream digitalization as a tool for climate change response in the country. © 2020 Ojakorotu et al.","Adaptation; Climate Change; Development; Digitalization; Mitigation; Nigeria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091927309

Therefore, increasing the photosynthetic rate of an individual leaf under fluctuating light is essential for improving crop productivity. The high-yielding indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Takanari is considered a potential donor of photosynthesis genes because of its higher steady-state photosynthesis at both atmospheric and elevated CO2 concentrations than those of several Japanese commercial cultivars, including Koshihikari. Photosynthetic induction after a sudden increase in light intensity is faster in Takanari than in Koshihikari, but whether the daily carbon gain of Takanari outperforms that of Koshihikari under fluctuating light in the field is unclear. Here we report that Takanari has higher non-steady-state photosynthesis, especially under low nitrogen (N) supply, than Koshihikari. In a pot experiment, Takanari had greater leaf carbon gain during the initial 10 min after a sudden increase in irradiation and higher daily CO2 assimilation under simulated natural fluctuating light, at both atmospheric (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) CO2 concentrations. The electron transport rate during a day under field conditions with low N supply was also higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari. Although the advantages of Takanari were diminished under high N supply, photosynthetic N use efficiency was consistently higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari, under both low and high N supply. This study demonstrates that Takanari is a promising donor parent to use in breeding programs aimed at increasing CO2 assimilation in a wide range of environments, including future higher CO2 concentrations. © Copyright © 2020 Ohkubo, Tanaka, Yamori and Adachi.","CO2; electron transport; nitrogen; non-steady-state photosynthesis; rice; stomatal conductance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091256206

This paper looks at 60 years of continuous decline of an industry that employed more than 600,000 people, through a case study comparing Germany’s two largest hard coal mining areas (Ruhr area and Saarland). Although predominantly economic drivers underlay the transitions, both provide valuable lessons for upcoming coal phase-outs induced by stricter climate policies, including beyond Germany. The analysis identifies the main qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the two regions. It then discusses policy instruments implemented to guide the transition, including measures for the conservation of coal production, regional economic reorientation, and the easing of the transition’s social impacts. The success of these policies is evaluated using economic, social, and geographical indicators that were developed within three interdisciplinary research projects running from 2016 to 2019. A key lesson from the examined case studies is the importance of combining not only policies addressing unemployment and the attraction of new energy corporations and investments, but also measures improving infrastructure, education, research facilities and soft location factors. Protecting a declining industry for decades caused increased transition costs compared to an earlier phase-out. Economic reorientation and changing regional identities have proven most difficult in the past. However, the German example illustrates that the complexity of the challenges of a transition can be mastered if city, regional, and national governments and institutions cooperate in a polycentric approach. Key policy insights A faster and more pro-active hard coal mining phase-out in Germany would have been much less expensive and paved the way for new industries A just and in-time transition needs to: be jointly managed in a polycentric approach by city, regional, national, and international governments and institutions.combine climate, energy, social, and structural policies, whilst recognizing both local specifics and global connections.consider long-term effects, external independent advice apart from the incumbent regime and beyond-border thinking, while aiming to diversify the economy and enabling broad stakeholder participation.address unemployment, the economy, and the energy system, as well as measures to improve infrastructure, universities, research facilities, and soft location factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

This study aims to estimate the contributions of ten southeastern states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) to ozone (O3), and identify significant associations with nonattainment or maintenance at monitors across the eastern United States (US) in 2017. Two widely used air quality models, the Comprehensive Air quality Model with extensions (CAMx) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ), using different versions of the Carbon Bond (CB) chemical mechanism, were applied to predict 2017 O3 design values (DVFs) from 2011 O3 design values (DVCs) at the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) sites throughout the eastern US. Since 2017 design values are already published, the accuracy of the EPA-recommended modeling methodology for projecting current design values into the future only by changing the emissions was evaluated. The assumption that good model performance in the base year would result in accurate future year ozone projections was tested. In general, CAMx/CB6r2 simulated higher DVFs than CMAQ/CB05, with an average difference of 0.5 ppb. As a result, this study identified 24 sites in the eastern US as nonattainment (DVF ≥ 76 ppb) with CAMx/CB6r2 compared to only 16 sites with CMAQ/CB05. Using monitor cell relative response factors (RRFs) instead of 3×3 cell matrix maximum RRFs (the approach used in EPA's proposed Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) modeling) (EPA, 2015a), led to higher DVFs at some monitors and lower DVFs at others. Source apportionment analysis with the CAMx Anthropogenic Precursor Culpability Assessment (APCA) probing tool revealed that NOx emissions dominated over VOC emissions in contributing to O3 in downwind states. Contributions of total anthropogenic NOx emissions and contributions of Electric Generating Unit (EGU) NOx emissions from the southeastern states to O3 at nonattainment and maintenance sites were quantified separately using CAMx/APCA as well as CMAQ/zero-out simulations. Contributions obtained from CAMx/APCA were typically larger than the contributions obtained from CMAQ/zero-out. Therefore, a “significant contribution” determined by CAMx/APCA may be insignificant according to CMAQ/zero-out. “Significant contribution” was defined as an impact larger than 1% of the 2008 O3 NAAQS (i.e., ≥ 0.76 ppb). Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia were linked to 2, 3, 1, 1, 6 and 5 nonattainment sites with CAMx/APCA, while only Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia were linked to 2, 3 and 2 nonattainment sites with CMAQ/zero-out. Additionally, for significant linkages, EGU NOx contributions were 10–55% of the total anthropogenic NOx contributions.

Coobservations of four meteor trails (trains) from the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) telescopes in New Mexico and the Widefield Persistent Train (WiPT) camera associate the long-lasting (tens of seconds), self-generated radio emission known as MRAs with the long-lasting (tens of minutes) optical emissions known as PTs. Each of the four MRAs presented in this paper were spatially and temporally coincident with a PT. In one case, the MRA follows a relatively small (≤400 m × 400 m) noticeably bright region (knot) of emission within the PT, whereas the other three cases were associated with broader regions of PT activity. As PTs are thought to be driven by exothermic chemical reactions between atmospheric oxygen and ablation products, we show that the same reactions, specifically those involving anions, may produce the necessary suprathermal electrons to power MRAs. We show that only one part in ∼1010 of the available power needs to be converted to radio emission in order to produce a typical MRA. ©2020.

Because 99% of silicates in meteorites were reprocessed at high temperatures in the inner regions of the Solar Nebula, we propose that similar levels of heating of carbonaceous materials in the oxygen-rich Solar Nebula would have converted nearly all carbon in dust and grain coatings to CO. We discuss catalytic experiments on a variety of grain surfaces that not only produce gas phase species such as CH4, C2 H6, C6 H6, C6 H5 OH, or CH3 CN, but also produce carbonaceous solids and fibers that would be much more readily incorporated into growing planetesimals. CH4 and other more volatile products of these surface-mediated reactions were likely transported outwards along with chondrule fragments and small Calcium Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs) to enhance the organic content in the outer regions of the nebula where comets formed.

Different responses have emerged to intervene in these communities and slum upgrading is currently considered the best framework. How slum upgrading interventions engage with climate change adaptation and mitigation is not fully explored in the literature. This article scrutinizes three recent slum upgrading programs in Latin America to uncover the ways these tend to engage or not with climate change adaptation and mitigation. The analysis revealed that slum upgrading is both a policy mechanism to address socio-economic issues and an instrument by which built-environment interventions can enhance adaptation and mitigation in informal settlements. Six key areas emerged from the analysis of the case studies that link slum upgrading to climate change adaptation and mitigation through infrastructure and policies: (1) security of tenure, (2) relocation and barriers, (3) public space, (4) energy-efficient and improved architecture, (5) connectivity, and (6) land management. Slum upgrading can be an effective mechanism that combines mitigation and adaptation efforts whilst addressing sustainable development priorities in disadvantaged territories. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation and mitigation; Climate change; Informal settlements; Latin America; Paris agreement; Slum upgrading","adaptive management; climate change; informal settlement; socioeconomic conditions; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085753562

In response to this deficiency, the present study focuses on projected responses to the enhanced greenhouse effect in: (1) the mean state of the atmosphere and land surface; (2) oceanic and terrestrial drivers of sub-Saharan climate variability; and (3) total seasonal climate predictability of sub-Saharan Africa, a region known for its pronounced land–atmosphere coupling. Analysis focuses on output from 23 Earth System Models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Five for the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is projected that the greatest warming across sub-Saharan Africa will occur over the Sahel, the monsoon season will become more persistent into late summer and autumn, short rains in the Horn of Africa (HOA) will intensify, and leaf area index will increase across the HOA. Stepwise Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Assessment, i.e. a multivariate statistical approach, is applied to the model output over sub-Saharan Africa in order to explore the oceanic and terrestrial drivers of regional climate. The models indicate that the study region’s climate variability is dominated by oceanic drivers, with secondary contributions from soil moisture and very modest impacts from vegetation. Overall, the general model consensus of future projections indicates a concerning diminished seasonal predictability of sub-Saharan African regional climate based on key oceanic and terrestrial predictors and an elevated role of the land surface (associated with soil moisture anomalies) compared to oceanic drivers in regulating regional climate variability. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Africa; Climate change; Earth system models; Feedbacks; Land–atmosphere feedbacks","climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; extreme event; feedback mechanism; land surface; regional climate; seasonal variation; soil moisture; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085891316

The results showed that the daily maximum LST simulated by CHTESSEL over Iberia was affected by a large cold bias during summer months when compared against the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF), reaching magnitudes larger than 10 C over wide portions of central and southwestern Iberia. This error was shown to be tightly linked to a misrepresentation of the vegetation cover. In contrast, SURFEX simulations did not display such a cold bias. We show that this was due to the better representation of vegetation cover in SURFEX, which uses an updated land cover dataset (ECOCLIMAP-II) and an interactive vegetation evolution, representing seasonality. The representation of vegetation over Iberia in CHTESSEL was improved by combining information from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) land cover dataset with the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of vegetation coverage (FCOVER). The proposed improvement in vegetation also included a clumping approach that introduces seasonality to the vegetation cover. The results showed significant added value, removing the daily maximum LST summer cold bias completely, without reducing the accuracy of the simulated LST, regardless of season or time of the day. The striking performance differences between SURFEX and CHTESSEL were fundamental to guiding the developments in CHTESSEL highlighting the importance of using different models. This work has important implications: first, it takes advantage of LST, a key variable in surface atmosphere energy and water exchanges, which is closely related to satellite top-of-Atmosphere observations, to improve the model s representation of land surface processes. Second, CHTESSEL is the land surface model employed by ECMWF in the production of their weather forecasts and reanalysis; hence systematic errors in land surface variables and fluxes are then propagated into those products. Indeed, we showed that the summer daily maximum LST cold bias over Iberia in CHTESSEL is present in the widely used ECMWF fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5). Finally, our results provided hints about the interaction between vegetation land atmosphere exchanges, highlighting the relevance of the vegetation cover and respective seasonality in representing land surface temperature in both CHTESSEL and SURFEX. As a whole, this work demonstrated the added value of using multiple earth observation products for constraining and improving weather and climate simulations. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Because agricultural land and GHG emissions are inextricably interrelated, understanding the transfer characteristics and nexus of agricultural land and GHG emissions along supply chains is of great significance for formulating sustainable management strategies for environmental protection in agricultural development. Therefore, this study used a network approach, referred to as the “quasi-input–output” model, to simultaneously track agricultural land and GHG emission flows embodied in global agricultural trade among 151 individual countries/regions in 2016; a nexus strength indicator was then applied to explore the interdependencies of land and emissions in different economic systems. The findings indicate that Australia, the USA, Brazil, and Argentina were the top four largest exporters of both agricultural land and GHG emissions. China and the USA were the top two net importers of land use and GHG emissions. Nexus analyses indicate that each country had its specific land-emission dependent and source countries/regions. Large amounts of land–emission nexus trade flows were one-way transmissions among the trading countries, mainly from land-rich and less-developed regions to land-scarce and more-developed regions. Strong regional characteristics were found in the agricultural land–emission-yield nexuses of different countries. These results suggest that an international trade structure adjustment according to the land–emission nexus characteristics of each country, and targeted agricultural intensification strategies considering land and emission trade-offs, should be the key leverages for sustainable agricultural development and environmental protection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural trade; Greenhouse gas emission; Land use; Land-emission nexus; Quasi-input-output model","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; International trade; Land use; Planning; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Agricultural development; Agricultural intensification; Different economic systems; Less-developed regions; Regional characteristics; Sustainable agricultural development; Sustainable management; Transfer characteristics; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084942030

However, soil N emission is largely neglected while pursuing forage yield. We carried out a randomized block study to investigate whether and how the C3 and C4 grass species differ in soil N emission in a typical salinized field with temperate continental arid climate in the northwest inland regions, China. We quantified soil N2O flux from two C3 (barley and rye) and two C4 grass species [corngrass and sorghum hybrid sudangrass (SHS)] in fields during the growing season (from May to September) by using the static box method, and then determined the relationships between soil N2O fluxes and forage yield and soil properties. Results show that soil available nitrogen, soil temperature, pH, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen were correlated, but soil water was anti-correlated with soil N2O fluxes. In addition, N2O flux increased significantly faster with soil temperature in C4 than in C3 grass fields. Although the lower total N2O emission fluxes were detected for C3 species, the lower yield-scaled N2O was detected for C4 species. Our study provided insights into the determination of grass species and the understanding of mechanisms regulating N2O fluxes in C3 and C4 species in the continental arid regions. © 2020 by the authors.","Crude protein yield; Denitrification; Greenhouse gas; Hay yield; Pasture; Soil organic carbon","Cultivation; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Temperature; Available nitrogen; Emission fluxes; Grazing pressure; Growing season; Nitrous oxide emissions; Soil organic carbon; Soil temperature; Total nitrogen; Arid regions; carbon emission; crop yield; denitrification; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; pasture; protein; soil pollution; soil quality; yield response; Hordeum; Secale cereale; Sorghum x drummondii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091873845

Globally, there is growing demand to develop infrastructure to harvest water resources to support agriculture, threatening the ecological integrity of associated wetland ecosystems. We investigated the potential ecological impacts on floodplain wetland connectivity in northern Australia in response to changes in flow regime due to dam construction and climate change. Results for this study indicate that a drier climate and/or dam construction in catchments have the potential to reduce the effective size of the floodplain and reduce wetland connectivity. A drier climate will reduce rainfall and subsequent catchment run-off, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of riverine flows. In contrast, dams in the upper catchment will reduce the magnitude of flows downstream. The reduction in flows under both dam development and a drier climate will result in reduced extent and duration of floodplain inundation and decreased wetland connectivity. As a result, we anticipate that this loss of connectivity will reduce the capacity for nutrients, carbon and primary production to be flushed into the river channel, as well as reduce the ability for biota such as fish and turtles to move between in-channel and off-channel habitats. © 2020 Commonwealth of Australia.

Advances in efficiency of new technologies, with impacts in renewable energy and transport affected by environmental concerns and climate change mitigation, demand a reassessment and adjustment of the industrial structure of the economy. Technological advances enhancing creativity and analytical skills mean people must learn and adapt to a fast-changing economic environment. This paper present some key changes in Australian educational areas in recent years that are important and relevant to the subject of education innovation and philosophy to achieve outcomes in training and sustainable economic development, as anticipated by the community and government. Education courses and curricula in many countries have been transformed by technological advance. It is the swift incorporation of new technologies that best prepares students for the dynamics of economic and social change. Even though technological responsiveness is not a new phenomenon, it is established that the teaching methods found to be most successful include complementary and supplemental courses producing multi-skilled and creative graduates. These courses are delivered with significant emphasis upon self-development skills and are less focused upon traditional content. A move toward horizontal focus and a student-centric balance is the current trend, displacing vertical over-specialisation of learning. Yet, the central role of educator is seen as still appropriate and necessary where the aim is to equip graduates with creative and adaptive skills. © 2020, © 2020 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","creativity; education innovation; education technology; Knowledge economy; self-assessment; self-learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083646089

When used with coupled models of Earth system compartments, e.g., the atmosphere and the ocean, consistent joint states can be estimated. A common approach for data assimilation is ensemble-based methods which utilize an ensemble of state realizations to estimate the state and its uncertainty. These methods are far more costly to compute than a single coupled model because of the required integration of the ensemble. However, with uncoupled models, the ensemble methods also have been shown to exhibit a particularly good scaling behavior. This study discusses an approach to augment a coupled model with data assimilation functionality provided by the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (PDAF). Using only minimal changes in the codes of the different compartment models, a particularly efficient data assimilation system is generated that utilizes parallelization and in-memory data transfers between the models and the data assimilation functions and hence avoids most of the file reading and writing, as well as model restarts during the data assimilation process. This study explains the required modifications to the programs with the example of the coupled atmosphere-sea-ice-ocean model AWI-CM (AWI Climate Model). Using the case of the assimilation of oceanic observations shows that the data assimilation leads only to small overheads in computing time of about 15&thinsp;% compared to the model without data assimilation and a very good parallel scalability. The model-agnostic structure of the assimilation software ensures a separation of concerns in which the development of data assimilation methods can be separated from the model application.</p>. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

This paper compares which contributions the different flexibilities can make to emission reduction, avoidance of curtailment, and reduction of fuel and CO2 costs, and which circumstances contribute to a decrease or increase of overall emissions with additional flexibilities. The analysis stresses the rising importance of flexibilities in an energy system based on increasing shares of renewable electricity generation, and shows that flexibilities are generally suited to reduce carbon emissions. It is presented that the relative contribution towards the reduction of curtailment and costs of flexibilisation of aluminium electrolysis are high, whereby the absolute effect is small compared to the other options due to the limited number of available processes. © 2020 by the authors.","Demand response; Demand-side management; Dispatch; Flexibility; Heat storage; Renewable energy system; Sector coupling; Storage","Aluminum; Buffer storage; Cost reduction; District heating; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Electrolysis; Emission control; Heat storage; Hydrogen storage; Additional flexibilities; Aluminium electrolysis; District heating networks; Electricity generation; Electricity storages; Hydrogen electrolysis; Relative contribution; Renewable electricity; Demand side management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090899631

Nevertheless, energy programs have resulted in growing societal polarization in several regions. Therefore, around the globe, government and legislative authorities at the local, regional, national, and international levels are highly concerned about the environmental impacts and risk factors that influence the energy paradigm. Thus, to minimize and/or limit the environmental insecurity issues, the world needs swift and effective actions to secure the climate for a better tomorrow. Moreover, there is a dire need to look for new energy alternatives, along with reducing the complete dependence on petro-based energy sources. Keeping this burning issue in mind, herein, an effort has been made to present the potential of several renewable energy sources, including wind-based renewable energy, solar-based renewable energy, hydro-based renewable energy, and biomass-based renewable energy. Following a brief introduction of energy-related problems and opportunities, a comparative overview is given to renewable vs. non-renewable energy sources. Then, several renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, hydro, and biomass, along with the worldwide energy capacity of each energy source are given with suitable examples and statistics. Finally, risk factors, concluding remarks, and future guidelines are discussed towards the end. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental impact; Renewable energy; Societal-economic impact; Visual impact; Wind energy","alternative energy; electrification; environmental impact; environmental issue; environmental legislation; governance approach; literature review; risk factor; social structure; wind power; energy resource; environment; renewable energy; risk factor; wind; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Renewable Energy; Risk Factors; Wind",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086729781

This study examines the characteristics and structure of these typhoons and the responses to the global warming climate to explore the robust features of typhoon hazards in northern Japan in a future warming climate. By obtaining similar typhoon tracks under the 2016 conditions and a pseudo global warming (PGW) climate, we found that the typhoon intensity under the PGW climate becomes stronger with higher lifetime maximum wind up to ~10 m·s−1 and lower lifetime minimum sea level pressure of ~20 hPa. Rainfall associated with the typhoons indicated a robust increase in northern Japan in the PGW climate, while the changes in surface winds in the PGW climate depend on the case. A higher rate of intensification and more availability of energy are expected in the future warming climate especially over the landfall regions. All the typhoons except Typhoon Lionrock, after making landfall over Hokkaido region, exhibited a much deeper cold core structure in the future climate. Overall results suggest that the hazards related to typhoons over northern Japan will be more severe in the future warming climate. © 2020 The Authors.

(2016), for mixtures of dilute gases with large numbers of components. In particular, we detail the practical implementation of Model 1+M (loc.cit.) using the lowest order approximation. This is a simple and easy to implement approach, where the 1+M main species can be chosen locally. These new formulations of multicomponent diffusion are compared to the formulation of Dixon-Lewis, used for instance in the Chemkin package, and also to the widely used mixture-averaged simplification. Steady flamelets are first considered for very different fuels (hydrogen, methane or dodecane) in order to show some differences and limitations of the different formulations, and in order to compare computational costs when different numbers of species are involved. An unsteady auto-igniting counterflow diffusion flamelet of methane in a coflow of hot products is also considered. In this way, unsteady 1D calculations can be performed, still including all the challenges of multicomponent diffusion transport as would appear for instance in Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulent flames. The different comparisons in terms of precision and cost show that Model 1+M truncated to the lowest order can be more efficient than the mixture-averaged approach, while reproducing the results of Dixon-Lewis multicomponent diffusion. The efficiency of the proposed approach is mainly due to the evaluation of fewer binary diffusion coefficients, therefore reducing significantly the number of time-consuming operations. Finally, we show that the definition of 1+M main species can also be used to simplify the time-consuming evaluation of the mixture viscosity, leading to an important further reduction of CPU time that makes the lowest order Model 1+M always more efficient than the mixture-averaged formulation. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","Differential diffusion; Mixture-averaged; Multicomponent gases","Hydrogen fuels; Methane; Mixtures; Binary diffusion coefficients; Computational costs; Counterflow diffusion; Mixture viscosity; Multi-component diffusion; Multicomponents; Steady flamelets; Turbulent flame; Diffusion; dodecane; fuel; hydrogen; methane; Article; calculation; combustion; decomposition; diffusion coefficient; flame; multicomponent Fick diffusion; priority journal; simulation; thermal diffusion; viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086083406

Carbon dioxide adversely affects the environment, therefore, its utilization and storage are critical. In this work, a simplistic approach of single-stage membrane units combine with amine absorption processes with different commercial amines was investigated. An increase in CO2 concentration in the feed gas results in a substantial increase in the thermal energy consumption of the stripper reboiler were using a hybrid amine-membrane setup can effectively reduce energy consumed in the reboiler. Both the amine absorption process and membrane process are simulated using Aspen HYSYS V10. Since the membrane is not available in Aspen HYSYS V10 unit operation package; it is programmed and added as custom user operation. Moreover, a new acid/ amine-based fluid package builds in a combination of the Peng-Robinson equation of state for vapor phase and electrolyte non-random two liquid-based activity model for the liquid phase were used in this study.

In the light of these results, for water management purposes in the Mediterranean area, rainfall spatio-temporal scale is a critical aspect and it must be taken into account in groundwater reservoir allocation.

The chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is regulated by several physical processes: star birth and death, grain formation and destruction, and galactic inflows and outflows. Understanding such processes and their relative importance is essential to following galaxy evolution and the chemical enrichment through the cosmic epochs, and to interpreting current and future observations. Despite the importance of such topics, the contribution of different stellar sources to the chemical enrichment of galaxies, for example massive stars exploding as Type II supernovae (SNe) and low-mass stars, as well as the mechanisms driving the evolution of dust grains, such as for example grain growth in the ISM and destruction by SN shocks, remain controversial from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. Aims. In this work, we revise the current description of metal and dust evolution in the ISM of local low-metallicity dwarf galaxies and develop a new description of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) which are considered to be their high-redshift counterparts in terms of star formation, stellar mass, and metallicity. Our goal is to reproduce the observed properties of such galaxies, in particular (i) the peak in dust mass over total stellar mass (sMdust) observed within a few hundred million years; and (ii) the decrease in sMdust at a later time. Methods. We fitted spectral energy distribution of dwarf galaxies and LBGs with the ""Code Investigating GALaxies Emission"", through which the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rate are estimated. For some of the dwarf galaxies considered, the metal and gas content are available from the literature. We computed different prescriptions for metal and dust evolution in these systems (e.g. different initial mass functions for stars, dust condensation fractions, SN destruction, dust accretion in the ISM, and inflow and outflow efficiency), and we fitted the properties of the observed galaxies through the predictions of the models. Results. Only some combinations of models are able to reproduce the observed trend and simultaneously fit the observed properties of the galaxies considered. In particular, we show that (i) a top-heavy initial mass function that favours the formation of massive stars and a dust condensation fraction for Type II SNe of around 50% or more help to reproduce the peak of sMdust observed after ≈100 Myr from the beginning of the baryon cycle for both dwarf galaxies and LBGs; (ii) galactic outflows play a crucial role in reproducing the observed decline in sMdust with age and are more efficient than grain destruction from Type II SNe both in local galaxies and at high-redshift; (iii) a star formation efficiency (mass of gas converted into stars) of a few percent is required to explain the observed metallicity of local dwarf galaxies; and (iv) dust growth in the ISM is not necessary in order to reproduce the values of sMdust derived for the galaxies under study, and, if present, the effect of this process would be erased by galactic outflows. © A.

Mode choice behavior is also a core feature in transportation planning models, which are used for analyzing future policies and sustainable plans such as greenhouse gas emissions reduction plans. Specifically, an agent-based model requires an individual level choice behavior, mode choice being one such example. However, traditional utility-based discrete choice models, such as logit models, are limited to aggregated behavior analysis. This paper develops a model employing a deep neural network structure that is applicable to the travel mode choice problem. This paper uses deep learning algorithms to highlight an individual-level mode choice behavior model, which leads us to take into account the inherent characteristics of choice models that all individuals have different choice options, an aspect not considered in the neural network models of the past that have led to poorer performance. Comparative analysis with existing behavior models indicates that the proposed model outperforms traditional discrete choice models in terms of prediction accuracy for both individual and aggregated behavior. © 2020 by the authors.","Agent-based model; Deep neural network; Discrete choice model; Individual-level choice prediction; Logit model; Mode choice behavior; Random utility model; Smart urban mobility","accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; greenhouse gas; prediction; transportation planning; travel behavior; travel demand; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091526122

The presence of a comprehensive legal regime is meant to provide an opportunity for the country to coordinate climate change issues in a more structured manner. Despite this, Kenya continues to grapple with challenges presented by climate change, which have increased the country’s vulnerability to biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation and immense impacts on livelihoods and infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. Climate-related disasters and extreme events have plagued the most vulnerable communities, particularly with the most affected being Indigenous People and marginalised local communities. It is against this backdrop that the extent to which procedural mechanisms and the substantive legal frameworks produced needs to be reflected upon, to determine their interaction and feedback with the ongoing climate crisis and their sufficiency to adequately deliver climate justice across various levels of climate change law implementation. As a starting point, this article builds a comprehensive understanding on the existing climate laws in Kenya and explores how this translates to climate resilience building. The coherences, practicalities and implementation dynamics of the legal instruments are analysed to provide a clear picture of how the country responds to international, regional and national expectations and obligations. We argue that the adequacy of climate instruments in Kenya has not satisfactorily translated into climate resilience. Although most of the instruments are informed by sustainability principles for climate justice and resilience building, they still face diverse socio-economic and political dynamics that impede its effective implementation. © The Author(s) 2020.","Climate change governance; communities; instruments; justice; legislation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092565269

The effective use of surplus energy from wind plants appears as a promising method to produce hydrogen. Accumulating surplus energy through hydrogen production and storage can solve the problem of energy excess, making energy available on-demand. This article explored the potential of hydrogen production from wind energy in three distinct scenarios of surplus energy, and the amount of electricity generation for Brazil and its regions. To a scenario of 6-h of energy excess, the potential for hydrogen production from wind energy was equal to 1.48E + 07 Nm3.d−1. The state of Rio Grande do Sul reached a potential of 1.10E+06 MWh.month-1 of electricity generation using H2. Taking into account a payback-time of 3.5 years, the cost of hydrogen production was 0.402 US$.kWh−1. Hydrogen ensures greater energy security in times of energy shortages through biofuel storage. The main goal was to show the possibilities of diversifying the national electrical matrix and the wind resources contribution to the Circular and H2 Economy in the country. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Brazil; Electrolysis; Energy security; Hydrogen; Rio Grande do Sul state; Wind power","Electric power generation; Energy conservation; Energy security; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Wind power; Avoided emissions; Circular economy; Electricity generation; Energy shortages; Integration of renewable energies; Rio Grande do Sul; Surplus capacity; Sustainable energy development; Hydrogen production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089195735

Adaptation strategies were grouped into two categories, i.e., traditional adaptation strategies and scientific adaptation strategies. Traditional adaptation strategies consisted of practices that require minimal technical expertise and less external inputs such as changing from crops to livestock, crop diversification, increasing land under production, changing crop type and water harvesting. Scientific adaptation strategies consisted of practices that require additional external inputs, labour, and some level of technical expertise such as changing crop variety, improving soil fertility and soil conservation. Data were collected from 391 smallholder farmers using a structured household questionnaire and were verified through focus group discussion meetings with key informants. Data were analysed using the descriptive statistics, frequency analysis and a binary logistic model. Results indicated that the majority of smallholder farmers perceived that climate change had triggered food‐related impacts in the study area and had adopted at least one adaptation strategy. This study showed that awareness and knowledge were the key factors that determined the adoption of traditional adaptation strategies in the study area. The adoption of scientific adaptation strategies was additionally determined by the availability of external financial investments. It is recommended that the promotion of traditional practices should focus on raising awareness of climate change and adaptation strategies while the promotion of scientific practices additionally requires the provision and accessibility of financial institutional support and incentives. © 2020 by the authors.

However, optimal irrigation scheduling is a nonlinear problem with many competing and conflicting objectives and constraints, and deals with an environment in which conditions are uncertain. In this study, a multi-objective optimization problem for irrigation scheduling was presented in which maximization of net benefits and water use efficiency and minimization of risk were the objectives. The presented optimization problem was solved using four different approaches, all of which used the AquaCrop model and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III. Approach 1 used dynamic climate data without adaption; Approach 2 used dynamic climate data with adaption; Approach 3 used static climate data without adaption; and Approach 4 used static climate data with adaption. The dynamic climate data were generated using the bootstrap resampling of original climate data. A case study of maize production in north Jiangsu Province of China was used to evaluate the proposed approaches. Under the multi-objective scenario presented and other conditions of the study, Approach 4 gave the best results, and showed that irrigation depths of 400, 325, and 200 mm were required to produce a maize crop in a dry, normal, and wet year, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.","Bootstrap resampling technique; Climate uncertainty; Irrigation; Maize; Simulation-optimization model","agricultural modeling; bootstrapping; genetic algorithm; multiobjective programming; numerical model; optimization; risk assessment; sustainable development; uncertainty analysis; water use efficiency; China; Jiangsu; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091195111

In particular, catalytic reductive aminations using molecular hydrogen are highly valued and essential for the cost-effective and sustainable production of different kinds of amines and their functionalization. These reactions couple easily accessible carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones) with ammonia, amines or nitro compounds in the presence of suitable catalysts and hydrogen that enable the preparation of linear and branched primary, secondary and tertiary amines including N-methylamines and molecules used in life science applications. In general, amines represent valuable fine and bulk chemicals, which serve as key precursors and central intermediates for the synthesis of advanced chemicals, life science molecules, dyes and polymers. Noteworthily, amine functionalities are present in a large number of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and biomolecules, and play vital roles in the function of these active compounds. In general, reductive aminations are challenging processes, especially for the syntheses of primary amines, which often are non-selective and suffer from over-alkylation and reduction of carbonyl compounds to the corresponding alcohols. Hence, the development of suitable catalysts to perform these reactions in a highly efficient and selective manner is crucial and continues to be important and attracts scientific interest. In this regard, both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have successfully been developed for these reactions to access various amines. There is a need for a comprehensive review on catalytic reductive aminations to discuss the potential catalysts used and applicability of this methodology in the preparation of different kinds of amines, which are of commercial, industrial and medicinal importance. Consequently, in this review we discuss catalytic reductive aminations using molecular hydrogen and their applications in the synthesis of functionalized and structurally diverse benzylic, heterocyclic and aliphatic primary, secondary and tertiary amines as well as N-methylamines and more complex drug targets. In addition, mechanisms of reductive aminations including selective formation of desired amine products as well as possible side reactions are emphasized.

Additionally, the resources consumed and the operational energy requirements of buildings are ‘locked-in’, potentially for decades. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recognised construction as a sector in which significant improvements can, and indeed must, be made. But the industry is often argued to be unique, in its multiplicity of stakeholders, transient organisational structures, avoidance of risk and impact on society. The current Virtual Special Issue (VSI) sought to bring together a collection of papers on progress and potential for improvement in the construction sector, in terms of both sustainability and resilience to the changing climate. A total of 34 papers form the VSI. Insights from social science include the need for more holistic perspectives at multiple levels, from buildings to urban plans, and the centrality of human relationships, through leadership, collaboration and along supply chains. Insights from a technology perspective include BIM applications for green and off-site construction, enhanced estimation of construction waste, and developments in materials. Insights on low-carbon construction include evidence that reducing both costs and emissions in the construction sector is viable. This editorial reviews the VSI papers and makes a number of recommendations including the need to recognize that values and understanding change over time and that leadership and human decision-making are essential factors for transformation. Alongside the progress described on sustainability in multiple areas, the editorial calls for an invigorated research focus on how construction can adapt the built environment to the changing future that is before us all. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Construction industry; Resilient built environment; Sustainable construction","Climate change; Construction industry; Decision making; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Construction sectors; Holistic perspectives; Human decision making; Human relationships; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Low carbon constructions; Off-site construction; Organisational structure; Architectural design",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086368027

The most advantageous AWC applications are for developing solar energy driven, off-grid water sources. Solid phase silica gel (SiO2) desiccant materials can adsorb and concentrate water vapor in many relative humidity (RH) (20-100%) and temperature (20-40 °C) conditions. Generating sufficient solar thermal heat to release all of the sorbed water vapor from the desiccant bed can take many hours of sunlight, which limits the AWC system to just one adsorption-desorption-condensation cycle per day. In this work, we applied solar-light active photothermal nanomaterials (gold cubes and rods, carbon black) on SiO2desiccant surfaces with the aim of providing localized heat sources, thereby rapidly increasing desiccant surface temperature, improving kinetics and totality of water vapor desorption, and allowing additional AWC cycles per day. Desiccants were tested for adsorption at 40%, 60%, and 80% RH and desorption under 1-Sun simulated solar irradiation. In the optimal use-case scenario, 5 wt% carbon black coated SiO2could cycle through &gt;10 adsorption-desorption phases per day to produce 0.47 g H2O per g desiccant/12 hours (2 L m−2) at 40% RH. By innovating material and AWC system design to operate over multiple atmospheric water harvesting cycles per day, we showed that nano-enabled photothermal desiccants can be applied in semi-arid climates to produce 10-fold more water than one standard cycle using a bare SiO2desiccant. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.",,"Adsorption; Atmospheric humidity; Carbon black; Desorption; Driers (materials); Silica; Silica gel; Silicon; Solar energy; Water conservation; Water vapor; Adsorption desorption; Atmospheric water; Photothermal nanomaterials; Semi-arid climate; Solar irradiation; Surface temperatures; Use case scenario; Water vapor desorption; Potable water; adsorption; air temperature; atmospheric moisture; desorption; relative humidity; silica; solar power; surface temperature; water resource; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091752339

Glacier shrinkage leads to cascading impacts, including changes in river flow regimes, availability of water resources for downstream populations and economy, changes in the occurrence and severity of natural hazards, and cultural changes associated with landscape character and identity. In this study, we analyze impacts of mountain cryosphere change through a lens of Loss and Damage (L&D), a mechanism of international climate policy that tries to evaluate and reduce negative consequences of climate change for societies. We analyze the effects of climate change on glacier change, glacier lake formation and growth, hydrological regimes, and associated impacts on human societies in the Cordillera Blanca in the Peruvian Andes, now and under future scenarios. We use various methods such as literature review, glacial lake outburst flood, and hydrologic modeling to examine three major dimensions of cryospheric change and associated human impacts: (i) ice loss; (ii) glacial hazards; and (iii) variability of water availability. We identify the damage and losses in terms of the number of people affected by glacial hazards, monetized agricultural crop loss due to water loss, and non-economic values local people attribute to glacier loss. We find that different levels of warming have important negative but differentiated effects on natural and human systems.

We tested the hypotheses that (1) eutrophication of freshwaters increases the invasive success of the submersed aquatic plant Hydrilla verticillata; (2) CO2-enrichment makes freshwater systems more prone to H. verticillata invasion; and (3) interactions between eutrophication and CO2 enrichment increase the potential of H. verticillata invasion. We carried out a factorial experiment crossing eutrophication (nutrient and phytoplankton addition) and CO2 enrichment to compare the growth attributes of the invasive H. verticillata with those of the native Egeria najas (both Hydrocharitaceae). We found that eutrophication and CO2 enrichment had different effects on growth attributes. Eutrophication decreased the growth rate and lateral branch formation of both species, but the invasive species continued producing more branches than the native one. These results suggest that the invasive species has an increased advantage for spreading under eutrophic conditions. In contrast, CO2 enrichment increased the growth rate and lateral branch formation of both species, but only under eutrophic conditions. Consequently, CO2 enrichment largely counteracted the negative effects of eutrophication on these two macrophytes. Our results indicate that the interaction between freshwater CO2 enrichment and eutrophication may enhance the invasion success of H. verticillata, and potentially other Hydrocharitaceae, due to an increase plant growth and in propagule pressure. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Macrophytes; Nutrient availability; Regime shifts","aquatic plant; carbon dioxide; eutrophication; growth rate; invasive species; macrophyte; phytoplankton; propagule; tropical region; Egeria najas; Hydrilla verticillata; Hydrocharitaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085049389

Attempt to determine the methods to reduce environmental risk of rice cultivation are required. Selecting the best cover crop in rice rotation is necessary. The novelty of this research versus current knowledge is that life cycle assessment (LCA) has not been applied to assess the environmental impacts of crop rotation systems in paddy fields in Iran. Hence, the life cycle of rice cultivars in different crop rotations was assessed in Neka region, northern Iran from 2017 to 2018. All the management practices/inputs of local (‘Tarom Hashemi’) and improved (‘Shiroodi’) rice cultivars were monitored. After recording the data of 100 selected paddy fields for each cultivar, nine cover crop-rice rotations (fallow-rice, clover-rice, rape seed-rice, wheat-rice, barley-rice, faba bean-rice, garlic-rice, lettuce-rice and cabbage-rice) were identified. Functional unit of LCA was 1-ton rice yield. The results demonstrated that the maximum and minimum amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were applied in fallow-rice and clover-rice rotations, respectively. The highest paddy yield for local (4856 kg ha−1) and improved (7745 kg ha−1) cultivars was produced in clover-rice rotation. Fossil CO2 eq, biogenic CO2 eq, global warming potential (GWP) 100a, terrestrial acidification (TA) and fossil depletion (FD) of local cultivar were 11.79%, 34.76%, 13.35%, 15.48%, and 20.13% greater than improved cultivar. The most cumulative energy demand (CED) in both cultivars was obtained for fallow-rice rotation followed by rape seed-rice rotation. The highest emission of biogenic CO2 eq for both cultivar was observed in rape seed-rice and fallow-rice rotations. The lowest amount of GWP 100a was calculated in clover-rice rotation for local and improved cultivars (248.08 and 240.5 kg CO2 eq). In both cultivars, the most and lowest amount of TA, freshwater eutrophication (FEU), ozone depletion (OD) and FD was emitted in fallow-rice and clover-rice rotations. Among the crop rotations, clover-rice and fallow-rice had significantly lowest and most emission of heavy metals in the air, water and soil, respectively. As a matter of fact, the environmental emissions of the study is straightly linked to the application of inputs and field management practices. According to this, the lowest amount of environmental emissions for both cultivars was observed in clover-rice rotation. The emissions released from environmental pollutants are positively correlated with the application of inputs and field management practices for crop species in rotation system. In conclusion, clover-rice rotation showed the potential to save non-renewable energies (fuel, nitrogen, and etc.) with higher paddy yield which is considered to be environmentally friendly crop in rotation with respect to reduce emissions of GHG. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Barley; Clover; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Wheat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083383431

This study evaluated the future climate suitability for the cultivation of winegrape and potential global warming impacts on southern California's winegrowing regions through a series of high-resolution surface air temperature and precipitation projections obtained with the WRF-SSIB regional climate model. Results reveal that by mid-21st-century the surface air temperature will increase by approximately 1.2 °C, while average precipitation will decrease by as much as 11% in the southern winegrowing areas under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario. Evaluation of bioclimatic suitability indices indicate increases in heat accumulation for all major winegrowing areas; including an increase of about 10% in growing-degree day, while morning low temperatures in September may experience increases of approximately 11% in the future, thus impacting negatively the ripening stage of grapevines and leading to changes in wine composition and quality. Additionally, the extent of areas classified under the cool to warm climate suitability categories could decrease by nearly 42% in the study area by 2050. Conditions in southern California are already warm and dry for viticulture and continuing heat accumulation increase, along with rainfall reduction, could potentially place additional stress to winegrape crop in the area, including advanced phenological timing and moisture deficit stress that could lead to decreases in yield. The projected decline in viticulture suitability highlights the need for adaptive capacity within this sector to mitigate the impacts of global warming. Possible mitigating strategies include planting hotter climate grape varieties, moving vineyards to regions that are more suitable in the future, and adopting dry-farming techniques. © 2020 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)","Bioclimatic indices; Dynamical downscaling; Global warming; Regional climate modeling; Winegrape suitability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091614265

However, there is high spatio-temporal uncertainty on those impacts linked to climate change uncertainty and the natural and anthropogenic interdependencies of water management systems. This study identifies current and future spatial patterns of fES production in a highly managed water resource system in northern India to inform the design and assessment of plausible adaptation measures to enhance fES production in the catchment under uncertain climate change. A water resource systems modelling approach is used to evaluate fES across the full range of plausible future scenarios, to identify the (worst-case) climate change scenarios triggering the greatest impacts and assess the capacity of adaptation to enhance fES. Results indicate that the current and future states of the fES depend on the spatial patterns of climate change and the impacts of infrastructure management on river flows. Natural zones deliver more regulating and cultural services than anthropized areas, although they are more climate-sensitive. The implementation of a plausible adaptation strategy only manages to slightly enhance fES in the system with respect to no adaptation. These results demonstrate that water resource systems models are powerful tools to capture complex system dependencies and inform the design of robust catchment management measures. They also highlight that mitigation and more ambitious adaptation strategies are needed to offset climate change impacts in highly climate-sensitive catchments. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Catchment management; Climate change; Spatial dependencies; Water resource systems modelling; WEAP","Ecosystems; Rivers; Runoff; Water; Water management; Adaptation strategies; Catchment management; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Freshwater ecosystem; Infrastructure managements; Water management systems; Water resource systems; Climate change; adaptive management; basin management; climate change; complexity; ecosystem service; hydrological modeling; mitigation; river flow; river system; strategic approach; water resource; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089966343

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States","Sulfur compounds are an important constituent of particulate matter, with impacts on climate and public health. While most sulfur observed in particulate matter has been assumed to be sulfate, laboratory experiments reveal that hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS), an adduct formed by aqueous phase chemical reaction of dissolved HCHO and SO2, may be easily misinterpreted in measurements as sulfate. Here we present observational and modeling evidence for a ubiquitous global presence of HMS. We find that filter samples collected in Shijiazhuang, China, and examined with ion chromatography within 9 days show as much as 7.6 μg m−3 of HMS, while samples from Singapore examined 9–18 months after collection reveal ~0.6 μg m−3 of HMS. The Shijiazhuang samples show only minor traces of HMS 4 months later, suggesting that HMS had decomposed over time during sample storage. In contrast, the Singapore samples do not clearly show a decline in HMS concentration over 2 months of monitoring. Measurements from over 150 sites, primarily derived from the IMPROVE network across the United States, suggest the ubiquitous presence of HMS in at least trace amounts as much as 60 days after collection. The degree of possible HMS decomposition in the IMPROVE observations is unknown. Using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we estimate that HMS may account for 10% of global particulate sulfur in continental surface air and over 25% in many polluted regions. Our results suggest that reducing emissions of HCHO and other volatile organic compounds may have a co-benefit of decreasing particulate sulfur. ©2020.

This study aims to design the system-optimal (SO) traffic management policy, i.e., multiperiod tradable credit scheme (MPTCS), for urban transportation infrastructure. Under this scheme, the central authority (CA) seeks to minimize the total system travel time while achieving a predetermined vehicular emissions standard in each period of a long-term horizon with a duration of multiple years. Because travel demand and supply are uncertain in transportation infrastructure over a long-term horizon, the CA cannot provide accurate forecasts of future credit prices (CPs) to travelers a priori, leading to traveler heterogeneity in perceiving these future CPs. It impacts travelers' decisions about using credits or transferring them to the next period. Further, travelers perceive credit purchases in the market as monetary losses and selling credits as monetary gain. We formulate the SO MPTCS design as a bilevel model. The CA determines the credit charging and allocation schemes in the upper-level model to minimize total system travel time over a horizon constrained by the emissions standard for each period. The MPTCS equilibrium condition is formulated in the lower level where travelers decide about credit consumption and path choice to minimize their travel costs. Numerical experiments suggest that as the difference between travelers' perception of future CPs and the actual CPs (set by the CA for various periods) increases, the effectiveness of the SO MPTCS design in minimizing total system travel time decreases unless this difference is explicitly factored in the design. Also, if the CA increases emissions standards under the SO MPTCS design, the travel costs increase. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Emissions caps; Loss aversion; Optimal design; Perceived credit price; Tradable credit scheme","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Equilibrium conditions; Numerical experiments; Price perceptions; Tradable credit schemes; Traffic management; Transportation infrastructures; Transportation sector; Vehicular emission; Urban transportation; design method; emissions trading; future prospect; perception; traffic emission; transportation infrastructure; travel demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092668675

The case evolved around the legally binding force of a cabinet decision of the Federal Government which laid down the German greenhouse gas emissons reduction target for 2020. Despite the fact that the application was dismissed for lack of standing, some important legal developments can be derived from the judgment, especially in relation to justiciability of the case and the state’s duty to protect fundamental rights under the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) in the climate change context. Just after the judgment was delivered, the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) adopted the first Federal Climate Protection Act in November 2019 and thus defined the state’s new climate targets in statutory form. This changed the legal landscape and claimants consequently abstained from appealing the judgment. However, the German Constitutional Court now has the opportunity to clarify further some of the legal issues that arose in this first German climate case from applying ‘traditional’ legal concepts to the challenge of climate change, if it decides to hear the constitutional complaint which was filed in 2020 against the Federal Climate Protection Act. © The Author(s) 2020.","Climate change; climate litigation; duty to protect; fundamental rights; German climate case",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092598841

Predicting the evolutionary trajectory of species essential to ecosystem function under future climates is challenging but necessary for prioritizing conservation investments. We use a combination of population genetics and niche suitability models to assess the trajectory of a functionally important, but highly fragmented, plant species from south-eastern Australia (Banksia marginata, Proteaceae). We demonstrate significant genetic structuring among, and high level of relatedness within, fragmented remnant populations, highlighting imminent risks of inbreeding. Population simulations, controlling for effective population size (Ne), suggest that many remnant populations will suffer rapid declines in genetic diversity due to drift in the absence of intervention. Simulations were used to demonstrate how inbreeding and drift processes might be suppressed by assisted migration and population mixing approaches that enhance the size and connectivity of remnant populations. These analyses were complemented by niche suitability models that predicted substantial reductions of suitable habitat by 2080; ~30% of the current distribution of the species climate niche overlaps with the projected distribution of the species climate niche in the geographic region by the 2080s. Our study highlights the importance of conserving remnant populations and establishing new populations in areas likely to support B. marginata in the future, and adopting seed sourcing strategies that can help populations overcome the risks of inbreeding and maladaptation. We also argue that ecological replacement of B. marginata using climatically suited plant species might be needed in the future to maintain ecosystem processes where B. marginata cannot persist. We recommend the need for progressive revegetation policies and practices to prevent further deterioration of species such as B. marginata and the ecosystems they support. © 2020 The Authors.

Given the abundance of WH from NPPs and the ubiquity of generally low-grade heat requirements of agricultural operations, from production to post-harvest, there is remarkable potential to harness NPP WH for agricultural uses with mutual economic advantages to NPPs and agricultural sectors. Taking advantage of this WH resource may improve the financial outlook of both the partnered power plants and agricultural businesses by providing an additional revenue stream, decreased heating costs, and a reduced carbon footprint. This review summarizes and interprets the historical discourse and research on agricultural applications of NPP WH in the U.S., and synthesizes technical constraints, unknowns, and opportunities for realizing the benefits of WH derived from the nuclear energy sector for agricultural value chains. Previous applications of WH in the agricultural industry demonstrate that this is a viable option to the benefit of the parties involved under the right conditions, but relatively little has been done to further this technology in the U.S. in recent years or explore novel applications. A revival of interest in this technology may be warranted given the current outlook for NPPs in the U.S. and a general interest in reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Agricultural robots; Carbon footprint; Environmental technology; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Radioactive wastes; Waste heat; Agricultural business; Agricultural industries; Agricultural operations; Agricultural sector; Economic advantages; Environmental liabilities; Novel applications; Technical constraints; Agriculture",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085580087

Considering the impact of energy consumption and environmental pollution on the technological innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises, this paper incorporates industrial energy consumption, pollution control, and wastewater and exhaust emissions into the technical inefficiency equation. Based on the panel data of industrial enterprises in 30 provinces and autonomous regions in China from 2009 to 2016, the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) model is used to study the effect of energy consumption and environmental pollution on technological innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises. The research results show that reducing energy consumption and increasing pollution treatment investment both have a significant driving effect on the improvement of industrial enterprises’ technological innovation efficiency. Industrial wastewater and exhaust emissions have the opposite effect; unreasonable input mode of pollution control and personnel allocation have hindered the improvement of industrial enterprises’ technological innovation efficiency. The average annual trend of technological innovation efficiency in industrial enterprises shows a curve of first rising, then falling, and rising again. The average values of Chongqing, Zhejiang, and Hunan rank in the top three, and the average values of Qinghai, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia rank the bottom three. The average values of other provinces are higher than 0.9, and the difference is small. A suitable incentive mechanism should be established for industrial enterprises to save energy and reduce emissions and strengthen pollution control, improve the training program for environmental protection technical personnel, and provide important support for improving the green competitiveness of industrial enterprises. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Energy consumption; Environmental pollution; Pollution control; Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA); Technological innovation efficiency","empirical analysis; energy conservation; environmental protection; industrial enterprise; innovation; panel data; pollution control; wastewater; China; China; industry; invention; pollution; productivity; China; Efficiency; Environmental Pollution; Industry; Inventions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086701180

The EU market share for this vehicle type in the passenger car segment was 3% in 2018 and this powertrain type remains of interest as an option to meet the European Union (EU) fleet average CO2 limits. EU legislative procedures require emissions limits to be met during the chassis dynamometer test and in the on-road real driving emissions (RDE) test, while official CO2/FC figures are quantified via the laboratory chassis dynamometer test only. This study employed both legislative test procedures and compared the results. Laboratory (chassis) dynamometer testing was conducted using the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). On-road testing was carried out in accordance with RDE requirements, measuring the concentration of regulated gaseous emissions and the number of solid particles (PN). Dynamic parameters and other characteristic properties were determined for each RDE test. Compliance with such requirements allowed the assessment of harmful compound emissions to which the latest requirements of the standard for non-plugin hybrid vehicles were applied. Comparisons of the results from the two test procedures revealed varying behaviour from compound to compound, with differences caused by certain characteristics of the RDE/WLTP tests, such as the proportion of urban driving, the frequency of stops and the mean speed, as well as ambient temperature. Overall, harmful emissions were shown to be low under almost all driving conditions, even for test conditions generally thought to cause higher emissions. © 2020 SAE International.

Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95 °C and mean precipitation around 8.74 mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57 °C and 20.87 mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65 °C and 8.48 mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacán, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.). © 2020","Climate effect; Local transmission rate; Mexico; SARS-CoV-2","Transmissions; Climate characteristics; Environmental conditions; Lower temperatures; Mean precipitation; Meteorological factors; Meteorological station; Regional climate effects; Transmission ratios; Tropics; air temperature; climate effect; COVID-19; disease transmission; environmental conditions; epidemic; evaporation; infectious disease; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; temperature effect; viral disease; adult; Article; climate; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; epidemic; evaporation; female; human; male; meteorology; Mexico; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trend study; virus transmission; weather; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; pandemic; season; temperature; virus pneumonia; Mexico [North America]; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Climate; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mexico; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085180959

They are also part of the global carbon cycle. Atmospheric black and organic carbon (including brown carbon) may deposit and darken snow surfaces. Currently, there are no standardized methods for sampling, filtering, and analysis protocols to detect carbon in snow. Here, we describe our current methods and protocols to detect carbon in seasonal snow using the OCEC thermal optical method, a European standard for atmospheric elemental carbon (EC). We analyzed snow collected within and around the urban background SMEARIII (Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations) at Kumpula (60° N) and the Arctic GAW(Global Atmospheric Watch) station at Sodankyla (67° N). The median BC, OC, and TC in snow samples (ntot = 30) in Kumpula were 1118, 5279, and 6396 ppb, and in Sodankyla, they were 19, 1751, and 629 ppb. Laboratory experiments showed that error due to carbon attached to a sampling bag (n = 11) was &lt;0.01%. Sonication slightly increased the measured EC, while wetting the filter or filtering the wrong side up indicated a possible sample loss. Finally, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of OCEC to detect carbon in snow. © 2020 by the authors.","Arctic; Black carbon; Brown carbon; Carbon; Organic carbon; Procedure; Protocol; Seasonal; Snow; Urban background","Particulate emissions; Snow; Thermal conductivity; Wetting; Elemental carbon; European Standards; Global atmospheric watches; Global carbon cycle; Laboratory experiments; Standardized methods; Thermal optical method; Urban background; Organic carbon; aerosol; arctic environment; black carbon; detection method; organic carbon; sampling; seasonal variation; snow; urban atmosphere; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092397031

Hashtgerd plain is an immigrant destination due to socio-economic development and its proximity to the Tehran metropolis. The population growth has led to more water demand, resulting in excessive utilization of groundwater resources and water shortages in the agricultural sector. The water shortage and climate change in Hashtgerd plain could lead to more severe water crisis in the future. Therefore, this study aimed to provide adaptation strategies for minimizing the negative effects of climate change by taking into account the interaction between different sub-systems in Hashtgerd plain during 2020–2049 period. In order to assess the climate change impacts, the output of 19 AOGCMs models was used under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. A comprehensive model was developed based on the system dynamics theory to investigate the interactions of water resources, agriculture, and socio-economic sub-systems and were used to investigate the impacts of climate change and evaluate various adaptation strategies on different sub-systems of the region. The simulation results showed the negative effects of climate change will intensify the water shortage in Hashtgerd Plain. The agricultural sector will be more vulnerable to climate change than the domestic and industrial sectors. The results of various policies showed that improving water use efficiency coupled with reducing the cultivation of high-consumption crops and changing the cropping pattern towards lower water requirement plants can effectively minimize the adverse impacts of climate change on water shortages in agriculture. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; System dynamics; Water shortage","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Cultivation; Economics; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Population statistics; Water supply; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural sector; Climate change impact; Comprehensive model; Socio-economic development; Water resources planning and managements; Water resources systems; Water use efficiency; Climate change; adaptive management; agriculture; climate change; climate effect; megacity; policy analysis; resource scarcity; suburban area; water resource; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089783126

The majority of studies of biogenic SOA have focused on single or simple multicomponent BVOC mixtures thought to be representative of Northern hemispheric deciduous or mixed forest conditions. Gaps remain in our understanding of SOA formation from complex mixtures of real plant emissions in other environments. Towards the goal of understanding SOA in other regions, we conducted the first comprehensive study of SOA from oxygenated monoterpenes. These are the dominant emissions from the most common plant species in southern California's coastal sage ecosystem: black sage (Salvia mellifera) and California sagebrush (Artemisia californica). Emissions from sage plants, as well as single compounds representing their major emissions (camphor, camphene and eucalyptol), were oxidised in an Aerodyne potential aerosol mass oxidation flow reactor (PAM-OFR). The chemical composition of SOA was characterised using a high-resolution time-of-flight iodide-anion chemicalionisation mass spectrometer equipped with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO-I-HR-ToF-CIMS) under low-and medium-NOx conditions. SOA from oxygenated monoterpenes showed a higherorder oligomer content and a greater presence of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) than non-oxygenated monoterpenes, with HOM contributing 27 %-47 % and 12 %-14 % of SOA product signal from oxygenated and nonoxygenated monoterpenes respectively. This study highlights the potential importance of oxygenated monoterpene emissions for SOA formation in woody shrub ecosystems. © 2020 Author(s).",,"aerosol formation; biogenic emission; monoterpene; oxidation; shrub; volatile organic compound; Artemisia californica; Cordia polycephala; Dryobalanops; Salvia columbariae columbariae; Salvia mellifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092301624

Plant allelopathic effects may increase under abiotic and biotic stresses based on The Stress Hypothesis of Allelopathy (TSHA). Lonicera maackii is an aggressive EIPS in the Midwestern USA, able to affect native flora by means of allelopathy. We aimed to test the role of intraspecific competition, as biotic stress, and expected future climate conditions (i.e. intense floods in spring; hotter and drier conditions in summer), as abiotic stress, on the performance and allelopathic potential of L. maackii. We grew L. maackii plants, collected from the field (field plants) or germinated from seeds in a greenhouse (seedlings), with or without intraspecific competition and under simulated present and expected future (1) spring (intense flooding vs no flooding) and (2) summer conditions. We subsequently measured plant performance variables, such as Fv/Fm (an indicator of plant stress), plant biomass, and concentration of pigments, carbon and nitrogen; and allelopathic potential (i.e. the effect of L. maackii leaf extracts and conditioned substrates on the germination of two herb species). In accordance with TSHA, intense flooding stressed L. maackii (Fv/Fm &lt; 0.7), reduced its biomass, and increased its allelopathic potential. In summer, L. maackii plants were more stressed (lower average Fv/Fm) under future summer conditions and intraspecific competition than under present conditions without competitors, but they had similar allelopathic potential. This suggests the presence of a stress threshold from which allelopathic potential does not increase further. Intraspecific competition more negatively affected the performance of seedlings (e.g. plant mass reduction) than field plants, but only increased the allelopathic potential of the latter. Our results indicated that the negative effects of intense flooding on L. maackii performance could be counteracted by the benefit gained in plant–plant competition by means of increased allelopathic potential. The complex role of abiotic and biotic conditions on L. maackii performance and allelopathy are also discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Amur Honeysuckle; Exotic species; Lonicera maackii; Novel weapons; Phytotoxicity; Stress hypotheses","allelochemical; allelopathy; climate change; climate conditions; environmental stress; intraspecific competition; invasive species; native species; shrub; Midwest; United States; Lonicera maackii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085283970

Attaining food and nutrition security goals is also a priority for the region, particularly in relation to improving dietary quality and reducing the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Addressing these challenges requires context-specific research that incorporates a realistic understanding of the links between drivers of change, food systems, and how these influence diets and health. Using a case study approach, this study explores links between climate hazards, food systems, and diets in remote coastal villages of Fiji. Livelihood transitions and climate hazards explain why households have become less reliant on local fisheries and agriculture for their dietary needs. Most households are routinely consuming only locally sourced food items from four food groups, meaning dietary diversity is low. In addition, diets are shifting and now include significant quantities of energy-dense processed (imported) foods with lower nutritional value. The study highlights the importance of increasing availability of fruits and vegetables, mainly through local production, and diversifying sustainable sources of animal protein as strategies to increase diet quality. These communities are already implementing strategies to adapt to climate change, yet this study underscores the need to link climate adaptation with changes to food systems and diets, in ways that allow livelihoods to be sustained and the quality of life of rural dwellers to improve. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Climate change; Food security; Food systems; Nutrition; Pacific",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086164620

However, quantifying the impact of land management practices on soil GHG fluxes including CO2 and N2O is difficult due temporal and spatial variability of localized weather conditions and subfield soil properties. A process-based biogeochemistry modeling framework coupled with public soils, weather, and yield data layers was used to estimate regionally specific soil GHG reductions associated with the adoption of one or more CSA practices in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) crop production fields. Site-specific, multi-year DeNintrification-DeComposition model simulations were performed on agricultural fields within 11 U.S. Corn-Belt states that were identified to be in maize or soybean production from 2013 to 2016. Differences between modeled changes in SOC stocks to a depth of 50 cm, N2O emissions, and CH4 fluxes corresponding with alternative land management scenarios simulated across field sites were converted to a CO2 equivalent basis and spatially weighted to a county-scale to highlight regional variability. County-scale GHG reductions corresponding with a conversion from conventional tillage to no-tillage practices are estimated to be have a mean reduction potential of 1477 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 (SOC, N2O, and CH4 flux reductions of 945, 549, −17 kg CO2e ha−1yr−1, respectively, where a negative reduction indicates an increase in emissions.) with a standard deviation of 605 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1. Additionally, the adoption of cover crops is predicted to provide a mean reduction of 678 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 (SOC, N2O, and CH4 flux reductions of 824, -173, 26.7 kg CO2e ha−1yr−1, respectively), and improved N-fertilizer timing is estimated to mitigate 413 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 (SOC, N2O, and CH4 flux reductions of 75, 337, 1 kg CO2e ha−1yr−1, respectively). The adoption of multiple CSA practices is estimated to have the greatest mean reduction potential of 2861 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 (SOC, N2O, and CH4 flux reductions of 2210, 611, 39 kg CO2e ha−1yr−1, respectively). Use of the spatially explicit subfield modeling approach based on public data provides a relatively low-cost approach for strategically targeting CSA practices to agricultural regions where adoption is most impactful. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon sequestration; Climate smart agriculture (CSA); GHG mitigation; Soil organic carbon; Subfield scale","Agricultural robots; Amino acids; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Land use; Nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Reduction; Scales (weighing instruments); Soils; Agricultural fields; Agricultural greenhouse; Conventional tillage; Land management practices; No-tillage practices; Regional variability; Soybean (Glycine max (L.)

In this context, it highlights the novel strategy regarding the use of macroalgal- and microalgal-derived feed additives. Recent Findings: Several feed management strategies for ruminants focus on the inclusion of nutritional supplements, increasing proportion of starch, or supplementation with high-energy lipids. These strategies aim to improve animal productivity, whilst at the same time reduce methane emissions. Algae supplements are currently investigated as novel ingredients for decreasing methanogenesis, with the potential production of algal biomass also contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, utilisation of algal biomass as a feed concentrate in dietary supplementation presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy. Summary: This review summarises the current stage of research on dietary strategies and their influences on the metabolic processes during enteric fermentation. This information is essential for developing strategies to mitigate methane emissions in the livestock industry. We specifically present the opportunities that algae could offer as a feed additive for methanogenic reduction in cattle. The data compiled from the peer-reviewed literature revealed synergistic effects of algal biomass on methane reduction and animal productivity. However, the challenges regarding the mass cultivation of macro- and microalgae were noticed. Considering the diversity of algal species, future research should increase screening efforts to include more species and dosage evaluation, along with efforts to see if such effects are sustained over time. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agriculture; Algae; Feed management; Global challenges; Livestock; Sustainability",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087642671

Traditionally, the estimation of N2O emissions from grasslands is carried out by means of plot-scale experiments, where externally sourced animal excreta are applied to soils to simulate grazing conditions. This approach, however, fails to account for the impact of different sward types on the composition of excreta and thus the functionality of soil microbiomes, creating unrealistic situations that are seldom observed under commercial agriculture. Using three farming systems under contrasting pasture management strategies at the North Wyke Farm Platform, an instrumented ruminant grazing trial in Devon, UK, this study measured N2O emissions from soils treated with cattle urine and dung collected within each system as well as standard synthetic urine shared across all systems, and compared these values against those from two forms of controls with and without inorganic nitrogen fertiliser applications. Soil microbial activity was regularly monitored through gene abundance to evaluate interactions between sward types, soil amendments, soil microbiomes and, ultimately, N2O production. Across all systems, N2O emissions attributable to cattle urine and standard synthetic urine were found to be inconsistent with one another due to discrepancy in nitrogen content. Despite previous findings that grasses with elevated levels of water-soluble carbohydrates tend to generate lower levels of N2O, the soil under high sugar grass monoculture in this study recorded higher emissions when receiving excreta from cattle fed the same grass.

Such targets imply an expected contribution of afforestation to the net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, yet the nature of afforestation undertaken and its geographical distribution means that there is considerable uncertainty over the eventual emission reductions outcomes. This uncertainty is reduced if the net carbon balance is calculated for all potential afforestation sites, considering climate, soil characteristics and the possible types of afforestation (species and management regimes). To quantify the range of possible emissions outcomes for area-based afforestation targets, a new spatial analysis method was implemented. This improved the integration of spatial data on antecedent land use with mapped outputs from forest models defining the suitability and productivity of eleven forestry management alternatives. This above ground carbon data was then integrated with outputs from the ECOSSE (Estimation of Carbon in Organic Soils – Sequestration and Emissions) model which simulates the soil carbon dynamics. The maps and other model output visualisations combining above and below ground carbon highlight where net carbon surpluses and deficits are likely to occur, how long they persist after afforestation and their relationships with antecedent land use, soils, weather conditions and afforestation management strategies. Using more productive land classes delivers more net sequestration per hectare and could mean greater carbon storage than anticipated by emissions reduction plans. Extensive establishment of lower yielding trees on low-quality ground, with organo-mineral soils could, though, result in net emissions that persist for decades. From the spatial analysis, the range of possible outcomes for any target area of planting is substantial, meaning that outcomes are highly sensitive to policy and implementation decisions on the mix of forestry systems preferred and to spatial targeting or exclusions (both at regional and local scales). The paper highlights the importance of retaining the existing presumption against planting of deep peat areas, but also that additional incentives or constraints may be needed to achieve the aggregate rates of emission mitigation implied by policy commitments. Supplementary carbon storage tonnage targets for new forestry would introduce a floor for carbon sequestration outcomes, but would still allow for flexibility in achieving an appropriate balance in the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and the many other objectives that new woodlands are expected to deliver. © 2020 The Authors","Afforestation; Carbon; Emissions; Mitigation; Soils; Targets","afforestation; carbon balance; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission control; forest management; tree planting; woodland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087005163

Distributed energy resources have enabled an expanded role for energy consumers and non-utility third parties to reshape system costs, drawing renewed attention to the potential of reforming electricity rate design based on the further application of cost-causal principals to improve overall system fairness and efficiency. One mechanism to move toward greater application of cost-causal rate design is dynamic pricing, which varies electricity prices across time and location to reflect costs of providing electricity to consumers under specific market conditions and grid operation conditions. While dynamic electricity pricing has penetrated some markets, and it has not been widely implemented, particularly for residential consumers. In this review article, we provide a brief summary of electricity rate design, including the possibility of introducing dynamic prices, and explain why dynamic prices are more reflective of the short-run marginal costs of electricity supply than volumetric rates. We then explore the barriers to the widespread adoption of residential dynamic pricing, emphasizing technical, economic, and political challenges. Our assessment reflects the ability of dynamic prices to engender more equitable and efficient outcomes by achieving the goal of cost-causality, and we argue that a move toward more dynamic pricing can constitute a welfare improvement over volumetric rates. However, dynamic pricing does not completely address the full set of challenges associated with rate design and, alone, is unlikely to enable the full recovery of fixed costs and the fair attribution of the positive and negative externalities of electricity provision. Therefore, electricity rate design requires tradeoffs, making it as much an art as a science. This analysis synthesizes literature across multiple fields and suggests avenues for further research. © 2020 The Author(s).

Despite regulations on exhaust gas emissions being applied, minimizing unsuitable driving habits that cause elevated fuel consumption and emissions would achieve further reductions. For that reason, this work proposes a self-organized map (SOM)-based intelligent system in order to provide drivers with eco-driving-intended driving style (DS) recommendations. The development of the DS advisor uses driving data from the Uyanik instrumented car. The system classifies drivers regarding the underlying causes of non-optimal DSs from the eco-driving viewpoint. When compared with other solutions, the main advantage of this approach is the personalization of the recommendations that are provided to motorists, comprising the handling of the pedals and the gearbox, with potential improvements in both fuel consumption and emissions ranging from the 9.5% to the 31.5%, or even higher for drivers that are strongly engaged with the system. It was successfully implemented using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device of the Xilinx ZynQ programmable system-on-a-chip (PSoC) family. This SOM-based system allows for real-time implementation, state-of-the-art timing performances, and low power consumption, which are suitable for developing advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs). © 2020 by the authors.

Our community engaged research partnership previously demonstrated associations between neighborhood NH3 and ambient PM2.5 and asthma in the agricultural lower Yakima Valley of Washington. As a next step, the partnership desired an intervention approach to address concerns about pediatric asthma in this largely Latino immigrant, farm worker community. Objective: The Home Air in Agriculture Pediatric Intervention (HAPI) sought to examine the effectiveness of enrichment of an existing asthma education program with portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners designed to reduce PM2.5 and NH3. We investigated the effect of this enriched approach on these exposures and asthma health measures. Design: We randomized children with poorly controlled asthma to a control arm (current asthma education program) or an intervention arm (current asthma education program + placement of two indoor air cleaners in the family's home). Outcomes included (1) 14-day integrated samples of indoor air contaminants (PM2.5 and NH3) at baseline and one-year follow-up and (2) child asthma health metrics at baseline, midpoint (4–6 months) and one-year follow-up. These included the Asthma Control Test, symptoms days, clinical utilization, oral corticosteroid use, pulmonary function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and urinary leukotriene E4 concentration. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first randomized HEPA cleaner intervention designed to assess NH3 as well as PM2.5 and to evaluate health outcomes of children with asthma in an agricultural region. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Agricultural workers' diseases; Air filter; Air pollutants; Asthma; Environmental exposure; Pediatrics","allergen; ammonia; corticosteroid; endotoxin; leukotriene E4; nitrogen dioxide; agricultural worker; air quality; ambient air; Article; asthma; Asthma Control Test; child; clinical article; controlled study; environmental exposure; follow up; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; Hispanic; home environment; human; immigrant; lung function; mental stress; particulate matter; patient education; pediatrics; randomized controlled trial; rural area; symptom assessment; Washington; agriculture; asthma; methodology; Agriculture; Asthma; Child; Humans; Research Design; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088965348

The legal landscape for offshore freshwater aquifers consequently spans domestic, regional, and international regimes, making the governance analysis for this untapped resource complex and multilayered. At the apex of ocean governance lies the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), a global treaty with almost universal application. Both LOSC and customary law grant each coastal state exclusive sovereign rights over seabed natural resources in its continental shelf, although those rights are limited by other legal commitments such as obligations to protect the environment. LOSC does not address transboundary resources, but early and sustained demand for offshore hydrocarbons caused that governance gap to be filled through judicial decisions, bi-lateral treaties, and customary practices. Traditionally, distribution of natural resources has been viewed as a right commensurate with sovereign claims to the resource, but a strong ethical argument can be made for treating water as an exceptional case due to its uniquely life-giving properties. When offshore freshwater is eventually appropriated for use, humanity will have an opportunity to choose between following old patterns of distribution or crafting a more inclusive system. In a world facing global shortages of freshwater due to pollution, overuse and climate change, policymakers designing a legal regime for untapped reservoirs of a vital resource for which there is no substitute should consider more equitable forms of distribution. Both Roman law and LOSC provide precedents for sharing natural resources, and the emerging trend of benefit-sharing offers multiple and varied possibilities as well.

In this sense, to reduce the impact of climate warming, obtaining new tolerant/resistant cultivars and rootstocks is a mandatory goal in Prunus breeding. Therefore, the current study assembled three Prunus species including almond, (P. dulcis Mill D.A. Webb), apricot (P. armeniaca L.) and peach (P. persica L.) to model the temporal effects of drought. A hybrid peach × almond and a wild almond-relative species Prunus webbii were also included in the study. Physiological traits associated with photosynthetic activity, leaf water status, and chlorophyll content were assessed under three watering treatments. Results showed that effects of time, genotype, and treatment interact significantly in all traits. In addition, results confirmed that P. webbii have a greater tolerance to drought than commercial rootstocks. However, “Real Fino” apricot showed the fastest recovery after re-irrigation while being one of the most affected cultivars. In addition, from the better response to these watering treatments by the almond genotypes, two different trends were observed after re-irrigation treatment that clearly differentiate the response of the almond cultivar “Garrigue” from the rest of Prunus genotypes. A better characterization of the short-term drought response in Prunus, an accurate and more efficient evaluation of the genotype effect was obtained from the use of mixed models considering appropriate variance–covariance structures. Although the advantages of these approaches are rarely used in Prunus breeding, these methodologies should be undertaken in the future by breeders to increase efficiency in developing new breeding materials. © 2020 by the authors.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is widely considered a carbon (C)-neutral or C-negative bioenergy production system, but projected increases in air temperature and precipitation due to climate change might substantially alter soil organic C (SOC) dynamics and storage in soils. This study examined long-term SOC changes in switchgrass grown on marginal land in the USGLR under current and projected climate, predicted using a process-based model (Systems Approach to Land-Use Sustainability) extensively calibrated with a wealth of plant and soil measurements at nine experimental sites. Simulations indicate that these soils are likely a net C sink under switchgrass (average gain 0.87 Mg C ha−1 year−1), although substantial variation in the rate of SOC accumulation was predicted (range: 0.2–1.3 Mg C ha−1 year−1). Principal component analysis revealed that the predicted intersite variability in SOC sequestration was related in part to differences in climatic characteristics, and to a lesser extent, to heterogeneous soils. Although climate change impacts on switchgrass plant growth were predicted to be small (4%–6% decrease on average), the increased soil respiration was predicted to partially negate SOC accumulations down to 70% below historical rates in the most extreme scenarios. Increasing N fertilizer rate and decreasing harvest intensity both had modest SOC sequestration benefits under projected climate, whereas introducing genotypes better adapted to the longer growing seasons was a much more effective strategy. Best-performing adaptation scenarios were able to offset &gt;60% of the climate change impacts, leading to SOC sequestration 0.7 Mg C ha−1 year−1 under projected climate. On average, this was 0.3 Mg C ha−1 year−1 more C sequestered than the no adaptation baseline.

Here we develop an RNAi-RbcS tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) master-line, tobRrDS, for producing homogenous plant Rubisco by rbcL-rbcS operon chloroplast transformation. Four genotypes encoding alternative rbcS genes and adjoining 59-intergenic sequences revealed that Rubisco production was highest (50% of the wild type) in the lines incorporating a rbcS gene whose codon use and 59 untranslated-region matched rbcL. Additional tobacco genotypes produced here incorporated differing potato (Solanum tuberosum) rbcL-rbcS operons that either encoded one of three mesophyll small subunits (pS1, pS2, and pS3) or the potato trichome pST-subunit. The pS3-subunit caused impairment of potato Rubisco production by ;15% relative to the lines producing pS1, pS2, or pST. However, the bAbB loop Asn-55-His and Lys-57-Ser substitutions in the pS3-subunit improved carboxylation rates by 13% and carboxylation efficiency (CE) by 17%, relative to potato Rubisco incorporating pS1 or pS2-subunits. Tobacco photosynthesis and growth were most impaired in lines producing potato Rubisco incorporating the pST-subunit, which reduced CE and CO2/O2 specificity 40% and 15%, respectively. Returning the rbcS gene to the plant plastome provides an effective bioengineering chassis for introduction and evaluation of novel homogeneous Rubisco complexes in a whole plant context. © 2020 ASPB.",,"bacterial protein; RbcL protein, plastid; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; chloroplast; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; operon; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; potato; protein subunit; Rhodospirillum rubrum; RNA interference; tobacco; transgenic plant; translation initiation; Bacterial Proteins; Chloroplasts; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Operon; Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Protein Subunits; Rhodospirillum rubrum; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; RNA Interference; Solanum tuberosum; Tobacco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090510072

The assessment of added resistance in waves is important from both an economic and environmental point of view, owing to increasingly stringent rules set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) with the aim to reduce CO2 emission by ships. For that reason, it is desirable to evaluate the added resistance in waves already in the preliminary ship design stage both in regular and irregular waves. Ships are traditionally designed and optimized with respect to calm water conditions. Within this research, the effect of prismatic coefficient, longitudinal position of the centre of buoyancy, trim, pitch radius of gyration, and ship speed on added resistance is investigated for the KCS (Kriso Container Ship) container ship in regular head waves and for different sea states. The calculations are performed using the 3D panel method based on Kelvin type Green function. The results for short waves are corrected to adequately take into account the diffraction component. The obtained results provide an insight into the effect of variation of ship characteristics on added resistance in waves. © 2020 by the authors.","Added resistance in waves; Container ship; Potential flow theory; Sea states; Variation of ship characteristics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091723318

XRD confirmed the structure of the nanocomposite, XPS was performed to examine the chemical state of the compounds. The morphology analysis realized by FESEM confirmed the success of the proposed methodology to produce the rGO/MWCNTf-ZnS nanocomposites revealing good homogeneity. The electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge.

Microbial communities responsible for sulfur and methane cycling and organic transformation in terrestrial mud volcanoes remain poorly characterized. Using a metagenomics approach, we analyzed the microbial community of bubbling fluids retrieved from an active mud volcano in eastern Crimea. The microbial community was dominated by chemolithoautotrophic Campylobacterota and Gammaproteobacteria, which are capable of sulfur oxidation coupled to aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Methane oxidation could be enabled by aerobic Methylococcales bacteria and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME), while methanogens were nearly absent. The ANME community was dominated by a novel species of Ca. Methanoperedenaceae that lacked nitrate reductase and probably couple methane oxidation to the reduction of metal oxides. Analysis of two Ca. Bathyarchaeota genomes revealed the lack of mcr genes and predicted that they could grow on fatty acids, sugars, and proteinaceous substrates performing fermentation. Thermophilic sulfate reducers indigenous to the deep subsurface, Thermodesulfovibrionales (Nitrospirae) and Ca. Desulforudis (Firmicutes), were found in minor amounts. Overall, the results obtained suggest that reduced compounds delivered from the deep subsurface support the development of autotrophic microorganisms using various electron acceptors for respiration. © 2020 by the authors.

They have implemented readiness activities to fulfil the requirements for results-based payments from the forestry sector (termed REDD+). Using content analysis, a questionnaire, and a series of workshops with key stakeholders, we mapped the REDD + readiness of 11 Asia-Pacific countries with respect to UNFCCC's resolutions on REDD+. Their status was mapped against the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which constitutes the five design elements of the Warsaw REDD + Framework and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) requirements. While the overall achievements vary across the studied countries, our results demonstrate that Vietnam, Nepal, and Indonesia are in an advanced stage of REDD + readiness. A significant number of conditional NDCs and timely and adequate technical and financial support are imperative for the studied countries to achieve a high level of readiness. However, lack of trust and coordination among the state and non-state actors, limited national participation of Civil Society Organizations and Indigenous Peoples in REDD + related committees, and conflicts among regulatory frameworks related to forestry and other land uses remain common challenges for these countries. These challenges risk disrupting the essence of REDD + as a multi-level, multi-stage and multi-stakeholder governance system. Stakeholders in these countries are optimistic about a better performance of REDD + regarding emission reduction, enhanced livelihoods, improved forest governance and improvement in biodiversity. However, any optimism is challenged by stakeholder's own suspicion of the effectiveness of REDD + projects to achieve permanency and control leakage/displacement. Building political will and the development of context-specific benefit-sharing plans and their effective implementation could be important keys to maintaining optimism of stakeholders about REDD + initiatives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate financing; Forest carbon partnership facility; REDD+; UN-REDD; Warsaw framework","climate change; emission control; indigenous population; performance assessment; Red List; risk assessment; stakeholder; Article; Bhutan; biodiversity; Cambodia; climate change; content analysis; developing country; female; Fiji; financial management; forest management; forestry; human; Indonesia; land use; Laos; Nepal; Pakistan; Papua New Guinea; structured questionnaire; Thailand; Vanuatu; Viet Nam; workshop; Asia; environmental protection; Viet Nam; Asia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Indonesia; Nepal; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084512389

For historical reasons, the households of ethnic minorities in China tend to face more severe energy poverty problems. In this study, we proposed the concept and research method of characteristic energy, a new method to depict household energy use pattern. Combined with the diversity analysis, the energy use pattern of Tujia and Miao rural households in Chongqing, China, were studied. Households in research area were clustered into four groups with different characteristic energy sources: firewood, electricity, coal and gasoline, representing four types of household energy use pattern. The main impact factors of rural household energy use pattern are electrical appliances and amount of pig raising, indicating that household production and lifestyle play a decisive role in household energy use patterns. In addition, the research depicts the energy consumption characteristics of rural households with different incomes, ethnic groups and in different regions. The study puts forward corresponding energy saving countermeasures for different energy use pattern, helps to identify the heterogeneity of rural household energy use and promote the formulation of refined regional energy conservation and emission reduction policies. © 2020 by the authors.","Characteristic energy; Energy conservation and emission production; Energy use pattern; Refined management; Rural household","decision making; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; ethnic minority; factor analysis; household energy; pollution policy; rural area; China; Chongqing; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090793918

Land Surface Temperature in the southern part of the city was hotter by ~7-9 °C compared to the northern part due to lack of urban vegetation. Hot spots were found in compact midrise forms (LCZ 2) that are not ideal from the climatological perspective. Whereas compact low-rise forms (LCZ 3) were less heat vulnerable. The results of this study suggest that climatologists can provide planners and architects with scientific insight into the causes of and solutions for urban climatic heat exposure. © 2020 by the authors.","Heat stress; Land Surface Temperature; Local Climatic Zone (LCZ); Urban geometry; Urban Heat Island (UHI)","Land surface temperature; Remote sensing; Climatic variables; Infra-red cameras; Mediterranean cities; Meteorological measurements; Meteorological station; Spatial patterns; Urban heat island; Wall temperatures; Atmospheric temperature; climate variation; environmental stress; geometry; GIS; heat island; land surface; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; surface temperature; urban area; Israel; Mediterranean Region; Tel Aviv",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091855341

Studies show that implementing winter rye cover crops into agricultural systems reduces N loads from subsurface drainage, but its effectiveness in the Mississippi River Basin under expected climate change is uncertain. We used the field-tested Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to estimate drainage N loads, crop yield, and rye growth in central Iowa corn-soybean rotations. RZWQM scenarios included baseline (BL) observed weather (1991-2011) and ambient CO2 with cover crop and no cover crop treatments (BL_CC and BL_NCC). Scenarios also included projected future temperature and precipitation change (2065-2085) from six general circulation models (GCMs) and elevated CO2 with cover crop and no cover crop treatments (CC and NCC). Average annual drainage N loads under NCC, BL_NCC, CC and BL_CC were 63.6, 47.5, 17.0, and 18.9 kg N ha-1. Winter rye cover crop was more effective at reducing drainage N losses under climate change than under baseline conditions (73 and 60% for future and baseline climate), mostly because the projected temperatures and atmospheric CO2 resulted in greater rye growth and crop N uptake. Annual CC drainage N loads were reduced compared with BL_NCC more than the targeted 41% for 18 to 20 years of the 21-year simulation, depending on the GCM. Under projected climate change, average annual simulated crop yield differences between scenarios with and without winter rye were approximately 0.1 Mg ha-1. These results suggest that implementing winter rye cover crop in a corn-soybean rotation effectively addresses the goal of drainage N load reduction under climate change in a northern Mississippi River Basin agricultural system without affecting cash crop production. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Cover crop; Drainage; Hypoxia; Model; Nitrate; RZWQM","baseline conditions; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate prediction; cover crop; crop yield; drainage water; farming system; general circulation model; maize; nitrogen; soybean; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Iowa; Mississippi River; United States; Glycine max; Secale cereale; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091164708

COVID-19 epidemic endow with a unique opportunity to report the degree of air quality improvement due to the nationwide lockdown in 10 most polluted cities across the country. National Air Quality Index (NAQI) based on continuous monitoring records of seven criteria pollutants (i.e. common air pollutants with known health impacts e.g. PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, NH3 and O3) for a total of 59 stations across the cities, satellite image derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and few statistical tools are employed to derive the outcomes. NAQI results convey that 8 cities out of the 10 air quality restored to good to satisfactory category during the lockdown period. Within week+1 of the lockdown period, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations have suppressed below the permissible limit in all cities. CO and NO2 have reduced to about −30% and −57% respectively during the lockdown period. Diurnal concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have dropped drastically on the very 4th day of lockdown and become consistent with minor hourly vacillation. In April 2020 the AOD amount was reduced to about 36% and 18% in contrast to April 2018 and April 2019 respectively. This add-on reporting of the possible recovery extent in air quality may help to guide alternative policy intervention in form of short term lockdown so as to testify whether this type of unconventional policy decisions may be put forward to attain a green environment. Because, despite numerous restoration plans, air pollution levels have risen unabated in these cities. However, detailed inventory needs to be focused on identifying the localized pollution hotspots (i.e. source contribution). © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Aerosol optical depth (AOD); Criterion pollutants; Lockdown; Most polluted cities; National air quality index (NAQI); SARS-CoV-2","air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; pollution exposure; pollution policy; satellite imagery; severe acute respiratory syndrome; viral disease; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution indicator; air quality; ambient air; Article; environmental exposure; health hazard; India; outcome assessment; priority journal; quarantine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; India; pandemic; virus pneumonia; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087488509

Numerous research and field experiments report soil health in terms of physicochemical and biological indicators, and identify different management practices that can improve it. However, the question remains how much of cultivated land has degraded since the dawn of agriculture? What is the maximum or realistically attainable soil health goal? Determination of a benchmark that defines the true magnitude of degradation and simultaneously sets potential soil health goals will optimize efforts in improving soil health using different practices. In this paper, we discuss a new term “Soil Health Gap” that is defined as the difference between soil health in an undisturbed native soil and current soil health in a cropland in a given agroecosystem. Soil Health Gap can be determined based on a general or specific soil property such as soil carbon. Soil organic carbon were measured at native grassland, no-till, conventionally tilled, and subsoil exposed farmlands. Soil Health Gap based on soil organic carbon was in order of no-till < conventional till < subsoil exposed farmland and subsequently, maximum attainable soil health goal with introduction of conservation practices would vary by an existing management practice or condition. Soil Health Gap establishes a benchmark for soil health management decisions and goals and can be scaled up from site-specific to regional to global scale. © 2020 The Authors","Agroecosystems; Benchmark; Soil carbon; Soil health; Soil Health Gap; Soil quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084966039

It is a stepwise tightly regulated process that has been evolved to cope with a wide range of different inflammatory stimuli. However, under certain physiopathological conditions, the inflammatory response overwhelms local regulatory mechanisms and leads to systemic inflammation that, in turn, might affect metabolism in distant tissues and organs. In this sense, as mitochondria are able to perceive signals of inflammation is one of the first organelles to be affected by a dysregulation in the systemic inflammatory response, it has been associated with the progression of the physiopathological mechanisms. Mitochondria are also an important source of ROS (reactive oxygen species) within most mammalian cells and are therefore highly involved in oxidative stress. ROS production might contribute to mitochondrial damage in a range of pathologies and is also important in a complex redox signaling network from the organelle to the rest of the cell. Therefore, a role for ROS generated by mitochondria in regulating inflammatory signaling was postulated and mitochondria have been implicated in multiple aspects of the inflammatory response. An inflammatory condition that affects mitochondrial function in different organs is the exposure to air particulate matter (PM). Both after acute and chronic pollutants exposure, PM uptake by alveolar macrophages have been described to induce local cell activation and recruitment, cytokine release, and pulmonary inflammation. Afterwards, inflammatory mediators have been shown to be able to reach the bloodstream and induce a systemic response that affects metabolism in distant organs different from the lung. In this proinflammatory environment, impaired mitochondrial function that leads to bioenergetic dysfunction and enhanced production of oxidants have been shown to affect tissue homeostasis and organ function. In the present review, we aim to discuss the latest insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that link systemic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in different organs, taking the exposure to air pollutants as a case model. © Copyright © 2020 Magnani, Marchini, Calabró, Alvarez and Evelson.","environmental pollution; inflammation; mitochodria; oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species","cryopyrin; dual oxidase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; mitochondrial DNA; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 3; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 5; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; air pollutant; air pollution; atmospheric particulate matter; bioenergy; blood vessel permeability; cardiopulmonary insufficiency; chemoluminescence; gastrointestinal tract; inflammation; metabolic disorder; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrion; oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; particulate matter; redox signaling; Review; upregulation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092100994

Feasibility is examined in the context of science mission profiles of particular significance in coastal oceanography that require a modern, capable, general-purpose coastal research vessel. These missions translate into the primary Zero-V vessel requirements against which technical feasibility is assessed. Hull form analysis indicated a trimaran design enables a vessel that can meet all of the space and volume requirements as well as for fitment of the machinery, service, and control spaces necessary for operation of the vessel. To meet speed and range (endurance) requirements, the vessel needs to be constructed of aluminum to reduce weight. The beam (56 feet), length (170 feet) and draft (12 feet) of the vessel enable it to dock at all primary ports of call. With 1800 kW of installed proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell power for primary propulsion, the cruising speed is 10 knots. With 10,900 kg of consumable LH2 stored in two LH2 tanks, the range of the vessel is 2400 nautical miles, with an endurance of 15 days. Both the greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant (NOx, HC, PM10) emissions were estimated based on a complete “well-to-waves” (WTW) analysis. Using renewable hydrogen, the annual WTW GHG emissions predicted for the Zero-V are 91.4% less than those from an equivalent vessel running on conventional diesel fuel. Analysis of the WTW criteria pollutant emissions show that hydrogen PEM fuel-cell technology can reduce these emissions below stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 marine diesel engine emissions limits regardless of whether the hydrogen is made using natural gas or renewable methods. The capital construction cost is estimated to be ~ $79 M, not unreasonable when compared to other modern diesel-fueled research vessels of similar size and capabilities. The operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs of the Zero-V were estimated to be 7.7% higher than operating the equivalent diesel-fueled vessel at the assumed fuel prices for LH2 made from steam reforming of fossil natural gas. The approach to safety for the Zero-V is described in terms of the arrangement of hazardous areas on the vessel. Regulatory review of the vessel design by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the Class society DNV GL found no fundamental or “show-stopping” design concerns that would prevent eventual deployment of the Zero-V. Overall, this study found it feasible from technical, regulatory, and economic perspectives to design, build and operate a coastal research vessel powered solely by hydrogen fuel cells. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Coastal research vessel; Hydrogen fuel cell; Hydrogen vessel; Oceanography; Zero-emissions vessel","Cost estimating; Diesel engines; Economic analysis; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Machine design; Marine engineering; Marine pollution; Natural gas; Ships; Steam reforming; Coastal oceanography; Economic feasibilities; Economic perspective; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Marine Diesel Engines; Operations and maintenance; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; United States Coast Guard; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089457320

Although the heat pumping has been found to be crucial in driving oceanic heat transport and thereby regulating climate changes, the contribution of surface cold anomaly to the atmosphere remains unclear. Here we show that local clouds and rainfall are effectively modulated by cold wakes left behind by tropical cyclones using a combination of satellite observations. On average, the negative surface enthalpy flux anomaly associated with the cold wake results in a reduction of rainfall by ~16.6 ± 0.6% (standard error) and a decline of cloud fraction by ~6.7 ± 0.4% over the wake region. Clouds and rainfall tend to be more suppressed for slower moving or stronger TCs. With more intense or slower moving TCs in a warming climate, such a modulation could be amplified accordingly. ©2020.

The ZnCl2 play a crucial role in creating the 3D porous structure which is more beneficial for enhancing specific surface area and exposing sufficient active sites. Anecdotally, the rationally designed catalysts have multifactorial synergistic function of ultra-thin porous NCNS, NCNTS with iron carbide and oxide (Fe3C,Fe2O3). The prepared optimal Fe@N-CNS/CNTS-0.5 revealed catalytic performance with onset potential of 0.983V (vs RHE) and relatively small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1 in 0.1 M KOH solution. More importantly, after 25,000s chronoamperometry, the as-prepared electrocatalyst possessed excellent durability with only 7% current decay surpassing that of the 20% Pt/C (17%), which is also further evaluated in realistic quasi-solidstate flexible Zn-air batteries. As a consequence, this strategy provided a universal approach for future development of the multifunctional cathode catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon nanotubes; Oxygen reduction reaction(ORR); Porous carbon nanosheets; Three-dimensional(3D) structure","Carbides; Carbon nanotubes; Chlorine compounds; Chronoamperometry; Coordination reactions; Costs; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Hematite; Nanosheets; Oxygen; Porous materials; Potassium hydroxide; Precious metals; Zinc air batteries; Zinc chloride; Catalytic performance; Coordination structures; Metal-based catalysts; ORR electrocatalysts; Porous structures; Solid state growth; Threedimensional (3-d); Universal approach; Oxygen reduction reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086511530

Two different aeration intervals designed to maintain the temperature of the compost was in 50–65 °C. The control group and experimental group were set to 10 min–10 min (on-off) and 10 min–30 min (on-off), respectively. The results indicated that the emissions of methane and nitrous oxide from the outside of the membrane in the control group were 9.68% and 47.10% less than those in the experimental group. And the global warming potential was 9.77% less than that in the experimental group. Wilcoxon rank-sum test result indicated that Tenericutes was a significantly different phylum between the two groups and played an important role in cellulose degradation. Redundancy analysis indicated that C/N had the greatest influence on the distribution of the bacterial community. It also found that Pseudogracilibacillus and Tepidimicrobium were significantly correlated with nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emission rates, respectively.

By using different ion-selective membranes, we show nearly identical catalytic selectivity for CO2 reduction, which is primarily due to a similar local reaction environment created at the cathode/electrolyte interface via the introduction of a catholyte layer. In addition, based on a systematic exploration of gases released from electrolytes and the dynamic change of electrolyte speciation, we demonstrate the explicit discrepancy in carbon balance paths for the captured CO2 at the cathode/catholyte interface via reaction with OH- when using different ion-selective membranes: (i) the captured CO2 could be transported through an anion exchange membrane in the form of CO32-, subsequently releasing CO2 along with O2 in the anolyte, and (ii) with a cation exchange membrane, the captured CO2 would be accumulated in the catholyte in the form of CO32-, while (iii) with the use of a bipolar membrane, the captured CO2 could be released at the catholyte/membrane interface in the form of gaseous CO2. The unique carbon balance path for each type of membrane is linked to ion species transported through the membranes.

To identify future low carbon roadmaps of residential buildings, this study is the first to assess the historical carbon mitigation and simulate the energy and emission peaks of China's residential building sector using a dynamic emission scenario. It shows that the emission mitigation of the residential building sector during 2000–2015 is 1.817 (±0.643) billion tons of carbon dioxide (BtCO2), and the normal distribution-based scenario simulation demonstrates that the residential building sector will achieve its carbon emission peak in 2037 (±4) with a peak value of 1.419 (±0.081) BtCO2. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the impacts of floor space per capita and energy intensity of urban residential buildings are the most significant for the uncertainty of emission peaks. A strict energy demand benchmark of the residential building sector suggests a control at 0.661 billion tons of standard coal equivalent (Btce), and its peaking time is estimated for 2035, which is 5 years ahead of the business-as-usual scenario, with energy savings of 0.042 Btce. For the earliest peaking time, if the residential building sector aims to achieve its emission peak before 2030, the emission peak should be controlled at 1.258 BtCO2. Overall, this paper can assist the government in more accurate and feasible building emission mitigation strategies. Moreover, the results provide a more powerful decision-making reference in issuing targeted and feasible strategies for future residential building emission mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon mitigation; Dynamic scenario analysis; Emission mitigation strategy; Energy and emission peaks; Residential building","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Energy conservation; Housing; Normal distribution; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Business-as-usual; Carbon mitigation; Emission mitigation; Emission scenario; Energy and emissions; Residential building; Scenario simulations; Urban residential buildings; Coal industry; benchmarking; building; carbon emission; decision making; historical geography; residential development; residential location; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085999448

We employ contained directional, non-directional, and undesirable inputs and outputs, which include population number, fossil fuels energy consumption, gross capital formation, gross domestic product, renewable energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emission. From the full energy efficiency and ranking of the DDF-DEA approach herein, the empirical results show that Trinidad and Tobago exhibits the best efficiency (2.8194) and Uzbekistan has the worst efficiency (0.5734). The best regional energy performance is Americas, and the worst is Asia for 2010–2016, showing that regional energy policies have a significant impact. The Environmental Performance Index is an important sustainable environment index, and most Environmental Performance Index levels are quite consistent with the trend of energy efficiency and ranking with DDF-DEA in this study. The energy efficiencies of the higher Environmental Performance Index group and higher renewable energy consumption group are significantly larger than the lower Environmental Performance Index group and better than the lower renewable energy consumption group, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that all countries should adjust their future energy using a strategy based on annual Environmental Performance Index. Their goals can be to reduce fossil fuels energy consumption, increase renewable energy use, and reduce undesirable output of carbon dioxide. Doing so will help them to develop their economies while taking into account a sustainable environment, thus achieving sustainable economic development. © The Author(s) 2019.","Directional distance function; energy efficiency; Environmental Performance Index; regional difference","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide emissions; Directional distance function; Environmental performance indices; Gross domestic products; Regional differences; Renewable energy consumption; Sustainable economic development; Sustainable environment; Energy efficiency; alternative energy; comparative study; data envelopment analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy planning; energy use; future prospect; performance assessment; Asia; Central America; Europe; North America; South America; Trinidad and Tobago; Uzbekistan",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074486737

Environmental innovation is considered to be the key to solving economic and environmental problems. Therefore, discussing the impact of environmental innovation on environmental productivity will reveal its economic and environmental effects. This paper measures environmental productivity by value added per unit of pollution emissions (four types of emissions are used) using panel data of 10 Chinese urban agglomerations from 2003 to 2016 to analyze the spatial correlation of environmental productivity, and constructs a spatial panel data model to empirically test the impact of environmental innovation on environmental productivity. It was found that environmental productivity measured by value added per unit of carbon dioxide emissions (gross domestic product (GDP)/CO2) had a significant positive spatial spillover effect, and measured by value added per unit of sulfur dioxide emissions (GDP/SO2), smoke (dust) emissions (GDP/SDE), and industrial sewage emissions (GDP/IS) had a significant negative spatial spillover effect. Environmental innovation has a significant negative inhibitory effect on environmental productivity measured by GDP/SDE and GDP/IS, but no obvious effect measured by GDP/CO2 and GDP/SO2. Control variables such as economic development level, industrial agglomeration, foreign direct investment, and endowment structure factor also show significant differences in environmental productivity measured by value added per unit of pollution emissions. In addition, there are significant differences in direct effects of explanatory variables on environmental productivity of local regions and indirect effects on neighboring regions. These differences are also related to the types of pollution emissions. Therefore, policymakers should set different policies for different types of pollution and encourage different types of environmental innovation, so as to achieve reduced pollution emissions and improved environmental productivity. © 2020 by the authors.

However, fewer studies have determined how increasing temperature affects vegetation patterns in Carex-dominated peatlands. As plants are important determinants of carbon storage potential in peatlands, we aim to determine how climate warming alters plant community composition in peatlands of two different vegetation types. Location: Boreal peatlands in north–central Ontario, Canada. Methods: In a Sphagnum- and a Carex-dominated peatland over two growing seasons, we instigated passive warming using clear open-topped chambers, providing a modest increase (1–2°C) in temperature. In replicated plots we examined shifts in plant community composition using the point intercept method, and total above-ground biomass using Leaf Area Index (LAI) against non-warmed control plots. Results: While there was no difference in species diversity between control and warmed plots in either fen site, warming significantly increased above-ground biomass in the Carex-dominated fen and decreased moss abundance in the Sphagnum-dominated fen. Both fens also displayed significantly different plant community composition between warming and control plots, and increased heterogeneity under warming. Conclusion: Peatlands are important global carbon stores and the plant community contributes to their carbon storage; Sphagnum mosses, in particular, are linked to high peatland carbon storage potential. Previous studies in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands have shown concomitant declines in Sphagnum biomass and increases in vascular plant biomass, and in the short term, we show only a decline in Sphagnum.

Modeling tillage effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is challenging and subject to great uncertainties as the processes producing the emissions are complex and strongly nonlinear. Previous findings have shown deviations between the LPJmL5.0-tillage model (LPJmL: Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) and results from meta-analysis on global estimates of tillage effects on N2O emissions. Here we tested LPJmL5.0-tillage at four different experimental sites across Europe and the USA to verify whether deviations in N2O emissions under different tillage regimes result from a lack of detailed information on agricultural management, the representation of soil water dynamics or both. Model results were compared to observational data and outputs from field-scale DayCent model simulations. DayCent has been successfully applied for the simulation of N2O emissions and provides a richer database for comparison than noncontinuous measurements at experimental sites. We found that adding information on agricultural management improved the simulation of tillage effects on N2O emissions in LPJmL. We also found that LPJmL overestimated N2O emissions and the effects of no-tillage on N2O emissions, whereas DayCent tended to underestimate the emissions of no-tillage treatments. LPJmL showed a general bias to overestimate soil moisture content. Modifications of hydraulic properties in LPJmL in order to match properties assumed in DayCent, as well as of the parameters related to residue cover, improved the overall simulation of soil water and N2O emissions simulated under tillage and no-tillage separately. However, the effects of no-tillage (shifting from tillage to no-tillage) did not improve. Advancing the current state of information on agricultural management and improvements in soil moisture highlights the potential to improve LPJmL5.0-tillage and global estimates of tillage effects on N2O emissions. © 2020 L'Homme et l'Animal, Societe de Recherche Interdisciplinaire (HASRI).

C. sativa has recently seen revived attention due to its high oil content, high omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids, short life cycle, broader regional adaptation, and low-input agronomic requirements. However, abiotic stress such as salinity stress has imposed threatens on plant photosynthesis and growth by reducing water availability or osmotic stress, ion (Na+ and Cl−) toxicity, nutritional disorders and oxidative stress yield. There still remains much to know for the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. In this study, a preliminary study applying 10 C. sativa cultivars to be treated under a gradient NaCl concentrations ranging from 0-250 mM and found that 100 mM was the optimal NaCl concentration to effectively differentiate phenotypic performance among different genotypes. Then, a spring panel consisting of 211 C. sativa accessions were germinated under 100 mM NaCl concentration. Six seedling germination traits, including germination rate at two stages (5-day and 9-day seedling stages), germination index, dry and fresh weight, and dry/fresh ratio, were measured. Significant correlations were found between the germination rate at two stages as well as plant biomass traits. Combining the phenotypic data and previously obtained genotypic data, a total of 17 significant trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the germination rate at the two stages and dry weight were identified from genome-wide association analysis (GWAS). These SNPs are located on putative candidate genes controlling plant root development by synergistically mediating phosphate metabolism, signal transduction and cell membrane activities. These identified SNPs could provide a foundation for future molecular breeding efforts aimed at improved salt tolerance in C. sativa. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

However, such inequality and its dynamic change for recent years have not been systematically studied. In this paper, we evaluate China’s regional inequality in per capita CO2 emissions during 1997–2016 using the Theil index and decompose it into within-region and between-region components based on eight regions. Furthermore, we apply the decomposition analysis to explore the contribution of different factors to such inequality, including the carbonization index, energy intensity, energy structure, labor productivity, and employment rate. The results show that China’s overall inequality in per capita CO2 emissions reduced first and increased thereafter during 1997–2016. Within-region inequality was the main source of overall inequality in 1997–2004, while between-region inequality contributed more during 2005–2016. Labor productivity and energy intensity were the two main drivers of overall inequality, but their contributions to the inequality between regions and within regions were quite different. Moreover, the impact of energy structure and carbonization index on regional inequality in per capita CO2 emissions significantly increased during 2012–2016, which was related to the efforts made by local governments to improve the energy mix. Policy implications were given according to the above conclusions to improve regional inequality in per capita CO2 emissions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Decomposition analysis; Per capita CO2 emissions; Regional inequality; Theil index","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; energy intensity; labor productivity; local government; pollutant source; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; socioeconomics; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086123461

Therefore, it is essential to understand the air pollution characteristics and assess the risks to humans. In this study, we analyzed the pollution characteristics of criteria pollutants in six key cities in northwest China from 2015 to 2018. We used the air quality index (AQI), aggregate AQI (AAQI), and health-risk based AQI (HAQI) to assess the health risks and determine the proportion of people exposed to air pollution. Additionally, on this basis, the AirQ2.2.3 model was used to quantify the health effects of the pollutants. The results showed that PM10 pollution occurred mainly in spring and winter and was caused by frequent dust storms. PM2.5 pollution was caused mainly by anthropogenic activities (especially coal-fired heating in winter). Because of a series of government policies and pollutant reduction measures, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO concentrations showed a downward trend during the study period (except for a small increase in the case of NO2 in some years.). However, O3 showed high concentrations due to the high intensity of solar radiation in summer and inadequate emission reduction measures. The air quality levels based on their classification were generally higher than the Chinese ambient air quality standard classified by the AQI index. We also found that the higher the AQI index was, the more serious the air pollution classified based on the AAQI and HAQI indices was. The HAQI index could better reflect the impact of pollutants on human health. Based on the HAQI index, 20% of the population in the study area was exposed to polluted air. The total mortality values attributable to PM10, PM2.5, SO2, O3, NO2, and CO, quantified by the AirQ2.2.3 model, were 3.00%, 1.02%, 1.00%, 4.22%, 1.57%, and 0.95% (Confidence Interval:95%), respectively; the attributable proportions of mortality for respiratory system and cardiovascular diseases were consistent with the change rule of total mortality, because the number of deaths attributable to the latter was greater than that for the former. According to the exposure reaction curves of pollutants, PM10 and PM2.5 still showed a large change at high concentrations. However, the tendencies of SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 were more obvious under low concentration exposure, which indicated that the expected mortality rate due to lower air pollution concentrations was much higher than the mortality due to high air pollution concentrations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutant; Air quality index; AirQ2.2.3 model; Health risk assessment","carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health risk; mortality; pollution exposure; public health; solar radiation; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; cardiovascular disease; China; city; dust storm; health hazard; human; mortality; particulate matter; respiratory tract disease; solar radiation; spring; summer; winter; air pollutant; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084986810

Considering that the aggregation of the power sector from different sources in input-output (IO) tables will lead to the “aggregation bias problem”, it is vital that we disaggregate the power sector using IO tables when analyzing and comparing the driving forces of embodied carbon emission changes in the power sector. This paper first disaggregates the power sector into seven subsectors; then, it uses structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to analyze the driving forces of embodied carbon emission changes in each subsector and allocates embodied emissions that occur from 2007 to 2015 according to the demand categories. The results show that the embodied carbon emissions from each clean energy sector were relatively lower than those from thermal power during the study period. Consumption volume was the main driving factor for the embodied carbon emission increments. From 2012 to 2015, the production structure was mainly responsible for the embodied emission increases in each clean energy sector, indicating that the embodied carbon emissions caused by power equipment updates or reconstruction processes should receive more attention. In addition, the embodied carbon emission changes induced by urban residential consumption on the thermal power showed a plateaued trend from 2007 to 2015. This paper provides support for the formulation of emission reduction measures and the low-carbon structural transformation of the power sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; China; Disaggregation; Input-output analysis; Power sector; Structural decomposition analysis","Emission control; Emission reduction strategy; Energy transitions; Input output model; Production structures; Reconstruction process; Residential consumption; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Structural transformation; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084954785

The authors examine recent literature on the environmental and social networks that surround animal/human dynamics, and some recent methodologies for the study of these dynamics. Additionally, they review the concept of ecosystem services, their valuation and sources of uncertainty. In 2008 the governors of California, Oregon and Washington formed the Pacific Coast Collaborative, which the province of British Columbia also joined, with the purpose of taking a regional approach to issues such as climate change, environmental protection, and trade. Because the plan relies on public support and participation to achieve the goals of reducing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, an analysis of public beliefs about climate change is presented. The authors describe and analyze the evolution of Québec's higher education policies from the Parent Reform to the present day. While the structure of higher education introduced between 1960 and 1970 remains almost unchanged to this day, the public policies defining and framing its role have evolved.

The consequences of climate change on plant phenology have been widely investigated during the last few years. However, the underlying causes of the timing of autumn phenology have not been fully clarified yet. Here, we focused on the onset (10%) of leaf colouring—LCO—(Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie (BBCH) 92) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica, L.) as an important native tree species growing throughout Europe. Studied beech stands are located along the natural distribution range of the European beech in Western Carpathians (Slovakia) at different altitudes from lowlands (300 m a.s.l.) to uplands (1050 m a.s.l.) and climatic regions from warm to cold. To define limiting climate conditions for LCO, we established several bioclimatic indices as indicators of meteorological drought: climatic water balance (CWB), standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), dry period index (DPI), and heat waves (HW). In addition, meteorological variables such as monthly mean temperatures and precipitation totals were taken into account. Throughout the 23-year period (1996–2018) of ground-based phenological observations of temperate beech forests, the timing of LCO was significantly delayed (p ≤ 0.05) in the middle to high altitudes, while in the lowest altitude, it remained unchanged. Over the last decade, 2009–2018, LCO in middle altitudes started at comparable to low altitudes and, at several years, even later. This resulted mainly from the significant negative effect of drought prior to this phenological phase (p ≤ 0.01) expressed through a 1-month SPI in September (SPIIX) at the stand at the low-altitude and warm-climatic region. Our results indicate that the meteorological drought conditioned by lower total precipitation and higher evapotranspirative demands in the warmer climate advance leaf senescence. However, at present time, growth in rising temperature and precipitation is acceptable for most beech stands at middle to high altitudes. Beech utilizes these conditions and postpones the LCO by 0.3–0.5 and 0.6–1.2 day per year at high and middle altitudes, respectively. Although we show the commencing negative effect of drought at mid-altitudes with lower (below 700 mm) total annual precipitation, the trend of LCO in favourable warm climates is still significantly delayed. The ongoing warming trend of summer months suggests further intensification of drought as has started to occur in middle altitudes, spreading from the continual increase of evapotranspiration over the next decades. © 2020 by the authors.

Mitigation actions through land management, such as cover crops in agricultural soils, are often evaluated in terms of their carbon sequestration potential, while radiative forcing related to surface albedo changes is often ignored. The aim of this study was to assess the mitigation potential of cover crops, both as changes in biogenic greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and N2O) and albedo-driven radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). To achieve this, we have integrated a biogeochemistry model framework running on approximately 8000 locations across the European Union with detailed soil data, supplemented with time series of albedo measurements derived from satellite remote sensing. We found that carbon sequestration remained the dominant mitigation effect, with 1th and 3rd interquartile of 5.2-17.0 Mg CO2e ha-1 at 2050, and negligible changes in N2O emissions over that time-horizon. Cover crops were generally brighter than bare soils, hence, the reflected shortwave radiation at TOA ranged between 0.08-0.22 Wm-2 on average, broadly equivalent to a removal of 0.8-3.9 Mg CO2e ha-1. Through scenarios analysis, we further showed how the mitigation potential could be substantially increased by growing a high albedo chlorophyll-deficient cover crop. This radiative land management option has an additional benefit of providing its mitigation effect more rapidly than carbon sequestration, although additional studies might be warranted to evaluate local and non-local associated climatic effects, such as changes in patterns of surface temperature and precipitation. © 2020 The Author(s).

The local pH on the cathode surface is 7.2, and the HCO3- concentration profile extends a distance of 120 μm into the electrolyte, which verifies that the nominal overpotential reduction from using alkaline electrolyte originates from the Nernst potential of the pH gradient layer at the cathode/electrolyte interface.

Such an interface was constructed by adhering ternary Na electrodes containing 3 wt % MoS2 and 3 wt % carbon on BASE and reducing contact angles of molten Na to ∼45°. The ternary Na electrodes exhibited twice improved elasticity for flexible deformation and intimate solid contact, whereas NaxMoS2 and carbon synergistically provide durable ionic/electronic diffusion paths, which effectively resist premature interface failure due to loss of contact and improved Na stripping utilization to over 90%. Na metal hosted via triple junctions exhibited much smaller charge-transfer resistance and 200 h of stable cycling.

Conventional high-quality DW imaging relies on the coherent compounding of multiple consecutive steered emissions, which in turn reduces the gain in frame rate. Reconstructing high-quality US images for ultrafast imaging using deep learning techniques has recently raised a growing interest in the US community. We recently described a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called ID-Net, which exploited an inception layer devoted to the reconstruction of DW ultrasound images using radio frequency (RF) data. We derive in this work the complex equivalent of this network, i.e., the complex inception for DW network (CID-Net), operating on in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) data. We experimentally demonstrate that the CID-Net yields the same image quality as that obtained from the RF-trained CNN, i.e., using only three I/Q images, the CID-Net yields high-quality images competing with those obtained by coherently compounding 31 RF images. © 2020 IEEE.","Complex convolutional neural networks (CCNNs); Deep learning; Diverging wave; Image reconstruction; Ultrasound imaging","Complex networks; Convolution; Deep learning; Image reconstruction; Multilayer neural networks; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Ultrasonics; High frame rate; High quality images; In-phase/quadrature; Learning techniques; Low qualities; Radio-frequency datum; Ultrafast imaging; Ultrasound images; Convolutional neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097883612

COnstructing Proxy Records from Age Models (COPRA) software was used to produce Bayesian age models for those speleothems. The new age modelling helped us examine Late Quaternary temporal coverage for the national speleothem network, and also supported our exploration of three different isotope master record generation techniques using Holocene δ18O data from Waitomo. We then applied the output from one of the isotope master record techniques to test an application case of how climate transfer functions can be developed using climate model simulated temperatures. Our results suggest Holocene δ18O trends at Waitomo capture air temperature variations weighted toward the primary season of soil moisture (and epikarst) recharge during winter. This interpretation is consistent with the latest monitoring data from the Waitomo region. Holocene δ18O millennial-scale trends and centennial-scale variability at Waitomo likely reflect atmospheric circulation patterns that concomitantly vary with surface water temperature and the isotopic composition of the Tasman Sea. A climate model simulation context for the Holocene millennial-scale trends in the Waitomo δ18O isotope master record suggest that site is sensitive to changes in the subtropical front (STF) and the Tasman Front. Our comparison of isotope master record techniques using Waitomo δ18O data indicate that caution is needed prior to merging δ18O data series from different caves in order to avoid time series artefacts. Future work should incorporate more high-resolution cave monitoring and climate calibration studies, and develop new speleothem data from northern and eastern regions of the country. © 2020 by the authors.

Representative isolates of each family were characterized based on colony and conidial morphology, optimum growth temperature, and the comparison of DNA sequence data (ITS, LSU, EF, TUB2, and ACT genomic regions). Detached and attached shoots, and attached panicles of pistachio cv. Kerman were inoculated with mycelial plugs or conidial suspensions to demonstrate the pathogenicity of the selected isolates. Botryosphaeria dothidea, Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae, Neofusicoccum mediterraneum, N. parvum, Diaporthe neotheicola, Diaporthe sp., Eutypa lata, Eutypa sp., Cytospora sp., and Phaeoacremonium minimum were identified. P. minimum had the highest optimum growth temperature (29.6 °C) and Cytospora sp. the lowest (21–22 °C). Botryosphaeriaceae isolates showed the largest lesions on inoculated shoots, with L. pseudotheobromae being the most aggressive, followed by Neofusicoccum species. Panicles inoculated with N. mediterraneum showed blight symptoms and canker formation 6 weeks after inoculation, without significant differences in aggressiveness between isolates.

In this analysis column emission rates of the OH Meinel (6–2) and O2 Atmospheric (0–1) bands, as well as rotational temperatures derived from these emission rates are employed for the period of 1998–2015. The long time series allows the determination of gravity waves climatology at this site. The gravity wave activity content exhibits an annual variability with a maximum during winter and a faint increase in summer. It was found that gravity waves with periods of less than 3h are more prevalent than those with periods of 3–6h throughout the year, for both column emission rates and rotational temperatures. The gravity wave activity with periods of less than 3h is larger in summer, while gravity waves with period from 3 to 6 h have maximum activity around autumn-winter. The analysis showed that the gravity waves activity surpassed that of the semidiurnal tides, although was still smaller than the planetary wave activity, especially in summer when the planetary waves appear to dominate the dynamics of the MLT region. In general, wave activity is the main source of variability in both OH and O2 airglow emissions with the planetary wave activity being the main driver of the O2 emission variability. However, the rotational temperatures are more affected by seasonal variations, especially the OH rotational temperatures, accounting for more than the 40% of the overall observed variability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric composition and structure (airglow and aurora; Density and temperature)- meteorology and atmospheric dynamics (waves and tides); Pressure","Gravity waves; Ionosphere; Airglow emissions; Annual variability; Long time series; Mesosphere/lower thermospheres; Middle atmosphere; Planetary wave activity; Rotational temperature; Seasonal variation; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085842097

We explore the nonlinear response to orbital forcing and then consider climate millennial variability down to daily weather events. Orbital changes are translated into regional responses in temperature, where the precessional response is related to nonlinearities and seasonal biases in the system. We question regularities found in climate events by analyzing the distribution of interevent waiting times. Periodicities of about 900 and 1,150 yr are found in ice cores besides the prominent 1,500 yr cycle. However, the variability remains indistinguishable from a random process, suggesting that centennial-to-millennial variability is stochastic in nature. New numerical techniques are developed allowing for a high resolution in the dynamically relevant regions like coasts, major upwelling regions, and high latitudes. Using this model, we find a strong sensitivity of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation depending on where the deglacial meltwater is injected into. Meltwater into the Mississippi and near Labrador hardly affect the large-scale ocean circulation, whereas subpolar hosing mimicking icebergs yields a quasi shutdown. The same multiscale approach is applied to radiocarbon simulations enabling a dynamical interpretation of marine sediment cores. Finally, abrupt climate events also have counterparts in the recent climate records, revealing a close link between climate variability, the statistics of North Atlantic weather patterns, and extreme events. ©2020.

However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in urban areas underlying land surface temperature are still being understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to design strategies that mitigate land temperatures in our cities. Using the recently available night-time moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery and employing advanced nonlinear statistical models, we seek to answer the question “What is the influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on land surface temperature, during both the day and night?” To answer this question, we analyze urban land surface temperature in four cities across the United States. We devise techniques for training and validating nonlinear statistical models on geostatistical data and use these models to assess the interdependent effects of urban characteristics on urban surface temperature. Our results suggest that vegetation and impervious surfaces are the most important urban characteristics associated with land surface temperature. While this may be expected, this is the first study to quantify this relationship for Landsat-resolution nighttime temperature estimates. Our results also demonstrate the potential for using nonlinear statistical analysis to investigate land surface temperature and its relationships with urban characteristics. Improved understanding of these relationships influencing both night and day land surface temperature will assist planners undertaking climate change adaptation and heat wave mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Convolutional neural network; Geospatial machine learning; Land surface temperature; LandSat; Spatial random forest; Urban canyon","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Satellite imagery; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Climate change adaptation; Geostatistical data; Impervious surface; Moderate resolution; Nighttime temperatures; Urban characteristics; Urban land surface temperature; Urban surface temperature; Land surface temperature; complexity; heat island; heat wave; land surface; mitigation; model validation; nonlinearity; remote sensing; satellite imagery; surface temperature; training; urban area; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085657272

The value of pH and chemical oxygen demand, the content of total solid and volatile solid, volatile fatty acids concentration, coenzyme F420 concentration, and microbial community analysis were investigated during the anaerobic digestion process. The PAN-NH2 system had the highest removal efficiency of the pollutants and regulated the pH of the system better than other systems.

A control-oriented model of HEV and catalyst is developed, which captures the dynamics of the battery state of charge and catalyst temperature. The energy and thermal management problem is cast as a hybrid optimal control problem, to minimize entire trip fuel consumption under different switching (warm-up) times. An off-line solution method is designed to exploit the tradeoff between fuel and warm-up time based upon hybrid minimum principle and a nested shooting algorithm. For online implementation, a distributed supervisory control is proposed, which covers both cold-start and normal operations, and is compatible with the equivalent consumption minimization strategy. Both off-line and online methods are validated in simulation, using two driving cycles and five warm-up speeds. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","After-treatment warm-up; energy management; equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS); hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); hybrid optimal control","Battery management systems; Catalysts; Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Diesel engines; Distributed parameter control systems; Fuel economy; Fuels; Optimal control systems; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Battery state of charge; Control oriented models; Cost-effective solutions; Electrically heated catalysts; Hybrid optimal control; Online implementation; Thermal management problems; Thermal management systems; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087061107

Therefore, assessing the role of ecological restoration policies in desertification is extremely urgent, especially quantified policies contribution. Here, we quantify the desertification process in the Mu Us Desert (China) from 1986 to 2015 based on remote sensing images, and using panel data analysis to assess the relative roles of climate, socioeconomic development and ecological restoration as drivers of these dynamics based on meteorological record, socioeconomic statistics and input funds of ecological restoration projects. We found (1) that, between 1986 and 2015, desertification of the Mu Us Desert initially intensified, but then declined, with maximum desertification in 2005, and (2) that, ecological restoration policies represent the dominant factor underlying the mitigation of desertification (60.9%), with a smaller, negative role of socioeconomic development (37.2%) and low impact of climate (1.8%). (3) There was obvious spatial heterogeneity in desertification process, with varying patterns among the three provinces (Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Ningxia): Desertification in Inner Mongolia experienced two episodes of intensification and reversals, with the strongest desertification in 1990 and 2005, while it peaked in Shaanxi and Ningxia in 2000 and 2005, respectively, with recovery in the following years. (4) Considerable differences are observed in the three driving factors affecting the desertification dynamics at the provincial scale, with socioeconomic factors (36.4%) accounting for a slightly higher contribution than ecological restoration policies (34.8%) and climate factors (28.9%) in Inner Mongolia. The reversal of desertification has mainly driven by ecological restoration policies in Shaanxi (55.8%) and climatic factors in Ningxia (44.1%).

Compared with the emission of normal c-plane multiple quantum wells (C-MQWs), the emission of C-MQWs close to V-shaped pits (V-pits) exhibits a shoulder peak phenomenon at cryogenic temperature, and the shoulder peak gradually disappears as the temperature increases. At room temperature, the peak of C-MQWs close to V-pits (C2) exhibits a red-shift. The formation of V-pits would induce strain relaxation. Strain relaxation can result in Indium (In) incorporation and localization, and reduced quantum-confined stark effects (QCSE). In incorporation and localization can lead to the red-shift of C2, reduced QCSE can cause the blue-shift of C2. Therefore, the red-shift of C2 arises from further In incorporation and localization of C-MQWs. It is worth noting that In incorporation and localization is dominant in the formation of V-pits for green InGaN/GaN C-MQWs. Additionally, the carriers limited in sidewall MQWs (S-MQWs) of V-pits escape into C-MQWs close to V-pits can mitigate the common phenomenon in which the emission intensity of C-MQWs decreases as the temperature increases, which helps improve the emission intensity of GaN-based green LEDs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carrier transport; InGaN/GaN multiple Quantum wells; LED; V-shaped pits","Blue shift; Doppler effect; Gallium nitride; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; III-V semiconductors; Light emitting diodes; Red Shift; Strain relaxation; Cryogenic temperatures; Emission intensity; Green light emitting diodes; Micro photoluminescence; Quantum-confined Stark effect; Shoulder peaks; Temperature dependent; Temperature increase; Semiconductor quantum wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086629840

The W-Mo mineralization occurs as veins and stock-works mainly hosted in the granodiorite porphyry, monzogranite porphyry, biotite granite porphyry, and surrounding schist. Four types of fluid inclusions (FIs) including PC-type (pure vapor CO2), C-type (CO2-H2O), W-type (aqueous two-phase) and L-type (pure liquid H2O) FIs have been identified from Stage I quartz-scheelite ± alkaline feldspar veins, Stage II (including three sub-stages) quartz-molybdenite ± pyrite ± chalcopyrite veins, and Stage III quartz ± calcite ± pyrite veins. The total homogenization temperatures of FIs vary widely (187–437 °C) with multiple peaks, indicating multistage fluid activities. The ore-forming fluids of the main mineralization stages are characterized by CO2 enrichment, high-medium temperature (~270–440 °C), and medium–low salinity (2.4–14.4 wt% NaCl equiv.). The homogenization temperature of W-type inclusions is obviously higher than that of C-type inclusions, and the salinity is relatively lower, implying multiple immiscibility of fluids with continuous escape of CO2. H-O isotopic compositions suggest that the primary ore-forming fluids dominantly originated from magma water. Mo concentrations and δEu values in scheelite indicate a decreasing trend of redox state of ore fluids. From Stage I to Stage II to Stage III, the relatively higher-temperature, CO2-rich, and oxidized fluids gradually evolved into relatively lower-temperature, CO2-poor, and reduced fluids. Here we propose that the decrease of temperature and oxygen fugacity and increase of S2- activity and PH values of the ore fluids caused by continuous fluid-rock interaction and loss of CO2 could account for the successive mineralization of W and Mo at the Larong deposit. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Continental collision setting; Eastern Tibet; Fluid inclusions; H-O isotopes; Larong W-(Mo) deposit; Scheelite geochemistry","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Deposits; Feldspar; Isotopes; Mica; Mineralogy; Molybdenum; Molybdenum alloys; Molybdenum compounds; Quartz; Sodium chloride; Tungstate minerals; Aqueous two phase; Fluid-rock interaction; Homogenization temperatures; Isotopic composition; Lower temperatures; Medium temperature; Metallogenic belt; Ore-forming fluid; Ores; fluid inclusion; geochemistry; hydrogen isotope; mineralization; molybdenum; ore deposit; ore-forming fluid; oxygen isotope; porphyry; scheelite; tungsten; China; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086046494

This study aims to develop an intersection energy consumption and emissions model framework with an embedded SPS to analyse the impacts of the SPS on the intersection. To validate this model framework, an intersection in Shenzhen, China was selected for simulation as a case study. In this study, we compared the effects of an active SPS, a real-time SPS and the real-time SPS improved under Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperation System (i-VICS) on the energy consumption and emissions of the targeted intersection. The simulation results illustrate that, the active strategy could decrease fuel consumption and emissions with a maximum reduction of 13.33% in fuel consumption, and the real-time strategy maintains a smooth fluctuation in the total fuel consumption and emissions during the entire period. Compared with the two in-use strategies, the i-VICS-based transit priority strategy demonstrates the best environmental performance, by reducing the greatest negative environmental influences and cutting down the most emissions of nearly 28.86% in the case study.

Passenger transport operators are being encouraged to replace traditional buses with electric buses, to increase their use in urban transportation. Reduced energy consumption and operating costs are important operational benefits for passenger transport operators, and driving behavior has a significant impact on fuel consumption. Although many literatures or real-world systems have addressed the issues related to reducing energy consumption with electric buses, these works do not involve the records collected from an on-vehicle battery management system (BMS). Accordingly, the results of analyses of existing works lack in-depth discussions, and therefore the applicability of existing works is insignificant. Therefore, in this study, driving data were collected using a battery management system (BMS), and vehicular power consumption was classified according to energy efficiency. Then, decision trees and random forest were applied to construct energy consumption analytical models. Finally, the driving behaviors that influence energy consumption were investigated. A case study was conducted in which a Taichung passenger transport operator's electric bus driving data on urban routes were collected to construct energy consumption analytical models. The data consisted of two parts, i.e., vehicle records and route records. On the basis of these records, we considered the practicability and applicability of the analytical models by transforming the unstructured records into raw data.

High selenium concentration (30–120 mg/L) decreased methane yield by 23.1–100% and methane production rate by 1.3–100% owing to the reduced hydrolytic enzyme and F420 activities at initial phase of anaerobic digestion. Meanwhile, the inhibited activity of methane production could be completely recovered through a successive supplementing organic matter for selenite reduction. Besides, selenite addition also altered the relative abundance of hydrolytic and acetogenic bacteria, and increased the relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogen. These results suggested that the inhibited methane production was owing to the fact that the selenite-reducing microorganism competes with methane-producing microorganism for H2 and acetate, but selenite might not directly inhibit methane-producing microorganism. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Anaerobic digestion; Inhibition; Microbial community; Pig manure; Selenite","Fertilizers; Mammals; Manures; Methane; Microorganisms; Selenium; Acetoclastic methanogens; Acetogenic bacteria; Mesophilic anaerobic digestion; Methane production; Microbial communities; Process performance; Relative abundance; Selenium concentrations; Anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion; bioremediation; concentration (composition); enzyme; hydrolysis; inhibition; manure; methane; microbial community; organic matter; pig; selenite; selenium; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085102607

As a relatively clean fuel, ethanol gasoline can significantly reduce the emission of harmful substances in automobile exhaust. Compared with ordinary gasoline, it has the advantages of high octane number, good antiknock performance and high oxygen content. But it also has disadvantages such as low combustion heat value, large latent heat of evaporation, corrosion to metals, poor and compatibility with some engine materials, etc. The three factors affecting the development of ethanol gasoline are resources, technology and economic benefits. Although China is the third largest ethanol production and consumption country in the world, its resource conditions are not as good as those of the United States and Brazil. Under the current market and industrial policy environment, the overall benefits of domestic fuel ethanol production enterprises are poor.

Traditional ways to improve the electrochemical kinetics for A-HER catalysts have been focusing on surface modification, which still can not meet the demanding requirements for practical water electrolysis because of catalyst surface deactivation. Herein, we report an interior modification strategy to significantly boost the A-HER performance. Specifically, a trace amount of Pt was doped in the interior Co2P (Pt-Co2P) to introduce a stronger dopant-host interaction than that of the surface-modified catalyst. Consequently, the local chemical state and electronic structure of the catalysts were adjusted to improve the electron mobility and reduce the energy barriers for hydrogen adsorption and H-H bond formation. As a proof-of-concept, the interior-modified Pt-Co2P shows a reduced onset potential at near-zero volts for the A-HER, low overpotentials of 2 mV and 58 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm-2, and excellent durability for long-term utilization. The interior-modified Pt-Co2P delivers superior A-HER performance to Pt/C and other state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. This work will open a new avenue for A-HER catalyst design.

First, this paper takes public environmental petitions as an estimated variable, the influence of economic factors and environmental factors on it is discussed. Secondly, we also analyzed whether the degree of public participation can effectively reduce the scale of pollution emissions by taking local sulfur dioxide and industrial soot emissions as explained variables. This paper uses Poisson regression and Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression to explore the influence of each explanatory variable on the environmental public participation. The empirical results show that economic development will stimulate the demand for environment when personal income and wealth are improved. Local investment in coastal environmental construction will guarantee or improve the coastal environmental quality, which will not only reduce people's attention to environmental problems, but also reduce the scale of coastal environmental pollution emissions. Secondly, with the increase of public participation, the public's demand for environmental improvement will bring pressure to government departments, thus stimulating economic activities to prevent and control pollution. © 2020 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc..

Cr migrates to the environment through stack emissions and can leach out from solid coal-burning byproducts, thereby causing adverse effects on the ecosystem. In this study, atmospheric emissions of Cr from six coal-fired power plants (CFPPs), as well as the distribution of Cr inside these CFPPs in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, were investigated. Among the six CFPPs, one was a circulating fluidized bed boiler and the others were pulverized coal boilers. The results showed that Cr in the feed fuel of these CFPPs ranged from 39.5 to 101.5 mg·kg-1 (average: 68.0 ± 24.8 mg·kg-1) and was approximately four times higher than the national and global average. Cr in the feed fuel correlated significantly with the ash yield, demonstrating that Cr in coal is closely associated with ash-forming minerals. After the coal combustion and the treatment by different air pollution control devices, most Cr (&gt;92%) in the installation was retained in the captured fly ash and bottom ash, with less as gypsum (0.69-7.94%); eventually, only 0.01-0.03% of Cr was emitted into the atmosphere with a concentration of 1.4-2.2 μg·Nm-3. The atmospheric emission factors of Cr for these utility boilers were as low as 14.86 ± 3.62 mg Cr·t-1 coal, 7.72 ± 2.53 μg Cr (kW·h)-1, and 0.70 ± 0.19 g Cr·TJ-1, respectively. About 981 kg·y-1 of Cr was discharged into the atmosphere from Guizhuo's CFPPs in 2017, much lower than previous reported values. Most of the Cr in the CFPPs ended up in solid combustion products, identifying the need for the careful disposal of high-Cr-containing ashes (up to 500 mg·kg-1) to prevent possible mobilization into the environment. © 2020 by the authors.","Atmospheric emissions; Chromium; Coal-fired power plants; Control efficiency","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air pollution control equipment; Ash handling; Atmospheric spectra; Coal; Coal byproducts; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal industry; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Fly ash; Fossil fuel power plants; Pulverized fuel fired boilers; Air pollution control devices; Atmospheric emission; Atmospheric pollutants; Circulating fluidized bed boiler; Coal-fired power plant; Environmentally sensitive elements; Guizhou Province; Pulverized coal boilers; Coal combustion; atmospheric pollution; burning; chromium; coal combustion; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); source apportionment; China; Guizhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091816507

In this study, we took the Haihe River Basin in China as a case study area, as it is highly populated and experienced rapid urbanization from 2000-2015. We investigated how land use and cover change (LUCC) was driven by urban land development affects land-climate dynamics. From 2000-2015, we collected data from the land use and cover database, the remote sensing database of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) series, and the meteorological database to process and generate regional datasets for LUCC maps. We organized data by years aligned with the selected indicators of land surface, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), albedo, and land surface temperature (LST), as well as of regional climate, cloud water content (CWC), and precipitation (P). The assembled datasets were processed to perform statistical analysis and conduct structural equation modelling (SEM). Based on eco-climatology principles and the biophysical process in the land-climate dynamics, we made assumptions on how the indicators connected to each other. Moreover, we testified and quantified them in SEM. LUCC results found that from 2000-2015 the urban area proportion increased by 214% (2.20-6.91%), while the agricultural land decreased by 7.2% (53.05-49.25%) and the forest increased by 4.3% (10.02-10.45%), respectively. This demonstrated how cropland intensification and afforestation happened in the urbanizing basin. SEM results showed that the forest had both positive and negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. The agricultural land, grassland, and shrub had indirect effects on the P via different biophysical functions of LST. The overall effects of urbanization on regional precipitation was positive (pathway correlation coefficient = 0.25). The interpretation of how urbanization drives LUCC and alters regional climate were herein discussed in different aspects of socioeconomic development, biophysical processes, and urbanization-related atmospheric effects. We provided suggestions for further possible research on monitoring and assessment, putting forth recommendations to advance sustainability via land planning and management, including agricultural land conservation, paying more attention to the quality growth of forest rather than the merely area expansion, integrating the interdisciplinary approach, and assessing climatic risk for extreme precipitation and urban flooding. ©","Albedo; Cloud; Land surface temperature; Land use and cover change (LUCC); Land-climate; NDVI; Precipitation; Structural equation model (SEM); Urbanization","Agricultural robots; Biophysics; Conservation; Database systems; Digital storage; Dynamics; Economic and social effects; Economics; Land surface temperature; Land use; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiometers; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Surface measurement; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Watersheds; Correlation coefficient; Land use and cover change; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Monitoring and assessment; Normalized difference vegetation index; Positive and negative effect; Socio-economic development; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091338425

We statistically disaggregated city-level sectoral CO2 emissions to districts of Beijing during 2004–2013 and examined the impact factors using an extended STIRPAT model. Results revealed that CO2 emissions decreased in manufacturing sector, while increased in residential and transportation sectors, which were promising fields for emissions reduction. Spatial dynamics of district-level CO2 emissions indicated that industrial carbon reduction should focus on not only core urban area but also the new merged hotspot districts. The impact estimations indicating by elastic coefficients revealed that population size (0.6, 0.49, 1.06), GDP per capita (0.63, 0.56, 0.8), energy intensity (0.93, 0.86, 0.96) and secondary industrialization level (0.36, 0.8, 0.88) can lead to increase in total, industrial and transportation CO2 emissions, while urban land area size (−0.47, −0.24, −0.81) exerted negative effects on them. In addition, private vehicle ownership (0.45) positively affect transportation CO2 emissions. Residential CO2 emissions were positively influenced by urban land area size (0.44), urbanization level (0.18), population density (0.49) and private vehicle ownership (0.11).

The detailed phase transformations and microstructural evolution mechanisms during antimony extraction and sulfur fixation process were investigated. The results show that stibnite (Sb2S3) can quickly transform to senarmontite (Sb2O3) in the presence of Fe2O3 and Na2CO3, and then Sb2O3 will be continuously reduced into metallic Sb. Sulfur in Sb2S3 was conserved as FeS and Na2SxOy (Na2S, Na2SO4 and/or Na2S2O3). As a result, sulfur was immobilized and recycled in the solid state resource, instead of emitting SO2 gas. Laboratory-scale batch experiments employed pyrite cinder as sulfur-fixing agent indicate that more than 92.6% of antimony can be extracted and recovered by one step conversion from stibnite at 1123 K (850 °C) by this new technique. 97.3% of sulfur was fixed and converted to sulfide as matte and sulfate. In other words, SO2 emissions were reduced by 97.3%. By-product elemental sulfur was produced after the water-leaching step, and finally producing industrial H2SO4. Iron contained in pyrite cinder waste will also be recycled.

Tailoring their structure and electronic properties is crucial for the design of high-performance TiO2 catalysts. Herein, we report a strategy to significantly enhance the performance of TiO2 in the photothermocatalytic reduction of CO2 by doping high crystalline nano-TiO2 with tungsten. A variety of tungsten doping concentrations ranging from 2% to 10% were tested and they all showed enhanced catalytic activities. The 4% W-doped TiO2 exhibited the highest activity, which was 3.5 times greater than that of the undoped TiO2 reference. Structural characterization of these W-doped TiO2 catalysts indicated that W was successfully doped into the TiO2 lattice at relatively low dopant concentration. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy at both the W L3- and Ti K-edges was further used to provide insight into the local structure and bonding properties of the catalysts. It was found that the replacement of Ti with W led to the formation of Ti vacancies in order to maintain the charge neutrality. Consequently, dangling oxygen and oxygen vacancies were produced that acted as catalytically active sites for the CO2 reduction. As the W doping concentration increased from 2% to 4%, more such active sites were generated which thus resulted in the enhancement of the catalytic activity. When the W doping concentration was further increased to 10%, the extra W species that cannot replace the Ti in the lattice aggregated to form WO3. Due to the lower conduction band of WO3, the catalytic O sites were deactivated and CO2 reduction was inhibited.

The People's Government of Beijing Municipality has adopted a package of measures to control the haze pollution with its best efforts. To objectively evaluate how effective these haze pollution control measures are from different perspectives and in an all-round way, it is necessary to adopt a scientific and reasonable approach. Based on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) idea, we establish a system of indexes to evaluate the government performance of Beijing in haze pollution control from the four perspectives of development quality, public services, government management and development potential, and use a combination of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy weight method (EWM) to determine the index weights, and objectively evaluate Beijing's performance in haze pollution control from 2010 to 2016. The results show that the scores for the four perspectives are all on the rise, and since the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in 2013, the government's haze pollution control measures have achieved significant results, and made a much higher overall score. On that basis, we propose the optimized path for Beijing's haze pollution control, namely, accelerating the upgrading of development quality, improving the public services level, strengthening the government management, tapping the development potential of haze pollution control and increasing the linkage and cooperation between the governments of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Balanced Scorecard; Beijing; government performance evaluation; Haze pollution control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100476027

However, the low sulfur loading, shuttling effect in electrolyte, and poor cycling stability limit their applications. Herein, molybdenum carbide nanocrystals embedded carbon nanofibers (Mo2C@CFs: MCCFs) hybrid membrane was prepared in situ on CFs membrane based on carbonthermal reduction of ammonium molybdate. The fibrous MCCFs network is used as the current collector with Li2S6 catholyte solution for Li-S batteries, which inhibits the shuttle effect and accelerates kinetics redox reaction. In addition, Mo2C, as electrocatalyst, promotes nucleation of Li2S of the MCCFs substance, which can reduce polarization and increase the specific capacity. As a result, the free-standing MCCFs@Li2S6 electrode (sulfur loading: 4.74 mg) shows a capacity of 977 mAh g−1 and maintains at 828 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C over 250 cycles, and indicates excellent reversibility and cycling stability. Even with sulfur loading as high as 7.11 mg, the MCCF@Li2S6 electrode exhibits an extremely high capacity of 5.75 mAh. Meanwhile, the Mo2C modified CFs can be effectively retarding the self-discharge behavior by trapping the polysulfides. Furthermore, the stability improvement of lithium anode state by effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfide, played an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performance. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","electrocatalyst; free-standing; lithium-sulfur batteries; Mo2C/CFs membrane; self-discharge; shuttle effect","Carbides; Carbon nanofibers; Electric discharges; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Lithium sulfur batteries; Molybdenum compounds; Nanocrystals; Polysulfides; Reaction kinetics; Redox reactions; Ammonium molybdate; Carbon-thermal reduction; Electrochemical performance; Focus of researches; Modified carbon nanofibers; Molybdenum carbide; Specific capacities; Stability improvement; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087319910

Primary reference fuels (PRF) comprising iso-octane and n-heptane are the simplest gasoline surrogates. C4 hydrocarbons: butane isomers (n-butane and isobutane), butene isomers (1-butene, 2-butene and isobutene) and 1,3-butadiene are the smallest hydrocarbons with isomeric, saturated, unsaturated and conjugated bond structures, which makes them good candidates for understanding the blending octane behavior of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. In this study, the blending octane behaviors of six PRF60 &amp; C4 hydrocarbon mixtures were systematically investigated. A state-of-the-art kinetic models were used by merging the latest KAUST gasoline surrogate model with the AramcoMech 3.0 model. IDTs of stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures were simulated at wide range of pressure (20–50 atm) and temperature (600–1400 K). Three correlation equations were employed from the literature to predict the research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON) of all blends based on these calculated IDTs. Compared with the experimentally measured ON, the best correlation conditions and errors were identified. With the highest degree of unsaturation, 1,3-butadiene was found to be the strongest ON enhancer. Moreover, based on a polynomial correlation, a TPRF (PRF + toluene) blend was formulated by matching the RON and MON of PRF plus 1,3-butadiene blend, for a comparative analysis. Finally, the reactants’ consumption profile, flux and sensitivity analysis were simultaneously performed for explaining the chemistry behind the blending octane behavior of the PRF blends with 1,3-butadiene and toluene. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blending octane behavior; C4 hydrocarbons; Chemical kinetics; Ignition delay time; Motor octane number; Research octane number","Antiknock rating; Blending; Butane; Butenes; Chemical analysis; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Internal combustion engines; Isomers; Mixtures; Sensitivity analysis; Toluene; Comparative analysis; Correlation equation; Degree of unsaturations; Empirical parameters; Polynomial correlations; Primary reference fuels; Research octane number; Unsaturated hydrocarbons; Heptane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084663453

The use of “natural rod-base blowing” to reduce this interaction noise is investigated numerically using a 3D hybrid computational aeroacoustics approach. The natural blowing is generated through an internal slot that interconnects the stagnation and base region of the rod. Numerical simulation is performed for a straight blowing at blowing rates (BRs) between 6.4% and 16.3% and an oblique blowing with slot–incidence angles (θ) between 0° and 15°, respectively. Far-field noise evaluation demonstrates that the natural rod-base blowing under tested BRs can reduce significantly the noise emission, whereas loses its efficiencies gradually with the increase of angle θ. The most effective case is the straight blowing (θ=0°) at BR≥13.6% where the far-field tonal noise associated with the steady-periodic von Karman vortex shedding is annihilated. The changes in transient flow structures indicate that the natural blowing gradually attenuates the von Karman vortex shedding when BR increases, resulting in a mitigation of vortex–body​ interaction on the airfoil leading surface and hence a reduction of the unsteady lift. At BR=13.6%, as the angle θ reaches 15° from below, a new von Karman vortex street reforms in the flow field, leading to another tonal noise. Linear stability analysis based on a local concept of absolute/convective instability suggests that the absolutely unstable region in the near-wake of the rod elongates first and then shrinks with the increase of BR, while the local absolute growth rate decreases monotonously. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Absolute/convective instability; Flow/noise control; Natural rod-base blowing; rod–airfoil configuration; SAS+FWH; vortex–body interaction noise","Airfoils; Computational aeroacoustics; Linear stability analysis; Vortex shedding; Wakes; Absolute/convective instabilities; Airfoil configuration; Incidence angles; Its efficiencies; Numerical experiments; Unstable regions; Von Karman Vortex Street; Von Karman vortices; Vortex flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084047160

The results show that the energy production and their associated water requirements would continue to grow at a high speed in the Reference Scenario. The energy production and their associated water withdrawals and water consumption were found to have decreased sharply in the coordinated development scenario and the strong emission reduction scenario compared to the reference scenario. It shows that industrial restructuring, energy structure optimization and the renewable energy replacement have played an important role in energy-efficient and water-efficient in coordinated development scenario and strong emission reduction scenario.

We use RCP2.6 and its extension to year 2300 as the reference scenario and design a set of cumulative emissions and temperature overshoot scenarios based on other RCPs. Our results suggest that the overshoot and subsequent return to a reference cumulative emissions level would leave substantial impacts on the marine environment.

Clarifying the temperature change over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the Common Era is critical because it plays a vital role in the prediction of cryosphere changes in such regions under a future warming climate. In this paper, we report a comprehensive synthesis of currently available quantitative temperature records to refine the temperature history of the TP during the Common Era. To date, Common Era quantitative temperature reconstructions are sparse and mainly concentrated in the northeastern TP. Considering seasonal bias of the available quantitative temperature reconstructions, three different composite temperature records for TP were derived, namely the “Standardization” composite, the “Mean annual air temperature anomaly” composite, and the “Mean summer temperature anomaly” composite individually. All the integrated temperature series reveal the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, but the start and end timings of these multi-centennial-scale periods and their temperature amplitudes differ. There is strong seasonality in temperature variations on this high plateau, and the 20th century warming was characterized by rapid winter temperature increases, while summer temperatures displayed weak variations. Spatial analysis suggests a relatively consistent signal marking a warm TP during 600–1400 CE and a cold plateau during 1400–1900 CE. Large-scale trends in temperature history for the TP resemble those for China and the Northern Hemisphere.

We analyze in detail these spectral componentsWNk and obtain the main properties of their vertical profiles and global structures. We report that all of the wavenumber spectral components WNk occur mainly around 100 km altitude, and that the most prominent component is the wavenumber spectral component WN 4 structure. Comparing these long duration temperature data with results of previous investigations, we have found that the yearly variation of spectral component WN 4 is similar to that of the eastward propagating non-migrating diurnal tide with zonal wavenumber 3 (DE3) at the low latitudes, and to that of the semi-diurnal tide with zonal wavenumber 2 (SE2) at the mid-latitudes: the amplitudes of the A 4 are larger during boreal summer and autumn at the low-latitudes; at the mid-latitudes the amplitudes have a weak peak in March. In addition, the amplitudes of component WN 4 undergo a remarkable short period variation: significant day-to-day variation of the spectral amplitudes A 4 occurs primarily in July and September at the low-latitudes. In summary, we conclude that the non-migrating tides DE3 and SE2 are likely to be the origins, at the low-latitudes and the mid-latitudes in the MLT region, respectively, of the observed wavenumber spectral component WN 4. © 2020 by Earth and Planetary Physics.","non-migrating tides; short period variation; TIMED observations; wavenumber spectral components",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120678281

The results show that local government decision-making competition is one of the main causes of the regional “green paradox”; the effect of local government decision-making competition on carbon emissions has significant regional heterogeneity and spatial dependence, and the short-term energy rebound effect is greater than the long-term energy rebound effect; and local government decision-making competition has three effects on carbon emissions that also have interaction and substitution effects between them: factor market distortion, investment bias, and the “race to the bottom” of environmental policies.

We investigated Li geochemistry of the humid and arid regolith profiles formed on the Pololu lavas, the Kohala Mountain, Hawaii. The shallow regolith (0–1 m depth) retains Li (τLi,Nb &gt; 0) and displays peak Li accumulation in biologically-active, near-surface soil layers (humid, τLi,Nb = 10.9; arid, τLi,Nb = 2.8), with heavy Li isotopic compositions (humid, 4.7–9.9‰; arid, 4.0–13.9‰) with respect to the basalt signal (2.2‰). The deep regolith (&gt;1 m) demonstrates δ7Li (ave. 3.3‰) comparable to the composition of the underlying parent basalt (2.2‰). Decoupling of Li abundance and isotopic composition in the shallow regolith from those of the deep regolith implies different regolith controls on Li chemistry at vertical locations. The Li geochemistry in the shallow regolith has been substantially influenced by: (i) atmospheric deposition, (ii) plant cycling, and (iii) secondary mineral formation. In addition to weathering alteration, our data show that dust addition mainly influences δ7Li in the humid regolith, and marine aerosol largely affects δ7Li in the arid regolith. In the humid regolith, downward seepage migration allows for deeper and more advanced weathering, whereas occasional wetting events followed by rapid drying likely dominate in the arid regolith. Thus, biological cycling and the deposition of Asian dust and volcanic ash from the more recent Hawi eruptions are responsible for upward Li enrichment in soils and increases of soil δ7Li composition in the shallow regolith. This is particularly important in the humid site with dense plant coverage and heavy rainfall. By contrast, the deep regolith of the humid and arid sites is mostly affected by pore fluid percolation and accumulation, thus inheriting heavy Li isotope signals from pore fluids. Our study emphasizes climate-regulated and long-neglected biological controls on terrestrial Li cycling during chemical weathering. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biogeochemistry; Chemical weathering; Hawaii; Lithium isotopes; Regolith","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; chemical weathering; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; lithium; regolith; soil chemistry; terrestrial ecosystem; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kohala; Pololu Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088393217

The composition of the fine particles may change along with the improved air quality, and thus may induce distinct environmental and climate effects in future. In this study, a very recent long-term dataset (2018–2019) of non-refractory chemical composition measured by a quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation monitor (Q-ACSM) observed in urban Beijing is applied to investigate the changes in ratio of nitrate (NO3−) to sulfate (SO42−) in PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameters of less than 2.5 μm). We show that the ratio of NO3− to SO42− varies seasonally, with a maximum in winter (1.6 ± 1.2) and a minimum in summer (0.7 ± 1.0). Compared with results from earlier studies showing a continuous increase in the ratio of NO3− to SO42− since 1999, a decline in the ratio is found during the period of 2018–2019. This is partially associated with an attenuated nitrate formation likely due to reduced nitrogen oxides emissions since 2016 in China. Our results suggest that the strict reduction control measures in place serve only to improve SO42− pollution in winter but not in summer when high SO42− levels are still observed. SO42− and NO3− concentrations during study periods together comprise 37–53% of PM2.5, presenting significant role in dominating the levels of PM2.5. In addition, we show that the ratio of NO3−/SO42− in warm seasons generally increases with increasing relative humidity (RH) due to enhanced NO3− hydrolysis formation, but with a maximum value of only ~1.0 that is pulled down by the high levels of sulfate in summer, while the dependence of the ratios on RH is more pronounced in cold seasons when multiple factors (regional transportation, planetary boundary layer, PBL and sources of sulfate, etc.) can impact nitrate levels. We finally characterize two typical processes that lead to the rapid accumulation of nitrate in the atmosphere over urban Beijing: the regional transportation and PBL variations, which is found driving heavy haze in cold seasons, and the hydrolysis formation and partitioning of NO3− that tends to impact the diurnal patterns of nitrate in warm seasons. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fine particles; Nitrate; Seasonal variation; Sulfate; Trends","Air quality; Boundary layers; Chemical speciation; Climate change; Emission control; Hydrolysis; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Air quality improvement; Chemical compositions; Emission control measures; Legislative action; Multiple factors; Particulate Matter; Planetary boundary layers; Regional transportation; Urban transportation; ammonia; ammonium sulfate; black carbon; carbon monoxide; chloride; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; sulfate; accumulation; aerosol; air quality; chemical composition; emission control; haze; humidity; hydrolysis; nitrate; nitrous oxide; periurban area; pollutant transport; speciation (chemistry); aerosol; air pollution control; Article; boundary layer; chemical composition; China; circadian rhythm; exhaust gas; humidity; hydrolysis; oxidation; particulate matter; photooxidation; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; summer; temperature; urban area; wind speed; winter; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082852963

Tracking reversible electron transfer from and to NOM in biogeochemical redox processes has been a challenge for decades. Reasons include side reactions of reactants used to determine the redox state of NOM and slow reaction kinetics of reactants or traditional non-mediated electrochemical methods. Furthermore, partially irreversible reactions/methods employed hamper the experimental determination of redox properties of NOM. Recent advances in mediated electrochemical analysis, however, have greatly improved our ability to characterize the redox properties of NOM. Thus, mediated electrochemical analysis may become an important tool in expanding our understanding of NOM-fueled biogeochemical N cycling in anoxic environments. Nonetheless, this technique has rarely been applied to investigate microbial pathways of reversible NOM redox cycling such as its coupling to anoxic nitrogen (N) cycling. Here we advocate for employing mediated electrochemical analysis to address such topics in the future and provide recommendations for a successful experimental application of this method in the presence of reactive N-species. To this end, we review recent applications of mediated electrochemical analysis in studying microbial NOM cycling. We exemplify the potential of mediated electrochemical techniques for biogeochemical research by discussing how microbial NOM redox cycling is linked to anaerobic N cycling. We focus on anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and reduction of N-oxides that are related to N loss and nitrous oxide (N2O) mitigation. Finally, we present strategies to work around problems arising from electroactive intermediates that hamper the application of mediated electrochemical analysis in microbial experiments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemistry; Geomicrobiology; Humic substances; Nitrogen cycle; Redox processes","ammonium; anaerobic digestion; anoxic conditions; biogeochemical cycle; electrochemical method; experimental study; groundwater; microbial activity; nitrogen cycle; organic matter; oxidation; redox conditions; redox potential; soil chemistry; water chemistry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087921153

Two geographical groups of countries that previously belonged to the former bloc of socialist countries are used for the estimations of CO2 emissions drivers. The research covers such Eastern European countries as Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Russian Federation, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, and Ukraine and such Central Asian states as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan during the period 1996-2018. The main goal of the research is to identify common drivers that determine carbon dioxide emissions in selected states. To control for the time fixed effects (like EU membership), random effect model was used for the analysis of the panel data set. Results: It is found that energy efficiency progress reduces per capita CO2 emissions. Thus, an increase in GDP by 100 USD per one ton of oil equivalent decreases per capita CO2 emissions by 17-64 kg. That is, the more energy-efficient the economy becomes, the less CO2 emissions per capita it produces in a group of selected post-communist economies. Unlike energy efficiency, an increase in GDP per capita by 1000 USD raises CO2 emissions by 260 kg per capita, and the richer the economy becomes, the more CO2 emissions per capita it generates. The increase in life expectancy by one year leads to an increase in CO2 emissions per capita by 200-370 kg, with average values of 260 kg per capita. It was found that an increase in agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector share (as a % of GDP) by one percentage point leads to the decrease in CO2 emissions by 67-200 kg per capita, while an increase in industrial sector share by one percentage point leads to the increase in CO2 per capita emissions by 37-110 kg. Oil prices and foreign direct investment appeared to be statistically insignificant factors in a group of selected post-communist economies. Conclusions: The main policy recommendation is the promotion of energy efficiency policy and the development of green economy sectors. The other measures are the promotion of a less energy-intensive service sector and the modernization of the industrial sector, which is still characterized by high energy and carbon intensity. © 2020 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Decarbonization; Economic development; Electricity consumption; Energy efficiency; Environmental economics; Institutional changes; Post-communist countries","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Crude oil price; Economics; Forestry; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Investments; Random processes; Service industry; Carbon dioxide emissions; Central Asian States; Energy efficiency policies; Environmental contaminant; Foreign direct investments; Policy recommendations; Random-effect models; Russian federation; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; electricity supply; energy efficiency; environmental economics; institutional reform; post-communism; Bulgaria; Czech Republic; Hungary; Kazakhstan; Poland [Central Europe]; Romania; Russian Federation; Slovakia; Ukraine; Uzbekistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092355675

Regional comprehensive transportation network will become the main trend of low-carbon ecological comprehensive transportation planning strategy. Based on the three-level programming model, this paper studies the dynamic relationship between three planning levels and carries out comprehensive optimization design. Decision variables include characteristics of land use optimization, and also the construction and renovation of traffic routes. In order to solve the complex nonlinear model, the hybrid method of augmented dual algorithm and sequential average algorithm is adopted to solve the lower model, and the heuristic algorithm is adopted to effectively solve the integrated model, thus obtaining the optimal comprehensive transportation network layout scheme and the optimal land use scheme. Finally, a multi-scale space is taken as a research unit to carry out an example analysis. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method, which can improve the scientificity and rationality of the planning. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","augmented dual algorithm; heuristic algorithm; low carbon ecology; regional integrated transportation distribution network","Ecology; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Land use; Optimization; Comprehensive optimizations; Comprehensive transportation; Ecological development; Environmental damage; Integrated modeling; Interactive development; Land-use optimization; Minimum energy consumption; Heuristic methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092411836

It is influenced by the westerly circulation, plateau monsoon, and East Asian monsoon circulation, and the drought disasters across the CLP have obvious regional characteristics. In this study, climate regionalization was performed by a spatial hierarchical cluster approach based on the gridded datasets of monthly precipitation across the CLP from 1961 to 2017. Then, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) was used to explore the temporal evolution of regional meteorological droughts. Finally, wavelet methods were used to investigate the drought cycles in each homogeneous subregion and the linkages between SPI and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The results show that: (1) Spatially, the CLP can be divided into four homogeneous regions, namely, Ordos Plateau semi-arid area (Region I), Northern Shanxi hilly semi-humid area (Region II), Longzhong plateau cold-arid area (Region III), and Fenwei Plain and Shaanxi-Shanxi hilly semi-humid area (Region IV). (2) There are apparent differences in the temporal evolution of meteorological droughts in different subregions, but two wet periods from the 1960s to 1980s and 2010s, and a drought period in the 1990s, can be found in each subregion. (3) There is a significant drought cycle of 3–8 years in the four subregions, and the first main cycles of drought variation are not completely consistent. (4) The linkages between SPI and SOI are time-and space-dependent and the phase differences are dominated by in-phase. The strongest correlations between the two time series occur in the 1980s in the four subregions. The results of this research have important implications for the establishment of drought monitoring programs in homogeneous climate regions, and informed decision making in water resource management. © 2020 by the authors.

Regional atmosphere–ocean models are used to investigate the storm surge and coastal inundation that might be produced by a similar storm under the warmer ocean temperature and higher sea level projected for the future climate. Warming causes the storm to intensify, with the minimum sea level pressure decreasing from 955 mb during Isabel to ~ 950 mb in 2050 and ~ 940 mb in 2100. The stronger storm and higher mean sea level amplify the peak water level by ~ 0.5 m in 2050 and ~ 1.2 m in 2100. The total inundated area over Chesapeake Bay expands by 26% in 2050 and 47–62% in 2100. Over the rural Dorchester County, the inundated area shows moderate expansion in the future climate but the average inundation depth is 30% higher in 2050 and 50–70% higher in 2100. The number of houses flooded increases from 1420 during Hurricane Isabel to 1850/2190 in 2100 under the climate change scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5/8.5. The inundated area in Baltimore is 2.2 km2 during Hurricane Isabel, expands to 5.1 km2 in 2050, and reaches 8.1/9.1 km2 in 2100 under RCP 4.5/8.5. The estimated flood damage to Baltimore increases from $29 million in 2003 to $98/100 million in 2050 and $150/162 million in 2100 under the median projection of RCP 4.5/8.5.

In this study, a time-series study was conducted in 48 large Chinese cities from 2013 to 2017. Generalized additive model coupled with random effects model were used to estimate national-average associations of PM2.5 with YLL. Effect modification by individual- and city-level characteristics obtained by linking with China Chronic Disease and Risk Factors Surveillance was explored. Moreover, additional life gain was evaluated under scenario where PM2.5 concentration would be reduced. For 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration at lag01 day, the relative increment of YLL was 0.22% from CVD, 0.20% from ischemic heart disease, 0.26% from stroke, 0.23% from hemorrhagic stroke, and 0.31% from ischemic stroke. Some associations were stronger in elder and less educated people, warm season, as well as cities characterized by higher temperature and prevalence of binge drinking and excess red meat intake, or lower PM2.5 and prevalence of usual exercise. Additional life gain attributable to avoidable YLL from CVD was estimated to be 0.08 year if PM2.5 concentration could fall to the standard recommended by World Health Organization (25 μg/m3). This large epidemiological investigation demonstrated robust evidence of short-term associations between PM2.5 exposure and YLL from CVD.

The drag effect of carbon emissions on the process of urbanisation is derived based on the intrinsic relationship between economic growth and urban development. Then, unit root and cointegration tests are performed using panel data from 30 provincial regions in Mainland China from 2003 to 2016 to prove and estimate the resistance caused by carbon emission in the process of urbanisation. Results show that the drag effect of carbon emission between 2003 and 2016 has a certain negative impact on the process of urbanisation in China. Due to the constraints of carbon emissions, the growth rate of China's economic growth and urbanization level is 0.74% and 4.96% lower than that without constraints, respectively. Therefore, in the process of rapid urbanisation, formulating a reasonable carbon emission reduction strategy by the provincial government is conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of urbanisation. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emission; Drag effect; Panel cointegration; Urban development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092112763

Existing national-level carbon accounting is insufficient to support developing carbon reduction policies and measures tailored for specific locations. In this study, we conducted a spatially high-resolution analysis to estimate life-cycle carbon emissions from the coal-fired power industry at the province-level. The estimate is from a bottom-up perspective, including computing carbon emission factors for 22 coal-fired power technologies based on the operation data of 47.8 % of all units, measuring provincial technology structures based on the information data of 99.7 % of all ones, and weighted calculating the above two terms. We also analyzed the carbon reduction potential of the coal-fired power industry according to relevant measures by province. The estimate shows great differences in carbon emission factors of various technologies. The coupling of these factors with different technology structures causes significant variations of 0.933–1.019 kg CO2eq/kWh in the carbon emission factors of the coal-fired power industry at the province-level. In 2016, carbon emissions from China's coal-fired power industry were 3835 Mt CO2eq and intensive in the northern and eastern provinces. From 2016 to 2020, carbon emission factors in most provinces will decrease by 3 %–6 % benefiting from technology structure optimization and energy conservation. The falling of carbon emission factors leads to a carbon reduction potential of 307 Mt CO2eq in total. In particular, Beijing and Shandong achieve negative growth in carbon emissions from the coal-fired power industry during this period. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Carbon reduction; China; Coal-fired power; High-resolution","Carbon; Coal; Structural optimization; Carbon accounting; Carbon emission factors; Carbon reduction potentials; High resolution analysis; Policies and measures; Specific location; Structure optimization; Various technologies; Coal industry; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; emission control; industrial emission; life cycle analysis; optimization; pollution monitoring; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087411724

The key link of integrated energy system planning and optimization is to determine the kind and installed capacity of source-side equipment, and how to make the equipment of the system cooperate and couple with each other. A model of equipment capacity allocation at the source side of integrated energy system is proposed, which can get the best equipment kind and installed capacity in the planning and optimization area. The objectives of the model are the optimal economy and the minimum carbon emission. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, three typical scenarios are set for comparative analysis. In the simulation, by comparing the economy and carbon emission of planning results in different scenarios, it can be found that there is a potential connection between the installed capacity of source-side equipment, and at the same time, the carbon emission will also affect the installed capacity of equipment. Renewable energy equipment has made great contribution to carbon emission, but its investment cost has greatly increased the system planning cost. Therefore, system economy and carbon emission are mutually exclusive to a certain extent. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Carbon; Economics; Energy efficiency; Comparative analysis; Comprehensive energy; Efficiency and economies; Equipment capacities; Equipment performance; Installed capacity; Integrated energy systems; Renewable energies; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091592698

The phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) co-doped graphene (PNG) electrode materials are prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method and look like tremella with bent and wrinkled structures, which facilitates the construction of a multiple thin-wall electrolytic cell. The amount of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate is controlled to adjust the PNG morphology. The 20PNG electrode material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 348 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. When the current density is increased to 50 times, the specific capacitance value is still 83% of the initial value, which indicates that 20PNG has an extremely high rate performance. Additionally, the symmetric supercapacitor 20PNG//20PNG shows a high energy density of 34.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 500 W kg-1 in a 2 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and maintains an initial specific capacitance of 91.4% after 20?000 cycles.

However, BBE estimates show very large variability and the accuracy of emissions estimation is poorly understood due to the lack of good reference data. We evaluated fire emissions estimated using FRP from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on GOES-R (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R) by comparing with the Sentinel 5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) Carbon Monoxide (CO) over 41 wildfires across the United States during July 2018-October 2019. All the ABI FRP-based CO and TROPOMI CO emissions were significantly correlated and showed a very good agreement with a coefficient of determination of 0.94 and an accuracy of 13-18%. We further reported a CO emission coefficient of 29.92 ± 2.39 g MJ-1 based on ABI FRP and TROPOMI CO, which can be used to directly estimate BBE from FRP observed from satellites. Based on the CO emission coefficient and ABI FRP, we finally estimated a monthly mean CO of 596 Gg across the Conterminous United States for June-September 2018. © 2020 The Author(s).

The C-TiO2/kaolinite composite exhibited improved degradation performance towards ciprofloxacin under visible light, with a reaction rate constant of 0.00597 min−1, which is about 3.24 and 24.88 times higher than that of 2.0C-T (2.0% carbon-doped TiO2) and pure TiO2, respectively. Based on various materials characterization methods and DFT calculations, it was indicated that the electronic structure was correlated with the changes in light absorption, charge carrier lifetime, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The enhanced visible light responding ability could be attributed to the synergistic effect between natural kaolinite and nanosized TiO2, the formation of localized occupied states in the gap, and the formation of TiIII defects consisted of surface oxygen vacancies. All of them effectively increase the separation efficiency, migration velocity, and lifetime of the photoinduced charge carriers under visible-light irradiation.

Methanol vehicle pilot projects completed in ten Chinese cities have demonstrated that methanol vehicles can reduce costs and emissions. In considering whether methanol vehicles should be deployed more widely in China, there is a role for bespoke decision-making methods as an aid for assessing the prospects for such an expansion and developing the strategies needed for implementation. In this paper, a FANP (fuzzy analytic network process) - SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) method was proposed and applied to assess the prospects for methanol vehicles in China. Based on the proposed method, an evaluation criteria system that includes 12 criteria from social, technological, economic, environmental, and political fields was established. Each criterion was weighted based on interviews with 16 experts who have extensive experience and expertise related to policy development for methanol vehicles in China. As a result, 10 strategies for the further implementation of methanol vehicles in China were proposed and prioritized. The results form the basis for six proposed policy implications for the further deployment of methanol vehicles. Policies for developing core technologies for methanol vehicles to achieve socioeconomical and environmental benefits are given the highest priority. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy analytic network process; Methanol vehicles; SWOT analysis","decision making; development strategy; fuzzy mathematics; methanol; transport vehicle; transportation development; transportation policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087315742

We identified the spatiotemporal distribution of PAHs in YRD, and analyzed the factors (source contribution, meteorological conditions, and backward trajectory) influencing these concentrations. First, our results showed that the average PAH concentration was 41.46 ± 15.57 ng/m3 in YRD, and was highest in Jiangsu (44.47 ± 11.37 ng/m3). The concentration of PAHs has decreased since 2001. The relatively balanced development of urban and rural areas in the YRD has resulted in a relatively low ratio (∼1.12) of PAHs between urban and rural areas. The PAH level in YRD was highest in winter (52.21 ± 14.70 ng/m3) and lowest in summer (31.23 ± 12.88 ng/m3). Second, principal component and multivariate linear regression analyses (PCA-MLR) were used to identify three main PAH sources: vehicle emissions (52.83%), coke ovens and volatilization (23.67%), and coal and biomass combustion (23.51%). The seasonal variations in the PAH source contribution were mainly attributed to seasonal differences in the amounts of coal and biomass burned, the prevailing wind direction, and traffic control in winter. Third, we found that the PAH concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with the temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity throughout the year. Finally, backward trajectory analysis indicated that the PAHs in YRD were significantly affected by air masses from northern China, particularly during winter. The results of this study suggest that enforcing stricter controls on coal and biomass combustion in northern China, improving the fuel quality of vehicles, increasing the proportion of gas/electric vehicles, and strengthening the joint control of air pollution could further reduce the PAH concentrations in China. The analysis conducted in this study will help develop pollution control strategies to reduce lung cancer risk for the whole YRD region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Backward trajectory; Source identification; Yangtze river delta","Air pollution control; Atmospheric humidity; Biomass; Coal; Coal combustion; Mineral oils; Principal component analysis; Quality control; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; River pollution; Rural areas; Traffic control; Vehicles; Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Backward trajectory analysis; Meteorological condition; Multivariate linear regression analysis; Prevailing wind directions; Seasonal differences; Spatiotemporal distributions; Urban and rural areas; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085615761

Climate drivers will alter deep-sea biodiversity and associated ecosystem services, and may interact with disturbance from resource extraction activities or even climate geoengineering. We suggest that to ensure the effective management of increasing use of the deep ocean (e.g., for bottom fishing, oil and gas extraction, and deep-seabed mining), environmental management and developing regulations must consider climate change. Strategic planning, impact assessment and monitoring, spatial management, application of the precautionary approach, and full-cost accounting of extraction activities should embrace climate consciousness. Coupled climate and biological modeling approaches applied in the water and on the seafloor can help accomplish this goal. For example, Earth-System Model projections of climate-change parameters at the seafloor reveal heterogeneity in projected climate hazard and time of emergence (beyond natural variability) in regions targeted for deep-seabed mining. Models that combine climate-induced changes in ocean circulation with particle tracking predict altered transport of early life stages (larvae) under climate change. Habitat suitability models can help assess the consequences of altered larval dispersal, predict climate refugia, and identify vulnerable regions for multiple species under climate change. Engaging the deep observing community can support the necessary data provisioning to mainstream climate into the development of environmental management plans. To illustrate this approach, we focus on deep-seabed mining and the International Seabed Authority, whose mandates include regulation of all mineral-related activities in international waters and protecting the marine environment from the harmful effects of mining. However, achieving deep-ocean sustainability under the UN Sustainable Development Goals will require integration of climate consideration across all policy sectors. © 2020 The Authors.

Flask sampling in ICOS has three different purposes, namely (1) to provide an independent quality control for in situ observations, (2) to provide representative information on atmospheric components currently not monitored in situ at the stations, and (3) to collect samples for 14CO2 analysis that are significantly influenced by fossil fuel CO2 ( ffCO2 ) emission areas. Based on the existing data and experimental results obtained at the Heidelberg pilot station with a prototype flask sampler, we suggest that single flask samples are collected regularly every third day around noon or in the afternoon from the highest level of a tower station. Air samples shall be collected over 1 h, with equal temporal weighting, to obtain a true hourly mean. At all stations studied, more than 50 % of flasks collected around midday will likely be sampled during low ambient variability ( <i>&lt;</i>0.5 parts per million (ppm) standard deviation of 1 min values). Based on a first application at the Hohenpeißenberg ICOS site, such flask data are principally suitable for detecting CO2 concentration biases larger than 0.1 ppm with a 1 <i>σ</i> confidence level between flask and in situ observations from only five flask comparisons. In order to have a maximum chance to also sample ffCO2 emission areas, additional flasks are collected on all other days in the afternoon. To check if the ffCO2 component will indeed be large in these samples, we use the continuous in situ CO observations. The CO deviation from an estimated background value is determined the day after each flask sampling, and depending on this offset, an automated decision is made as to whether a flask shall be retained for 14CO2 analysis. It turned out that, based on existing data, ffCO2 events of more than 4-5 ppm that would allow ffCO2 estimates with an uncertainty below 30 % were very rare at all stations studied, particularly in summer (only zero to five events per month<span idCombining double low line""page11162""/> from May to August).

CO2 emissions can then be estimated from the magnitude of these plumes. In this paper, we assimilate pseudo-observations in a global atmospheric inversion system to assess the performance of a constellation of one to four sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit (LEO) imagers to monitor anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The constellation of imagers follows the specifications from the European Spatial Agency (ESA) for the Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring (CO2M) concept for a future operational mission dedicated to the monitoring of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This study assesses the uncertainties in the inversion estimates of emissions (""posterior uncertainties""). Results: The posterior uncertainties of emissions for individual cities and power plants are estimated for the 3 h before satellite overpasses, and extrapolated at annual scale assuming temporal auto-correlations in the uncertainties in the emission products that are used as a prior knowledge on the emissions by the Bayesian framework of the inversion. The results indicate that (i) the number of satellites has a proportional impact on the number of 3 h time windows for which emissions are constrained to better than 20%, but it has a small impact on the posterior uncertainties in annual emissions; (ii) having one satellite with wide swath would provide full images of the XCO2 plumes, and is more beneficial than having two satellites with half the width of reference swath; and (iii) an increase in the precision of XCO2 retrievals from 0.7 ppm to 0.35 ppm has a marginal impact on the emission monitoring performance. Conclusions: For all constellation configurations, only the cities and power plants with an annual emission higher than 0.5 MtC per year can have at least one 8:30-11:30 time window during one year when the emissions can be constrained to better than 20%. The potential of satellite imagers to constrain annual emissions not only depend on the design of the imagers, but also strongly depend on the temporal error structure in the prior uncertainties, which is needed to be objectively assessed in the bottom-up emission maps. © 2020 The Author(s).","Anthropogenic CO2emissions; PMIF global inversion system; Posterior uncertainty; Satellite imager","carbon emission; environmental monitoring; fossil fuel; orbit determination; point source; satellite constellation; satellite imagery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092095411

In developing countries, imported genetic resources are regarded as both a solution to improve the performance of local livestock and as one of the main threats to local populations. Using international databases, censuses and technical reports, we investigate ongoing trends and consequences of these two phenomena in 40 countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America. In these countries, the share of locally adapted breeds within species has decreased by an average of 0.76% per year over the last 20 years. The corresponding increase has been distributed between pure exotic breeds and crossbred animals, with differences across regions. In several countries, increased utilization of exotic cattle breeds and crossbreeding has been accompanied by a trend in increased milk yield per cow. The shift from local genetic resources to crossbred and exotic animals must be considered in the context of challenges such as food security, erosion of agrobiodiversity, interactions with other agricultural production, reduction of poverty and provision of ecosystem services, as well as resilience to and mitigation of climate change. © 2020 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations","Crossbreeding; Developing countries; Livestock; Locally adapted breeds; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089516222

Nonetheless, the fossil-based resources are mainly being converted into syngas via the thermo-chemical process with substantial emissions of anthropogenic CO2, which is one of main factors deteriorating the usefulness of syngas. Thus, it is desirable to obtain syngas through sustainable conversion techniques and a carbon neutral feedstock. To achieve the noted grand challenges, suppressing CO2 formation during the synthesis of syngas by transforming CO2 into a combustible matter (CO2-to-fuel) is of great importance since it offers a precautious measure for fortifying energy security in the most countries and abating catastrophic consequences arising from global warming. To this end, this study was aimed to introduce a sustainable conversion of syngas through pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW). Specifically, pyrolysis of yard trimming was investigated as a case study because it is one of the main MSW components. To offer an environmentally benign platform for producing syngas, CO2 was fed during pyrolysis of yard trimming, and the functional effectiveness of CO2 was mainly scrutinized. All experimental observations offered that reduction of CO2 and simultaneous oxidation of volatile pyrolysates coming from yard trimming thermolysis were achieved, which resulted in the enhanced formation of CO. In addition, catalytic pyrolysis was examined to expedite reaction rates using a concrete waste because the demolition waste is one of main inorganic MSW components. The effectiveness of CO2 was remarkably enhanced from catalytic pyrolysis over concrete. Conclusively, this study suggested that both the organic/inorganic MSW components could be valorized through the concept of waste-to-energy in conjunction with CO2-to-fuel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Catalytic pyrolysis; Concrete; Syngas; Waste-to-energy; Yard trimming","Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Concretes; Demolition; Energy security; Feedstocks; Fuels; Global warming; Pyrolysis; Reaction rates; Synthesis gas; Trimming; Catalytic pyrolysis; Catastrophic consequences; Demolition wastes; Environmentally benign; Grand Challenge; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Organic/inorganic; Thermo chemical process; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085109952

To verify the N2O emission inventory using inverse analysis, precise and reliable measurements are necessary. In this study, we compared the conventional gas chromatography with the microelectron capture detector method (GC-μECD, Agilent 7890A) with advanced off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (OA-ICOS, Los Gatos, EP-30) for atmospheric N2O measurements at the Jeju Gosan Suwolbong Station (JGS, 126.16° E, 33.30° N, 71.47 m a.s.l) in South Korea. The measurement uncertainties from linearity, repeatability, and reproducibility derived from the two instruments were compared. The values derived from GC-μECD were 2.4 to 8.7 times greater than that of OA-ICOS in all factors at the station. Since these factors affect the measurement quality, the calibration strategy should be well-established to reduce the measurement uncertainty. These uncertainties resulted in biases from the measurement of atmospheric N2O. The parallel inter-comparison experiment was implemented at JGS for 22 months, and the difference in atmospheric N2O was 0.17 ± 0.9 ppb between the two instruments. The significant differences were observed in the nonlinear range of the GC-μECD. Finally, these differences resulted in the over/underestimation of N2O characteristics locally and seasonally. Overall, OA-ICOS has a more robust performance with a lower measurement uncertainty than GC-μECD. Based on this study, we also suggest a calibration strategy for both instruments to achieve precise N2O measurements. © 2020 by the authors.","GC-μECD; GHGs; GHGs measurement; N2O; OA-ICOS","Atmospheric chemistry; Calibration; Gas chromatography; Greenhouse gases; Inverse problems; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone layer; Anthropogenic sources; Atmospheric nitrous oxide; Emission inventories; High-precision measurement; Integrated cavity output spectroscopies; Measurement uncertainty; Pre-industrial levels; Reliable measurement; Uncertainty analysis; anthropogenic source; comparative study; emission inventory; gas chromatography; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; spectroscopy; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091853001

In these circumstances, urban climate is progressively taken into account in urban planning processes, for instance using terrain classifications. The developed methodology involves the Local Climate Zone scheme (LCZ), which has been applied to Nancy, France. Mobile measurements campaigns have been performed using an instrumented vehicle in order to record daily air temperature dynamics, with a focus on the daily cooling period. So as to quantify LCZ cooling before and after sunset over several days, a climatic indicator called Normalized Cooling Rate (NCR) has been used. This study presents statistical regressions that have been performed between normalized cooling rate values calculated from field measurements and urban indicators. Results indicate that normalized cooling rates and most of the studied urban features are correlated.

We show that the occurrence probabilities of the duration, intensity, and cumulative intensity of most documented, large, and impactful MHWs have increased more than 20-fold as a result of anthropogenic climate change. MHWs that occurred only once every hundreds to thousands of years in the preindustrial climate are projected to become decadal to centennial events under 1.5°C warming conditions and annual to decadal events under 3°C warming conditions.

For a complete understanding of the flare, we must analyze multi-wavelength datasets, as emission at different wavelengths originates from different layers in the solar atmosphere. Also, flares are transient and localized events observed to occur at all longitudes. With these considerations, we have carried out multi-wavelength analysis of two representative flare events. One event occurred close to the center of the solar disk and the other occurred close to the limb. In the former case, we examine emission from the lower layers of the solar atmosphere. Therefore the chromosphere, transition region and also photospheric magnetogram can be analyzed. On the other hand, in the near-limb event, coronal features can be clearly examined. In this paper, the first event studied is the M1.1 class flare from the active region NOAA 10649 located at S10E14 and the second event is the M1.4 class flare from the active region 10713 located at S12W90. In both cases, we have acquired excellent multi-wavelength data sets. The observations from multi-instrumental data clearly demonstrate that flares occur in the vicinity of sunspots.

Fire globally reduces the tree covered area and vegetation carbon storage by 10%. Regionally, the effects are much stronger, up to 20% for certain latitudinal bands, and 17% in savanna regions. Global fire effects on total carbon storage and carbon turnover times are lower with the effect on gross primary productivity (GPP) close to 0. We find the strongest impacts of fire in savanna regions. Climatic conditions in regions with the highest burned area differ from regions with highest absolute fire impact, which are characterized by higher precipitation. Our estimates of fire-induced vegetation change are lower than previous studies. We attribute these differences to different definitions of vegetation change and effects of anthropogenic land use, which were not considered in previous studies and decreases the impact of fire on tree cover. Accounting for fires significantly improves the spatial patterns of simulated tree cover, which demonstrates the need to represent fire in dynamic vegetation models. Based upon comparisons between models and observations, process understanding and representation in models, we assess a higher confidence in the fire impact on tree cover and vegetation carbon compared to GPP, total carbon storage and turnover times. We have higher confidence in the spatial patterns compared to the global totals of the simulated fire impact.

To assess the potential scale and cost of CO2 sequestration from BECCS in the US, this analysis models carbon sequestration net of supply chain emissions and costs of biomass production, delivery, power generation, and CO2 capture and sequestration in saline formations. The analysis includes two biomass supply scenarios (near-term and long-term), two biomass logistics scenarios (conventional and pelletized), and two generation technologies (pulverized combustion and integrated gasification combined cycle). Results show marginal cost per tonne CO2 (accounting for costs of electricity and CO2 emissions of reference power generation scenarios) as a function of CO2 sequestered (simulating capture of up to 90% of total CO2 sequestration potential) and associated spatial distribution of resources and generation locations for the array of scenario options. Under a near-term scenario using up to 206 million tonnes per year of biomass, up to 181 million tonnes CO2 can be sequestered annually at scenario-average costs ranging from $62 to $137 per tonne CO2; under a long-term scenario using up to 740 million tonnes per year of biomass, up to 737 million tonnes CO2 can be sequestered annually at scenario-average costs ranging from $42 to $92 per tonne CO2. These estimates of CO2 sequestration potential may be reduced if future competing demand reduces resource availability or may be increased if displaced emissions from conventional power sources are included. Results suggest there are large-scale opportunities to implement BECCS at moderate cost in the US, particularly in the Midwest, Plains States, and Texas. © 2020 by the authors.","BECCS; Bioenergy; Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; Biomass economics; Biomass logistics; Biomass resources; Biopower",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090499206

Microbial selenate reduction coupled to methane (CH4) oxidation has been demonstrated very recently. Little is known whether ethane (C2H6) and butane (C3H8) are able to drive selenate reduction, although they are also important components in shale gas. In this study, we demonstrated Se(VI) bio-reduction could be achieved using C2H6 and C3H8 as electron donors and carbon sources. Scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) confirmed elemental Se (Se0) was the major final product formed from Se(VI) bio-reduction. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) were generated in the biofilms as the internal electron-storage materials, which were consumed for sustaining Se(VI) bio-reduction in absence of C2H6 and C3H8. Microbial community analysis showed that two genera capable of oxidizing gaseous alkanes dominated in the biofilms, including Mycobacterium (in both C2H6 and C3H8-fed biofilms) and Rhodococcus (in C3H8-fed biofilm). In addition, several potential Se(VI) reducers (e.g., Variovorax) were detected in the biofilms. Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States analysis supported that predictive genes associated with alkanes oxidation, denitrification and PHAs cycle were enriched in the biofilms. These findings offer insights into the process of selenate reduction driven by C2H6 and C3H8, which ultimately may help to develop a solution to use shale gas for groundwater remediation, especially near shale gas exploitation sites. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ethane; Groundwater remediation; Membrane biofilm reactor; Propane; Selenate; Shale gas","Biofilms; Electrons; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ethane; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Hydrocarbons; Paraffins; Scanning electron microscopy; Shale gas; Electron donors; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Gas exploitation; Gas extractions; Ground water remediation; Membrane biofilm reactor; Microbial community analysis; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Selenium compounds; alkane derivative; ethane; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; propane; selenate; selenic acid; bacterium; biofilm; bioreactor; denitrification; electron; ethane; groundwater; membrane; methane; microbial community; oxidation; propane; selenate; Article; carbon source; chemical analysis; denitrification; DNA extraction; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; gas chromatography; illumina sequencing; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); scanning electron microscopy; surface area; thermal conductivity; waste water treatment plant; biofilm; bioreactor; electron; oxidation reduction reaction; Mycobacterium; Rhodococcus; Variovorax; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Electrons; Ethane; Oxidation-Reduction; Propane; Selenic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087380148

Although more sustainable practices have been implemented in the area (i.e., integrated, INT and organic farming, ORG), it remains unclear how these practices will affect C dynamics mediated by soil biota. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of agricultural management practices and earthworm additions (macrofauna) on soil C losses [CO2 emissions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] in relation to the amount of bioavailable soil carbon [salt extractable organic carbon (SEOC) and microbial carbon indicators (microbial biomass or Cmic and the Cmic/Corg ratio)]. The experimental design consisted of a 105-days laboratory incubation of intact soil cores collected in the field (40 from each agroecosystem) and earthworm additions over ambient (2.43 ± 0.05 g/earthworm) to half of the experimental units (+EW), with the remaining half acting as controls. Our results showed that earthworm additions led to significant increases in their abundance in all three management treatments, but with the ORG soils sustaining the greatest population sizes. However, no significant effect on soil C transformations were observed in response to these earthworm increases, and instead, legacy agricultural practices overrode macrofauna control on C turnover. Consequently, more C was lost from the CONV treatments than from the ORG ones (on average, 60% more CO2 and 53% more DOC) as a result of CONV practices promoting microbial-mediated processes and hence, amplifying C mineralization versus C stabilization. Furthermore, C release from the INT soils was intermediate between the other two treatments, which suggests that more sustainable farming practices could help in achieving climate change mitigation. These findings provide clear evidence of how local adaptation (at farm level) toward a more environmentally friendly land management could represent a promising strategy to increase soil C sequestration. Future agricultural approaches would need to incorporate the potential benefits from other agroecosystem services beyond those derived from productivity and market values. © Copyright © 2020 Lago, Barreal, Gallego and Briones.","Actinidia chinensis; conventional agriculture; earthworms; integrated production; microorganisms; organic management; soil carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091942669

In this study, we highlight the potential of combined multi-spectral Sentinel-2 and fully polarimetric PALSAR-2 data for land cover classification in dense urban areas, based on the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme. We classified differently combined spectral and back-scattering characteristics using the subspace method in comparison with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) methods. Results show that, (i) the overall accuracy (OA) was 65.9% for the Sentinel-2 data, (ii) higher OA (71.9%) was achieved by adding four intensity images of PALSAR-2 to Sentinel-2, (iii) the inclusion of decomposed components increased OA to 72.8%, and (iv) the highest OA (73.3%) was achieved using all features. These results suggest that the inclusion of different backscattering characteristics disproportionately improved classification accuracy from using multi-spectral data alone. The results of comparison between different methods show that the subspace method performed better than SVM and MLC, particularly when high-dimensional data were used. The subspace method classified particularly well for some specific LCZ classes which are easily mixed between each other. It provides a promising option for LCZ mapping. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Local Climate Zone; PALSAR-2; Polarimetric features; Sentinel-2; Shanghai; Subspace",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087061336

Surabaya as an urban area that contributes to the phenomenon of global warming. The challenges of the City of Surabaya in managing the impacts of climate change need to be further considered. On 21-22 February 2018, the City Government of Surabaya joined the Climate Change Adaptation Workshop. In managing the impacts of climate change, it is necessary to synchronize national, regional and local government policies and create SOPs for climate change adaptation actions. In addition, another priority is spatial planning that takes into account climate change in the context of development. Responding to the suggestions expected from the workshop, this research focuses on assessing risks due to climate change involving institutional aspects. This institutional aspect was taken with the intention of providing recommendations to managers and decision makers in making processes and designing policy analyzes to reduce and adapt to climate change. The results showed that there were six Surabaya City Organizations that were considered to have significant influence and interest in the field of climate change. In addition, historical disaster data on climate change has been derived, which states that disasters in Surabaya include floods, whirlwinds (extreme weather), drought, and forest and land fires. Based on the Likert scale scoring calculation results, it is known that the Surabaya City Organizations resilience a with the CDRI concept is 4.47. This figure indicates that the resilience level of the City of Surabaya is seen from the institutional aspect is relatively high and needs to be maintained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Decision making; Disasters; Environmental protection; Global warming; Planning; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Calculation results; Climate change adaptation; Decision makers; Disaster resiliences; Historical disasters; Institutional aspects; Research focus; Spatial planning; Urban planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092352534

In order to meet these conditions, it is necessary to develop not only efficient thermal insulation materials, but also more environmentally friendly ones. This paper describes an experiment in which two types of bio-polyols were obtained using transesterification of used cooking oil with triethanolamine (UCO_TEA) and diethylene glycol (UCO_DEG). The bio-polyols were next used to prepare low-density rigid polyurethane (PUR) foams. It was found that the bio-polyols increased the reactivity of the PUR systems, regardless of their chemical structures. The reactivity of the system modified with 60% of the diethylene glycol-based bio-polyol was higher than in the case of the reference system. The bio-foams exhibited apparent densities of 41-45 kg/m3, homogeneous cellular structures and advantageous values of the coefficient of thermal conductivity. It was observed that the higher functionality of bio-polyol UCO_TEA compared with UCO_DEG had a beneficial effect on the mechanical and thermal properties of the bio-foams.

Here, we evaluate the potential impacts of projected climatic change on prescribed burning in the south-eastern United States by applying a set of burn window criteria that capture temperature, relative humidity and wind speed to projections from an ensemble of Global Climate Models under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Regionally, the percentage of suitable days for burning changes little during winter but decreases substantially in summer owing to rising temperatures by the end of the 21st century compared with historical conditions. Management implications of such changes for six representative land management units include seasonal shifts in burning opportunities from summer to cool-season months, but with considerable regional variation. We contend that the practical constraints of rising temperatures on prescribed fire activities represent a significant future challenge and show that even meeting basic burn criteria (as defined today) will become increasingly difficult over time, which speaks to the need for adaptive management strategies to prepare for such changes. © 2020 Journal Compilation","coastal plain; managed fire regimes; piedmont; statistical downscaling; wildfire",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085941285

The assimilation significantly pushes the model AOD and PM2.5 toward the observations with the largest changes below 5 km altitude in the fire source regions (northeastern Pakistan, Punjab, and Haryana) as well as the receptor New Delhi. WRF-Chem forecast with MODIS AOD assimilation, aerosol-radiation feedback turned on, and real-time fire emissions reduce the mean bias by 88–195 μg/m3 (70–86%) with the largest improvement during the peak air pollution episode of 6–13 November 2017. Aerosol-radiation feedback contributes ~21%, ~25%, and ~24% to reduction in mean bias of the first, second, and third days of PM2.5 forecast. Persistence fire emission assumption is found to work really well, as the accuracy of PM2.5 forecasts driven by persistent fire emissions was only 6% lower compared to those driven by real fire emissions. Aerosol-radiation feedback extends the benefits of assimilating satellite AOD beyond PM2.5 forecasts to surface temperature forecast with a reduction in the mean bias of 0.9–1.5°C (17–30%). These results demonstrate that air quality forecasting can benefit substantially from satellite AOD observations particularly in developing countries that lack resources to rapidly build dense air quality monitoring networks. ©2020.

To support high-speed IoT devices, wavelength division multiplexed passive optical networks (WDM-PON) is one of the most promising and most commonly used technology in optical distribution network (ODN). With the exponential growth of WDM-PON and its applications, energy consumption, operational expenditure (OPEX), communication latency between different users, reliability of service etc. are becoming the most challenging issues to implement the WDM-PON networks in the smart cities. In this paper, we propose a ring based latency aware and energy efficient PON architecture which is capable of providing point to point downstream, upstream, inter-ODN, intra-ODN and inter-ODN broadcasting transmission. Proposed architecture reduces the significant amount of transmission latency, energy consumption, operational expenditure and reduces the emission of Green House Gases (GHGs). The architecture also reduces the downstream and upstream bandwidth consumption by avoiding the transmission of the inter-ODN signal to optical line terminal (OLT) and back to destined ODN.

Thus, the main risks for 2020 are those related to the environment and occupying the first positions in the rating for the last three years (in particular, in 2019, the risk of extreme weather events). The gradual increase in awareness of this risk has led to a change in the sentiment of both producers and consumers. Experts assessed climate change as a major risk in 2019, outpacing cyberattacks, financial instability and terrorism. Thus, to mitigate this risk in 2020 and future periods, the global business community should implement circular «designs», reducing resource use and prioritizing low carbon materials. The potential effects of the transition to a circular economy on greenhouse gas emissions are significant, mainly achieved by improving resource efficiency, increasing the useful life of buildings and assets, increasing recycling and reuse, and completely reducing primary raw material use. Thus, the circular economy can be seen as an effective strategy for promoting climate change mitigation. The poly-paradigmatic nature of economic knowledge from the standpoint of the existential nature of the imperatives of economic development in the context of responsibility to the global future causes certain paradigm shifts, and greening is the mainstream and imperative that reflects the heterodox beginning of the theorico-cyclological methodology. Multidisciplinary epistemological perspective for the analysis of economic phenomena from the standpoint of the new pragmatism in the context of the «triad» of sustainability (economic, social and ecological components), distinguishes the humanitarianism of economic science and positions «in the foreground» the role of values in the economic activity of people and society (acceleration of exploitation of natural resources; climate change; the formation of a new environmental order; environmental and food security) and the dominant paradigm formation (exceeding the environmental limit; Paris agreement; changing public sentiment of fossil producers and businesses; global economic losses; UN sustainable development goals with strong circular practices; WTO involvement in supporting new technologies, minimizing waste production and promoting circular trade). The methodological features of the paradigm of the global inclusive circular economy from the standpoint of postmodernism are the strengthening of socio-humanistic orientations (reflecting its ideology and creating the basis for an inclusive-oriented society); ontological nonlinearity (emphasizes circularity); consensus (the need for a global consensus to achieve a goal) emulated using the economic-mathematical method. According to the proposed methodological approach, the integrated index of development of the global inclusive circular economy has been calculated for 28 countries of the world, including Germany, USA, China and South Africa. We substantiate the conceptual provisions of the theoretical and methodological model of the global inclusive circular economy, namely: system characteristics (sustainable development; stability; inclusive growth; expanding opportunities for equity; equal access to resources and distribution of benefits) and the principles of circular self-organization (conservation of resources for future and rationalization of their use; counteraction of management dysfunction), determined by criterion constraints of corporate culture, communications in global value chains, dominance of linear economy, unformed circular value of goods and low quality of recycled products, limited implementation of institutional, informational, financial, financial pilot circular business projects and programs. Our approach made it possible to substantiate the basic concepts of forming a paradigm of the global inclusive circular economy: global value chains (supply of secondary raw materials), sharing platforms, circular trade, circular product life cycle, circular cities and circular cores. © 2020 Institute of Society Transformation.

While making assumptions explicit is the standard in all disciplinary sciences, some assumptions in the context of societal challenges can only be usefully unveiled, discussed, and verified from the perspective of other research disciplines. Results from successful interdisciplinary collaborations are then more accessible and more generalizable to actors beyond the confines of the academic community. We aim to illustrate how interdisciplinary exchange helps to unveil assumptions in research endeavors and why this is important for successful interdisciplinary collaborations. We therefore follow different stages of the German Priority Program on Climate Engineering (SPP 1689), which we use as an example case of a successful interdisciplinary project. SPP 1689 focused on risks, challenges, and opportunities of Climate Engineering from the perspectives of numerous disciplines. Major results were that the initial assessments of technologies had to be sobered, the consideration of trade-offs is crucial for the potential assessment, and governance issues appeared larger than previously considered. From the reflections of SPP 1689, we conclude with three lessons learned: (1) The project profited from egalitarian organizational structures and communicative practices, preventing the predominance from single disciplines. (2) Within the project continuous efforts were undertaken to foster interdisciplinary understanding. In addition, the flexible project structure allowed for the accommodation of research needs arising as a result of these exchanges. (3) SPP 1689 offered early career researchers a platform for professional exchange on common challenges and best practices of being a part of an interdisciplinary research project. © 2020, The Author(s).","Assumptions; Carbon dioxide removal; Climate engineering; Communication; Interdisciplinarity; Radiation management","Economic and social effects; Academic community; Different stages; Initial assessment; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Interdisciplinary project; Interdisciplinary research; Organizational structures; Project structure; Engineering research; interdisciplinary approach; research work; risk assessment; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087803131

This compound was chosen because it was effective in reducing exhaust emissions from light duty diesel vehicles. Emission tests (CO, HC, NOx and PM) of the city bus were performed over SORT (Standardized On-Road Tests) cycles using portable exhaust gas analyzers-PEMS. Significant differences in the emission of exhaust components were observed in individual SORT cycles. The level of road emissions reduced as the traffic smoothness increased, i.e. from the SORT 1 to SORT 3 cycle. The largest reduction in bus emissions associated with the use of the oxygenated additive (triethylene glycol dimethyl ether) applies to carbon monoxide and ranges from 50% for the SORT 3 cycle up to 90% for the SORT 1.

In addition, the GHG Phase 2 legislation and also phased-in regulations in the EU enforce a continuous reduction in CO2 emissions resp. fuel consumption. In order to meet such low NOX emission limits, a rapid heat-up of the exhaust after-Treatment system (EATS) is inevitable. However, the required thermal management results in increased fuel consumption, i.e. CO2 emissions as shown in numerous previous works also by the authors. A NOX-CO2 trade-off for cumulative cycle emissions can be observed, which can be optimized by using more advance technologies on the engine and/or on the EATS side. In the present study a systematic investigation is carried out by means of model-based holistic approach targeting the definition of a high efficiency engine layout and optimal thermal management calibration. First, the potentials of combustion process optimization (compression ratio, peak firing pressure) and of turbocharger efficiency increase are quantified aiming engine efficiency increase. Afterwards, using holistic engine and EAT concept development approach, conventional and advanced EATS layouts are tested. The advanced EATS layout consist of a close-coupled dual-stage SCR system. In order to explore the benefits of each layouts, the engine heat-up calibrations are varied and the resulting, cumulative NOX-CO2 emissions of the investigated cycle are compared and evaluated. Multiple improvement measures for both engine and EAT system are discussed and an outlook of future powertrain concepts is given. © 2020 SAE International.

In adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), branchial NECs are presumed to mediate the cardiorespiratory reflexes associated with hypoxia or hypercapnia, whereas in larvae, there is indirect evidence linking cutaneous NECs to hypoxic hyperventilation and hypercapnic tachycardia. No study yet has examined the ventilatory response of larval zebrafish to hypercapnia, and regardless of developmental stage, the signaling pathways involved in CO2 sensing remain unclear. In the mouse, a background potassium channel (TASK-2) contributes to the sensitivity of chemoreceptor cells to CO2. Zebrafish possess two TASK-2 channel paralogs, TASK-2 and TASK-2b, encoded by kcnk5a and kcnk5b, respectively. The present study aimed to determine whether TASK-2 channels are expressed in NECs of larval zebrafish and whether they are involved in CO2 sensing. Using immunohistochemical approaches, TASK-2 protein was observed on the surface of NECs in larvae. Exposure of larvae to hypercapnia caused cardiac and breathing frequencies to increase, and these responses were blunted in fish experiencing TASK-2 and/or TASK-2b knockdown. The results of these experiments suggest that TASK-2 channels are involved in CO2 sensing by NECs and contribute to the initiation of reflex cardiorespiratory responses during exposure of larvae to hypercapnia.

The two-modes approach is known from multi-temperature models. Its basic assumption is that vibrational energy of the CO2 molecule which depends on 4 quantum numbers can be approximated by a function of only 2 numbers. Subsequently, vibrational states of CO2 with the same quantum numbers of the effective symmetric and asymmetric mode can be grouped into one combined state. The paper presents the calculation of the average probabilities of transitions between combined states based on the Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld theory.

Major contributors to winter PM2.5 are direct primary emissions of wood smoke from residential wood combustion, primary emissions from motor vehicles, gaseous NOx emissions leading to particulate nitrate, and primary and secondary sources of particulate sulfate. A number of communities in the Northwest U.S. now have long data records of chemically speciated PM2.5 from which receptor-based source apportionment can be performed. This work uses receptor-based source apportionment on data from these monitoring sites to evaluate changes in the major contributors to winter PM2.5 over the available monitoring time span. Data from 9 sites are analyzed in this work using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) source apportionment model. Each site was modeled individually rather than grouping the data from multiple sites. All sites had data through the summer of 2018, with most sites having 11 years of data and one site having 9 years of data. The number of PMF factors identified was between 5 and 10, depending on the site. Associations were made between PMF factors and PM2.5 sources based on comparison of PMF factor chemical profiles with published source test data and source profiles identified in other published studies. The most common factors found were: fresh wood smoke, aged wood smoke, soil dust, gas engines, mixed – gas engines and nitrate, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium nitrate. In this work, total wood smoke was identified as the combined contribution of fresh and aged wood smoke, and winter season data was defined as encompassing the last two months of a year and the first two months of the next year. To evaluate changes over time, average winter season PM2.5 measurements, major PM2.5 chemical components, and PMF factor results for the winter seasons of 2007–2009 were compared with the winter seasons of 2015–2017. The result for total 3-year average winter season PM2.5 was a decrease between 2% and 29% at the 9 sites, and the decreases were statistically significant at 3 sites. However, total winter season wood smoke contributions to PM2.5 decreased at every site between the two 3-year periods and the decreases were statistically significant at 8 of 9 sites, with decreases from 48% to 74% at those 8 sites. All PMF factors associated with ammonium nitrate (identified at 5 of 9 sites) decreased a statistically significant 11%–54% between the two 3-year winter season periods. All PMF factors associated with ammonium sulfate (identified at 7 of 9 sites) decreased a statistically significant 27%–81% between the two 3-year winter season periods. In contrast to the significant reductions in PM2.5 from PMF factors related to wood smoke, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, PMF factors associated with gas engines increased from 6% to 226% between the two 3-year winter season periods. Increases in PM2.5 contributions from gas engine related factors explain why overall average winter season PM2.5 had more modest percent reductions compared to the percent reductions for wood smoke, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate factors between the two 3-year winter season periods. © 2020","Mobile sources; PM2.5; Positive matrix factorization; Residential wood combustion; Source apportionment","Factorization; Gas engines; Monitoring; Nitrates; Sulfur compounds; Wood; Anthropogenic sources; Chemical component; Particulate nitrate; Particulate sulfates; Positive Matrix Factorization; Primary emissions; Residential wood combustions; Source apportionment; Smoke; ammonium nitrate; ammonium sulfate; nitrate; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; chemical composition; nitrogen oxides; particle size; particulate matter; seasonality; smoke; sulfate; traffic emission; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; Article; chemical composition; combustion; comparative study; diesel engine; dust; motor vehicle; particulate matter; priority journal; smoke; summer; United States; wind speed; winter; wood; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086907372

The present study used greenhouse-based bioremediation to investigate the effects of natural attenuation (NA) and necrophytoremediation (addition of pea straw (PS)) on hydrocarbon degradation, toxicity and the associated bacterial community structure and composition in diesel-contaminated soil. A significant reduction in total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration was detected in both treatments; however, PS-treated soil showed more rapid degradation (87%) after 5 months together with a significant reduction in soil toxicity (EC50 = 91 mg diesel/kg). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed an increase in the number of 16S rRNA and alkB genes in the PS-amended soil. Substantial shifts in soil bacterial community were observed during the bioremediation, including an increased abundance of numerous hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. The bacterial community shifted from dominance by Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria in the original soil to Actinobacteria during bioremediation. The dominance of two genera of bacteria, Sphingobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, in both NA- and PS-treated soil demonstrated changes occurring within the soil bacterial community through the incubation period. Additionally, pea straw itself was found to harbour a diverse hydrocarbonoclastic community including Luteimonas, Achromobacter, Sphingomonas, Rhodococcus and Microbacterium. At the end of the experiment, PS-amended soil exhibited reduced ecotoxicity and increased bacterial diversity as compared with the NA-treated soil. These findings suggest the rapid growth of species stimulated by the bioremediation treatment and strong selection for bacteria capable of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons during necrophytoremediation.

Infection-induced declined net photosynthesis rate and the related changes in transpiration rate, the intracellular CO2 concentration, and prolonged reduction in maximal PSII quantum yield (Fv/Fm), accompanied by an increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), were observed only in the infected leaves, along with full disease symptom development. Infection severely affected the ROS/redox homeostasis at the cellular level and in chloroplasts. Superoxide dismutase, ascorbate, and tocopherol were preferentially induced at the early stage of pathogenesis, whereas catalase, glutathione, and the ascorbate–glutathione cycle enzymes were activated later. Systemic leaves retained their net photosynthesis rate and the changes in the antioxidant system were partly like those in the infected leaves, although they occurred later and were less intense. Rebalancing of ascorbate and glutathione in systemic leaves generated a specific redox signature in chloroplasts. We suggest that it could be a regulatory element playing a role in integrating photosynthesis and redox regulation of stress, aimed at increasing the defense capacity and maintaining the growth of the infected plant. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, a 3-year observational experiment was conducted from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017, in Chengdu, southwest China. NSA pollution characteristics, chemical conversion generation, emission reduction control sensitivity and pollutant regional transport characteristics were analyzed. NSA are the most important chemical compositions of particles with aerodynamic equivalent diameter 2:5 m in ambient air (PM2:5), and the contribution of nitrate to the accumulation of PM2:5 concentration is greater than that of sulfate and ammonium. NSA also have obvious characteristics of annual, monthly, seasonal, diurnal and weekly variations. Through observation data and model simulation, it was also found that the existence of an aerosol aqueous environment plays an important role in the formation and existence of NSA. Sensitivity analysis between NSA found that controlling NO3 and SO2 4 plays an important role in reducing the contribution of NSA to PM2:5, which also implies that the current control of NOx and SO2 is important for improving air pollution. Combined with meteorological conditions and potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis, local emissions and regional emissions of pollutants are found to have important impacts on Chengdu s atmospheric environment.

In this context marine algae have recently been described as a possible source of CH4 in surface waters. In the present study we investigated the effects of temperature and light intensity (including daylength) on CH4 formation from three widespread marine algal species Emiliania huxleyi, Phaeocystis globosa, and Chrysochromulina sp. Rates of E. huxleyi increased by 210% when temperature increased in a range from 10°C to 21.5°C, while a further increase in temperature (up to 23.8°C) showed reduction of CH4 production rates. Our results clearly showed that CH4 formation of E. huxleyi is controlled by light: When light intensity increased from 30 to 2,670 μmol m−2 s−1, CH4 emission rates increased continuously by almost 1 order of magnitude and was more than 1 order of magnitude higher when the daylength (light period) was extended from 6/18 hr light-dark cycle to continuous light. Furthermore, light intensity is also an important factor controlling CH4 emissions of Chrysochromulina sp. and P. globosa and could therefore be a species-independent regulator of phytoplankton CH4 production. Based on our results, we might conclude that extensive blooms of E. huxleyi could act as a main regional source of CH4 in surface water, since blooming of E. huxleyi is related to the seasonal increase in both light and temperature, which also stimulate CH4 production. Under typical global change scenarios, E. huxleyi will increase its CH4 production in the future. ©2020.

This model predicts that wind-accessible, climatically analogous sites will be scarcer in locations such as the tropics and on the leeward sides of mountain ranges, implying that the wind-dispersed biota in these landscapes may be more vulnerable to future climate change.

Sustainable development is a core principle of the Spatial Planning Law of the Republic of Lithuania since 2014. Special attention to the management of climate change is given at the national and municipal levels, and recent legislative initiatives are proof of this. Methodology – this analysis is based on evaluating the main applicable documents and introduced amendments. The theoretical publications, statistical data, and judicial practice are also observed while interpreting the given normative rules. This paper specifically analyses the legal requirements enshrined in Lithuanian law that are intended to foster sustainable development. New amendments to manage climate change are also analysed. In addition, the solutions of the Vilnius Master Plan are presented, as they introduced the principle of sustainable development before it became a national rule, as well as climate change management measures. Findings – the analysis reveals that national regulation only sets out the principles for spatial planners, and it is left to local governments to make final decisions on what exact measures may be introduced for the purpose of ensuring sustainable development and climate change management via spatial planning. This is a cause for concern and should lead to renewed calls for a coherent and ambitious approach to introduce the specific measures at the national level – at least in the by – laws to ensure consistent and unified application. Despite the vague wording employed by the regulations, the Vilnius Master Plan actively encourages the introduction of measures which could help in ensuring sustainable development and climate change management via spatial planning. Originality/value – this article is the first to analyse the newly adopted principle of sustainable development in the light of climate change management via spatial planning regulations in the Republic of Lithuania. In addition, the present analysis contributes to worldwide studies on sustainable development and climate change measures by filling a gap from Lithuania’s side, showing recent regulatory changes as a good practice to other jurisdictions. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Climate change; Environmental law; Land use law; Spatial planning; Sustainable development; Urban planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090254641

However, a large literature has developed during the past century indicating that animal agriculture is responsible for numerous negative environmental impacts. In this paper, I review literature on some of the environmental impacts of two different livestock management approaches, industrial-conventional (IC) management and regenerative-multi-paddock (RM) management. I consider the null hypothesis that the environmental impacts of ruminant livestock production are independent of the approach used to manage animals and grazing lands. It evident in the literature that managed grazing ecosystems are complex, and for certain system attributes, such as forage quality and plant community structure, the better management system is difficult to discern. In other areas definitive differences in impacts appear clearly management dependent. For instance, the soils of RM grasslands exhibit higher microbial biomass and diversity, and higher fungal: bacterial ratios than IC soils. Several impacts associated with livestock production appear to have less to do with grazing, per se, and more to do with support factors, such as feed production and manure management. The compilation of data from numerous sources suggests that RM management may reduce blue withdrawals and GHG emissions by &gt;50%, relative to IC management. Accumulating data also suggest that a significant portion of anthropogenic CO2-eq emissions can be removed from the atmosphere and stored in the soil by applying RM management practices. Finally, it is suggested that while research design may affect the outcomes of some studies, the quality and quantity of the science may not resolve many discrepancies in the data. It is suggested that the viability and sustainability of animal agriculture may depend upon broadening the goals of practitioners to include both food production and the restoration and protection of agricultural ecosystem services. © Copyright © 2020 Kleppel.","conventional livestock management; industrial agriculture; livestock impacts; meat production; multi-paddock livestock management; regenerative agriculture",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091931277

However, this region is vulnerable to climate change which is likely to impact the livelihoods of millions of marginal and small holders. Agriculture is not only impacted by climate change but also one of the major contributor to global warming in South Asia. As compared to the traditional practices, Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices help mitigate the impact of climate change through a reduction in carbon emission and conservation of natural resources. In this article, a meta-analysis of the important studies was done for the impact of CA on carbon sequestration, water use, greenhouse gas emissions and cost and net returns. Carbon sequestration potential was found significantly higher in the CA practices (+16.30%) as compared to the conventional tillage. Inclusion of legumes, clay-rich soils, irrigation and presence of soil cover are the major drivers for higher carbon sequestration potential in the region. Additionally, a significant amount of water was also saved as CA practices led to relatively less consumption of water over the conventional tillage. Further, the adoption of CA based management practices resulted in a substantial reduction of CO2 (−4.28%) and CH4 (−25.67%) emissions both in aerobic and anaerobic soil conditions. However, the emission of NO2 and N2O–N gases were higher under the CA, +14.45 and + 5.20% respectively. Nevertheless, the emission of N2O–N was lesser in CA (−1.78%) under aerobic conditions whereas it is increased under anaerobic soil conditions (+12.15%). The adoption of CA practices resulted in higher returns and lower costs as compared to the conventional system. Although CA has significant environmental benefits, the study suggests judicious use of inorganic inputs under CA for managing the impact of climate change in South Asia. Therefore, CA is a sustainable agricultural practice that deserves outscaling in South Asia for mitigation and adaptation of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Conservation agriculture; Greenhouse gas emission; South asia","alternative agriculture; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation tillage; greenhouse gas; meta-analysis; oxic conditions; soil cover; agriculture; Article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; climate change; conventional tillage; economic aspect; environmental protection; South Asia; water supply; Asia; greenhouse gas; meta analysis; soil; South Asia; Agriculture; Asia; Carbon Sequestration; Greenhouse Gases; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084828436

Commonly, thermal sulfur infiltration into mesoporous carbon was a representative method for S−C composites; however, these had some problems such as pore blocking or nonuniform deposition of sulfur. Electrochemical sulfur impregnation without chemical or thermal infiltration reduced the preprocess time and enabled efficient polysulfide diffusion into the carbon pores. As the soluble polysulfides are smaller and more mobile than solid-state sulfur, they could be physically or chemically adsorbed into the pores of the carbon additives. This approach enhanced the cycle stability and rate performance of the batteries.

In this article, we explore two CDR technologies: soil carbon sequestration (SCS), and carbon capture and storage (CCS) integrated with cellulosic biofuel production. These CDR technologies are applied as part of decentralized biorefinery systems processing corn stover and unfertilized switchgrass grown in riparian zones in the Midwestern United States. Cover crops grown on corn-producing lands are chosen from the SCS approach, and biogenic CO2 in biorefineries is captured, transported by pipeline, and injected into saline aquifers. The decentralized biorefinery system using SCS, CCS, or both can produce carbon-negative cellulosic biofuels (≤-22.2 gCO2 MJ-1). Meanwhile, biofuel selling prices increase by 15-45% due to CDR costs. Economic incentives (e.g., cover crop incentives and/or a CO2 tax credit) can mitigate price increases caused by CDR technologies. A combination of different CDR technologies in decentralized biorefinery systems is the most efficient method for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and its total GHG mitigation potential in the Midwest is 0.16 GtCO2 year-1.

To simulate mineral carbonation reactors with complex gas–liquid–solid interacting flow patterns, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based compartmental model was developed. In the model, the reactors were divided into hundreds of zones, and each zone was assumed to be a single homogeneous reactor. Mass and heat balance equations were formulated for each zone and the entire reactor, separately. The mass flow rates between adjacent zones and initial CO2 holdup at each zone were calculated from CFD simulations, and a kinetic model, which included all the involved reactions, was built in MATLAB. The total CO2 removal efficiency, pH, and temperature changes as well as concentration profiles of CO2 and other species were predicted during batch operations. To validate the performance of the model, the simulated results were compared with the real operation data from the pilot- and industrial-scale plants. The errors at steady states were within 7% without any adjustable parameters.

Excess nitrogen inputs from rivers result in low dissolved oxygen bottom waters, or hypoxia, which has negative ecological and economic impacts. Additionally, warming surface water temperatures increase stratification, further preventing oxygenation of bottom waters. Land use management policies have been implemented to improve water quality, but the solution must be regionally appropriate, accounting for the uniqueness and complexity of each watershed. In this study, we implement an AutoML pipeline to find the best model and associated parameters for predicting total nitrogen concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay, USA watershed from geographic and climate predictors. The highest performing model was a stacked ensemble model, H2O AutoML Regression GLM, with an R2 of 0.91 and RMSE of 0.48 on the test data. This model outperformed deep learning models, which were included in the 60+ models evaluated in the AutoML pipeline. Since feature importance cannot be deciphered from ensemble models, we looked to the best performing non-ensemble model for the most important predictors. The three most important features in the H2O AutoML XGBoost model (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.69) were geographic indicators (i.e. longitude, latitude and watershed code) while climate variables were poor predictors. Our results point to the importance of location and land use within a subwatershed for modeling watershed nitrogen concentrations. While these findings provide insight into watershed dynamics for our region of study, we hypothesize that the best performing model, model performance and/or feature importance may be different for other geographies. © 2020 ACM.","automl; feature importance; land use; nutrient; pollution; stacked ensemble; water quality; watershed","Biochemical oxygen demand; Deep learning; Dissolved oxygen; Land use; Nitrogen; Pipelines; Surface waters; Water quality; Watersheds; Ecological and economic; Important features; Land-use management; Low dissolved oxygen; Nitrogen concentrations; Nutrient concentrations; Surface water temperature; Water quality impairment; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099781801

Additionally, this paper examines the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The result of the DAG reveals that total biomass energy consumption and GDP have a unidirectional contemporaneous causal relationship with total energy CO2 emissions. Based on the results of the ARDL, we find that a 1% increase in per capita total biomass energy consumption causes a 0.65% reduction in per capita total energy CO2 emissions in the long-run. This finding implies that expanding the usage of biomass is one way to reduce and control greenhouse gases in the US. Moreover, we find that the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis is satisfied for the US case. Findings from this study suggest that energy policies should stimulate an increase of biomass production for reducing total energy CO2. © 2020 The Society for Policy Modeling","Autoregressive distributed lag model; Biomass; CO2 emissions; Directed acyclic graph; Environmental Kuznets curve",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089814591

As a way to minimize computation cost without undermining estimation precision, this study proposes an innovative link screening methodology, using a supervised machine learning random forest (RF) classification algorithm, that eliminates links with zero or negligible concentration contributions from modeled link-receptor combinations. The study uses 79,328 receptor-link pairs randomly selected from the Atlanta Metropolitan area to train and test the model. The final link screening model employs six variables, including link attributes, urban variables, and meteorological conditions. The RF classifier successfully identifies the small portion of links that contribute more than 95% of concentrations that are estimated by the same model using every link-receptor pair. The efficiency and precision of the smaller dispersion model runs developed using the RF classifier (the ‘reduced-link’ model) are compared to the dispersion modeling without the link-screening process (the ‘whole-link’ model) for downtown Atlanta and northwest Atlanta. Results show that AERMOD run-times for reduced-link models are only 0.2%–1.1% of the times required for whole-link models, because far fewer links are handled during the AERMOD simulation (0.1%–0.6% of links in the whole-link model). The correlation between estimates of the two models ranges from 95% to 97%, depending upon the density of the road network, link activity, link emission rates, meteorology, etc. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Near-road dispersion modeling; Supervised link screening (SLS); Transportation and air quality conformity","Air quality; Decision trees; Dispersions; Particles (particulate matter); Roads and streets; Supervised learning; Classification algorithm; Dispersion modeling; Estimation precision; Meteorological condition; Microscale dispersion; Particulate Matter; Screening process; Supervised machine learning; Quality control; air quality; concentration (composition); machine learning; metropolitan area; numerical model; particulate matter; simulation; supervised classification; air quality; article; classification algorithm; classifier; controlled study; highway; meteorology; particulate matter; random forest; randomized controlled trial; simulation; supervised machine learning; Atlanta; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086459688

As passenger cars are one of the dominant CO2 emitters in the transport sector, governments and the automobile industry have implemented various countermeasures, including decarbonization of fuels, more energy efficient vehicles, and transport demand management. However, the total impact of these measures in the long term remains unclear. This study aims to clarify the CO2 emissions reductions from passenger cars by 2050 in 1727 municipalities in Japan under a declining population. To estimate CO2 emissions, we model travel behavior and traffic situations reflecting the regional conditions of the municipalities, including population density and accessibility to public transport for the base year 2010. Assuming plausible scenarios for future populations and automobile technologies, we estimate CO2 emissions from passenger cars. We estimate that CO2 emissions will decline by 64-70% between 2010 and 2050, with automobile technologies playing the largest role. We find that the impact of urban compaction is marginal at the national level but varies by municipality. These results imply that, given regional variations, all countermeasures, including technology and demand management, must be used to achieve the long-term target of CO2 emissions reductions. © 2020 by the author.","Aging society; Climate change; CO2 emissions; Compact city; Low carbon technologies; Passenger car; Population decline; Travel behavior","accessibility; automobile industry; carbon emission; demography; emission control; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; population density; public transport; travel behavior; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090571143

Such a process has potential to eliminate the conventional sorbent regeneration step normally required between capture and utilization, which is highly energy-intensive. We previously reported the scientific feasibility of such an integrated process, which was studied as a first exploration-of-concept in a nonaqueous, Li-based cell containing 2-ethoxyethylamine, LiClO4 salt, and dimethyl sulfoxide solvent. The amine-modified electrolyte activated otherwise-inactive CO2 for electrochemical reduction at voltages up to â2.9 V versus Li/Li+ at room temperature, and kinetically facilitated conversion of CO2 to lithium carbonate, indicating that amines can successfully act as electrochemical mediators. However, much remained to be understood about the functionality and compatibility of amine capture chemistry in nonaqueous electrochemical environments containing alkali salts, as well as the kinetics of conversion, particularly at temperatures where thermal desorption via N-C bond cleavage can become a competing issue. Here, we investigated the conversion (discharge) reaction in an elevated temperature range (40 °C < T < 70 °C) to evaluate these points. We find that CO2-amine chemistry is chemically and electrochemically stable in nonaqueous electrolytes (containing both amine and inorganic salt) at these higher temperatures, and that electrochemical conversion kinetics of CO2-loaded amines are competitive and enhanced at higher temperature, especially in the low-current regime. However, new issues arise from the Li anode as temperature increases. These issues can be directly addressed by identifying new amine-solvent combinations, such as diispropylamine in a glyme-based electrolyte (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)) reported herein. These results indicate feasibility to pursue amine-facilitated conversion of CO2 over flexible temperature conditions, while also reporting for the first time that additional amine structures are active for integrated capture-conversion processes, broadening the parameter space for further research.

Thin- to thick-bedded Eocene limestone exhibits wackestone, packstone, mudstone, and grainstone texture and comprises larger benthic forams such as Nummulite, Assilina, Lockhartia, Discocyclina, Orbitolites and Operculina. The accumulation of the strata occurred in lagoon, inner to deeper shelf. The microfacies and textural variations revealed stable shallow shelf conditions in early Eocene. The marine sedimentation ceased in Hazara and Salt ranges, but Kohat and Sulaiman regions remained under water during middle Eocene. The deposition of Habib Rahi Formation in deeper shelf attests to local scale normal faulting due to the northward movement of the Indian Plate. The Eocene reservoir zones were sourced by Patala and Ghazij Formations and capped by thick cover of fluvial shale, establishing favourable conditions for stratigraphic traps. Thick limestone packages of foraminiferal wackestone/packstone and dolomitized/dolomitic wackestone microfacies are regarded as estimable targets for hydrocarbons exploration in the region. Several diagenetic processes were observed in the studied limestone which includes: micritization, dolomitization, neomorphism, cementation, mechanical and chemical compaction, fracturing and dissolution which were caused in marine, meteoric and burial diagenetic environments. Compaction was the main factor for the destruction of primary porosity along with cementation effect. The porosity in the limestone was significantly enhanced by late stage dissolution, fractures enclosed by calcite cement and dolomitization. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Diagenesis; Eocene limestone; Hydrocarbon exploration; Microfacies; Pakistan; Shelf morphology","carbonate sediment; cementation; compaction; deposition; diagenesis; Eocene; hydrocarbon exploration; microfacies; sedimentation; stratigraphy; Pakistan; Assilina; Discocyclina; Foraminifera; Lockhartia; Operculina (Foraminiferida)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086235214

It is also shown that at sufficiently low values of pressure of injection of carbon dioxide and pressure at the right boundary of the reservoir, the pressure at the boundary of hydrate formation of carbon dioxide drops below the boiling pressure of carbon dioxide.

SIMS analysis showed that intrinsic carbon incorporation around two orders can be controlled effectively by varying the growth parameters. Defects analysis by cross-sectional cathodoluminescence (X-CL) is demonstrated as a useful analytical technique for unambiguously understanding the effect of incorporation of the intrinsic carbon concentration on the yellow luminescence (YL) and blue luminescence (BL) band intensities. It was inferred from the experimental data that the observed BL and YL intensities are due to the electronic transitions through the isolated CN and CNON complex, respectively. This finding is in contrast to the theoretically published literature that two charged states of CN are responsible for both BL and YL which sought that the BL emission to be always smaller in comparison to YL emission. Our experimental data, for all different growth conditions showed the prominent BL in comparison to YL except for the growth at sufficiently lower temperature which is considered to be more conducive for higher oxygen incorporation into the stoichiometry. This increases the probability of CNON formation which is manifested in the enhancement of YL intensity over BL as the formation energy of CNON complex is lower than the CN defect. Thus, X-CL analysis method can be key to address the challenges of understanding the impurity character in multi-thin layered GaN structures. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Carbon; Defects; III-V semiconductors; Luminescence; Semiconductor doping; Blue luminescence bands; Carbon concentrations; Carbon incorporation; Electronic transition; Lower temperatures; Multi-layered structure; Oxygen incorporation; Yellow luminescence; Gallium nitride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088255353

When integrated into a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant, however, CLC imposes a large indirect energy penalty because the maximum achievable reactor temperature is far below the firing temperature of state-of-the-art gas turbines. This study presents a techno-economic assessment of a CLC plant that circumvents this limitation via an added combustor after the CLC reactors. Without the added combustor, the energy penalty amounts to 11.4%-points, causing a high CO2 avoidance cost of $117.3/ton, which is more expensive than a conventional NGCC plant with post-combustion capture ($93.8/ton) with an energy penalty of 8.1%-points. This conventional CLC plant would also require a custom gas turbine. With an added combustor fired by natural gas, a standard gas turbine can be deployed, and CO2 avoidance costs are reduced to $60.3/ton, mainly due to a reduction in the energy penalty to only 1.4%-points. However, due to the added natural gas combustion after the CLC reactor, CO2 avoidance is only 52.4%. Achieving high CO2 avoidance requires firing with clean hydrogen instead, increasing the CO2 avoidance cost to $96.3/ton when a hydrogen cost of $15.5/GJ is assumed. Advanced heat integration could reduce the CO2 avoidance cost to $90.3/ton by lowering the energy penalty to only 0.6%-points. An attractive alternative is, therefore, to construct the plant for added firing with natural gas and retrofit the added combustor for hydrogen firing when CO2 prices reach very high levels. © 2020 The Author(s)","Carbon capture; Chemical looping combustion; Combustor; Internally circulating reactor; Turbine inlet temperature","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Combustors; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Gas turbines; Gases; Hydrogen; Natural gas; Chemical-looping combustion; Firing temperature; Natural gas combined cycle plants; Natural gas combined cycles; Natural gas combustion; Post-combustion captures; Reactor temperatures; Techno-economic assessment; Natural gasoline plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085310594

Rice-Wheat cropping zone is one of the prone regions that use water coming from upstream of the Indus Basin in Pakistan. In this study Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to evaluate the climate change adaptation practices in agriculture. The model was calibrated for the years 2005-2010 at Tarbela and Mangla reservoirs. Reasonably good performance of the calibrated model was achieved by estimated Coefficient of Determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Percent Bias (PBIAS) at 0.87, 0.82 and 10.7 % for Tarbela and 0.70, 0.72 and 15.7 % for Mangla, respectively. Direct-Seeded Rice (DSR) practice for rice and Zero Tillage practice for wheat crops were tested in comparison to conventional methods by using SWAT. In parallel to the modeling approach, the field experiment was performed for two years i.e 2016-17 and-2017-18 at district Sahiwal. The results showed that overall water productivity of DSR was 0.58 and 0.54 kg per m3 in the year 2017 and 2018, respectively, which was higher than Transplanting Rice Practice (TRP) having 0.43 and 0.40 kg per m3 in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In wheat crop trails, overall water productivity of zero tillage was 1.3 and 1.2 kg per m3 in the years 2017 and 2018, respectively. Two climate change scenarios Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 were tested in a combination of best management practices to evaluate climate change adaptation strategies for rice-wheat cropping zones. The results showed that DSR and Zero Tillage practices would be helpful in the future to adapt the expected climate change conditions without compromising the yield and water productivity of rice and wheat crops. © 2020, University of Agriculture.

BC comes from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Local and regional sources of BC exist in High Mountain Asia, such as dry-dung burning for heat and fuel, which occurs in close proximity to snow and glaciers. Local dust or dust transported from the Indo-Gangetic Plain is also present. In the Ganges River Basin, meltwater is dominated by seasonal snow, yet relatively few observations of impurities in seasonal snow exist. To understand sources of impurities and their concentrations for seasonal snow on land, we evaluated multiple lines of evidence to scale up from ground-based measurements in the Dudh Koshi River Basin, a remote headwater basin within the Khumbu Region of Nepal. We obtained ground-based in-situ observations of refractory black carbon (rBC) measured by Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), including size distributions in snow on land. We interpreted these results in the context of concurrent Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations and speciated aerosol optical depth derived from reanalysis products modeled with the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System global aerosol model. We collected snow samples, mostly in the Gokyo Valley, at varying distances from local tea houses along a 2000 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) elevation transect from 3250 to 5299 m a.s.l. rBC concentrations ranged from 3.9 to 76.8 μg-rBC/L-H2O. Although previous data do not exist at these lower elevations, our findings are higher than previous surface snow results at higher elevations in the nearby Khumbu Valley. In general, rBC concentrations were lower in fresh snow than aged snow; concurrent MODIS satellite observations of snow albedo also show smaller impacts from LAIs in visible wavelengths in fresh snow. In aged snow samples, rBC decreased with elevation, as did concurrent MODIS albedo observations. rBC-particle size distributions also shifted to a larger mode for aged snow samples. Results from the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System model indicate anthropogenic and biogenic fine aerosols from biofuel (dry-dung burning) are the primary aerosol species in the atmosphere for the study period, at ∼thrice the concentration of dust and smoke. © Copyright © 2020 Khan, Rittger, Xian, Katich, Armstrong, Kayastha, Dana and McKnight.","black carbon; burning; Nepal; snow; yak-dung","Aerosols; Biofuels; Carbon; Dust; Fossil fuels; Heating; Landforms; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Predictive analytics; Radiometers; Refractory materials; Rivers; Sea level; Size distribution; Smoke; Solar radiation; Tea; Watersheds; Aerosol optical depths; Ground based measurement; Imaging spectroradiometers; In-situ observations; Incomplete combustion; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Satellite observations; Visible wavelengths; Snow; black carbon; burning; concentration (composition); elevation; river basin; snow; Dudh Koshi River; Nepal; Sagarmatha [(ADS) Nepal]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091950299

Accurately modeling the chromosphere is important, even if the transition region and corona are the areas of interest, due to the flow of energy, mass, and radiation through the interconnected layers. We present a solar flare arcade model that aims to bridge the gap between 1D and 3D modeling. Our approach is limited to the synthesis of optically thin emission. Using observed active region loop structures in a 3D domain, we graft simulated 1D flare atmospheres onto each loop, synthesize the emission, and then project that emission onto the 2D observational plane. Emission from SDO/AIA, GOES/XRS, and IRIS/SG Fe xxi λ1354.1 was forward modeled. We analyze the temperatures, durations, mass flows, and line widths associated with the flare, finding qualitative agreement but certain quantitative differences. Compared to observations, the Doppler shifts are of similar magnitude but decay too quickly. They are not as ordered, containing a larger amount of scatter compared to observations. The duration of gradual phase emission from GOES and AIA emission is also too short. Fe xxi lines are broadened, but not sufficiently. These findings suggest that additional physics is required in our model. The arcade model that we show here as a proof of concept can be extended to investigate other lines and global aspects of solar flares, providing a means to better test the coronal response to models of flare energy injection. © 2020.

Published compilations indicate it occurred in two main phases, one centered in the Late Carboniferous (~315 Ma) and the other in the Early Permian (~295 Ma), before waning over the rest of the Early Permian and into the Middle Permian (~290 Ma to 275 Ma), and culminating with the final demise of Alpine-style ice sheets in eastern Australia in the Late Permian (~260 to 255 Ma). Recent global climate modeling has drawn attention to silicate weathering CO2 consumption of an initially high Greater Variscan edifice residing within a static Pangea A configuration as the leading cause of reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentrations below glaciation thresholds. Here we show that the best available and least-biased paleomagnetic reference poles place the collision between Laurasia and Gondwana that produced the Greater Variscan orogen in a more dynamic position within a Pangea B configuration that had about 30% more continental area in the prime equatorial humid belt for weathering and which drifted northward into the tropical arid belt as it transformed to Pangea A by the Late Permian. The presence of widespread equatorial coal basins with Euramerica flora in the footprint of the Greater Variscan orogen during the Late Carboniferous is more compatible with a heterogeneous horst-and-graben morphology, characterized by uplifted crystalline massifs acting as loci of intense silicate weathering CO2 consumption and supplying sediment for proximal basins as venues of organic carbon burial, than a contiguous high mountain plateau, as assumed in recent climate modeling of the LPIA and its demise. The culminating phase of the LPIA occurred at about 275 Ma with the transformation from Pangea B to Pangea A and the attendant reduction of continental area in the equatorial humid belt, as well as with continued northward drift that placed what remained of the Greater Variscan orogen into the Zechstein arid belt in the Late Permian, by which time the geologic landscape was largely blanketed with siliciclastics. The resulting warming from reduced silicate weathering and thus increasing pCO2 was interrupted at 260 Ma with a cooling trend that coincided with emplacement of the Emeishan large igneous province on the equatorial South China Craton as well as the drift of the Cimmerian continental blocks through the equatorial humid belt due to opening of the Neo-Tethys. A return to ice age conditions from the increase in silicate weathering uptake of CO2 was avoided by drift of the Emeishan large igneous province out of the equatorial belt, that in conjunction with massive outgassing from emplacement of the Siberian Traps in high latitudes at the end of the Permian (252 Ma), helped steer the climate system to sustained non-glacial conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Equatorial humid belt; Greater Variscan orogen; Late Paleozoic Ice Age; Organic carbon burial; Pangea A; Pangea B; Silicate weathering CO2 consumption","carbon dioxide; Carboniferous; climate modeling; glaciation; global climate; Gondwana; Hercynian orogeny; large igneous province; Pleistocene; silicate; weathering; Australia; China; Emeishan; Sichuan",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084970349

The reduction of air pollution requires reliable and detailed information regarding air pollution levels. Broad deployment of sensors can provide such information that, in turn, can be used for the establishment of mitigating and regulating acts. However, a prerequisite of such a deployment strategy is using highly durable sensors. The sensors must be able to operate for long periods of time under severe conditions such as high humidity, solar radiation, and dust. In recent years, there has been an ongoing effort to ruggedize sensors for industrial applications with an emphasis on elevated temperature, humidity, and pressure. Some of these developments are adapted for urban air sensing applications. However, protection from dust is based on filters that have not been modified in the last few decades. Such filters clog over time, thus requiring frequent replacement. This editorial presents the need for a consumable-free dust removal device that provides consistent performance without affecting the sensing process. A specific solution for removing dust using a cyclone dust separator is presented. The cyclone dust separator is implemented as an add-on module to protect commercially available sensors. © 2020 by the authors.

Given the complexity of this plan, and the increasing severity of the climate crisis, understanding the relationship between nations' social and environmental outcomes is a critical task for social scientists. Raising national rates of educational attainment is a cornerstone national and international governance goal. This paper integrates Amartya Sen's conceptualization of education as the expansion of human capabilities, with the ecological modernization position that more educated societies may be less ecologically intensive, and tests the resultant hypothesis that gains in education may support global sustainability. Specifically, this study uses two-way fixed effects longitudinal modeling techniques to assess the relationship between national educational attainment and the carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB) for 76 nations between 1960 and 2010. The CIWB ratio is a well-established metric for sustainability within sociology. The findings indicate that gains in educational attainment played an important historical role in reducing the carbon intensity with which nation states produce well-being for its citizens. Less encouraging, from a global sustainability perspective, is the uneven distribution of these desirable effects across regions, and the diminishment of the education effect over time in all regions outside of advanced economies. © The Author(s) 2020.

Without requiring the prearrangement of trip schedules, these programs match on-demand passenger requests with vehicles that have vacant seats. Ride-pooling programs are expected to offer benefits for both individual passengers in the form of cost savings and for society in the form of traffic alleviation and emission reduction. In addition to some exogenous variables and environments for ride-sourcing market, such as city size and population density, three key decisions govern a platform's efficiency for ride-pooling services: trip fare, vehicle fleet size, and allowable detour time. An appropriate discounted fare attracts an adequate number of passengers for ride-pooling, and thus increases the successful pairing rate, while an appropriate allowable detour time prevents passengers from giving up ride-pooling service. This paper develops a mathematical model to elucidate the complex relationships between the variables and decisions involved in a ride-pooling market. We find that the monopoly optimum, social optimum and second-best solutions in both ride-pooling and non-pooling markets are always in a normal regime rather than the wild goose chase (WGC) regime—an inefficient equilibrium in which drivers spend substantial time on picking up passengers. Besides, in general, a unit decrease in trip fare in a ride-pooling market attracts more passengers than would a non-pooling market, because it not only directly increases passenger demand due to the negative price elasticity, but also reduces actual detour time, which in turn indirectly increases ride-pooling passenger demand. As a result, we prove that monopoly optimum, social optimum and second-best solution trip fares in a ride-pooling market are lower than that in a non-pooling market under certain conditions. These theoretical findings are further verified by a set of numerical studies. © 2020","Average detour time; Pricing and equilibrium; Ride-pooling; Ride-sourcing","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Emission control; Population statistics; Complex relationships; Emission reduction; Exogenous variables; Mobility service; Passenger demands; Population densities; Price elasticity; Second-best solutions; Fleet operations; complexity; equilibrium; monopoly; numerical model; pricing policy; public transport; travel demand; Anser",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088393637

The highest methane production potential and energy value is in Muratli district and the least is in Çerkezkoÿ district. It was determined that 42 512.48 MWhyear-1 useful heat energy and in CHP unit 28 614.17 MWhyear-1 electricity energy and 19 784.65 MWhyear-1additional heat energy could be obtained from methane produced by anaerobic fermentation. It is determined that 19 067.56 tons CO2eyear-1 of methane will be released if the manure is stored outdoors. It was determined that methane emission could be reduced by 1 087.13 tons CO2eyear-1 if the nitrogen was used in fermentation residues instead of the chemical fertilizer. Total methane retention in the use of methane for heat purposes will be 31 590.55 tons CO2eyear-1. Methane emissions will be reduced by 12 522.99 tons CO2eyear-1 when used for heat purposes, than the conditions in which the manure is stored outdoors. When methane is used in the CHP unit to provide electricity and heat energy, total methane retention is calculated as 38 467.6 tons CO2eyear-1, and the decrease in methane emission is calculated as 19 400 tons CO2eyear-1. In animal husbandry enterprises that are located in Tekirdag and are commercially producing, evaluation of manure without long-term storage by means of anaerobic digestion is important in terms of meeting of the energy requirement and reducing methane emission and the government should encourage enterprises in this regard. © 2020 Namik Kemal University - Agricultural Faculty.

By encouraging people to migrate from private car use to public transport, city planners can prepare for a super-aged society, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigate negative externalities of private car use such as congestion, accidents, and noise. To achieve these goals, city planners are required to understand whether public transport usage can be increased by improving the service quality and what roles user satisfaction and loyalty play in the process. The relations between service quality, user satisfaction, loyalty, and user frequency have been studied for a long time. However, most of the studies are based on cross-sectional analysis. Cross-sectional analysis is less powerful in detecting causality as it does not show pre–post relations or lagged effects between variables. To investigate causal and non-simultaneous relations among quality, satisfaction, loyalty, and user frequency of public transport, we used data of the Benchmarking in European Service of Public Transport survey from 2001 to 2015 in four European cities, and applied vector auto regressive (VAR) analysis. The result shows that improvement of service quality has positive effects on user’s satisfaction, loyalty, and user frequency and that better satisfaction leads to higher loyalty and user frequency. More importantly, the result also shows that behavioral modification (change in user frequency) occurs with time lag while psychological modifications (changes in satisfaction and loyalty) occur immediately after changes in service quality. The findings suggest that city/transport planners ought to keep improving the service quality of public transport and monitoring the achievement from a long-term perspective. © Copyright © 2020 Kawabata, Ryo, Friman, Olsson, Lättman and Fujii.","behavioral modification; psychological modification; public transport recommendation; public transport satisfaction; public transport user frequency; time-series analysis; vector auto regressive modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091934238

V2G improves smart grid resiliency by enabling two-way communication and electricity flows while reducing the greenhouse gases emission. V2G practicality and stability is strongly based on the exchanged data between electrical vehicles (EVs) and the grid server (GS). However, using communication protocols to exchange vital information leads grid to being vulnerable against various types of attack. To prevent the well-known attacks in V2G network, this paper proposes a privacy-aware authentication scheme that ensures data integrity, confidentiality, users’ identity and location privacy, mutual authentication, and physical security based on physical unclonable function (PUF). Furthermore, the performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art, since EVs only use lightweight cryptographic primitives for every protocol execution. © 2020 by the authors.

The present study aims to understand the intrinsic changes in the composition of soil populations and their functions due to the interaction between long-term fertilization and rainfall fluctuations, seeing whether fertilization history would render the soil microbial communities and their activities more resistant to water stress or not. The experiment was established in 1988 on a typical meadow soil (Vertisols) as a rainfed maize monoculture receiving six elevated rates of NPK annually. The 30-year average annual precipitation of the growing season in this region is 345.1 mm. However, in 2010 rainfall was 106.1% greater than the average, while in 2011 it was 26.5% lower. The results show that long-term NPK fertilization has made the soil microbes more tolerant to changes in soil moisture content resulting from rainfall fluctuations. Soil microbes and their activities, however, did not follow a dose-response relationship of NPK as soil moisture content was the main driving factor. Numbers of total fungi, cellulose decomposing bacteria, and nitrifying bacteria increased as rainfall in 2010 increased. Moreover, microbial biomass carbon in 2010 was almost 2-fold higher than in 2009. Soil respiration in 2010 was 11 and 35% higher than in 2009 and 2011, respectively. Otherwise, high rainfall in 2010 significantly diminished soil NO3 − content and nitrification rate. Soil enzyme activity showed a higher response to soil moisture than the rate of NPK. The highest activity of phosphatase, dehydrogenase, and saccharase was measured in the driest year (2011), while urease displayed its highest activity in 2010. High rates of NPK significantly reduced soil dehydrogenase activity. These results illustrate how important it is for fertilizer programs to be flexible to match expected climate change in order to improve productivity and reduce environmental pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Long-term NPK fertilization; Rainfall fluctuation; Soil enzymes; Soil microorganisms; Soil organic matter; Water stress","beta fructofuranosidase; carbon; cellulose; fertilizer; nitric oxide; oxidoreductase; phosphatase; rain; fertilizer; nitric acid derivative; urease; annual variation; enzyme activity; fertilization (reproduction); microbial community; nutrient dynamics; precipitation intensity; seasonal variation; soil microorganism; Article; bacterial strain; climate change; controlled study; enzyme activity; fungus; growing season; maize; microbial activity; microbial biomass; microbial interaction; monoculture; nitrification; nitrifying bacterium; nonhuman; precipitation; productivity; seasonal variation; soil fertilization; soil management; soil microflora; soil moisture; soil pollution; soil respiration; species composition; vertisol; water stress; biomass; chemistry; dehydration; drug effect; growth, development and aging; Hungary; microbiology; microflora; soil; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Zea mays; Biomass; Dehydration; Fertilizers; Hungary; Microbiota; Nitrates; Nitrification; Rain; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Urease; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085710989

As many countries around the world, Malaysia and other southeast Asian (SEA) countries have also enforced lockdown at different degrees to contain the spread of the disease, which has brought some positive effects on natural environment. Therefore, evaluating the reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and the related governmental measures to restrict its expansion is crucial to assess its impacts on air pollution and economic growth. In this study, we used aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from Himawari-8 satellite, along with tropospheric NO2 column density from Aura-OMI over SEA, and ground-based pollution measurements at several stations across Malaysia, in order to quantify the changes in aerosol and air pollutants associated with the general shutdown of anthropogenic and industrial activities due to COVID-19. The lockdown has led to a notable decrease in AOD over SEA and in the pollution outflow over the oceanic regions, while a significant decrease (27% - 30%) in tropospheric NO2 was observed over areas not affected by seasonal biomass burning. Especially in Malaysia, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations have been decreased by 26–31%, 23–32%, 63–64%, 9–20%, and 25–31%, respectively, in the urban areas during the lockdown phase, compared to the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Notable reductions are also seen at industrial, suburban and rural sites across the country.

In this study, the measured C flux data was used to validate a process-based denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model, and the C budget components were simulated and quantitatively separated in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau alpine wetland ecosystem. Materials and methods: The field observation and 50-year climate data in this site were used as input to simulate soil environment change, plant growth, and C allocation for DNDC. The local parameterization, optimization, calibration, and evaluation of the process-based DNDC model were conducted to improve the simulation accuracy of the model and to separate the C budget components of the Zoige alpine wetland ecosystem on the basis of measured C flux data. Results and discussion: The results show that the modeled and measured values have good consistency on multiple time scales, and the system shows obvious C sink (− 169.16 g C m−2 yr−1). The plant net primary productivity (NPP) accounted for 53% of gross primary productivity (GPP); the plant autotrophic respiration (Ra) accounts for 61% of ecosystem respiration (Re); and the soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) accounts for 51% of soil respiration (Rs). Vegetation has the strongest photosynthesis and net C sequestration capacity during the peak growth stage, while the system appears as a C source in the senescence stage. Moreover, Ra dominated during the first four periods of plant growth, while Rh was dominant in the plant senescence stage. There was a negative correlation between environmental factors and NEE and a significant positive relationship with other C budget variables (P &lt; 0.001). Precipitation and temperature regulate the C budgets and C distribution. When soil temperature and monthly precipitation exceeded 7 °C and 18 mm mon−1, the ecosystem switched from C source to C sink. Conclusions: The optimized DNDC model can capture the dynamics of C budget in Zoige alpine wetland, and there are large differences in the function of C source and sink, C allocation, and relative contribution during different plant growth stages. Our work will provide support to predict the changes in C cycle components at regional scales in future climate change scenarios and to formulate measures to mitigate greenhouse effects. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon allocation; Carbon budgets; DNDC model; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Wetlands","alpine environment; biomass allocation; carbon cycle; carbon flux; climate change; decomposition analysis; denitrification; ecosystem dynamics; model validation; precipitation (climatology); primary production; quantitative analysis; simulation; soil respiration; temperature effect; wetland; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084806387

Improving the reliability of the GHG inventory of the waste incineration sector is an important aspect for the examination of global GHG emission management according to the Paris Agreement. In this study, we introduced a statistical approach to analyze seasonal changes through analysis of waste composition and CO2 concentration in Municipal Solid Waste incinerators and applied the methodology to one case study facility. The analysis results in the case study showed that there was no seasonal variation in waste composition and CO2 concentrations, except for wood. Wood is classified as biomass, and the GHG emissions caused by biomass incineration are reported separately, indicating that the effect of an MSW incinerator on GHG emissions is not significant. Therefore, the seasonal effect of CO2 concentration or waste composition may not be an impact when calculating GHG emissions from case study facilities' MSW incinerators. This study proposed an approach for analyzing factors that affect the GHG inventory reliability by analyzing seasonal characteristics and variation through the statistical analysis, which are used for the calculation of the GHG emissions of an MSW incinerator. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; GHG emission; Seasonal variation; Waste incinerator","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); emission inventory; greenhouse gas; incineration; international agreement; municipal solid waste; seasonal variation; solid waste; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091595810

In cases where ammonia is emitted, we aim to develop an emission factor, calculate annual emission amounts by utilizing activity data (waste incineration amount) applied in air pollutant emission calculations for the waste combustion in Korea, and investigate whether there is a need for emission calculation. As a result of the study, the ammonia emission factor of the MSW incineration facility to be studied was 0.0091 kg NH3/ton, which was 3 times higher than the emission factor in Europe. In the case of emissions, a randomly developed emission factor was applied to confirm the necessity of development of the emission factor, and as a result of the application, it was found to be 22 NH3 ton/year, which is the same number as the annual NH3 emission of the entire waste treatment sector in 2016. Therefore, we believe that MSW incinerator facilities should be recognized as one of the major NH3 omitted emission sources. Moreover, it is evident that there is a need for an NH3 emission factor and emission calculations that reflect the characteristics of Korea. © 2020 by the authors.","Ammonia emission factor; Missing sources; Municipal solid waste; PM2.5 secondary sources","air quality; air sampling; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; combustion; concentration (composition); emission control; incineration; municipal solid waste; Europe; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091555321

However, the complex multicomponent structure of an SEI hinders direct measurement of the elastic moduli of its constituent polymer components. To address this, we proposed a theoretical methodology to determine the elastic modulus. First-principles calculations were performed to study the cross-linking structures and mechanical properties of the polymeric materials formed by the electrochemical reduction of common LIB electrolyte additives, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and vinylene carbonate (VC). The energy barrier corresponding to the 1,2-radical shift in each polymer was used to evaluate its possible reaction mechanism and cross-linking sites. Mechanical analyses of the three-dimensional cross-linked polymers revealed that poly(FEC) and poly(VC) exhibited anisotropic Young's moduli (2.36-6.49 and 6.32-15.35 GPa, respectively). Our calculations confirm the elastic behavior of the polymeric species in the SEI formed by the reduction of VC and FEC on high-capacity Si anodes. The mechanical properties of polymers in the SEI identified herein can contribute to ongoing work on the chemomechanical analysis of SEIs with inorganic/organic nanocomposite structures for achieving mechanically stable SEIs.

Blind spots like these can also arise during economic development forecasting and developing political documents. Previous experience suggests that in previous energy and climate policy documents, the impact assessment of measures in many countries was not effective, as state aid instruments did not consider the blind spots faced by national economies in the post-support phase. Blind spots are problems and situations that the energy sector has to face unexpectedly. This paper presents a methodology for the impact analysis of energy policy instruments, including identification of previously unexpected problems - blind spots. The developed methodology is based on the analysis of energy sector legislation and literature on implementation of energy policies, as well as an assessment of financial support instruments in Latvia. Overall, this paper gives an insight into the importance of energy sector policies evaluation and proposes ways to avoid blind spots in the future using the developed methodology. © 2020 Sintija Kalna, Dace Lauka, Rasa Vaiskunaite, Dagnija Blumberga.","Blind spots; Financial support; Theory-based evaluation","economic development; energy policy; legislation; policy implementation; Latvia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093110811

However, the ability of forests to recover from gold mining activities remains largely unquantified. Forest inventory plots were installed on recently abandoned mines in two major mining regions in Guyana, and re-censused 18 months later, to provide the first ground-based quantification of gold mining impacts on Amazon forest biomass recovery. We found that woody biomass recovery rates on abandoned mining pits and tailing ponds are among the lowest ever recorded for tropical forests, with close to no woody biomass recovery after 3–4 years. On the overburden sites (i.e. areas not mined but where excavated soil is deposited), however, above-ground biomass recovery rates (0.4–5.4 Mg ha−1 year−1) were within the range of those recorded in other secondary forests across the Neotropics following abandonment of pastures and agricultural lands. Our results suggest that forest recovery is more strongly limited by severe mining-induced depletion of soil nutrients, especially nitrogen, than by mercury contamination, due to slowing of growth in nutrient-stripped soils. We estimate that the slow recovery rates in mining pits and ponds currently reduce carbon sequestration across Amazonian secondary forests by ~21,000 t C/year, compared to the carbon that would have accumulated following more traditional land uses such as agriculture or pasture. Synthesis and applications. To achieve large-scale restoration targets, Guyana and other Amazonian countries will be challenged to remediate previously mined lands. The recovery process is highly dependent on nitrogen availability rather than mercury contamination, affecting woody biomass regrowth. The significant recovery in overburden zones indicates that one potential active remediation strategy to promote biomass recovery may be to backfill mining pits and ponds with excavated soil. © 2020 The Authors.

To assess the potential impacts of such variations on CO2 transport, injection, and storage, their characteristics must be known. We investigated variation characteristics in a scenario of a regional CO2 emitter cluster of seven fossil-fired power plants and four industrial plants that feed captured CO2 streams into a pipeline network. Variations of CO2 stream composition and mass flow rates in the pipelines were simulated using a network analysis tool. In addition, the potential effects of changes in the energy mix on resulting mass flow rates and CO2 stream compositions were investigated for two energy mix scenarios that consider higher shares of renewable energy sources or a replacement of lignite by hard coal and natural gas. While resulting maximum mass flow rates in the trunk line were similar in all considered scenarios, minimum flow rates and pipeline capacity utilisation differed substantially between them. Variations in CO2 stream composition followed the power plants' operational load patterns resulting e.g., in stronger composition variations in case of higher renewable energy production. © 2020 by the authors.","CCS; CO2 quality; Energy mix; Impurities; Pipeline transport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092473538

In this study we used an integrated biophysical-economic modeling approach with multi-objective optimization to investigate how alternative land-use and land-management (LULM) options jointly affect economic returns from marketed (timber, energy peat, restoration costs) and non-marketed public goods (water quality, GHG emissions, biodiversity) in a typical landscape dominated by peatlands in northern Finland. We considered several LULM options including no action (the current state will continue), bioenergy wood harvesting, intensive forest management, restoration, and energy peat extraction with three after use options (no after use, reforestation, rewetting). Our study revealed strong tradeoffs between biodiversity and ecosystem services in drained peatlands. Optimal LULM depended strongly on the chosen objectives, i.e. whether marketed or non-marketed goods were preferred. For example, when the objective was carbon neutral land-use, the no action option was mostly chosen, while bioenergy wood harvesting was mostly chosen when the objective was to provide economic and environmental benefits at the same time. The strong tradeoff between biodiversity and ecosystem services indicates that compromises are unavoidable in order to obtain a multi-functional landscape which provides biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and water protection in a cost-effective manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; GHG emissions; Multi-objective optimization; Peatlands; Water quality","biodiversity; biophysics; cost analysis; economic conditions; ecosystem service; environmental economics; integrated approach; land management; land use change; optimization; peatland; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085063752

Research suggests that such car use practices do not only emerge from purely rational economic considerations but also result from symbolic and affective motives, institutionalized mobility cultures, and habitualized mobility practices that have developed and materialized in spatial structures over decades. This paper explores the notion of automobility and its influence on the domestic tourism mobilities of Christchurch residents. It does so by applying Q methodology, an inherently mixed method that involves participants structuring statements by their level of agreement, followed by a range of qualitative post-sorting questions. The statements draw on insights from the study of tourism mobilities, mobility cultures and classical mode choice research, allowing this study to provide novel insights into the under-researched field of urban-rural tourism mobility. The juxtaposition of quantitative Q and the qualitative interview results reveals influential factors at the personal, interpersonal, societal/political and infrastructural level. The results then feed into a conceptualisation of influential factors of tourism mobility choices using an embedded, interlinked structure that captures the dynamics of social interactions (i.e., feedback-loops). Policy implications are discussed with regards to possible sustainability pathways in line with New Zealand's decarbonisation strategy. © 2020 by the authors.","Exploratory analysis; Mobility culture; New Zealand; Q methodology; Rural leisure trips; Sustainable tourism mobility","conceptual framework; economic analysis; mobility; participatory approach; perception; policy implementation; strategic approach; sustainability; tourism development; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091166996

We used reduced-representation genomic sequencing methods to gain a better understanding of genetic structure among and within populations of Lake Tanganyika's two sardine species, Limnothrissa miodon and Stolothrissa tanganicae. Samples of these ecologically and economically important species were collected across the length of Lake Tanganyika, as well as from nearby Lake Kivu, where L. miodon was introduced in 1959. Our results reveal differentiation within both S. tanganicae and L. miodon that is not explained by geography. Instead, this genetic differentiation is due to the presence of large sex-specific regions in the genomes of both species, but involving different polymorphic sites in each species. Our results therefore indicate rapidly evolving XY sex determination in the two species. Additionally, we found evidence of a large chromosomal rearrangement in L. miodon, creating two homokaryotypes and one heterokaryotype.

However, the mechanisms by which plants sense temperature are not well understood. The evening complex is a major signalling hub and a core component of the plant circadian clock2,3. The evening complex acts as a temperature-responsive transcriptional repressor, providing rhythmicity and temperature responsiveness to growth through unknown mechanisms2,4–6. The evening complex consists of EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3)4,7, a large scaffold protein and key component of temperature sensing; ELF4, a small α-helical protein; and LUX ARRYTHMO (LUX), a DNA-binding protein required to recruit the evening complex to transcriptional targets. ELF3 contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat8–10, embedded within a predicted prion domain (PrD). Here we find that the length of the polyQ repeat correlates with thermal responsiveness. We show that ELF3 proteins in plants from hotter climates, with no detectable PrD, are active at high temperatures, and lack thermal responsiveness. The temperature sensitivity of ELF3 is also modulated by the levels of ELF4, indicating that ELF4 can stabilize the function of ELF3. In both Arabidopsis and a heterologous system, ELF3 fused with green fluorescent protein forms speckles within minutes in response to higher temperatures, in a PrD-dependent manner. A purified fragment encompassing the ELF3 PrD reversibly forms liquid droplets in response to increasing temperatures in vitro, indicating that these properties reflect a direct biophysical response conferred by the PrD. The ability of temperature to rapidly shift ELF3 between active and inactive states via phase transition represents a previously unknown thermosensory mechanism. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"ELF3 protein; green fluorescent protein; polyglutamine; scaffold protein; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis protein; ELF3 protein, Arabidopsis; ELF4 protein, Arabidopsis; peptide; polyglutamine; prion protein; repressor protein; transcription factor; biophysics; climate change; droplet; herb; laboratory method; phase transition; phenology; protein; sensory system; temperature; Arabidopsis; Article; climate; controlled study; correlational study; high temperature; in vitro study; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein function; protein purification; temperature measurement; temperature sensitivity; thermoreceptor; acclimatization; chemistry; heat; metabolism; molecular model; phase transition; physiology; protein domain; temperature; Arabidopsis; Acclimatization; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Hot Temperature; Models, Molecular; Peptides; Phase Transition; Prion Proteins; Protein Domains; Repressor Proteins; Temperature; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089862366

This contribution compares total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from generation and combustion of petroleum derived diesel fuel with plastic derived fuel oil. Generation emissions for diesel are obtained from literature values for well-to-tank (WTT) CO2 emissions, while 3T CO2 emissions for plastic are calculated based on a locally managed decentralized circular economy for waste plastic management. Specifically, this analysis applies a novel approach based on local, small-scale decomposition of waste plastic to fuel in an appropriate technology setting, with consumption of the fuel locally in rural, developing communities to completely remove waste plastic from accumulating in the global ecosystem. Results from 3T CO2 emissions for both the generation and uses of the fuel oil are reported based on a combination of literature review, laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations. Four plastic derived fuels––low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene––were individually compared with petroleum derived diesel fuel to depict a positive reduction in total CO2 emissions. Hence, this contribution will demonstrate that the 3T approach is a sustainable solution to waste plastic management in developing regions, where mismanaged waste plastic is an ongoing environmental and social challenge. Potential benefits to the global environment, particularly in developing regions, from the use of plastic derived fuels as replacement for petroleum based is additionally discussed in this study. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","appropriate technology; carbon dioxide emissions; fuel oil; slow pyrolysis; waste-to-fuel","Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Fuel oils; Gasoline; Global warming; Plastic recycling; Polyethylenes; Polypropylenes; Tanks (containers); Waste management; American Institute of Chemical Engineers; Appropriate technologies; Carbon dioxide emissions; Developing communities; Laboratory experiments; Slow pyrolysis; Small scale decompositions; Theoretical calculations; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060200041

A prominent increase in mixed layer temperatures of ~4°C occurred between 5.55 and 5.28 Ma, accompanied by a change from precession- to obliquity-driven variability in planktic δ18O and δ18Osw. We suggest that an intensified cross-equatorial transport of heat and moisture, paced by obliquity, led to increased summer monsoon precipitation during warm stages after 5.55 Ma. Transient cold stages were characterized by reduced mixed layer temperatures and summer monsoon failure, thus resembling late Pleistocene stadials. In contrast, an overall cooler background climate state with a strengthened biological pump prevailed prior to 5.55 Ma.

For Austrian cities, depending on location and topography, heavy rainfall events, storms and heat waves in particular could become increasingly relevant in the tourism context. For medium-sized and large cities, heat is the most frequently discussed topic in connection with possible adaptation potentials. The analysis of challenges shows a strong overlap of adaptation targets in city tourism with adaptation challenges for city planning including connection to the sub-urban surrounding areas to confront climate change impacts. Covid-19 pandemic, additionally, offered the opportunity to discuss a new re-start of the city-tourism against the experience during the shutdown period in spring 2020. The paper argues that we can learn from the current health crisis for coping with climate change related extreme events and to increase achievements in climate change mitigation. Firstly, the pandemic provides a strong ability to discuss the impact of city tourism due to short-term air travel and options to enhance more climate-friendly options on the other hand. Secondly, Covid-19 emphasized the need to reconsider the role of free spaces in metropolitan areas as well as their accessibility. Herewith synergies with climate change adaptation are likely when questioning the availability and accessibility of green and blue infrastructure as well as their capacities. Challenges including crowding and impacts by over tourism on public free spaces will require joint strategies involving all public and private institutions (including local communities and businesses) responsible for the maintenance of green and blue free spaces. Thirdly, the strong interactions between urban and suburban areas became evident once more, which will also be very relevant for city tourism in the future (e.g. in times of heat waves). Reflection on the transferability of coping with such crowding effects, related to the adaptive behaviour of residents and tourists in times of severe heat waves, might be relevant for both city tourism and summer tourism destinations near metropolitan areas. Finally, the Covid-19 crisis encourages discussions on over-tourism in metropolitan destinations in favour of a more balanced approach, in particular in inner city areas and around major sightseeing attractions. © 2020 The Authors","City tourism; Climate change adaptation Covid-19 pandemic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091108056

In Africa and other developing regions, changing distributions and abundances of tree species may have profound effects on livelihoods. The aims of the study were to determine the current continuous distribution of African wild loquat (Uapaca kirkiana Müll. Arg., Phyllanthaceae) and to predict the impact of climate change on the future distribution of the species. A maximum entropy method (Maxent) was used to generate models of the current distribution and for projections under different representative concentration pathways (RCPs). After resampling and correlation analysis, models were generated using 84 occurrence records and nine environmental variables. Results showed that the species has a current continuous distribution in the range of miombo woodlands of south-central Africa, in parts of Angola, southern Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Projections showed suitable habitat contracting under most RCPs in 2050 and 2070. Range contraction was especially acute under a scenario of no mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, that is RCP8.5. In 2050, the range of the species was forecasted to contract by − 13.9% (RCP2.6), − 5.8% (RCP4.5) and − 14.9% (RCP8.5), with a slight expansion of 1.3% under RCP6.0. In 2070, the range was forecasted to contract by − 17.6% (RCP2.6), − 16.4% (RCP4.5), − 3.7% (RCP6.0) and − 20.6% (RCP8.5).

This paper attempts to assess future SCC for eight Chinese regions by using the regional integrated model of climate and the economy (the RICE model), based on four scenarios, namely baseline (BS), carbon emissions trading (CET), carbon quotas (CQ), and carbon tax (CT) for the period 2005–2050. The results show that under the BS, CET, and CT scenarios, the SCC of China's eight regions increases by $22.26/t C, $20.58/t C, and $19.14/t C, respectively, from 2005 to 2050. The CT scenario performed best in terms of impact on CEs and SCC, but in order to do so they will have to bear certain economic losses. There are differences between the SCC of the eight Chinese regions under different scenarios. Under the BS, CET, and CT scenarios, the areas where SCC is highest are distributed in the Central, North Coast, and Southwest regions, and in the CQ scenario, the high-SCC areas are concentrated in the Southwest, North Coast, and Northeast regions. The low-SCC areas are distributed in the Beijing–Tianjin and South Coast regions under all four scenarios. The central and western regions will become the major energy consuming regions after 2025, so they will face a greater pressure than other regions to reduce emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Carbon tax; Eight Chinese regions; Regional integrated model of climate and the economy; Scenarios; Social cost of carbon","Carbon; Emission control; Losses; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxes; Climate policy; Economic loss; Integrated modeling; Northeast regions; Social cost of carbon; Western region; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085922196

An efficient way to approach this monitoring is to avoid duplication of efforts, generating products in a regional context that are subsequently adopted at the national level. In this effort, you should take advantage of the different data sources available by integrating geospatial tools and satellite image classification algorithms. In this research, a methodological framework was developed to generate cost-efficient national maps of forest cover and its dynamics for the countries of Central America, and its scalability and replicability was explored in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the State of Pará in Brazil. The maps were generated from Landsat images from the years 2000, 2012, and 2017. New geoprocessing elements have been incorporated into the digital classification procedures for satellite images, such as the automated extraction of training samples from secondary sources, the use of official national reference maps that respond to nationally adopted forest definitions, and automation of post-classification adjustments incorporating expert criteria. The applied regional approach offers advantages in terms of reducing costs and time, as well as improving the consistency and coherence of reports at different territorial levels (regional and national), reducing duplication of efforts and optimizing technical and financial resources. In Central America, the percentage of forest area decreased from 44% in 2000 to 38% in 2017. Average deforestation in the 2000-2012 period was 197,443 ha/year and that of 2012-2017 was 332,243 ha/year. Average deforestation for the complete period 2000-2017 was 264,843 ha/year.

Although scholars have qualitatively studied the influencing factors of NPP, few have quantified the contribution of different degrees of drought aggravation or mitigation and major land-use changes to NPP changes. Based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of NPP for 2000–2015 in the Chinese Loess Plateau, we quantified the contribution of drought, land use and land cover change (LUCC), and hydrothermal conditions to changes in NPP. Particularly, we analyzed the contribution of major land-use change and different drought levels to NPP. Our results showed that the 15-years average NPP was approximately 227 gC/m2 and decreased from southeast to northwest. Overall, NPP showed a linear increasing trend over the 15-years period. The results suggested that changes in hydrothermal conditions had the strongest impact on NPP (~61%), followed by drought (~33%), and land use and land cover change had the weakest impact (~1.4%). In particular, ~13% of the NPP decreases was affected by light drought aggravation, ~10% of the NPP decreases was affected by moderate drought aggravation, and ~0.3% was affected by the conversion of cropland to grassland or non-NPP main production land. Moreover, ~12.7% of the NPP increase was affected by light drought alleviation, ~9.4% was affected by moderate drought alleviation, and ~1.1% was affected by the conversion of grassland to cropland or forestland.

Subway-based distribution has been demonstrated and practiced. The self-service mode of express cabinets in stations based on the subway distribution can effectively reduce the last-mile delivery costs, increase the utilization rate of public transportation resources, and reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions. This paper designed self-service mode of express cabinets in stations and discussed the feasibility by investigating consumers' preferences. The consumers' preferences and influencing factors were examined by using the multicategorical logit model. The results show that consumers' gender, education level and number of online purchases per month have an impact on consumers' preferences. The majority of consumers are willing to actively engage in green consumer behavior. Meanwhile, consumers are more concerned about whether the express mode is convenient to conduct and the queuing of an express cabinet. Some suggestions and recommendations on promoting this self-service mode were put forward, such as pushing different advertisements for different groups of consumers, designing efficient and multi-function express cabinets, and adopting a reward system. This research provides guidance for decision making regarding the promotion of a new self-service mode based on the subway distribution, which can promote sustainable consumption and improve the efficient operation of urban last-mile delivery and the low-carbon development of urban transportation. © 2020 by the authors.","Concerns; Consumers' preferences; Express cabinet; Multicategorical logit model; New self-service mode; Subway distribution; Sustainable consumption","advertising; carbon emission; consumption behavior; decision making; feasibility study; perception; public transport; research work; sustainability; traffic congestion; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090408180

However, the eﬃciency and long-term durability are still inevitably limited by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in air electrode. Herein, we fabricated a planar all-solid-state rechargeable ZAB with excellent scalability by integrating atomically dispersed FeNx anchored on nitrogen-sulfur dual-doped porous carbon spheres and a highly conductive poly (acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) solid polymer alkaline electrolyte. Owing to the introduction of sulfur in carbon substrate, the catalyst exhibits superior ORR performance over 20% commercial Pt/C. Specially, it also displays outstanding all-solid-state ZAB capacity with a maximum power density of 85.5 mW/cm2, as well as ultralong cycle life for more than 40 h, which outperforms that of most conventional polyvinyl alcohol alkaline gel electrolyte-based flexible quasi-solid-state or all-solid-state ZAB. Density functional theory results reveal that the dopants N and S play a synergetic interplay in modulating the electronic structure of atomically dispersed FeNx species and provide a fast electron transfer path for ORR. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fe-N-S-C; FeNx; Flexible Zn-air battery; nitrogen-sulfur dual-doped porous carbon; Oxygen reduction reaction; Single atom",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085572094

The central and provincial governments have reinforced environmental awareness by increasing fiscal expenditure for environmental protection for years. This paper extended an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework to evaluate the direct and indirect spillover effects of environmental awareness of provincial governments on SO2 emissions, applying spatial econometric models. The empirical findings are as follows. (1) There exists an inverted U-shaped curve. Of 30 Chinese provinces, only 9 provinces, namely, 8 eastern provinces and Inner Mongolia, have passed the turning point at about 53,000 Yuan while the rest 21 provinces have not yet. (2) Expenditure for environmental protection is negatively correlated with SO2 pollution. In other words, environmental awareness of governments contributes to substantially reducing SO2 emissions. Besides, significant and negative spillover effects of environmental awareness are found, implying that provinces follow suit if neighboring provinces enhance environmental awareness by increasing spending on environmental protection, thereby reducing SO2 emissions. (3) The SO2 reduction policy implemented by the central government is found to have a negative impact on SO2 emissions, implying that the policy effectively works. To conclude, the central and provincial governments play pivotal roles in addressing the problem of SO2 pollution in China. Hence, more expenditure for environmental protection cannot be overstated for China’s environmental quality improvements and sustainable development. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; EKC; Environmental awareness; Fiscal expenditure for environmental protection; SO2 pollution; Spatial econometric model","econometrics; environmental protection; environmental quality; expenditure; governance approach; Kuznets curve; sulfur dioxide; sustainable development; China; Nei Monggol; China; government; health care cost; pollution; statistical model; China; Environmental Pollution; Government; Health Expenditures; Models, Econometric",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086431994

The main aim of this research is to disclose the temporal variations and the spatial patterns of NOx emissions of Chinese provinces, and then analyze reduction potentials. The main findings are as follows. (1) From 2006, the total NOx emissions in China continued to increase and then reached the summit in 2011, and began to decline until 2017. The two largest sources of NOx emission in China are industry and vehicle. (2) Most provinces with high NOx emissions are mainly concentrated on the North China Plain, but they have substantially reduced NOx emissions recently. However, from 2011 the share of NOx emissions from vehicles of all provinces sharply increased because of the ever-growing private vehicle consumption, indicating that the problem of vehicle emissions had become increasingly prominent. (3) Per capita NOx emissions presented an inverted U-shaped curve, similar to the total NOx emissions. From the coefficients of variation and the kernel density estimates, we conclude that the differences in cross-province per capita NOx emissions narrowed notably after 2015. In other words, provinces with higher per capita NOx emissions have greater reduction potentials, and will catch up with provinces with lower per capita NOx emissions. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","China; NOx emissions; Reduction potential; Spatial distribution; Temporal variation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086395704

Here, high-throughput sequencing was used to investigate rhizosphere and phyllosphere fungal communities during different plant development stages. Results demonstrated that phyllosphere and rhizosphere fungal community structures were distinct during all developmental stages while they were mediated separately by plant carbon and soil sulfur. Comparatively, the effect of root properties on phyllosphere fungal diversity was greater than soil properties. Moreover, rhizosphere fungal networks of Bothriochloa ischaemum were more complex than phyllosphere fungal networks. This study demonstrated that the effect of plant and soil traits on phyllosphere and rhizosphere fungal communities could potentially be significant, depending on the applicable environmental condition and plant development stage. Although links between phyllosphere and rhizosphere communities have been established, further studies on functional fungal groups during phytoremediation processes are necessary. This study comprehensively analyzed dynamic relationships between phyllosphere and rhizosphere fungal communities during different plant development stages in a polluted environment. These fungal communities were determined to be expedient to the development and utilization of beneficial microbial communities during different development stages, which could more effectively help to stabilize and reclaim contaminated copper tailings soil. © Copyright © 2020 Jia, Yao, Guo, Wang and Chai.","copper tailings dam; fungal community; phyllosphere and rhizosphere; plant and soil characteristics; plant development","copper; iron; nitrogen; phytohormone; RNA 16S; sulfur; Article; Basidiomycetes; bioinformatics; Bothriochloa ischaemum; carcinogenesis; community structure; DNA extraction; Dothideomycetes; environmental factor; environmental parameters; fungal community; high throughput sequencing; Hypocreales; microbial community; microbiome; mine tailings; molecular genetics; multidimensional scaling; nonhuman; phyllosphere; physical chemistry; phytoremediation; plant development; plant growth; polymerase chain reaction; protein protein interaction; Proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; redundancy analysis; rhizosphere; soil chemistry; soil microflora; soil moisture; soil property; symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092449667

Liaohe Delta is a typical coastal reed wetland in China. The latent heat, sensible heat, and net radiation flux of reed wetlands in Liaohe Delta were studied for four consecutive years (2012-2015) on the basis of the eddy correlation system. The average annual accumulation of latent heat flux was 1525.39 MJ m-2, with a large seasonal variation. The latent heat flux was positive, and the peak value did not exceed 320 W m-2 in the daytime. The latent heat flux increased with the increase of temperature each day. The annual average sensible heat flux was 550.96 MJ m-2, with the minimum sensible heat in June and July, and the daily average change peak did not exceed 160 W m-2. The annual net radiation accumulation was 2868.32 MJ m-2, and the net radiation in winter decreased. The maximum value of net radiation in summer reached 622 W m-2. Latent heat flux accounted for 41%-63% of solar radiation, followed by storage flux, and sensible heat flux had the lowest value.

Pollution control and emission reduction are now challenged, and we have to pay real attention. Pollutant discharge fee (PDF), one of the enforced levy regulations on pollutant discharge in China, was introduced in a new perspective as a direct economic representation of multi-pollutant emission. The DPSIR framework and regression model were constructed to analyze the co-control process of pollutant emission based on the provincial data from 2000 to 2012. The results showed that PDF had a significant and positive relationship with CO2 emission in China during 2000–2012. A special contradiction was found that CO2 emission and PDF increased greatly, verified with empirical analysis, while the pollutant emission reduction target in the 11th and 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) was achieved for the corresponding periods, which indicated that emission co-control is still unrealized in China. Conversely, the single indicator control of pollutant emission generated by opportunistic behavior of the Chinese government failed to bring real environmental improvement. In addition, PDF can be seen as a mirror for the Environment Tax (ET) to achieve authentic emission reduction and pollution control, even for sustainable development in China. © IWA Publishing 2020.","Co-control; CO2 emission; Pollutant discharge fee (PDF); Pollutant emissions","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Regression analysis; Chinese Government; Emission reduction; Empirical analysis; Environmental improvements; Environmental problems; Policy evaluation; Pollutant discharges; Pollutant emission; Sustainable development; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; emissions trading; empirical analysis; environmental economics; pollution policy; pollution tax; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088898970

The possible causes of hazard, exposure and vulnerability in flood disaster were clearly identified by using a climate risk template. Then, levels of exposure and vulnerability with adaptive capacity and sensitivity were further defined by a quantification approach, and the climate risk maps were consequently provided. The potential possible climate adaptation strategies were investigated through the comparison of climate risk maps with diverse adaptation options. The framework was demonstrated in the Kyoto City in Japan with residents as a target population to reduce the flood risk. The results indicate that the government should pay attention to reducing the population in flood-prone areas and adopt diverse adaptation strategies to reduce the flood risk to the residents. Rainwater storage and green roofs as adaptation strategies as short-term planning options are recommended.

Correspondence with civil servants, third sector organisations, and relevant academics allowed us to identify omissions and to ensure policy relevance of the recommendations. This evidence-based Review of the various co-benefits of climate change action for the UK identifies four main areas: health and the National Health Service; security; economy and unemployment; and poverty, housing, and inequality. Associated trade-offs are also discussed.

The wind data from a regional climate model incorporating a moderate global warming and response scenario are considered. The results show that future changes in the design Hs would be highly site specific and inclusion of past cyclonic winds will yield higher wave heights than its exclusion, as expected.

The impact of the climatic change on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks over a semi-arid region of India (Medak district, Telangana) was assessed using remote sensing-based indices and geostatistical modeling. The global soil organic carbon (GSOC) stocks (0–30 cm depth) at 1 km spatial resolution and a set of environmental variables like Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Net primary productivity (NPP), slope, elevation and various climate parameters such as rainfall, temperature, etc., were used to estimate the SOC stocks in current and future (2050 and 2070) climate change projections using regression kriging (RK) technique. The results of the study indicate that among the environmental covariates rainfall was the predominant factor that controls the SOC stocks in the study region. The current SOC stock in the study area was estimated as 25.4 Tg in top 0–30 cm depth. The future (2050 and 2070) SOC stocks were predicted using climate parameters of three Global Circulation Models (GCMs); namely CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, and HadGEM2-ES. Results show a reduction in SOC stocks in 2050 and 2070 due to the projected climate change in the study region. The projected decrease in total SOC stocks varies from 1.12 to 4.93 and 0.45 to 4.49 Tg by 2050 and 2070 respectively. The uncertainty associated with the prediction of the current stock of SOC was 8.44%.

However, neither roadmaps nor policies have been developed for large metropolitan areas (aggregations of towns and cities), including megacities (metropolitan areas with populations above 10 million). This study bridges that gap by developing roadmaps to transition 74 metropolitan areas worldwide, including 30 megacities, to 100% wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) energy and storage for all energy sectors by no later than 2050, with at least 80% by 2030. Among all metropolitan areas examined, the full transition may reduce 2050 annual energy costs by 61.1% (from $2.2 to $0.86 trillion/yr in 2013 USD) and social costs (energy plus air pollution plus climate costs) by 89.6% (from $8.3 to $0.86 trillion/yr). The large energy cost reduction is due to the 57.1% lower end-used energy requirements and the 9% lower cost per unit energy with WWS. The air pollution cost reduction of ~$2.6 (1.5–4.6) trillion/yr is due mostly to the saving of 408,000 (322,000–506,000) lives/yr with WWS. Global climate cost savings due to WWS are ~$3.5 (2.0–7.5) trillion/yr (2013 USD). The transition may also create ~1.4 million more long-term, full-time jobs than lost. Thus, moving to 100% clean, renewable energy and storage for all purposes in metropolitan areas can result in significant economic, health, climate, and job benefits. © 2020 by the authors.

This limits our ability to predict responses to climate change by plant species and communities. To address this gap, we used infrared heaters and manual watering in a fully factorial experiment to determine the relative importance of these climate factors on plant flowering phenology, and response differences among plant functional groups. Heating advanced snowmelt and flower initiation, but exposed plants to colder early-spring conditions in the period prior to first flower, indicating that snowmelt timing, not temperature, advances flowering initiation in the alpine community. Flowering duration was largely conserved; heating did not extend average species flowering into the latter part of the growing season but instead flowering was completed earlier in heated plots. Although passive warming experiments have resulted in warming-induced soil drying suggested to advance flower senescence, supplemental water did not counteract the average species advance in flowering senescence caused by heating or extend flowering in unheated plots, and variation in soil moisture had inconsistent effects on flowering periods. Functional groups differed in sensitivity to earlier snowmelt, with flower initiation most advanced for early-season species and flowering duration lengthened only for graminoids and forbs. We conclude that earlier snowmelt, driven by increased radiative heating, is the most important factor altering alpine flowering phenology. Studies that only manipulate summer temperature will err in estimating the sensitivity of alpine flowering phenology to large-scale warming. The wholesale advance in flowering phenology with earlier snowmelt suggests that alpine communities will track warming, but only alpine forbs and graminoids appear able to take advantage of an extended snow-free season. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","active heating; advanced snowmelt; alpine plant community; climate change; experimental climate warming; flower initiation; flower senescence; flowering duration; infrared heat; phenology; soil moisture","alpine environment; climate change; environmental factor; flowering; growing season; heating; herb; phenology; snowmelt; snow; climate change; ecosystem; flower; season; temperature; tundra; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Flowers; Seasons; Snow; Temperature; Tundra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090053913

We present a case study for the city of Singapore examining the spatio-temporal profile of the heat emissions due to road transport for a typical day. We calibrate and validate our simulation model which is later used for analysis of future electrification and automation scenarios. Furthermore, we also evaluate the temporal energy demand associated with the electrification of transport and assess the heat released for the production of this energy. Our results show a sixfold decrease of the energy usage, and thus heat production, of the road transport sector in case of a complete electrification of all vehicle classes, which include lorries and vans, private vehicles, taxis, buses, and motorcycles. We find that while autonomous mobility greatly reduces the overall trip durations as it mitigates congestion, the energy consumption of the sector remains almost unchanged compared to the fully electric scenario due to the overall increase of average speed in the transport system. Finally, we perform a carbon emission analysis comparing the current scenario to a fully electrified road system.

Fixation of carbon dioxide for this purpose is very attractive as CO2 is non-toxic, easily available, naturally abundant, recyclable, non-flammable and an inexpensive C1 resource, and also the concentration of CO2 (most responsible greenhouse gas) is reduced. This article demonstrates the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by an eco-friendly method and incorporation of the particles into a covalent organic framework in order to obtain a sustainable heterogeneous catalyst, AgN@COF. The catalyst has been characterized in detail by FT-IR,UV-Vis. spectroscopy, FE-SEM, TEM, EDAX, XPS, PXRD, ICP-AES, TG-DTA and N2 absorption-desorption studies. The synthesized catalyst is able to fix CO2 to terminal propargylic amine and propargylic alcohol for the production of 2-oxazolidinones and α-alkylidene cyclic carbonates, respectively, through two different catalytic pathways. In both catalytic protocols, one atmospheric carbon dioxide was used. Production of α-alkylidene cyclic carbonates occurred at room temperature and solvent-free condition, and 2-oxazolidinones were obtained under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, the catalyst is recyclable and reusable. Its catalytic efficacy was preserved even after the use of six consecutive catalytic cycles. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study assesses the transformative adaptation of fishery-based livelihoods of the Jamuna River in Bangladesh (a trans-boundary river called the Brahmaputra in India). Using interviews, focus group discussions and matrices data from two Jamuna River dependent fishing communities (Kalitola Ghat and Debdanga), this study found 80–91 % fishers in both communities have been exposed to floods, storms and riverbank erosion affecting their livelihood capitals, activities, strategies and outcomes. This study identifies five transformative adaptations: migration, building concrete house, livelihood diversification, changes in fishing gear and techniques and tree plantation. In Kalitola Ghat, 57.3 % and in Debdanga, 78 % of fishers have migrated to safer places to minimise the adverse impacts of climatic hazards. To withstand the impacts of storms and floods, in Kalitola Ghat, 5 % and in Debdanga, 6 % of fishers have built concrete houses. More fishers of Kalitola Ghat (56 %) have diversified their livelihoods than Debdanga counterparts (5 %). Around 78 % and 100 % of fishers in Kalitola Ghat and Debdanga have changed their traditional fishing gear and techniques to overcome the impacts of climatic hazards. Traditionally, the fishing communities have coped with or adapted to the impacts of climate change which are not sufficient to maintain their sustainable livelihoods. The findings of this study allow identification of the measures that could help address the impacts of current and future climate change for the fishing communities. © 2020, Faculty of Fisheries, Kasetsart University.

Because they contain thousands of individual components with similar molecular structures, detailed chemical characterization of hydrocarbon mixtures relies on advanced analytical techniques that are not accessible to many researchers. Many analyses of hydrocarbon mixtures instead characterize them as ""unresolved complex mixtures"", with quantification limited to a small number of resolvable components and/or total observed mass within specified volatility ranges. This work develops a new analytical approach to characterize the hydrocarbon component of petroleum and environmental mixtures by ""hydrocarbon group""(defined by carbon number, degree of unsaturation and, in certain cases, degree of branching) using gas chromatography coupled to a unit-mass-resolution electron ionization quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC/EI-MS), a standard and widely available instrument. Average mass spectra of hydrocarbons from a widely used spectral library are combined with chromatographic signal representing the molecular ion of each hydrocarbon group to recreate the magnitude and mass spectra of the chromatogram. Characterization of hydrocarbons in diesel fuel by this approach is in good agreement with state-of-the-art techniques relying on high-resolution and fast-response mass spectrometers. Application of this approach to subsurface soil gas samples from remediated sites of underground storage tank spills demonstrates that composition of hydrocarbons in environmental samples varies significantly and that the total signal of samples from contaminated sites may contain a substantial fraction of oxygenated components.

Most pastoralists are finding it difficult to sustain their livelihoods, and their communities have fallen into extreme poverty. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) approaches are increasingly acknowledged as having the potential to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities. The first step is to develop an understanding of how affected communities live, their perceptions of and how they respond to climate change and the biophysical impacts of climate change in their communities. This study aims to collect this information in order to explore the use of EbA to help pastoralists adapt to climate change. We examined an isolated pastoral Himba community, to understand their perceptions, experiences and understanding of climate change and its related impacts on their livelihoods. A nested mixed-methods approach using structured interviews was employed to address the study objectives. Interview results revealed that pastoralists lack scientific knowledge of climate change, and they have no access to climate change information. Though pastoralists have coping and adaptation approaches at the community level (such as making gardens, fishing, etc.), these have become ineffective as climatic uncertainty and change persist. Furthermore, pastoralists no longer get benefits from the environment, such as food and fodder. Despite this, there are currently no biodiversity interventions at the community level to address the impacts of climate change. Pastoralists have indicated their adaptation needs, particularly the provision of water supply to grow food. This is an open avenue to explore EbA approaches, specifically ecological restoration, while still addressing the need of the pastoralists. There is an urgent need to develop new practical adaptation strategies, including restoration options that will strengthen their adaptive capacity. Copyright: © 2020 Inman et al.

The framework is comprised of two layers. The first layer (optimal green routing) predicts the optimal splitting coefficients for all Origin–Destination (OD) pairs crossing the city center or bypassing. As implementing optimal routing strategies on the field is almost impossible as we do not have direct control over the user's decisions, we choose to balance travel time through gating at the city perimeter so that the usual Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE) discipline matches the optimal splitting coefficients. The second layer then adjusts inflows at the city gates to the DUE solution based on the instantaneous travel times corresponding to the optimal routing strategy for each OD pair. The accumulation-based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model of a single reservoir city with seven arterial routes and six bypass alternatives is developed. A Linear programming problem is formulated to determine the optimal splitting coefficients and a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)-based gating control strategy is designed to track the optimal splitting coefficients. The network-wide emission control framework is compared to three other gating strategies aiming to (i) optimize traffic conditions or (ii) minimize emissions, in the inner-city only, and (iii) optimize traffic conditions in the whole network. A comprehensive analysis conducted on all four approaches is presented. We compare the results of the controlled case with respect to the uncontrolled case and with respect to each other. The comparison results show that: (i) the proposed network-wide emission control strategy significantly outperforms the other two simpler control strategies focusing on inner-city only in reducing the total emission, (ii) but also improves the in total time spent and mean speed at the network-level. © 2020 The Author(s)","Green routing; MFD model; Nonlinear MPC; Traffic control; Traffic emission; User equilibrium discipline","Linear programming; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Routing algorithms; Travel time; Comprehensive analysis; Control and optimization; Dynamic user-equilibrium; Linear programming problem; Macroscopic fundamental diagram; Nonlinear model predictive control; Traffic conditions; Urban traffic networks; Emission control; optimization; traffic emission; travel time; urban area; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087477172

Besides the limitation of their resources, the government programs do not seem to facilitate them. On the other hand, smallholders with strong and diverse assets gain benefits from the government programs. However, social capital is the main resource that could support poor smallholders to relieve their financial pressure.

The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model holds promise for providing LAI within a dynamic range for input into climate and air quality models, improving on current LAI distribution assumptions typical within atmospheric modeling. To assess the potential use of EPIC LAI, we first evaluated the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product collections 5 and 6 (i.e., Mc5, Mc6) with in situ LAI estimates upscaled at four 1.0 km resolution research sites distributed over the Albemarle-Pamlico Basin in North Carolina and Virginia, USA.We then compared the EPIC modeled 12.0 km resolution LAI to aggregated MODIS LAI (Mc5, Mc6) over a 3 × 3 grid (or 36 km × 36 km) centered over the same four research sites. Upscaled in situ LAI comparison with MODIS LAI showed improvement with the newer collection where the Mc5 overestimate of +2.22 LAI was reduced to +0.97 LAI with the Mc6. On three of the four sites, the EPIC/MODIS LAI comparison at 12.0 km resolution grid showed similar weighted mean LAI differences (LAI 1.29-1.34), with both Mc5 and Mc6 exceeding EPIC LAI across most dates. For all four research sites, both MODIS collections showed a positive bias when compared to EPIC LAI, with Mc6 (LAI = 0.40) aligning closer to EPIC than the Mc5 (LAI = 0.61) counterpart. Despite modest differences between both MODIS collections and EPIC LAI, the overestimation trend suggests the potential for EPIC to be used for future meteorological alternative management applications on a regional or national scale. © 2020 by the authors.","EPIC; Evaluation; In situ; Leaf area index; MODIS; Satellite; Simulation","Air quality; Climate models; Data streams; Environmental protection; Air quality models; Alternative management; Atmospheric model; Dynamic range; Environmental policy integrated climate models; Leaf Area Index; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; North Carolina; Radiometers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090582056

This attention from the research community, media, healthcare providers, and the public has paralleled the occurrence of severe air pollution episodes in urban centres of rapidly developing economies, and those resulting from landscape fires on multiple continents. The American Heart Association1 and the European Society of Cardiology2 have published position papers concluding that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution exposure is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and the World Heart Federation highlighted the impact of air pollution on CVD for World Heart Day in 2018.3 The World Health Organization (WHO) included air pollution among its top 10 threats to global health in 2019.4 Lelieveld et al.5 conducted a disease burden assessment to calculate excess mortality and loss of life expectancy from outdoor air pollution (both PM2.5 and Ozone) globally and by country. In their work, they apply a chemical transport model to simulate atmospheric levels of long-term PM2.5 and Ozone concentrations and apply previously published concentration-response functions linking air pollution levels to risks of non-accidental mortality. They estimate 8.8 million excess deaths (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.11-10.41) and 2.9 years of loss of life expectancy (95% CI 2.3-3.5) were attributable to exposure to outdoor air pollution in 2015. These estimates are more than double previous air pollution burden estimates. For example, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study6 estimated that in 2017, 2.9 million deaths (95% CI 2.5-3.3) were attributable to outdoor air pollution, while the WHO7 estimated 4.3 million deaths (95% CI 3.6-5.0) from PM2.5 air pollution in 2016. The above estimates suggest substantial disease burden from outdoor air pollution, but there are big differences in their magnitude. A large proportion of the estimated burden from all of these analyses are in locations of high pollution (mostly in low- and middle-income countries), where observational studies are uncommon and relevant data largely missing. Burden estimates are therefore uncertain and sensitive to methodologic assumptions regarding extrapolation of concentration-response relationships from observational studies conducted mostly in high-income countries with low concentrations. Lelieveld et al.5 relied on the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM),8 which derives cause-specific mortality estimates from 41 observational cohort studies from 16 countries. Relying on the GEMM assumes that the existing air pollution and mortality cohort literature (based on studies largely from North America and Europe) captures the exposure-response relationships for different causes of mortality across the full spectrum of PM2.5 concentrations and different populations without systematic biases. In particular, the effects estimated for the GEMM at higher PM2.5 concentrations are highly sensitive to a cohort study of Chinese males with very high smoking prevalence. The GBD approach uses additional literature from studies of household air pollution from the use of polluting cooking fuels and second-hand smoking to inform the upper portion of the exposure-response curve. Given that over 54% of global PM2.5 exposures are above 35 mg/m3 (the WHO Level 1 Interim Target)9 and outside of the range of many of the included cohort studies, the application of the GEMM to project global disease burden can be misleading and should be treated with considerable caution. Further, the GEMM is based on analyses of non-accidental mortality, and the application of this model to global disease burden estimates assumes similar distributions of different non-communicable disease rates in high-income countries (from which the GEMM is derived) as in low and middle-income countries. This is problematic since the relative frequencies of the various causes of deaths differ markedly between regions of the world.10 Lelieveld et al.5 also did not calculate attributable loss of life expectancy based on standard methods using survival curves as in other PM2.5 burden estimates,11 but instead multiply the attributable years of life lost per capita (to air pollution) by the WHO maximum life expectancy of 91.9 years. This formulation is not derived and in the context of a comparative assessment (across countries and other risk factors) is problematic and likely provides upwardly skewed estimates of attributable loss of life expectancy. The knowns and unknowns The large population health impact of air pollution results from a high prevalence of exposure combined with small relative risks. Relative risks used to estimate the attributable burden of disease from air pollution are derived from meta-regressions of multiple cohort studies of mortality or disease incidence, mainly conducted in North America and Europe. These observational studies of the impacts of long-term exposure are supported by daily time series studies of the impacts of short-term exposure variation conducted throughout the world,12 and by an extensive literature of experimental studies (animal toxicology and controlled human exposures).1,2 Based on experimental evidence there is now a physiologic basis for the adverse health effects of exposure to outdoor air pollution, with a dominant pathway by which pulmonary inflammation 'spills over' to systemic inflammation which in turn increases the risk of CVDs. However, detecting and estimating the small relative risks linking long-term air pollution exposure to chronic disease is difficult. Observational epidemiologic methods are subject to a range of confounders whose effects can be several times larger than the potential effects of the air pollution exposure being studied. Recently, Pope et al. (2020) reviewed over 25 years of cohort studies examining PM2.5 and mortality and concerns regarding publication bias, confounding, and exposure measurement error. Funnel plots, while not conclusive, did not identify evidence of publication or selection bias. Based on 75 studies, they calculated a linear hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality of 1.09 (95% CI 1.07-1.11) per 10 mg/m3 increase in PM2.5. Effect estimates were similar in analyses that adjusted for individual-level smoking [pooled HR 1.07 (95% CI 1.06-1.10)], climate variables [HR 1.14 (95% CI 1.05-1.24)], and contextual variables [HR 1.09 (95% CI 1.07-1.17)]. In their analysis, Pope et al. concluded that studies with individual-level confounding data did not observe smaller estimated HRs for all-cause mortality, suggesting that a lack of control for individual-level covariates was not driving the associations seen with PM2.5 in meta-analyses. Still, most cohort studies include rather minimal individual-level covariate adjustment and some degree of residual confounding is likely. Moreover, since air pollution exposure is typically estimated at an ecological level (i.e. modelled or measured concentrations applied to residential locations of study participants) air pollution exposure measurement error and confounding by spatially varying contextual variables is likely a greater contributor to bias. Improving air pollution burden calculations While the translation of air pollution results to the policy and public is a top priority (and disease burden estimations are a powerful approach), a primary focus of the research community should remain on strengthening the evidence regarding air pollution impacts on human health. Several key questions remain that are especially important to global air pollution burden calculations. Most importantly, there is a need for high quality studies in low- and middle-income countries and especially studies at high PM2.5 concentrations. In addition, identification of susceptible populations, competing risk factors, and potential differences in particle toxicity due to different composition and source contributions are priorities. Further, additional research on specific and high prevalence diseases that may be causally linked to air pollution can help explain the gap between estimates derived from all-cause mortality and those based on specific diseases, as in the GBD. For example, a recent extensive case-control analysis of inpatient MEDICARE hospitalization claims data identified short-term air pollution impacts on a far larger set of diseases than currently considered in most cohort analyses, including high prevalence diseases such as chronic kidney disease and neurological disorders.13 This trend of a greater number of diseases being linked to air pollution parallels the diverse diseases associated with tobacco smoking.14 Greater emphasis in primary research should also focus on measures of disease incidence. When mortality is used as a metric, major diseases associated with air pollution (e.g. CVD) have very different fatality rates across countries,10 which is problematic for assessing the contribution of air pollution exposures to the development (and avoidance) of disease. Causal inference modelling can also strengthen the weight of evidence for the impacts of long-term air pollution on chronic disease.15 Comparative risk assessments and global burden calculations are useful for highlighting the importance of air pollution but equally useful for illuminating limitations in the underlying evidence as a means to ultimately improve understanding.

The usage of this method is demonstrated with a case study, where measured data was used from a cruise ship operating in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. The ship’s energy system is conceptualized to feature a fuel cell and a battery along standard diesel generating sets for the purpose of reducing local emissions near coasts. The developed method is formulated as a model predictive control (MPC) problem, where a novel 2-stage predictive model is used to predict power demand, and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is used to solve unit commitment according to the prediction. The performance of the methodology is compared to fully optimal control, which was simulated by optimizing unit commitment for entire measured power demand profiles of trips. As a result, it can be stated that the developed methodology achieves close to optimal unit commitment control for the conceptualized energy system. Furthermore, the predictive model is formulated so that it returns probability estimates of future power demand rather than point estimates. This opens up the possibility for using stochastic or robust optimization methods for unit commitment optimization in future studies. © 2020 by the authors.

Less is known about how diversification affects energy use, climate change, and air quality, when considering farm operations and supply chain activities. We conducted a life cycle study using measurements from a nine-year Iowa field experiment to estimate fossil energy (FE) use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, PM2.5-related emissions, human health impacts, and other agronomic and economic metrics of contrasting crop rotation systems and herbicide regimes. Rotation systems consisted of 2-year corn-soybean, 3-year corn-soybean-oat/clover, and 4-year corn-soybean-oat/alfalfa-alfalfa systems. Each was managed with conventional and low-herbicide treatments. FE consumption was 56% and 64% lower in the 3-year and 4-year rotations than in the 2-year rotation, and GHG emissions were 54% and 64% lower. Diversification reduced combined monetized damages from GHG and PM2.5-related emissions by 42% and 57%. Herbicide treatment had no significant impact on environmental outcomes, while corn and soybean yields and whole-rotation economic returns improved significantly under diversification. Results suggest that diversification via shifting from conventional corn-soybean rotations to longer rotations with small grain and forage crops substantially reduced FE use, GHG emissions, and air quality damages, without compromising economic or agronomic performance.

They are isoelectronic valence O = X = O (X = S, O) molecules and their mechanism of reduction on carbons is similar. The solid–gas kinetics were studied in a flow system with a tubular reactor under differential and steady state conditions. Initial rates and product distribution were used to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction. The reduction of XO2 on carbons proceeds through a common primary mechanism with oxidized and reduced intermediates. The reactivity of the intermediates that were inserted on carbons (graphite, activated carbon, graphene oxide) modified by SO2 is selective with respect to aminolysis and thiolysis. A theoretical study of the chemisorption of SO2 on dehydrogenated pyrene as graphite active site model showed that at 900 °C the chemisorption occurs mainly on the diradical zigzag edge. Computational quantum chemistry calculations were carried out for the reduction of SO2 on graphite to produce elemental sulfur and CO2 using tetradehydrogenated-benzo[α]anthracene (TBA) as model. The mechanisms of the decarboxylation and sulfur transport steps were postulated. Ozonation of graphite showed that the 1,2,3-trioxolane decomposes to an oxyrene, eliminating O2. Both reactions, the SO2 and O3 with graphite, have the same experimental free energy of activation for the decarboxylation reaction. The results show that for SO2 the desulfurization has a much lower energetic demand than the decarboxylation route raising the important possibility of using the reaction of reduction of SO2 on carbons to reduce the acid rain, producing elemental sulfur as the main product, without increasing the greenhouse effect due to the formation of CO2.

This interaction could either amplify or mitigate the threats to species from climate change, but has so far been little explored. Here, we investigate whether shifts of suitable areas under future climatic conditions would increase or decrease the match between potential climatic ranges and the availability of appropriate habitat types. Using Central Europe (Austria, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, southern Germany, northern Italy) as study region, we applied “climatic” species distribution models to 51 species from three taxonomic groups (butterflies, grasshoppers, vascular plants) that are bound to natural or semi-natural habitats of either low or high elevations (i.e. those that mainly occur below or above the tree line) and pruned their distribution to appropriate habitats to predict species’ current and future ranges in Central Europe. We found that while the potential climatic ranges of most species shrink under a warmer climate, the (proportional) match with appropriate habitat types remains largely unchanged for lowland species, but generally increases for species of high elevation, especially for plants and butterflies. The observed pattern can be explained by a decrease of land use intensity towards higher elevations. The detected buffer effect of land use patterns for alpine species might, however, vanish in the long run as both climate and land-use interests may modify the spatial habitat pattern itself. We conclude that adjustment of land use practices by reducing the intensity in lowland areas, but maintaining moderate use at higher elevations appears the most sensible long-term strategy to reduce climate change effects on central European biodiversity. © 2020","Alpine and lowland species; Ecological niches; Habitats; Insects; Species distribution modelling; Vascular plants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085182722

Detroit, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio are used as illustrative case studies. These cities are two of the only two legacy cities of the Great Lakes region to have developed formal and explicit adaptation plans, and foregrounded justice and equity early in the process. A review of planning documents, and interviews with key stakeholders, in the two cities are used to identify the components of justice being included in climate change adaptation planning, the drivers or motivations for foregrounding justice in their adaptation planning, and the policy tools being used or developed to reach these goals. The findings reveal an awareness among stakeholders and decision makers in both cities of the importance of addressing inequality in climate change adaptation, some attention to justice principles in the adaptation plans themselves, and a diverse set of policy tools emerging to support this work. Importantly, despite relatively modest ambitions for climate change adaptation, both cities face implementation challenges that are likely to be common among legacy cities of the region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Climate justice; Environmental justice; Legacy cities; Urban adaptation","article; awareness; city; climate change; human; interview; justice; Michigan; motivation; Ohio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085468242

However, the differences in characteristics of climate change mitigation and adaptation have shown the possible reasons for a dichotomy in climate policy. This has motivated us to further look into whether cities could integrate their actions in climate change mitigation and adaptation in their planning and how they achieve benefits to overcome the dichotomy. To answer our research question, we have developed an analysis framework built on the endogenous risk theory to analyse how cities overcome the different characteristics to integrate their climate strategies and obtain benefits. The theory of endogenous risk involves seeing both climate change mitigation and adaptation as risk reduction strategies because both of them aim to reduce climate risks and can be carried out by actors who perceive such risks. Therefore, the actors will be more willing to integrate and implement both mitigation and adaptation policy. Our results show that mitigation and adaptation in cities are interlinked and that benefits of an integrated climate change policy exist. A list of entry points how cities overcome the dichotomy are also identified.

However, the long-term effects of these management practices, especially their synergistic interaction, have not been well addressed. This study used an improved agroecosystem model (DLEM-Ag) to explore the synergistic effects of NT and CCs on soil carbon dynamics in a continuous maize system in the middle south of the United States for 1970–2099. Simulation results for 1970–2018 show that NT, relative to conventional tillage (CT), led to carbon gains (0.22 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) in the topsoil in a CC-inclusive continuing maize system; however, NT per se brought minor net carbon gains. This well captures the field observations. Model factorial analyses reveal that soil carbon sequestration was highly correlated with biomass carbon inputs from both the winter cereal CC and the summer maize. Elevated CO2 and warming effects were the main contributors to soil carbon gains, as these promote CC growth. Further model projections suggest that soil organic carbon would increase in the RCP 8.5 future scenarios (2019–2099), with greater gains under NT-CCs than under CT-CCs (0.089 vs. 0.058 Mg C ha−1 yr−1), largely due to enhanced CC biomass production.

In this study, individual city-scale linear mixed effect models (LME) were employed to accurately estimate ground PM2.5 concentrations considering the spatiotemporal variability of the relationship between PM2.5 and atmospheric, meteorological, and land observations. The contributions of diverse influential factors including aerosol optical depth, planetary boundary layer height, relative humidity, vegetation index, and wind on local PM2.5 pollution were also determined. High correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.89) and low root mean square error (RMSE = 13.1 μg/m3) ensured satisfactory LME model performances in estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. Spatiotemporal analyses of satellite-based PM2.5 showed high concentrations in eastern, southern, and northern Hubei, and low concentrations in the northwest and southeast because of unbalanced development. These analyses also displayed a mitigation trend of PM2.5 concentrations with a mean annual decline rate of 3–12% from 2016 to 2018. Moreover, from the statistical results of the model, the influential factor of aerosol optical depth was positively correlated with PM2.5 concentration, while planetary boundary layer height, relative humidity, and the normalized difference vegetation index were negatively correlated to local PM2.5 pollution. However, the winds had contradictory contributions on PM2.5 pollution; the northerly wind in western Hubei and the southerly and northeasterly winds in eastern Hubei alleviated local PM2.5 pollution, while the westerly wind in eastern Hubei facilitated PM2.5 diffusion between cities and aggravated PM2.5 pollution. The analysis of the spatiotemporal trend of local PM2.5 pollution at a city scale and the identification of the influence of wind on PM2.5 pollution provide a theoretical reference for regional pollution warnings and controls. © 2020","Central China; Haze pollution; Influential factors; Linear mixed effect model; Wind","Aerosols; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Mean square error; Optical properties; Vegetation; Wind; Central chinas; Correlation coefficient; Haze pollutions; Influential factors; Mixed-effect models; Normalized difference vegetation index; Planetary boundary layers; Spatiotemporal variability; Air pollution; ambient air; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); haze; particulate matter; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; variance analysis; wind; China; Hubei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082680058

Subsequent reductions in various anthropogenic activities have led to improved air quality during the lockdown. In this study, we apply a widely used exposure-response function to estimate the short-term health impacts associated with PM2.5 changes over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region due to COVID-19 lockdown. Concentrations of PM2.5 during lockdown period reduced by 22.9% to 54.0% compared to pre-lockdown level. Estimated PM2.5-related daily premature mortality during lockdown period is 895 (95% confidential interval: 637–1,081), which is 43.3% lower than pre-lockdown period and 46.5% lower compared with averages of 2017–2019. According to our calculation, total number of avoided premature death aassociated with PM2.5 reduction during the lockdown is estimated to be 42.4 thousand over the YRD region, with Shanghai, Wenzhou, Suzhou (Jiangsu province), Nanjing, and Nantong being the top five cities with largest health benefits. Avoided premature mortality is mostly contributed by reduced death associated with stroke (16.9 thousand, accounting for 40.0%), ischemic heart disease (14.0 thousand, 33.2%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.6 thousand, 18.0%). Our calculations do not support or advocate any idea that pandemics produce a positive note to community health. We simply present health benefits from air pollution improvement due to large emission reductions from lowered human and industrial activities. Our results show that continuous efforts to improve air quality are essential to protect public health, especially over city-clusters with dense population. © 2020.

The dispersion of the refractive index is approximated and presented in the form of the Sellmeier equation. We observe a large birefringence ΔnZ-X ≈ 0.76 and dichroism which is attributed to a strong absorption peak in the vicinity of ~1.23–1.25 THz for the Z-axis. However, the crystal can be considered as almost uniaxial due to a close value of nX and nY as well as αX ≈ αY in the region below 0.5 THz. Moreover, KTA crystals can satisfy the phase-matching condition in principal XZ-plane for THz emission on difference frequency generation mechanism. Therefore, the crystal could be considered as an efficient candidate for terahertz wave generator under intense laser pump. © 2020 by the authors.

Existing studies mainly focus on how LUCC per se affects habitat quality, while less attention is paid to the integration of LUCC, socio-economic development and climate change as a land use system, and to investigate their synergistic impacts on habitat quality. This study addresses this issue by incorporating a top-down system dynamic model, a bottom-up cellular automata and a habitat quality assessment model. The potential impacts of urban growth, socio-economic development and climate change on habitat quality of Hubei Province, China, were predicted under the four IPCC RCP scenarios. Overall, construction land was predicted to expand fast whereas forested land and cultivated land to shrink significantly from 2015 to 2030, but RCP 2.6 and 4.5 scenarios may maintain higher habitat quality compared with RCP 6.0 and 8.5 scenarios. Severe habitat degradation is likely to occur in the megacity's surrounding ecosystems under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, while the degradation is more likely to occur in middle-sized and small cities under RCP 4.5 and 6.0 scenarios. Further, our findings suggest that fixed asset investments and technology innovation play important roles in mitigating the negative impacts of urban and socio-economic development on habitat quality. This study should provide a useful approach for decision makers to design alternative development scenarios and to strike a balance between regional development and habitat conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","habitat degradation; Habitat quality; land use change; RCP scenarios; socio-ecological system; urban expansion","cellular automaton; climate change; climate effect; habitat conservation; habitat quality; policy analysis; policy approach; regional development; socioeconomic impact; urban development; urban growth; China; Hubei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086433479

However, the characteristics of VOCs emissions have not been fully elucidated. Ten representative vehicles were selected in Wuhan, China, and the VOCs emitted by these vehicles under actual working conditions were collected and analyzed through on-road tests. Results showed that the average concentrations of total VOCs emitted by gasoline and diesel vehicles were 5.9 ± 2.4 mg/m3 and 6.8 ± 3.0 mg/m3, while the average emission factors were 5.3 ± 2.2 mg/km and 33.9 ± 22.7 mg/km, respectively. The five compounds emitted at the highest levels by gasoline and diesel vehicles were hexanal, acetone, toluene, p-xylene and iso-pentane. Emission concentration of diesel vehicles was slightly higher than that of gasoline vehicles. Emission factor of diesel vehicles was much higher, because they consumed more fuel and produced more power than gasoline vehicles. The average concentrations of total VOCs emitted by China III, IV and V vehicles were 8.4 ± 1.4 mg/m3, 5.8 ± 3.4 mg/m3 and 5.3 ± 1.9 mg/m3, and their average emission factors were 21.7 ± 18.6 mg/km, 19.4 ± 28.9 mg/km and 9.1 ± 7.2 mg/km, respectively. Vehicle emissions decreased obviously as the emission standards increased. The average concentrations of total VOCs emitted under low-speed and high-speed conditions were 9.4 ± 3.5 mg/m3 and 5.5 ± 1.8 mg/m3. Concentrations of acetone, hexanal, toluene and p-xylene were the highest four VOCs under both conditions.

The relationship between exposure to air pollutants and semen quality is unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of ambient air pollutant exposures on semen quality. Methods: We analyzed 3797 semen samples from Guangdong Human Sperm Bank between May 28, 2018 and March 31, 2019. The inverse distance weighted interpolation method was used to estimate the personal exposures to CO, SO2, NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 during the entire period (0–90 lag days) and key periods (0–9, 10–14, 70–90 lag days) of sperm development. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the exposure-response relationships between air pollutants and semen quality, including sperm concentration, sperm count and sperm motility, after adjusting for other covariates. The regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with each interquartile range (IQR) increase in pollutant concentrations were estimated for each semen quality parameter. Results: Overall, we observed a significant association of decreased sperm count with the exposure to PM10 (−0.2466; −0.4443, −0.0489) and PM2.5 (−0.2910; −0.5401, −0.0419). Among the sperm quality parameters assessed, sperm count was observed more frequently to be negatively associated with ambient air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5), especially for the period during 10–14 lag days. In addition, motility decline was significantly associated with O3 in the late stage of sperm development. Sensitivity analyses for subgroup population yielded similar results. No significant association was found between all pollutants and sperm concentration (all P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Our results indicate that ambient air pollutants exposures during sperm development may have an adverse effect on semen quality, especially for sperm count and motility. The findings emphasize the potential to improve semen quality by reducing ambient air pollutant exposures, and the importance of taking into account the critical period of sperm development when protective measures are implemented. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Motility; Particulate matter; Semen quality; Sperm count","alcohol; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; cohort analysis; concentration (composition); pollution exposure; spatiotemporal analysis; sperm; adult; air pollution; alcohol consumption; ambient air; Article; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; human; human cell; major clinical study; male; marriage; pregnancy; priority journal; smoking; sperm quality; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon density; spermatozoon motility; adverse event; air pollutant; China; cohort analysis; epidemiology; particulate matter; retrospective study; semen analysis; spermatozoon; China; Guangdong; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cohort Studies; Humans; Male; Particulate Matter; Retrospective Studies; Semen Analysis; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085966695

Eighteen different experimental cases are examined to investigate the mechanisms by which depressurization-induced CO2 exsolution is affected by a near-miscible vs an immiscible CO2/oil initial state, by the depressurization rate, and by the presence of a water phase under different wettability conditions. CO2 exsolution is divided into three processes: nucleation, growth and coalescence, and migration. Visual observations and statistical results indicate that a near-miscible CO2/oil initial state causes intense and instantaneous CO2 nucleation. The presence of water effectively hinders the coalescence and migration of CO2 ganglia, reducing the generation and rapid departure of large CO2 ganglia in both water-wet and oil-wet cases. The amount of residual CO2 ganglia increases significantly in the presence of water, and the volumes of most of the increased residual CO2 ganglia are small. Hindrance by the presence of water is predominantly due to contact angle hysteresis rather than the Jamin effect, since it is found that the triple-phase contact lines do not move under most conditions. The residual CO2 saturation increases substantially in the presence of water, regardless of the wettability (oil vs water), with the improvement reaching 95%. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Coalescence; Contact angle; Crystallization; Enhanced recovery; Nucleation; Wetting; Contact angle hysteresis; Depressurization rate; Depressurizations; Enhanced oil recovery; Experimental system; Presence of water; Triple-phase contact line; Visual observations; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092089774

The very large range of inclusion compositions worldwide has been interpreted to represent four end-member fluids: saline (rich in Na + K + Cl); silicic (rich in Si + Al); and carbonatitic (rich in Ca + Mg + Fe, with low-Mg and high-Mg end members). However, the sources and evolution of these fluids and the processes involved in diamond formation are still unclear. We used an unusual study of diamonds from the Panda kimberlite (Ekati Mine, Northwest Territories, Canada) in which both mineral and fluid inclusions in the diamonds were analyzed (Tomlinson et al., 2006) to develop models of the saline, silicic, and low-Mg carbonatitic fluids present in the Panda fluid inclusions. The models used aqueous speciation and solubility calculations to link the solid and fluid inclusion chemistry with model upper mantle rock types. We used the extended Deep Earth Water model to calculate equilibrium constants previously calibrated with experimental rock solubilities referring to upper mantle temperatures and pressures (Huang and Sverjensky, 2019). Our results at 950 °C and 4.5 GPa suggest that the saline fluid could originate from peridotite, the silicic fluid from eclogite, and the low-Mg carbonatitic fluid from carbonated dunite. The fluid models were then used to predict the irreversible, chemical mass transfer when the carbonatitic fluid infiltrated a harzburgite containing a saline fluid. Simultaneous reduction of formate and bicarbonate in the carbonatitic fluid and oxidation of aqueous hydrocarbons from the peridotitic fluid during mixing and reaction with harzburgite resulted in the formation of diamond, olivine, garnet, and clinopyroxene, and increases in the logfO2 and pH. Olivine was predicted to become more Fe-rich and garnet more Ca and Fe-rich with reaction progress, in agreement with reported temporal trends (core-to-rim) in the Panda mineral inclusions. The fluid at the site of diamond formation became more saline with reaction progress and the predicted aqueous phase concentrations of all elements changed consistent with trends in Panda fluid inclusions. In contrast, a prediction for a saline fluid infiltrating a harzburgite containing a carbonatitic fluid resulted in trends of the silicate minerals and the salinity with reaction progress that were in the opposite direction to data from the Panda diamonds. Overall, our study strongly supports the notion that fluids from subducting slabs could mix and precipitate diamonds containing carbon from both oxidized and reduced sources, while adding Ca and Fe to the sub-lithospheric cratonic mantle through metasomatic reactions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","DEW model; Diamond; Fluid mixing; Inclusions; Thermodynamic modeling; Vaccine manufacturing","carbonatite; diamond; fluid inclusion; formation mechanism; kimberlite; mantle source; mixing; salinity; Canada; Ekati Mine; Northwest Territories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087128266

In this work, an innovative energy pooling mechanism for catalyst-free methane activation at low temperature enabled by the nanosecond pulsed non-thermal plasma in argon and methane gas mixture is investigated by both optical diagnostic and kinetics modelling. Importantly, the evolution of the absolute density of the hydrogen atom at the ground state, as a real-time and in-situ indicator of the methane dissociation degree, is measured using the two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (TALIF) method. A simple zero-dimensional reaction kinetics model is built-up to perform a quantitative interpretation on the density evolution of active species. Especially, a good agreement is achieved between the measured hydrogen atom density and that from the kinetics model, validating the reaction pathways of active species. It is demonstrated that, except for the direct electron impact dissociation during the pulse-on period, both the charge transfer between argon ion and methane and the quenching of argon metastable species by methane contribute to a further increase of the hydrogen atom density during the pulse-off period, i.e. the argon ions and metastable species can function as an energy pooling for the formation of hydrogen atom and hydrocarbon radicals. The innovative mechanism proposed in this work may contribute to the catalyst-free and cost-effective strategies for methane utilization at low temperature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Laser induced fluorescence; Methane activation; Nanosecond pulsed discharge; Reaction kinetics","Argon; Atom lasers; Atoms; Catalysts; Charge transfer; Chemical activation; Cost effectiveness; Dissociation; Free radical reactions; Greenhouse gases; Ground state; Impact ionization; Kinetics; Reaction kinetics; Temperature; Two photon processes; Cost effective strategies; Dissociation degree; Electron impact dissociation; Hydrocarbon radicals; Optical diagnostics; Quantitative interpretation; Reaction kinetics models; Two photon absorption laser induced fluorescences; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084086491

Basic strategies like improving food production efficiency, optimizing fertilizer application, reducing food loss and waste and shifting diets are currently insufficient to keep environmental impacts within national boundaries—particularly those concerning nitrogen. However, intensifying these strategies and reallocating food production from the northern to the southern provinces could keep environmental impacts within both national and provincial boundaries.

In fact, the surface of the insulator's hardware will absorb water droplets, the electrochemical corrosion caused by this situation is the main reason for the corrosion of the insulator hardware. However, there are many different degrees of influencing factors in the corrosion process. The principle of DC electric field acceleration of hardware corrosion is not very clear. Therefore, this paper focuses on the effect of the applied DC electric field on the ions adsorbed on the surface of the hardware, and measures the migration of different types of ions in the solution under the action of the applied DC electric field at the same time. To this end, a simulation model of the adsorption of water droplets on the surface of the carbon steel under the action of a DC electric field and an experimental model of ion migration within the solution were established. Through the coupling of multiple physical fields, different levels of voltage gradients were established, and the influence of the DC electric field on the received voltage was established Thus, the influence of the applied DC electric field on the local concentration of the ionic solution and the influence of the applied DC electric field on the electrolyte current density are obtained. The simulation results show that there is a change in ion migration under the DC electric field. As the field strength increases, the change also increases. The applied DC electric field will increase the electrolyte current density, but as the voltage increases, the electrolyte current density remains the same. The change of the electrode surface dynamic parameters with the change of the applied DC electric field is not an important factor. © 2020 IEEE.","corrosion mechanism; DC electric field; ion migration; micro-process","Drops; Electric fields; Electric lines; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrodes; Electrolytes; HVDC power transmission; Ions; Transmissions; Adsorption of water; Corrosion process; Dc electric field; Distribution of ions; Electrode surfaces; Electrolyte currents; Experimental modeling; Uhv dc transmissions; Current density",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099381063

The EAHE consisted of 7 parallel buried pipes with a length of 50 m and a diameter of 0.25 m. The energy performance of the system was analyzed based on data of both sensible and latent heat exchange. The monitored results have been compared with other previous cases presented in the literature to clarify the effect of various climates and design conditions on the EAHE application. The results show that despite relatively high soil temperatures underground compared with the previous case study in temperate regions, the visible temperature difference between inlet air and outlet supply air was recorded in the summer. The annual COP can reach 27.2 while the specific surface area is 0.039 m2(m3hr−1)−1, which represents a relatively low heat transfer area compared with other cases. The conclusion is that considering uncontrollable soil temperatures, the use of a relatively low specific surface area is suitable for great cooling demand in a hot and humid climate, while the design target is on maximizing the heat transfer rate rather than a higher temperature difference. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE); In-situ monitoring results; Subtropical climate; Thermal potential","Heat transfer; Specific surface area; Temperature; Tropics; Earth-air heat exchangers; Earthair heat exchanger (EAHE); Hot and humid climate; In-situ experiments; Latent heat exchanges; Long term monitoring; Subtropical monsoon climate; Temperature differences; Heat exchangers; building; climate change; cooling; equipment; experimental study; heat transfer; in situ measurement; monsoon; performance assessment; subtropical region; temperature effect; ventilation; Nantou; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085309292

The emergence of technologies such as earth observation (EO) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) promises to provide new advances in data collection for monitoring climate change mitigation, particularly where traditional means of data exploration and analysis, such as government-led statistical census efforts, are costly and time consuming. In this review article, we examine the extent to which digital data technologies, such as EO (e.g., remote sensing satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, generally from space) and IoT (e.g., smart meters, sensors, and actuators, generally from the ground) can address existing gaps that impede efforts to evaluate progress toward global climate change mitigation. We argue that there is underexplored potential for EO and IoT to advance large-scale data generation that can be translated to improve climate change data collection. Finally, we discuss how a system employing digital data collection technologies could leverage advances in distributed ledger technologies to address concerns of transparency, privacy, and data governance.

Thus, afforestation projects have been widely undertaken across countries to achieve poverty alleviation and environment protection goals, specifically in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Our study determines the optimal rotation periods of afforestation projects with three different tree species (Chinese fir, Eucalyptus, and Poplar) in various Chinese regions. Applying a modified Hartman rotation model, our results show that the optimal rotation period increases for all examined species, when considering the joint production of timber and carbon sequestration. However, they also indicate that carbon accounting regimes have a significant impact on the optimum rotation as well as on the revenue calculations. We distinguish between temporary (tCER) and long-term (lCER) Certified Emission Reductions. The present value of lCER revenues is three to four times higher than those generated by tCER for the same plantation in the initial 5 to 10 years. In contrast, when the project period extends to 30 years, the present value of lCER revenues is at least two times lower than the present value of tCERs. Therefore, forest managers have an incentive to apply tCER accounting to finance slow-growing plantations, and lCER for fast-growing ones. We conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to changes in discount rates and carbon prices. While the optimal decision for Chinese fir is highly sensitive to changes in both variables under tCER accounting, the results concerning Eucalyptus are most sensitive under the lCER accounting regime. In contrast, carbon revenues have a minimal impact on the optimal rotation of Poplar plantations, no matter which regime is applied. Our findings can contribute to the efficient and sustainable management of carbon sequestration projects, while the methodology can also be applied to other regions in the developing world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon accounting; Carbon price; Certified emission reductions; Optimal rotation period; Plantation species","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Emission control; Reforestation; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Timber; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Certified emission reductions; Environment protection; Optimal decisions; Optimal rotations; Poverty alleviation; Sustainable management; Rotation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088132813

Frameworks are intended to serve as international governance to help regulate corporate actions. However, companies’ climate-related activities are voluntary and produce several issues. The current research addresses the following questions: How do international business frameworks work for governing and enforcing the practical implementation of corporate activities? In the future, what functions are expected to work for business sectors ensuring the 2050 goals? This study examines the function of international business frameworks from different perspectives according to socio-environmental challenges, enforcement measures, organizers, and embedded problems. First, the development process of the motivation of corporate activities is examined, from Corporate Social Responsibility to the long-term vision. Second, we conduct a thorough review of the public and private regimes and identify three key components of private regimes to achieve effective, legitimate, and compliant functions: participation, accountability, and norms. These three components are not ensured by one regime, but by different types of international frameworks: industry associations, international organizations, and third parties. This study illustrates how these three types of frameworks work with the key components for enforcement. Furthermore, with increasing expectations for corporate actions, companies are creating their own visions and principles to attain the 2050 global goal. This paper demonstrates that the function of international frameworks is expected to strengthen in terms of supporting and governing a company’s actions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","2050 Goal; Climate change; Corporate actions; Enforcement; International business frameworks","action plan; business; climate change; corporate strategy; global climate; governance approach; international organization; law enforcement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082658411

Biologically enhanced weathering compensates for increasing solar luminosity, and temperature-dependent plant productivity weakens climate perturbations. Furthermore, a reduced calcification rate of marine organisms provides a negative feedback to rising atmospheric CO2. Here, I present a model of the long-term carbon cycle including biological enhancement of weathering and marine calcification. Climate oscillations of periods from thousands to millions of years arise from a simple model of mountain uplift and erosion. I systematically study the influence of the biologically driven feedbacks on damping these oscillations. For oscillations of periods &lt;2 Myr, the marine calcification feedback yields surface temperature amplitudes that are approximately 1/3 lower compared to a model that ignores this feedback. Abiotic oceans, however, would not necessarily imply a less stable climate on short timescales, due to a higher pH and thereby a higher buffer capacity. On longer timescales, the higher ocean pH would reduce climate stability, since the seafloor weathering feedback would work less efficiently. Biological enhancement of weathering helps stabilizing the climate against oscillations of periods &gt;0.5 Myr. These findings are sensitive to the ratio of land to oceans, however. Furthermore, the mantle carbon degassing rate plays a role, since the temperature dependence of biological primary productivity may be smaller at higher temperatures. Altogether, life can be argued to stabilize the climate on timescales longer than some 100 kyr, while details depend on the geological state of the planet. © 2020.

However, evaluations of this ‘climate penalty’ on air quality have typically not assessed the radiative effects of changes in short-lived aerosols. Additionally, China’s clean air goals will decrease pollutant emissions and aerosol loadings, with concomitant weakening of aerosol feedbacks. Here we assess how such weakened aerosol direct effects alter the estimates of air pollution and premature mortality in China attributable to mid-century climate change under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5. We found that weakening aerosol direct effects cause boundary layer changes that facilitate diffusion. This reduces air-pollution exposure (~4% in fine particulate matter) and deaths (13,800 people per year), which largely offset the additional deaths caused by greenhouse gas-dominated warming. These results highlight the benefits of reduced pollutant emissions through weakening aerosol direct effects and underline the potential of pollution control measures to mitigate climate penalties locked in by greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; climate change; mortality; pollution control; pollution exposure; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088863526

However, low‐cost particulate matter (PM) sensors are now widely used by the public as a source of air quality information during wildfires, although their performance during smoke impacted conditions has not been thoroughly evaluated. We collocated three types of low‐cost fine PM (PM2.5) sensors with reference instruments near multiple fires in the western and eastern United States (maximum hourly PM2.5 = 295 μg/m3). Sensors were moderately to strongly correlated with reference instruments (hourly averaged r2 = 0.52–0.95), but overpredicted PM2.5 concentrations (normalized root mean square errors, NRMSE = 80–167%). We developed a correction equation for wildfire smoke that reduced the NRMSE to less than 27%. Correction equations were specific to each sensor package, demonstrating the impact of the physical configuration and the algorithm used to translate the size and count information into PM2.5 concentrations. These results suggest the low‐cost sensors can fill in the large spatial gaps in monitoring networks near wildfires with mean absolute errors of less than 10 μg/m3 in the hourly PM2.5 concentrations when using a sensor‐specific smoke correction equation. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; Environmental monitoring; Smoke","Air quality; Fires; Instrument errors; Mean square error; Quality control; Smoke; Air quality impacts; Correction equation; Mean absolute error; Monitoring network; PM2.5 concentration; Quality information; Reference instruments; Root mean square errors; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089916658

This will require “rapid and far-reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities”. The challenge falls on all sectors, especially energy production and industry. In this regard, the recent progress and future challenges of greenhouse gas emissions and energy supply are first briefly introduced. Then, the current situation of the steel industry is presented. Steel production is predicted to grow by 25–30% by 2050. The dominant iron-making route, blast furnace (BF), especially, is an energy-intensive process based on fossil fuel consumption; the steel sector is thus responsible for about 7% of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In order to take up the 2050 challenge, emissions should see significant cuts. Correspondingly, specific emissions (t CO2/t steel) should be radically decreased. Several large research programs in big steelmaking countries and the EU have been carried out over the last 10– 15 years or are ongoing. All plausible measures to decrease CO2 emissions were explored here based on the published literature. The essential results are discussed and concluded. The specific emissions of “world steel” are currently at 1.8 t CO2/t steel. Improved energy efficiency by modernizing plants and adopting best available technologies in all process stages could decrease the emissions by 15–20%. Further reductions towards 1.0 t CO2/t steel level are achievable via novel technologies like top gas recycling in BF, oxygen BF, and maximal replacement of coke by biomass. These processes are, however, waiting for substantive industrialization. Generally, substituting hydrogen for carbon in reductants and fuels like natural gas and coke gas can decrease CO2 emissions remarkably. The same holds for direct reduction processes (DR), which have spread recently, exceeding 100 Mt annual capacity. More radical cut is possible via CO2 capture and storage (CCS). The technology is well-known in the oil industry; and potential applications in other sectors, including the steel industry, are being explored. While this might be a real solution in propitious circumstances, it is hardly universally applicable in the long run. More auspicious is the concept that aims at utilizing captured carbon in the production of chemicals, food, or fuels e.g., methanol (CCU, CCUS). The basic idea is smart, but in the early phase of its application, the high energy-consumption and costs are disincentives. The potential of hydrogen as a fuel and reductant is well-known, but it has a supporting role in iron metallurgy. In the current fight against climate warming, H2 has come into the “limelight” as a reductant, fuel, and energy storage. The hydrogen economy concept contains both production, storage, distribution, and uses. In ironmaking, several research programs have been launched for hydrogen production and reduction of iron oxides. Another global trend is the transfer from fossil fuel to electricity. “Green” electricity generation and hydrogen will be firmly linked together. The electrification of steel production is emphasized upon in this paper as the recycled scrap is estimated to grow from the 30% level to 50% by 2050. Finally, in this review, all means to reduce specific CO2 emissions have been summarized. By thorough modernization of production facilities and energy systems and by adopting new pioneering methods, “world steel” could reach the level of 0.4–0.5 t CO2/t steel and thus reduce two-thirds of current annual emissions. © 2020 by the author.

The sector is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. This study aims to examine the determinants of adaptation strategies to climate change among the smallholder farmers in Adama District, Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect quantitative data using questionnaire with 351 randomly selected smallholder farmers. To collect qualitative data focus group discussions, key informant interviews and field observations were also used. Triangulated with thematic analysis, descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression model were used for the analysis. Findings: The result indicated that the majority of the smallholder farmers use at least one climate change adaptation strategy in their local areas though the strategy is generally weak. In this regard, some of the dominant climate change adaptation activities identified in the study area are using improved crop varieties, planting trees, watershed management, adjusting planting date and terracing. The result from binary logistic regression model showed that age and sex of household head, as well as their education, family size, access to agricultural extension services and training on climate change significantly influence the practices of adaptation measures. Originality/value: This study would help the practitioners to modify the existing weak adaptation activities by introducing advanced and technological-based adaptation strategies to the rural farming communities. © 2020, Hurgesa Hundera Hirpha, Sylvester Mpandeli and Amare Bantider.","Adama; Adaptation; Climate change; Determinant; Smallholder farmers; Strategies","adaptive management; agricultural extension; climate change; crop plant; cultivar; questionnaire survey; rainfed agriculture; smallholder; strategic approach; Adama; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087699916

The bijao (Calathea lutea) is a plant of great importance since it has been used for years in the wrapping of an emblematic Colombian confectionery that is a cultural and financial staple in the area where it is produced. Objective. The aim of the research was to identify socioeconomic characters of peasant families dedicated to the production and sale of bijao leaf were, identify the main plant species that accompany bijao in the ecosystem and document the community's perception of the ecosystem services associated with the plant's ecosystem. Methodology For the development of this study, were used community interviews, questionnaires, workshops and verification visits at farms and cover forest areas and crop field with Bijao. Results. Predominantly, leaf production was conducted through family farming in transition, with women playing a fundamental role in the process. The community attributes an important ecological role to bijao, which is predicated on the protection and regulation of water, soil, climate and biodiversity. Implications. The study identified conservation values in an ecosystem where pressures exerted on the natural environment by agricultural production, urbanization and tourism prevail. Conclusions. The bijao leaf has socioeconomic importance and is part of the local tradition and culture of peasant families, the leaf is embedded in customs and gives identity to the territory. Women maintain the traditional knowledge of bijao for the next generations and it is an option of life and income for young people. The community recognized the environmental services and goods of the bijao areas on soil and water conservation. It provides conservation values of natural resources in an area with conflicts between forest conservation and where they produce agricultural goods. © 2020 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

This changing transport behavior is affecting city's economy and environment in terms of producing more economic movements, but at the same time generating more vehicular emissions. Assessing the impacts of this new mobility paradigm is critical, particularly whether it supports or limits city's government targets on reducing emission by 30% and maintaining average economic growth at 7% by 2030. In this paper, we focus our impact analysis on the contribution of online motorcycle taxis in driving various on-demand services such as ride-hailing and essential deliveries towards emission level in Jakarta using system dynamics modelling. The analyses further assess its advanced implications on economic and environmental indicators under three different shares of transport mode scenarios: Public-Online Transport Collaboration, Online Transport Glory, and Luxury Paradigm. The result shows that online motorbike taxi had the lowest energy consumption value and there were economic losses due to the impact of pollution that occurred in DKI Jakarta at this time. Therefore, there needs to be an intervention to achieve the government's target in 2030, one effective effort is by limiting the online use of motorcycle taxis by limiting the growth in the number of drivers and increasing tariffs per kilometer for online motorcycle taxis © 2020 ACM.","Greenhouse Emission; Mobility as a Service; Online Motorcycle Taxi; System Dynamics; Urban Sustainability","Electronic assessment; Energy utilization; Losses; System theory; Taxicabs; Environmental indicators; On-demand services; Reducing emissions; System dynamics approach; System dynamics modelling; Transport behavior; Urban mobility patterns; Vehicular emission; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098192751

Labile OM can stimulate the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM); a phenomenon termed “priming.” In N-poor subarctic soils, it is hypothesized that microorganisms may “prime” SOM in order to acquire N (microbial N-mining). Increased leaf-litter inputs with a high C/N ratio might further exacerbate microbial N demand, and increase the susceptibility of N-poor soils to N-mining. We investigated the N-control of SOM mineralization by amending soils from climate change–simulation treatments in the subarctic (+1.1°C warming, birch litter addition, willow litter addition, and fungal sporocarp addition) with labile OM either in the form of glucose (labile C; equivalent to 400 µg C/g fresh [fwt] soil) or alanine (labile C + N; equivalent to 400 µg C and 157 µg N/g fwt soil), to simulate rhizosphere inputs. Surprisingly, we found that despite 5 yr of simulated climate change treatments, there were no significant effects of the field-treatments on microbial process rates, community structure or responses to labile OM. Glucose primed the mineralization of both C and N from SOM, but gross mineralization of N was stimulated more than that of C, suggesting that microbial SOM use increased in magnitude and shifted to components richer in N (i.e., selective microbial N-mining). The addition of alanine also resulted in priming of both C and N mineralization, but the N mineralization stimulated by alanine was greater than that stimulated by glucose, indicating strong N-mining even when a source of labile OM including N was supplied. Microbial carbon use efficiency was reduced in response to both labile OM inputs. Overall, these findings suggest that shrub expansion could fundamentally alter biogeochemical cycling in the subarctic, yielding more N available for plant uptake in these N-limited soils, thus driving positive plant–soil feedbacks. © 2020 The Authors.

This approach is rooted in the principle of equal per capita access to atmospheric commons. Methods: For this analysis, national fair shares of a safe global carbon budget consistent with the planetary boundary of 350 ppm were derived. These fair shares were then subtracted from countries' actual historical emissions (territorial emissions from 1850 to 1969, and consumption-based emissions from 1970 to 2015) to determine the extent to which each country has overshot or undershot its fair share. Through this approach, each country's share of responsibility for global emissions in excess of the planetary boundary was calculated. Findings: As of 2015, the USA was responsible for 40% of excess global CO2 emissions. The European Union (EU-28) was responsible for 29%. The G8 nations (the USA, EU-28, Russia, Japan, and Canada) were together responsible for 85%. Countries classified by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as Annex I nations (ie, most industrialised countries) were responsible for 90% of excess emissions. The Global North was responsible for 92%. By contrast, most countries in the Global South were within their boundary fair shares, including India and China (although China will overshoot soon). Interpretation: These figures indicate that high-income countries have a greater degree of responsibility for climate damages than previous methods have implied. These results offer a just framework for attributing national responsibility for excess emissions, and a guide for determining national liability for damages related to climate change, consistent with the principles of planetary boundaries and equal access to atmospheric commons.

However continued loss and degradation of forested landscapes, coupled with a rapidly rising global population, is placing incredible pressure on forests globally. The United Nations has developed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) programme in response to the challenges facing tropical forests and in recognition of the role they can play in climate mitigation. REDD + requires consistent and reliable monitoring of forests, however, national-level methodologies for measuring degradation are often bespoke and, because of an inability to track degradation effectively, the majority of countries combine reporting for deforestation and forest degradation into a single value. Here, we extend a recent analysis that enabled the detection of selective logging at the scale of a logging concession to a regional-scale estimation of selective logging activities. We utilized logging records from across Brazil to train a supervised classification algorithm for detecting logged pixels in Landsat imagery then predicted the extent of logging over a 20 year period throughout Rondônia, Brazil. Approximately one-quarter of the forested lands in Rondônia were cleared between 2000 and 2019. We estimate that 11.0% of the forest area present in 2000 had been selectively logged by 2019, comprising >11 500 km2 of forest. In general, rates of selective logging were twice as high in the first decade relative to the last decade of the period. Our approach is a considerable advance in developing an operationalized selective logging monitoring system capable of detecting subtle forest disturbances over large spatial scales. © 2020 The Author(s).

There is a general agreement that this pattern forms when ramets grow radially, leaving a dead centre where the parent plant once was. Nevertheless, there is still some controversy over the actual causes of this dieback and how water source–sink relations in and around the rings are involved in their formation. We studied Asphodelus ramosus rings in two sites with different soil textures (sand and loess) but comparable climate, in order to understand whether differences in soil hydraulic properties create different water source–sink relations and mechanisms that drive ring formation. We characterised soil hydraulic properties and dynamics, accompanied by measurements of soil texture and of belowground storage root biomass. We found that the nature of source–sink relations varies with soil texture and properties. In sandy soils, water supply to ring perimeters is mainly from their centres. In loessial soils, water supply to ring perimeters is mainly from the surrounding matrix. Consequently, rings are larger in sandy soils than in loessial soils. This suggests that rings in both sites are formed by different mechanisms: fine particle deposition in the centres of ring in the sandy soil but competition over water in rings in the loessial soil. Studying the formation of rings and other vegetation spatial patterns should consider local soil properties and the possibility that similar patterns may emerge through various processes. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Asphodelus ramosus; Biological soil crusts; Desert; Soil texture; Soil water; Vegetation spatial patterns","dieback; hydraulic property; loess; soil property; soil texture; source-sink dynamics; spatial analysis; water supply; Asphodelus ramosus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088819698

Nevertheless, the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical setting of the area is understudied. In order to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies a profound understanding of the region's groundwater system is essential. In terms of comprehensive field surveys, aquifer structure and properties as well as water composition were evaluated. The Lower Cambrian Limestone and Dolomite Series as well as the Quaternary sediments were identified to be the major aquifer systems. Isotopic signatures of groundwater indicate direct groundwater recharge trough fractures and a major flow direction similar to the drainage system of the Tata River. Hydrochemical composition mainly reflects the mineralogy. The primary processes are calcite and bassanite dissolution as well as dedolomitization and feldspar weathering. Water of irrigation return flow drains downstream and is pumped repeatedly, with each cycle contributing to contamination and water loss through evaporation, while the water is used for irrigation and daily needs. In turn, groundwater quality decreases along its flow path from N to S.

Once revolutionary, now a buzzword, resilience is a concept that is difficult to transform into an integrated tool that stakeholders accept and adopt. This paper offers a perspective on the different interpretations of resilience, its difficult implementation and the tools that seek to operationalize it. The underlying questions are how these tools are appropriated by urban managers and territorial decision-makers, and how the theoretical concept can be translated into resilient urban development. This research paper reviews the work on resilience and investigates its use and operationalization, comparing two different approaches – organizational (Canada) and holistic (France) – that aim to clarify and operationalize resilience. These theoretical approaches have been combined to create workshops for urban managers so they can move from theoretical results to practical applications. © 2020","Climate Change; Collaborative workshops; Resilience issues; Spatial-decision support systems","climate change; management practice; stakeholder; urban development; urbanization; Canada; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085195827

The maps reflect aerosol emissions modified with atmospheric processes during transport between sources and receptor sites. Compared to emission maps, strong western European emission centers do not dominate the downwind concentrations because their emissions are reduced by atmospheric processes on the way to the receptor area. PM10, eBC, and to some extent also particle number concentrations are rather controlled by emissions from southeastern Europe from which pollution transport often occurs under drier conditions. Newly formed particles are found in air masses from a broad sector reaching from southern Germany to western Europe, which we explain with gaseous particle precursors coming with little wet scavenging from this region. Annual emissions for 2009 of PM10, BC, SO2, and NOx were accumulated along each trajectory and compared with the corresponding measured time series. The agreement of each pair of time series was optimized by varying monthly factors and annual factors on the 2009 emissions. This approach yielded broader summer emission minima than published values that were partly displaced from the midsummer positions. The validity of connecting the ambient concentration and emission of particulate pollution was tested by calculating temporal changes in eBC for subsets of back trajectories passing over two separate prominent emission regions, region A to the northwest and B to the southeast of the measuring stations. Consistent with reported emission data the calculated emission decreases over region A are significantly stronger than over region B. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); data set; mapping method; particulate matter; source apportionment; trend analysis; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092303293

Heikkila explores a truly important question that has not been adequately analyzed to date: how the rise of China alters the context in which the broad spectrum of policies in the United States should be assessed. Here, the policy domain of the U.S. government is carved into three broad spheres: economic policies: fiscal policy and deficits, trade policy, and employment and income sustainability policies: climate change, urban policy, and energy policy geopolitical policies: homeland security, defense policy, and foreign relations. For each domain, Heikkila assesses the key policy issues and tradeoffs, examining how the balance of such tradeoffs shifts due to China's rise. In doing so, he demonstrates how a rising China exerts its gravitation pull on U.S. policy, not so much through lobbying or negotiation, but through the very nature of its being. A concluding chapter presents a workable synthesis derived from these diverse perspectives. At a time of increasing tensions, it is all the more important for U.S. policy makers to focus on the many substantive policy questions that are impacted by China's rise. China from a U.S. Policy Perspective will be of key interest to scholars, practitioners, and students of policy analysis, U.S. politics, Chinese politics, and International Relations. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

Little attention has been paid to the capacities (in terms of knowledge and resources) that local actors need to successfully influence the operation and management of water services they are made responsible for. In a qualitative study, we asked regional and local actors in the Omusati Region of north-central Namibia for their perspectives on how water reforms, initiated in the late 1990s, have impacted on their participation in water governance. Our analysis reveals that decentralized governance of water resources can be ineffective if governments do not allocate sufficient resources to support and enable local actors to participate efficiently and effectively in the governance system. In the context of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, achieving greater equity and efficiency in the water sector while reducing climate risk will require that local actors receive more support in return for fuller and more effective participation. We suggest that policy and practice around decentralized water governance pay more attention to building the capacities of local actors to absorb the responsibilities transferred to them. © 2020, The Author(s).","Capacity building; Decentralization; Namibia; Participation; Water governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089599903

However, many driving decision-making problems are characterized by multiple competing objectives whose relative importance is dynamic, and that makes developing high-performance decision-making system difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (RL) scheme for multi-objective longitudinal decision-making of autonomous electric vehicle. Firstly, in order to prevent the policy from prematurely converging to a local optimum, the policy's entropy is embedded in proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm based on actor-critic architecture. Secondly, a self-adjusting mechanism to the weight of entropy is developed to accelerate model training and improve algorithm stability through entropy constraint. Thirdly, multimodal reward signals are designed to guide the RL agent learning complex multi-modal driving policies by considering safety, comfort, economy and transport efficiency. Finally, simulation results show that, the proposed longitudinal decision-making approach for autonomous electric vehicle is feasible and effective. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Decision making; Electric vehicles; Entropy; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Reinforcement learning; Actor-critic architectures; Algorithm stability; Decision-making systems; Driving decision makings; Policy optimization; Reducing emissions; Reinforcement learning approach; Transport efficiency; Autonomous vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099655706

However, large regional variations in maize yield using the same cultivar and management measures occur due to climate diversity. It is important to clarify the differences in regional maize production and climate resources in order to improve resource utilization efficiency. Long-term field experiments with the same maize cultivar (i.e., Zhengdan 958) and management measures were carried out at 26 sites from 2007 to 2015 in the main corn-producing areas of China. Based on the field experiment data, we analyzed the regional differences in maize production according to yield, growth period, grain number per spike and 1000-grain weight. The climate resources and utilization efficiency in NEC, NC and NWC were then determined by combining daily temperature and solar radiation data. The results show that NWC had significantly greater maize yield compared to NEC and NC, by 49.5 % and 38.7 %, respectively. A non-significant difference in maize yield was found between NC and NEC, and similar results were also found for the 1000-grain weight. NWC experienced significantly greater solar radiation during the maize growth period; the value was 14.0 % and 19.6 % higher than in NEC and NC, respectively. In addition, thermal time was 5.1 % and 8.9 % higher than in NEC and NC, respectively. The radiation utilization efficiency (RUE) in the NWC was the highest, 14.5 % and 27.2 % higher than those in NC and NEC, respectively. Similar to RUE, the heat utilization efficiency (HUE) value in NWC was 27.4 % and 46.5 % higher than in NC and NEC, respectively. The yield of maize was positively correlated with the total radiation and thermal time during the growth period; however, regional radiation had a greater impact on maize production than thermal time. Overall, NWC showed higher maize yield, higher radiation and higher thermal time during the maize growth period as well as higher RUE and HUE compared to NC and NEC. Improving resource utilization efficiency using the theory and technology of quantitative matching of maize yield formation and resources in NC and NEC may be a way to reduce the regional yield gap in China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Maize; Radiation; Resources utilization efficiency; Thermal time; Yield","crop yield; cultivar; efficiency measurement; maize; quantitative analysis; temperature effect; thermal power; weight; China; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084808721

Herein, in the context of carbon capture, a remarkable enhancement in the CO2 selectivity is demonstrated by uniquely masking nanoporous single-layer graphene with polymer with intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1). In the process, a major bottleneck of the state-of-the-art pore-incorporation techniques in graphene has been overcome, where in addition to the molecular sieving nanopores, larger nonselective nanopores are also incorporated, which so far, has restricted the realization of CO2-sieving from graphene membranes. Overall, much higher CO2/N2 selectivity (33) is achieved from the composite film than that from the standalone nanoporous graphene (NG) (10) and the PIM-1 membranes (15), crossing the selectivity target (20) for postcombustion carbon capture. The selectivity enhancement is explained by an analytical gas transport model for NG, which shows that the transport of the stronger-adsorbing CO2 is dominated by the adsorbed phase transport pathway whereas the transport of N2 benefits significantly from the direct gas-phase transport pathway. Further, slow positron annihilation Doppler broadening spectroscopy reveals that the interactions with graphene reduce the free volume of interfacial PIM-1 chains which is expected to contribute to the selectivity. Overall, this approach brings graphene membrane a step closer to industrial deployment. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","carbon capture; gas separation membrane; intrinsic microporosity; nanoporous graphene; transport mechanism","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Composite membranes; Energy efficiency; Graphene; Microporosity; Nanocomposite films; Nanopores; Energy efficient; Industrial deployment; Intrinsic microporosity; Molecular sieving; Phase transport; Post-combustion carbon captures; Selectivity enhancement; State of the art; Gas permeable membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088989754

We use a suite of regional climate simulation to compare the local climate impacts of the implementation of different roof strategies in summer and winter. The results indicate that in summer, the 2 m surface temperature reduced significantly when these two roof strategies are adopted, with peak reductions of 0.74 and 1.19 K for green roofs and cool roofs, respectively. The cooling impact of cool roofs is more effective than that of green roofs under the scenarios assumed in this study. Besides, rooted in the different mechanisms influencing urban heat flux, significant indirect effects were also observed: adopting cool roofs leads to a decreased precipitation in summer and an apparent reduction in wintertime temperatures in the urban area. Although cool roofs can be an effective way to reduce high temperatures during the summer, green roofs have fewer adverse impacts on other climate conditions. These results underline the need for comprehensive climate change policies that incorporate place-based solutions and extend beyond the nearly exclusive focus on summertime cooling.

Maintaining ecosystems that deliver critical services to communities can also provide co-benefits beyond adaptation, such as climate mitigation and protection of biological diversity and livelihoods. EbA has, to a limited extent, drawn upon indigenous and local knowledge for defining critical services and for implementing EbA in decision-making. This is a paradox given that the primary focus of EbA is to enable communities to adapt to climate change. The purpose of this study was to elucidate EbA strategies that take into account the knowledge of Sámi reindeer herders about pastures in tundra regions. We first examined what constitutes critical services through a synthesis of data and literature. We thereafter used content analysis of 91 land use cases from 2010 to 2018 to investigate to what extent the herders’ knowledge and maps over seasonal pastures and migratory routes are used in local decision-making. Finally, we propose EbA strategies of relevance to Sámi communities and pastoral communities elsewhere. Our analysis revealed that reindeer herders and organizations representing their interests perceived threats from green energy development, tourism, recreation, public road construction and powerlines. These threats included the loss of key habitats and the loss of connectivity for migration between seasonal pastures. Pastoralists’ knowledge is incorporated through participatory tools to protect the ecosystems and services crucial for pastoralists, but multiple competing land uses result in incremental loss of pastures regardless. Synthesis and applications. Protecting pasture ecosystems and the services they deliver, including the connectivity between pastures, are necessary Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies to buffer the adverse effects of climate change. Drawing on pastoralists’ knowledge to elicit EbA strategies can inform decision-making, but it is equally important to implement this knowledge for prioritizing adaptation needs in the assessment of competing land use. © 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: This longitudinal analysis linked state-level policy support for sexual minorities [N = 94 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in 38 states] to 7 years of data (2008-2014) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV outcomes among MSM. Using latent growth mixture modeling, we combined 11 state-level policies (eg, nondiscrimination laws including sexual orientation as a protected class) from 1999 to 2014, deriving the following 3 latent groups: consistently low policy support, consistently high policy support, and increasing trajectory of policy support. Outcomes were HIV diagnoses per 10,000 MSM, late diagnoses (number of deaths within 12 months of HIV diagnosis and AIDS diagnoses within 3 months of HIV diagnosis) per 10,000 MSM, AIDS diagnoses per 10,000 MSM with HIV, and AIDS-related mortality per 10,000 MSM with AIDS. RESULTS: Compared with MSAs in states with low policy support and increasing policy support for sexual minorities, MSAs in states with the highest level of policy support had lower risks of HIV diagnoses [risk difference (RD) = -37.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): -54.7 to -21.0], late diagnoses (RD = -12.5, 95% CI: -20.4 to -4.7), and AIDS-related mortality (RD = -33.7, 95% CI: -61.2 to -6.2), controlling for time and 7 MSA-level covariates. In low policy support states, 27% of HIV diagnoses, 21% of late diagnoses, and 10% of AIDS deaths among MSM were attributable to the policy climate. CONCLUSION: The state-level policy climate related to sexual minorities was associated with HIV health outcomes among MSM and could be a potential public health tool for HIV prevention and care.",,"health care policy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; male homosexuality; sexual and gender minority; treatment outcome; United States; Health Policy; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Treatment Outcome; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089615315

Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a common drug widely found in efficuents from hospitals, industrial and different wastewater treatment plants, as well as rivers. In this work, the lab-scale 3D-BER system was established, and more than 90% of the antibiotic CIP was removed from Low C/N wastewater. The best results were obtained with the current intensity being taken into account, and a different C/N ratio significantly improved the removal of CIP and nitrates when the ideal conditions were C/N = 1.5-3.5, pH = 7.0-7.5 and I = 60 mA. The highest removal efficiency occurred when CIP = 94.2%, NO3--N = 95.5% and total nitrogen (TN) = 84.3%, respectively. In this novel system, the autotrophic-heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria played a vital role in the removal of CIP and an enhanced denitrification process. Thus, autotrophic denitrifying bacteria uses CO2 and H2 as carbon sources to reduce nitrates to N2. This system has the assortment and prosperous community revealed at the current intensity of 60 mA, and the analysis of bacterial community structure in efficuent samples fluctuates under different conditions of C/N ratios. Based on the results of LC-MS/MS analysis, the intermediate products were proposed after efficient biodegradation of CIP. The microbial community on biodegrading was mostly found at phylum, and the class level was dominantly responsible for the NO3--N and biodegradation of CIP. This work can provide some new insights towards the biodegradation of CIP and the efficient removal of nitrates from low C/N wastewater treatment through the novel 3D-BER system. © 2020 by the authors.","3D-BER system; Biodegradation of ciprofloxacin; Denitrification; Low C/N wastewater treatment; Microbial communities","antibiotics; bacterium; biochemical composition; biodegradation; carbon; community structure; hydrogen; nitrate; nitrogen; three-dimensional modeling; wastewater treatment; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091165607

At the beginning of the year, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. Individual states have taken strict measures to prevent its spread among the population. Due to this fact, the government of the Slovak Republic has issued restrictions on the closure of public spaces (schools, shopping centres, restaurants, bars, etc.). These restrictions have had an impact not only on the economic activity of the population but also on their mobility in the form of reduced traffic. This is due to the drastically reduced mobility associated with the coronavirus, such as commuting trips and extremely limited leisure opportunities. Reduced mobility of the population (reduction of the number of vehicles in the traffic flow) can bring positive effects not only on overloaded road network (increased vehicle speed, lower flow) but also on the environment (reduction of noise, emissions, etc.). This article aims at finding out what effect the measures taken had on the quality of traffic flow. The quality of movement was examined in the form of the flow and speed of vehicles on one of the busiest first-class road sections. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the state of the restrictions. The results show that after the introduction of measures against the spread of coronavirus, the intensity and speed of vehicles in the measured section decreased. © 2020 by the authors.","COVID-19; Flow; Restriction; Speed; Traffic flow","economic activity; flow regulation; mobility; road traffic; viral disease; virus; Slovakia; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090396652

In order to provide an empirical basis for this discussion, an extensive search of the social science literature was performed. It showed that in the 1990s, climate science was a popular target among academic epistemic relativists. In particular, many STS scholars used it as an allegedly clear example of claims by natural scientists that should be treated as mere social constructions, rather than as reports on the actual state of the natural world. A few connections between social constructivists and corporate science denialism were also uncovered, but the extent of such connections could not be determined. With few exceptions, the stream of criticism of climate science from academic relativists has dwindled since the 1990s. One reason for this seems to be that the contrarian position lost its attraction when it became associated with corporate and right-wing propagandists. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate science denialism; Epistemic relativism; Postmodernism; Science and technology studies; Social constructivism; Strong programme",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089972867

Indonesia's commitment to protecting the global climate has been a concern since the 1990s. Through Presidential Regulation No.61 of 2011 concerning the National Action Plan (RAN) for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emission, each region needs to develop climate change mitigation actions through reducing emission or increasing the absorption of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) from various emission sources. The formulation of climate change mitigation actions needs to be supported by greenhouse gases inventory activities and measurement of emission. Measurement of GHG emission is a cross-sectoral activity. Therefore, an information system through an electronic GHG calculator platform is needed as an instrument for measuring GHG emission that can support districts/cities to formulate the most relevant mitigation actions. This study describes the sources of GHG emission based on energy use and its measurement using GHG calculator. GHG calculator is developed based on the theoretical context and designed in form of mobile application. Using Focus Group Discussion (FGD) technique and Spearman's correlation analysis, this research aims to evaluate GHG assessment based on the use of mobile application in Surabaya City. The findings of this study are 1) there is positive feedbacks regarding the use of mobile platform to predict and calculate GHG emission. It shows that perception on easiness and usability level of mobile calculator are correlated significantly; 2) there are some opportunities and challenges in implementing mobile application for measuring GHG emission in Surabaya City. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Global warming; Mathematical instruments; Mobile computing; Planning; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Correlation analysis; Emission sources; Global climates; Mobile applications; Mobile platform; Reducing emissions; Sectoral activities; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092338258

Overall, the photovoltaic installed capacity has reached 5213.37 MW, with the income generation of 7.41 billion CNY per year and the carbon emission mitigation of 5.98 million tons. From the results in this work, it is obvious that the GDP and household savings per capita in most counties and cities are lower than in those without photovoltaic poverty alleviation stations. As an essential strategy of generating income and mitigating emissions especially in countries well-endowed with sunlight, the deployment of photovoltaic power projects is consistent with sustainable development goals relating to global poverty eradication.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other air pollutants measured in Seoul over the two 30 day periods before and after the start of social distancing are analyzed to assess the change in air quality during the period of social distancing. The 30 day mean PM2.5 concentration decreased by 10.4% in 2020, which is contrasted with an average increase of 23.7% over the corresponding periods in the previous 5 years. The PM2.5 concentration decrease was city-wide and more prominent during daytime than at nighttime. The concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) decreased by 16.9% and 16.4%, respectively. These results show that social distancing, a weaker forcing toward reduced human activity than a strict lockdown, can help lower pollutant emissions. At the same time, synoptic conditions and the decrease in aerosol optical depth over the regions to the west of Seoul support that the change in Seoul’s air quality during the COVID-19 social distancing can be interpreted as having been affected by reductions in the long-range transport of air pollutants as well as local emission reductions. © 2020 by the authors.

The social and economic factors of the community are commonly used variables in assessing linear functions of the level of social welfare. The level of social welfare is then thought to be one of the main drivers of anthropogenic pressure on the environment. We examine the extent to which social and economic aspects of capture fisheries activities influence the dynamics of CO2 emissions generated from capture fisheries activities in all coastal areas in West Java Province during the 2007-2016 period. Based on the results of geographic information system and statistical analysis, we find that the increasing economic factor can reduce the ghg emission while the increasing of social factor on the contrary can increase the ghg emission. The GIS analysis also show that the level of CO2 emissions was found to be lower in districts that had relatively high levels of social index. It is estimated, the higher level of education and social welfare has a real positive correlation with increasing public awareness in conducting fishing activities that are environmentally friendly and carbon friendly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coastal zones; Anthropogenic pressures; Economic aspects; Economic factors; Fishing activities; Level of educations; Low-carbon development; Positive correlations; Public awareness; Fisheries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091893295

This paper presents a forecasting approach, to assess the development trends in climate service needs and thereby potential demand in key sectors that are essential to the green solution and will face a general growth in activity and key climate vulnerabilities towards 2050. These sectors are renewable energy, international climate finance, and cities. The geographical scope focuses on Europe, but global trends are included. We here suggest scenarios for growth in future climate services based on baseline development trends and policy scenarios reflecting future low-emission and SDG targets. Barriers and specific needs for climate service development within these sectors are discussed, and alignment of supply and demand within the climate service market is particularly emphasized. We find that several complexities influence the climate service market, including policy frameworks aimed at facilitating climate risk management as well as a lack of fit between the supply and demand sides of the market. Other barriers include uncertainties related to available climate information and socioeconomic climate risk information. Based on the forecasting, we find that substantial benefits can be seen with increased climate service development and deployment across the three sectors. © 2020 by the authors.","City adaptation plans; Climate service forecasting and scenarios; Climate service penetration; Climate services; Climate services markets; Renewable energy finance; Sustainable development goals","alternative energy; climate effect; demand analysis; financial services; market conditions; risk assessment; Sustainable Development Goal; urban area; vulnerability; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091180707

In particular, the subantarctic and polar frontal zone of the Southern Ocean is a significant region for physically driven carbon uptake due to mode water formation, although it is under-studied concerning biologically mediated uptake. Regional differences in iron concentrations lead to variable carbon export from the base of the euphotic zone. Contrary to our understanding of export globally, where high productivity results in high export, naturally iron-fertilized regions exhibit low carbon export relative to their surface productivity, while HNLC (High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll) waters emerge as a significant area for carbon export. Zooplankton, an integral part of the oceanic food web, play an important role in establishing these main carbon export regimes. In this mini review, we explore this role further by focusing on the impact of grazing and the production of fecal pellets on the carbon flux. The data coverage in the subantarctic region will be assessed by comparing two case studies - the iron-replete Kerguelen Plateau and the HNLC region south of Australia. We then discuss challenges in evaluating the contributions of zooplankton to carbon flux, namely gaps in seasonal coverage of sampling campaigns, the use of non-standardized and biased methods and under-sampling of the mesopelagic zone, an important area of carbon remineralization. More integrated approaches are necessary to improve present estimates of zooplankton-mediated carbon export in the Southern Ocean. © Copyright © 2020 Halfter, Cavan, Swadling, Eriksen and Boyd.","biological carbon pump; carbon cycle; southern ocean; subpolar; zooplankton",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092718976

Since the 1980s, in a context marked by increasing development in energy costs and by rising attention to the problem of global warming, countries have gradually mobilized to control their energy better and reduce the environmental footprint. However, even if there are some great successes, the deployment of renewable energies is still not well developed in developing countries such as Algeria that mainly uses fossil fuels. Considering the huge potential and good climatic conditions, developing countries should take on renewable energies for their future development. This paper aims to understand the impact of modern urban strategy on the application of solar urban planning. This study will clarify the critical role of solar electricity integration used in determining the urban solar potential in four studied regions located on three different continents: Africa, Europe and North America, in the cities of Ibenbadis (Constantine, Algeria), Saint-Hugues (Quebec, Canada), Saint-Malo (France) and Ambolobozobe (Madagascar). The results obtained will allow a comparison of the calculated solar energy potential of three urban sites, the benefits of reducing carbon dioxide as well as a comparison of solar energy costs on three continents. © 2020 Kamel Haine, Dagnija Blumberga.","PV integration solar electricity; Solar potential; Topological analysis; Urban forms; Urban network","alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; future prospect; photovoltaic system; solar power; topology; urban area; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093121920

CD-PEI was synthesized by the one-step microwave hydrothermal carbonization of a mixture of glycerol and PEI-25k, enabling simultaneous synthesis and surface passivation of CDs. DOX was loaded onto CD-PEI by electrostatic interactions. The results show that this system not only improves selective drug release but also prolongs the drug release time and improves the killing effect on tumors. Compared with free DOX, the CD-PEI-DOX complex has a stronger killing effect on liver cancer cells (MHCC-97L and Hep3B cells) but a very low killing effect on normal liver cells (L02). Studies have also confirmed that compared with DOX alone, CD-PEI-DOX nanoparticles can effectively inhibit tumors because of the larger amount of drugs localized in tumor cells and the higher apoptosis rate of MHCC-97L cells. In vivo experiments confirmed that CD-PEI-DOX has a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor growth, indicating that CD-PEI-DOX nanomedicine has inhibitory effects on tumors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbonization; Cell death; Diseases; Drug products; Hydrothermal synthesis; Medical nanotechnology; Passivation; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Drug delivery system; In-vivo experiments; Inhibitory effect; Liver cancer cells; Microwave hydrothermal; Polyethylenimines; Simultaneous synthesis; Surface passivation; Controlled drug delivery; antineoplastic agent; carbon; doxorubicin; nanoparticle; polyethyleneimine; drug delivery system; neoplasm; Antineoplastic Agents; Carbon; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms; Polyethyleneimine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090079616

Despite a growing number of examples of such plans and “toolkits” that outline the process for undertaking these planning efforts, many cities are still struggling to know where to start. Furthermore, meta-analyses of existing climate action plans show that many suffer from similar limitations including lack of scientific input, failure to consider strategies across multiple sectors within local government, limited public involvement, narrow focus on mitigation, and lack of detail regarding implementation and monitoring. This paper describes our process for developing the Anchorage Climate Action Plan and our experience fusing a three-way partnership between the municipal government, a local university, and the broader Anchorage, Alaska community. We describe the nuts and bolts of our funding, leadership structure, and technical working sessions and reflect on the key structural, political, and social elements that catalysed plan development, adoption, and implementation. Our experience suggests that public support from municipal leaders, commitment from local experts, a dedicated steering committee, a diverse set of stakeholders, and a good working relationship with the local government officials (e.g. Assembly members or City Council) are critical to creating a successful framework for climate mitigation and adaptation planning in a community.

This article reviews the literature on the applications of WMA-RAP and its effects on the performance of the asphalt mixture. Different types of WMA additives work differently on high temperature performance, low temperature and moisture susceptibility. WMA with a certain content of RAP showed satisfactory rutting performance and low temperature cracking resistance.

This study projects the agricultural water use towards 2030 under the climate change mitigation target at the provincial level in China by linking a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and a regression model. By solving the endogeneities amongst agricultural water use, output and climate factors, we explore how these variables affect water use and further predict future trends through soft-link with the IMED|CGE model. It is found that sunshine duration has a slightly positive impact on water use. Furthermore, agricultural output will significantly drive agricultural water use based on historical data of the past 16 years. Results also show that carbon reduction would have a trade-off or co-benefit effect on water use due to regional disparity. Provinces with increasing agricultural exports, such as Xinjiang and Ningxia, would anticipate considerable growth in agricultural water use induced by carbon reduction. The soft-link method proposed by this study could be applied for future studies that aim to incorporate natural and geographical factors into human activities, and vice versa, for assessing sustainable development policies in an integrated way. © 2020","Agricultural water use; Climate change; Co-benefit; IMED|CGE; Regression model; Soft link; Trade-off",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097556522

Although an increasing number of studies have documented the impacts of these factors on native and invasive freshwater plant species, relatively little is known about how they might interact to affect naturalised exotic species. We investigated the growth and biomass allocation responses of five naturalised ornamental freshwater plant species (Ludwigia palustris, Mentha aquatica, Mentha pulegium, Nasturtium officinale and Zantedeschia aethiopica) to varied levels of CO2 (ambient and elevated) and nutrient (low and high) concentrations. We found limited evidence that these factors interacted to affect plant growth and biomass allocation. However, the relative growth rate (RGR) of most of the species was enhanced under elevated [CO2] and/or nutrient enrichment. These results suggest that most of the tested study species will likely be of management concern under future global environmental change conditions. However, it is important that future research efforts test the potential shifts in the competitive interactions between native and exotic naturalised freshwater species in response to global environmental changes in order to determine community-level consequences of these changes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Emergent; Environmental change; Growth; Invasive; Root; Shoot","biomass allocation; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); environmental conditions; eutrophication; freshwater environment; growth rate; nutrient enrichment; plant; Ludwigia palustris; Mentha aquatica; Mentha pulegium; Nasturtium officinale; Zantedeschia aethiopica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088816181

Among the existing benefit-sharing options, the adoption of the stock-and-flow approach to share REDD+ benefits has afforded fair jurisdictional systems in the states of Acre and Mato Grosso in the Brazilian Amazon. This innovative perspective is also the dividing line between inequitable and socially balanced jurisdictional REDD+ initiatives. However, these jurisdictions present challenges to fully implementing a robust benefit-sharing mechanism including the stock-and-flow approach and guaranteeing that resources will be accessible to the relevant beneficiaries. To better understand these challenges, we applied the Options Assessment Framework (OAF), a methodology proposed by the World Bank to evaluate the capacity to implement an effective benefit-sharing mechanism for REDD+, in Acre and Mato Grosso. The results indicated that these jurisdictions need to strengthen their conditions to guarantee the multi-faceted functionality of this mechanism and determine what aspects need more attention and where resources should be invested. Additionally, the results indicated that an equitable benefit-sharing mechanism is, by far, the main challenge faced by jurisdictions. Despite being a more evolved state in its REDD+ policies, Acre still needs to improve its institutional capacities, particularly in its local civil society organizations, to help communities access these benefits. The state of Mato Grosso, on the other hand, is still engaging in its REDD+ initiative and needs its institutional capacities to further mature to better organize its monitoring mechanisms and governance. © 2020 by the authors.","Benefit-sharing mechanisms; REDD+; Stock-and-flow approach","Amazon region; Benefit sharing; Brazilian Amazon; Civil society; Forest degradation; Institutional capacities; Monitoring mechanisms; Reducing emissions; Deforestation; environmental policy; forest inventory; forest management; organizational framework; policy implementation; public access; Capacity; Deforestation; Degradation; Flow; Monitoring; Organizations; Plants; Resources; Acre [Brazil]; Brazil; Mato Grosso",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092469559

The analysis is based on a quantitative counting and sorting of all references to plants in the analysed fictions. The aim of this exercise is to contribute to theoretical reflections on climate fiction (cli-fi) as a literary form and to say something about the kind of literary thinking with, and about, plants that currently informs (Nordic) climate fiction for young adults, given that plants are highly important to the global climate. While broadening the discussion of climate change fiction to include a consideration of plants, the article further contributes to theoretical reflection on cli-fi through its Nordic perspective. In dialogue with Adam Trexler’s work on Anglo-American climate change fiction, the Nordic fictions examined here display both similar and diverging patterns of engagement with climate change, something that highlights the importance of reflecting on the genre with reference to a wide spectrum of local literatures. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate fiction; Critical plant studies; Ecocriticism; Nordic; Posthuman; Young adult literature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066031687

For these reasons, the aim of the work was to define specific IPCC coefficient taking into account differences in pedological characteristics that affect soil C steady state. In a vineyard area of Sicily, the effectiveness of 5 years of recommended management practice (RMP) adoption on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock increases was evaluated by considering 100 paired sites distributed over four functional soil groups. Each site consisted of two neighbouring plots. The soil of one plot was managed with cover crops according to RMP, and the other plot was managed with conventional tillage practices. IPCC coefficients were also derived and specifically adjusted for semiarid environments. SOC changes following RMP adoption and SOC steady-state levels were correlated with functional soil groupings. SOC increased from 24.8 to 28.3 t ha−1 in conventional and RMP vineyards, respectively, with the highest increases being observed in vertic and the lowest in calcic soils. The management factor (Fmg) ranged from 1.11 for calcaric to 1.44 for vertic functional soil groups. C maintenance requirement (C input) should be estimated in relation to soil functional groups. Findings of this study highlighted how the fine tuning of C steady state in relation to specific environmental characteristics is necessary to avoid overestimation of soil C sequestration. Awareness of correct soil C sequestration potential is useful for policymakers and stakeholders for future C account and land degradation control planning. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon steady state; CO2 mitigation; cover cropping; Mediterranean environment; vineyard soil management","Agronomy; Climate change; Organic carbon; CO2 mitigation; cover cropping; Mediterranean environment; Soil management; Steady state; Soils; cover crop; management practice; Mediterranean environment; organic carbon; pedology; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil management; soil organic matter; vineyard; Italy; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068036134

RES are mainly decentralised, not always predictable and introduce a high degree of volatility into energy grids. To cope with this challenges, flexible multi-energy-systems (MES) may be beneficial. To assess impacts of high degree of RES on energy grids and derive suitable countermeasures, simulation tools are necessary. In this article we propose a modelling framework suitable to perform a detailed technical assessment of MES. This framework (HyFlow) allows for MES simulation and includes depiction of spatial area and simplification of electricity grids without neglecting its properties. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of HyFlow to assess the impacts of the Austrian energy strategy #mission2030 on the energy grids of an Austrian federal state. We present and analyse two scenarios with various degrees of future generation and demand developments, including sector-coupling technologies, energy storages and electric vehicles. Both scenarios demonstrate that a high degree of renewable electricity generation can be realised with few improvements of the current energy infrastructure. Hybrid technologies such as heat pumps and power-to-gas turned out to be crucial in terms of both, energy efficiency as well as flexibility. © 2020, Aalborg University press.

As these disruptions and costs have become increasingly salient in recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in the climate policy community about how low-carbon transitions can be implemented justly, equitably, and politically smoothly. A key part of what is needed in responding to this growing interest is a better understanding of the suite of ‘transitional assistance policies’ and strategies that can be deployed, alongside or as part of climate change mitigation policies and processes. Responding to this need, we survey a wide, multi-disciplinary literature to answer the ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘how’ of transitional assistance policy: who is likely to be adversely affected by the low-carbon transition, and in what ways? What substantive strategies and policy instruments are available to governments to mitigate the burdens of low-carbon transitions? And how can governments implement such strategies and policies successfully? In the course of answering the first two of these questions, we develop a novel typology of transitional assistance policies, in which multiple policies are parsimoniously classified according to one of four coherent policy strategies, and one of five kinds of beneficiaries. In answering the third question, we emphasize the importance of certain ‘state capacities’ for shaping transition processes and managing vested interests. Key policy insights Without transitional assistance policies, consumers, workers, businesses, specially-affected communities, and states that are highly dependent on emissions-intensive assets stand to lose from decarbonization. Transitional assistance policies can be narrow (addressing financial losses only) or broad (addressing a wider range of losses), and conservative (backward-looking) or adaptive (forward-looking). Combining these elements yields four coherent transitional assistance strategies: compensation; exemption; structural adjustment assistance; and comprehensive adaptive support. Comprehensive adaptive support strategies have greatest potential for just, equitable and smooth transition outcomes, but are costlier and more complex to implement. State capacities to steer complex, long-term transitions are therefore a crucial variable in transition success. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change mitigation; compensation; Just transition; state capacities; structural adjustment assistance; transitions","carbon; climate change; environmental policy; global economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071336228

The impermanent and iterative nature of such initiatives makes it difficult to determine their enduring and potentially transformative impact. This review systematises how the sustainability transitions field has approached temporary initiatives. It finds broad agreement on the difficulty of sustaining local transitions, but little analytical engagement with how temporary initiatives shape transition pathways over time. The review therefore proposes a typology of temporal dimensions to help assess the dynamics between ephemerality and permanence in local transitions. By mapping the recent empirical sustainability transitions literature along these dimensions, ephemerality is found to be ubiquitous in local initiatives–there is a lot happening that does not endure but serves other functions. Actors deploy a range of local strategies directed at either formalising initiatives or retaining relevance by reinventing themselves, thus routinising sustainability transitions. © 2020","Durability; Local governance; Relationality; Sustainability transitions; Temporality; Transformation pathways","action plan; climate change; empirical analysis; institutional framework; local planning; strategic approach; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085348768

The plant and fungal kingdoms offer great potential but remain mostly untapped. Their increased use could contribute to the renewable energy transition and addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” Current research focuses on species cultivated at scale in temperate regions, overlooking the wealth of potential new sources of small-scale energy where they are most urgently needed. A shift towards diversified, accessible bioenergy technologies will help to mitigate and adapt to the threats of climate change, decrease energy poverty, improve human health by reducing indoor pollution, increase energy resilience of communities, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Summary: Bioenergy derived from plants and fungi is a major component of the global transition to renewable energy technologies. There is rich untapped diversity in the plant and fungal kingdoms that offers potential to contribute to the shift away from fossil fuels and to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” Energy poverty—the lack of access to modern energy services—is most acute in the Global South where biodiversity is greatest and least investigated. Our systematic review of the literature over the last 5 years (2015–2020) indicates that research efforts have targeted a very small number of plant species cultivated at scale, mostly in temperate regions. The wealth of potential new sources of bioenergy in biodiverse regions, where the implementation of SDG7 is most urgently needed, has been largely overlooked. We recommend next steps for bioenergy stakeholders—research, industry, and government—to seize opportunities for innovation to alleviate energy poverty while protecting biodiversity. Small-scale energy production using native plant species in bioenergy landscapes overcomes many pitfalls associated with bioenergy crop monocultures, such as biodiversity loss and conflict with food production. Targeted trait-based screening of plant species and biological screening of fungi are required to characterize the potential of this resource. The benefits of diversified, accessible bioenergy go beyond the immediate urgency of energy poverty as more diverse agricultural landscapes are more resilient, store more carbon, and could also reduce the drivers of the climate and environmental emergencies. © 2020 The Authors, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Foundation","Bioenergy; biofuel; biogas; energy poverty; feedstock; renewables; research effort; sustainable energy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104813501

The paper has also discussed changes in air quality parameters at different monitoring stations in Bengaluru during the same period. A discussion on air quality, grounded on contemporary studies conducted to evaluate impact of lockdown on ambient air in different cities, has provided an overview of the changes in air quality. The results provide an understanding that the overall air quality has been improved in all the studied cities; but further comprehensive assessment, considering the factors controlling the present air quality, is suggested to identify pathways for emission reduction to maintain the air quality in business as usual situation in future. © JHE 2020.","Air quality index; COVID-19; Lockdown; Megacities; Urban environment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089346324

A comparison was made between hybrid energy systems operating on the territory of Bulgaria, in the presence of energy storage with Li-ion batteries. A hybrid energy system has been built up to power a single-family house. The greenhouse gas emissions of the system in single-family houses were investigated. Long-term continuous implementation of the hybrid renewable energy system was simulated using HOMER Pro software and was discussed. The proposed hybrid energy system aims to show the amount of greenhouse gas emission reduction by single-family house implementation. This article provides recommendations on the number of harmful emissions, carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) that can be reduced by using a hybrid power supply system (solar and wind) in the presence of a battery storage system. The article proves that renewable energy sources (solar and wind generator) together with energy storage leads to approximately 50 % reduction of harmful CO2 and NOX emissions. © 2020 IEEE.","batteries storage technologies; greenhouse gases; HOMER Pro; hybrid power system; renewable energy sources; solar and wind generation","Carbon dioxide; Electric power systems; Emission control; Energy storage; Greenhouse gases; Houses; Lithium-ion batteries; Natural resources; Nitrogen oxides; Renewable energy resources; Solar power plants; Battery storage system; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid power supply systems; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Impact on the environment; Renewable energy source; Single-family house; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100466011

Despite global debt reaching unprecedented levels, little research has been done to understand the impacts of debt dynamics on environmental sustainability. Here, we explore the environmental impacts of the debt-growth cycle in Indonesia, the world’s largest debt-based producer of palm oil. Our empirical Agent-Based Model analyses the future effects (2018–2050) of power (im)balance scenarios between debt-driven economic forces (i.e. banks, firms), and conservation forces, on two ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation) and biodiversity. The model shows the trade-offs and synergies among these indicators for Business As Usual as compared to alternative scenarios. Results show that debt-driven economic forces can partially support environmental conservation, provided the state’s role in protecting the environment is reinforced. Our analysis provides a lesson for developing countries that are highly dependent on debt-based production systems: sustainable development pathways can be achievable in the short and medium terms; however, reaching long-term sustainability requires reduced dependency on external financial powers, as well as further government intervention to protect the environment from the rough edges of the market economy. © 2019, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Agent-based model; Debt; Ecosystem services; Palm oil; Social–ecological system; Sustainable development","biodiversity; conservation status; developing world; ecological economics; economic growth; ecosystem service; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; government; market conditions; oil production; sustainability; sustainable development; Indonesia; palm oil; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; Indonesia; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Indonesia; Palm Oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076200786

In this paper, single-family houses with different shape factors and window-to-wall ratios are analysed from both a thermal and environmental perspective using Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) software to calculate the energy demand. The study has been carried out for different Atlantic microclimates (coastal, inland, and mountain) in northern Spain. What most affects the thermal energy used for air conditioning is the variation of the microclimates, so the study focuses mainly on this aspect. Operational energy for heating has decreased greatly via the use of high degree of insulation and hence the next task is to decrease the total energy consumed taking into account the embodied energy. Impacts on Primary Energy and Global Warming Potential are calculated using a cradle-to-grave approach. The energy use for heating and domestic hot water is analysed for different thicknesses of insulation under three energy supply scenarios: electricity only (for 2018 and with the Spanish decarbonisation plan for 2030); heat pump plus electricity; and natural gas boiler. Even for houses with a good level of insulation, the ratio of operational-to-total impacts varies significantly: from 46% to 87% for primary energy and from 31% to 75% for global warming potential, depending on the shape factor of the house, the microclimate and the heat supply scenario. By applying future environmental policies, electricity can become a more environmentally friendly option than natural gas. © 2020 by the authors.

This feature has not been properly studied by researchers or policymakers, in spite of being one of the main tools that can encourage building owners to perform renovation activities. Considering the scarce research focusing on the recommendations list of measures, more information is needed in order to identify weaknesses, barriers and improvements of this tool. This is especially important since the European commitment to reduce their emissions in 2020 are far from reaching the proposed goals, mainly becouse of the low renovation rate. This critical review is based on the current literature mainly from reports delivered by the Commission and academic research. The study focuses on the requirement set by the directive, its current performance, barriers and improvements that can be made to take this tool to a level that can be effectively used by policymakers, certifiers and owners. The upgrade of the recommendation list of measure should strengthen their calculation methods and procedure from both local authorities and the Commission. This should be in line with the certifiers’ needs in order to do relevant work, including proper training, mandatory field inspections and tools. Lastly, financial policies and information should be implemented to accompany the certificate, ensuring that building owners interested in renovation have assistance and financial facilities or easy access to relevant information on this matter. The main conclusion of this study reveals that the regulatory framework could use some strictness in order to avoid ‘just enough’ implementations. Ambiguous definitions and too flexible obligations should be revised, especially cost-effectiveness and training for the certifiers. Attention on how to deliver the information to building owners should be increased, allowing them to understand the results, its implications and how to concretize renovation work through financial mechanisms, thus increasing the reliability of the EPC and the RLM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Accompanying measures; Energy performance certificate; EPBD; Recommendation list of measures; Renovation; Retrofitting","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Finance; Academic research; Building owners; Critical review; Current performance; Energy performance; Field inspection; Local authorities; Regulatory frameworks; Buildings",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085269560

First, we analyze the most stable configuration for Pt adsorption on the defective nanotube, obtaining a more favorable binding energy for a symmetric structure with equivalent C[sbnd]Pt bonds. Next, several configurations are studied for COS adsorption on the Pt-doped nanotube. In the most stable systems, the adsorbate interacts with the Pt decoration through its C and S atoms, with adsorption energy values of about −2.7 eV. Overlap population and bonding order studies are also performed, showing a strong affinity between COS and the Pt-doped surface. Furthermore, an important electronic transfer from nanotube to the gas molecule was detected, which would indicate chemical adsorption.

Herein, we have developed a facile strategy to the manipulation of the cobalt spin state over covalent organic frameworks (COFs), COF-367-Co, by simply changing the oxidation state of Co centered in the porphyrin. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with experimental results confirm that CoII and CoIII are embedded in COF-367 with S = 1/2 and 0 spin ground states, respectively. Remarkably, photocatalytic CO2 reduction results indicate that COF-367-CoIII exhibits favorable activity and significantly enhanced selectivity to HCOOH, accordingly much reduced activity and selectivity to CO and CH4, in sharp contrast to COF-367-CoII. The results highlight that the spin-state transition of cobalt greatly regulates photocatalytic performance. Theoretical calculations further disclose that the presence of CoIII in COF-367-Co is preferable to the formation of HCOOH but detrimental to its further conversion, which clearly accounts for its distinctly different photocatalysis over COF-367-CoII. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on regulating photocatalysis by spin state manipulation in COFs. © 2020 American Chemical Society",,"Cobalt; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Formic acid; Ground state; Magnetic moments; Photocatalytic activity; Spin dynamics; Catalytic performance; Covalent organic frameworks; Oxidation state; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic performance; Spin ground state; Spin state transition; Theoretical calculations; Electrospinning; cobalt; coordination compound; covalent organic framework; methane; unclassified drug; Article; chemical analysis; chemical modification; concentration (parameter); density functional theory; electrochemistry; extended X ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy; gas chromatography; impedance spectroscopy; photocatalysis; photochemistry; regulatory mechanism; scanning electron microscopy; synthesis; X ray powder diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092432172

Using a system boundary that started at winter wheat seeding and ended at summer maize harvest, a field experiment was conducted in Shandong Province (North China) to determine the effect of microbial fertilization and tillage on the carbon footprint (CF). The climate-based ecosystem services were evaluated in wheat-maize cropping systems. Also the optimal microbial fertilization and tillage with the lowest CF, highest climate-based ecosystem services and highest crop yield were determined. The results showed that compared with microbial organic fertilization, the use of microbial decomposing agents increased soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration (2582.1–2909.9 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) and reduced CF (0.11–0.12 kg CO2-eq kg−1 grain). Chemical fertilization was the largest contributor to total CF (27.5–56.7%), which decreased with decreasing chemical fertilization. Climate-based ecosystem services of microbial fertilization with rotary tillage (1689.9–1795.6 US$ ha−1 yr−1) were significantly higher than those of chemical fertilization. In the limited system boundary of wheat-maize cropping, microbial decomposing agent MA (of 30 L ha−1) with rotary tillage had the highest grain production, GHG emission mitigation and climate-based ecosystem services enhancement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Ecosystem service; Microbial fertilization; Tillage practice; Wheat-maize cropping system","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Crops; Emission control; Fertilizers; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Fertilizer applications; Ghg emission mitigations; Organic fertilization; Shandong province; Soil organic carbon; Tillage management; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086504446

The activity of microbial extracellular enzymes is generally the limiting step for soil organic matter mineralization. Nevertheless, the influence of soil characteristics and climate parameters on microbial extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) performance at different water availabilities and temperatures remains to be detailed. Different soils from the Iberian Peninsula presenting distinctive climatic scenarios were sampled for these analyses. Results showed that microbial EEA in the mesophilic temperature range presents optimal rates under wet conditions (high water availability) while activity at the thermophilic temperature range (60°C) could present maximum EEA rates under dry conditions if the soil is frequently exposed to high temperatures. Optimum water availability conditions for maximum soil microbial EEA were influenced mainly by soil texture. Soil properties and climatic parameters are major environmental components ruling soil water availability and temperature which were decisive factors regulating soil microbial EEA. This study contributes decisively to the understanding of environmental factors on the microbial EEA in soils, specifically on the decisive influence of water availability and temperature on EEA. Unlike previous belief, optimum EEA in high temperature exposed soil upper layers can occur at low water availability (i.e., dryness) and high temperatures. This study shows the potential for a significant response by soil microbial EEA under conditions of high temperature and dryness due to a progressive environmental warming which will influence organic carbon decomposition at local and global scenarios. © 2020 The Authors.

Seasonal upwelling in the eastern Arabian Sea entrains nitrate rich waters to the surface, the intense productivity that follows leads to oxygen depletion and then denitrification. Heterotrophic bacteria comprise diverse functional groups. Both aerobic and facultative anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria capable of nitrate reduction are important functional groups in the nitrogen cycle due to their ability to respire anaerobically using nitrogen oxides as electron acceptors, which are reduced to nitrous oxide and dinitrogen. However little is known from the coastal Arabian Sea on the types/species of culturable bacteria catalyzing this crucial step. To recognize the species composition of the culturable fractions involved in nitrate reduction and nitrous oxide production, as many as 360 cultures of native heterotrophic bacteria were isolated and screened for nitrate reduction. Isolates were identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene and the rate of nitrate reduction and production of nitrous oxide by representatives of 30 different species of bacteria were measured. Close to 77% (or 277 of 360) of the cultures were found to be nitrate reducers, which grouped into 30 different species. Further, the nitrate reduction rates and nitrous oxide production by these 30 representative nitrate reducing species were measured. Cultures were capable of nitrate reduction up to 2.40 (×10−14) mol cell−1 and 5.54 (×10−15) mol cell−1 of nitrous oxide. This high fraction of culturable bacteria reducing nitrate and producing N2O in low oxygen conditions ought to reflect their important role in biogeochemical processes in the tropical coastal water experiencing hypoxia during SuM (Summer monsoon) and FIM (Fall intermonsoon) in the monsoon affected regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Culturable bacteria; Nitrate reduction rate; Nitrous oxide production; South eastern Arabian Sea","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biogeochemistry; Denitrification; Ecology; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; RNA; Biogeochemical dynamics; Biogeochemical process; Culturable bacteria; Eastern Arabian Sea; Heterotrophic bacterias; Low oxygen conditions; Nitrate reduction; Nitrous oxide production; Aerobic bacteria; bacterium; biogeochemistry; coastal zone; hypoxic conditions; microbial ecology; monsoon; nitrate; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; oxic conditions; upwelling; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049080214

However, current emission inventories have limited temporal resolution and use data derived from a small subset of farms. To this end, we deployed three mobile laboratories during the DISCOVER-AQ campaign in summer 2014 with a focus on northeastern Colorado. Observations of NH3 and CH4 plumes downwind of 43 CAFOs were used to investigate the diurnal and site-to-site variability of emissions with an inverse area source plume modeling approach. Ammonia emissions scaled to all permitted animals in Weld, Morgan, and Larimer counties were estimated at 1.9 Gg month-1, 50% greater than the U.S. NEI 2014 and 360% greater than EDGAR for the month of August. Methane emissions were likewise estimated at 10.6 Gg month-1, consistent with the U.S. GHGI but 99% greater than EDGAR. Significant differences between individual CAFOs with repeat observations were also observed for both CH4 and NH3 emissions. The large subfarm, site-to-site, and diurnal variabilities observed show the importance of measurements taken across these scales in order to derive representative emission factors.

This counters what should be a long-term trend toward greater democracy. Recent research has shown that progress toward stable democracy is strongly associated with progress in the demographic transition. Since most of the world is rapidly dropping in fertility as more countries complete this transition, democracy should be spreading. However, a resurgence of anxiety, nationalism, and support for strong-man governance is associated with sudden waves of immigration from unfamiliar sources. Because certain parts of the world - mainly Central America, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East - still have very young and rapidly growing populations who suffer from poor economic prospects, adverse climate change, and bad governance, those regions are sending waves of migrants seeking asylum to Europe and the United States, raising anxieties that undermine liberal democratic governance. Global democracy is thus being tugged in opposing directions by current demographic trends. Improving governance in poorer countries to cope with the negative impact of climate change and to create better economic prospects, as well as efforts to reduce fertility, are essential to diminish the surges of migrants and restore the impetus toward democracy that should prevail in mature societies. © 2020 American Political Science Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094188997

We present an updated chronology of the core from DSDDP Hole 5017-1-A, from the Dead Sea's deepest basin, that refines our previous chronology (Torfstein et al. 2015) based on new information. The updated chronology uses the following approaches: (1) radiocarbon ages of Kitagawa et al. (2017); (2) correlation of specific layers in the core with U–Th-dated sediments on the Dead Sea margin, particularly during the interval of glacial Lake Lisan (MIS 2,3,4); (3) tuning of the δ18O data of DSDDP core aragonite to the U–Th dated oxygen isotopes of regional cave speleothems; and (4) tuning of the DSDDP aragonite δ18O data to summer insolation curves when the cave δ18O chronology is less clear. The updated chronology reveals a strong relationship between the sedimentary facies comprising the core and Northern Hemisphere summer insolation variations. It shows that sequences of sediments marking drier/wetter/drier climate conditions in the lake's watershed (e.g., salt/muds/salt, respectively) appear across the flank/peak/flank segments of several summer insolation peaks. In particular, the transition from drier to wetter sedimentary facies during mid-latitude insolation peaks coincides with the intervals of sapropel conditions in the Mediterranean, reflecting enhanced Nile flow due to intense African monsoonal conditions, and marking the impact of the tropical precession cycles on Eastern Mediterranean hydroclimate. This pattern was lost during MIS 2,3,4, when mostly sequences of primary aragonite are punctuated by gypsum precipitation during Heinrich events, marking the strong impact of the North Atlantic on the last glacial Levant hydroclimate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chronology; Eastern Mediterranean; Hydroclimate; ICDP drilling; Insolation; Levant; Paleoclimatology; Quaternary; Radiocarbon; Sapropels; U–Th dating","Carbonate minerals; Caves; Driers (materials); Glacial geology; Incident solar radiation; Infill drilling; Isotopes; Lakes; Sedimentology; Climate condition; Eastern Mediterranean; Gypsum precipitation; Heinrich Events; Marine isotope stages; Northern Hemispheres; Oxygen isotopes; Sedimentary facies; Core drilling; aragonite; chronology; climate conditions; climate cycle; Deep Sea Drilling Project; hydrometeorology; insolation; marine isotope stage; Northern Hemisphere; watershed; wetting-drying cycle; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Dead Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089277951

In this paper, taking the example of Delhi, one of the most polluted cities of India, an analysis has been done to compare the levels of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NOx and ozone) during the lockdown and the same period in the previous years. The study shows that the extent to which the industries, vehicles, power plants etc. release the air pollutants and severely impact the environment and human health. As during the lockdown when all such activities were either stopped or very much restricted, a reduction of almost 60% in the particulate matter pollution and up to 40% in the NOx pollution was observed while the ozone levels were reduced by 30-40% as compared to the same period during the previous two years. In the end, some suggestions have been made which can play some part to control air pollution once the lockdown is over. © 2020 Technoscience Publications.

Where should conservation resources be directed to maximize expected conservation benefits given future climate uncertainty? Here, we explore this question by quantifying variation in fish species’ distributions across future climate scenarios in the Red River basin south-central United States. We modeled historical and future stream fish distributions using a suite of environmental covariates derived from high-resolution hydrologic and climatic modeling of the basin. We quantified variation in outcomes for individual species across climate scenarios and across space, and identified hotspots of species loss by summing changes in probability of occurrence across species. Under all climate scenarios, we find that the distribution of most fish species in the Red River Basin will contract by 2050. However, the variability across climate scenarios was more than 10 times higher for some species than for others. Despite this uncertainty in outcomes for individual species, hotspots of species loss tended to occur in the same portions of the basin across all climate scenarios. We also find that the most common species are projected to experience the greatest range contractions, underscoring the need for directing conservation resources toward both common and rare species. Our results suggest that while it may be difficult to predict which species will be most impacted by climate change, it may nevertheless be possible to identify spatial priorities for climate mitigation actions that are robust to future climate uncertainty. These findings are likely to be generalizable to other ecosystems around the world where future climate conditions follow prevailing historical patterns of key environmental covariates. © 2020 The Authors.

However, the emission quantum yields are relatively low owing to the existence of low-lying dark electronic states and fast excitonic diffusion leading to carrier quenching at defects. Covalent functionalization of SWCNTs addresses this problem by brightening their infrared emission. Namely, introduction of sp3-hybridized defects makes the lowest energy transitions optically active for some defect geometries and enables further control of their optical properties. Such functionalized SWCNTs are currently the only material exhibiting room-temperature single photon emission at telecom relevant infrared wavelengths. While this fluorescence is strong and has the right wavelength, functionalization introduces a variety of emission peaks resulting in spectrally broad inhomogeneous photoluminescence that prohibits the use of SWCNTs in practical applications. Consequently, there is a strong need to control the emission diversity in order to render these materials useful for applications. Recent experimental and computational work has attributed the emissive diversity to the presence of multiple localized defect geometries each resulting in distinct emission energy. This Account outlines methods by which the morphology of the defect in functionalized SWCNTs can be controlled to reduce emissive diversity and to tune the fluorescence wavelengths. The chirality-dependent trends of emission energies with respect to individual defect morphologies are explored. It is demonstrated that defect geometries originating from functionalization of SWCNT carbon atoms along bonds with strong π-orbital mismatch are favorable. Furthermore, the effect of controlling the defect itself through use of different chemical groups is also discussed. Such tunability is enabled due to the formation of specific defect geometries in close proximity to other existing defects. This takes advantage of the changes in π-orbital mismatch enforced by existing defects and the resulting changes in reactivities toward formation of specific defect morphologies. Furthermore, the trends in emissive energies are highly dependent on the value of mod(n-m,3) for an (n,m) tube chirality. These powerful concepts allow for a targeted formation of defects that emit at desired energies based on SWCNT single chirality enriched samples. Finally, the impact of functionalization with specific types of defects that enforce certain defect geometries due to steric constraints in bond lengths and angles to the SWCNT are discussed. We further relate to a similar effect that is present in systems where high density of surface defects is formed due to high reactant concentration. The outlined strategies suggested by simulations are instrumental in guiding experimental efforts toward the generation of functionalized SWCNTs with tunable emission energies.

In total 94,940 measurements were made of 75,622 individual vehicles during the five campaigns. The measurements are subset into vehicle type (bus, car, HGV, minibus, motorcycle, other, plant, taxi, van, and unknown), fuel type for car (petrol and diesel), and EURO class, and particulate matter (PM), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are reported. In terms of recent EURO class emission trends, NO and NOx emissions decrease from EURO 5 to EURO 6 for nearly all vehicle categories. Interestingly, taxis show a marked increase in NO2 emissions from EURO 5 to EURO 6. Perhaps most concerningly is a marked increase in PM emissions from EURO 5 to EURO 6 for HGVs. Another noteworthy observation was that vans, buses and HGVs of unknown EURO class were often the dirtiest vehicles in their classes, suggesting that where counts of such vehicles are high, they will likely make a significant contribution to local emissions. Using Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) weighting we provide an indication of the magnitude of the on-site VERSS bias and also a closer estimate of the regulatory test/on-road emissions differences. Finally, a new ‘EURO Updating Potential’ (EUP) factor is introduced, to assess the effect of a range of air pollutant emissions restricted zones either currently in use or marked for future introduction. In particular, the effects of the London based Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and Ultra-Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ), and the proposed Birmingham based Clean Air Zone (CAZ) are estimated.

The present study investigates the characteristics and cause of the seasonality in rainfall change. Diagnostically, tropical precipitation change is decomposed into thermodynamic and dynamic components. The thermodynamic component represents the wet-get-wetter effect and its seasonality is due mostly to that in the mean vertical velocity, especially in the monsoon regions. The dynamic component includes the warmer-get-wetter effect due to the spatial variations in sea surface temperature (SST) warming, while the seasonality is due to that of the climatological SST and can be largely reproduced by an atmospheric model forced with the monthly climatological SST plus the annual-mean SST warming pattern. In the eastern equatorial Pacific where the SST warming is locally enhanced; for example, rainfall increases only during the March–May season when the climatological SST is high enough for deep convection. To the extent that the seasonality of tropical precipitation change over oceans arises mostly from that of the climatological SST, the results support the notion that reducing model biases in climatology improves regional rainfall projections. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Global warming; Rain; Surface waters; Tropics; Atmospheric model; Dynamic component; Eastern equatorial Pacific; Mean vertical velocity; Sea surface temperature (SST); Spatial variations; Tropical precipitation; Warming patterns; Oceanography; atmospheric forcing; atmospheric modeling; global warming; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; sea surface temperature; seasonality; spatial variation; thermodynamics; tropical environment; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090442917

Even though these batteries are a promising alternative, the accuracy of the battery state of charge (SOC) estimation is a critical factor for their safe and reliable operation. The SOC is a key indicator of battery residual capacity. Its estimation can effectively prevent battery over-discharge and over-charge. Next, this enables reliable estimation of the operation time of fully electric ferries, where little time is spent at the harbour, with limited time available for charging. Thus, battery management systems are essential. This paper presents a neural network model of battery SOC estimation, using a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) as a method for accurate estimation of the SOC in lithium-ion batteries. The current, voltage and surface temperature of the batteries are used as the inputs of the neural network. The influence of different numbers of neurons in the neural network's hidden layer on the estimation error is analysed, and the estimation error of the neural network under different training times is compared. In addition, the hidden layer is varied from 1 to 3 layers of the LSTM nucleus and the SOC estimation error is analysed. The results show that the maximum absolute SOC estimation error of the LSTM RNN is 1.96% and the root mean square error is 0.986%, which validates the feasibility of the method. © 2020 Sciendo.

In addition, the EU has called upon Member States to phase out their support to fossil fuels by 2020. Progress towards this goal, however, has been slow. Our research finds that 11 countries (accounting for 83% of the EU’s emissions) and the EU’s budget and public banks still provide at least €21 billion per year of support for the production of coal, oil, and gas (with €2.6 billion of this amount allocated to the transition away from coal). This is via three distinct financial flows: fiscal support via budgetary transfers and tax breaks; public lending to the sector; and capital investment by fossil fuel-related state-owned enterprises. The financing captured by this figure is a minimum estimate due to lack of transparency in the data provided by governments. We argue that it is vital for European governments to fulfil their promises to phase out subsidies and other financial flows to fossil fuels to meet their climate goals. This must start with greater transparency around the support being provided and phase-out plans, including annual reporting on support for production and consumption of fossil fuels, in line with the EU’s recently strengthened Energy Union Governance framework for 2030. This entails the inclusion of national policies, timelines, and measures aimed at phasing out financial support to fossil fuels in Member States’ National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs). Key Policy insights: Between 2014 and 2016, 11 European countries and the EU public banks and budget provided at least €21 billion per year of support for the production of coal, oil, and gas. Meeting commitments to phase out subsidies towards the production of fossil fuels is critical for meeting climate goals. EU Member States insufficiently reported on their fossil fuel subsidies in their draft NECPs. Greater transparency and reporting on all fossil fuel financing is a key first step towards phase-out. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; climate policy; energy policy; fossil fuel subsidies; production subsidies; public finance","capital flow; emission inventory; environmental policy; European Union; financial system; fossil fuel; governance approach; subsidy system; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082875677

Here, a fluorophore, BODIPY 493/503, displayed altered solid-state emission characteristics upon being hosted within a crystalline molecular flask. Specifically, a bathochromic shift of 939 cm-1 was observed (λ(max): 633 → 673 nm), with a concomitant reduction in emission intensity, and emission dependency on excitation wavelength. Multiple factors likely contribute to this behaviour, such as emission filtering by the host framework, exciplex formation between BODIPY and the electron-deficient framework, and collisional quenching between the host and guest. Here we prioritize solid-state analyses to explore these factors, including electron density mapping of the framework pores, and multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",,"Dyes; Anti-counterfeiting; Collisional quenching; Concomitant reduction; Emission characteristics; Emission intensity; Excitation wavelength; Multinuclear solid state NMR; Solid state emission; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; article; filtration; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; solid state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089997481

However, the geology of these caves and the paleoenvironmental context of human occupation remain poorly documented and understood. In this study, we obtained new ages yielded by MC-ICPMS uranium-series dating of speleothems from Zhiren Cave, Guangxi, where a partial early modern human mandible and 2 M have been recovered. The ages demonstrate that cave infilling of Zhiren Cave began at ~1 Ma, much earlier than the date previously suggested. Our dating results also suggest that fossils of anatomically modern human were deposited in Zhiren Cave during marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, between ~190 and ~130 ka, representing the oldest known anatomically modern human remains in East Asia. The cave's sedimentary processes and the paleoenvironmental changes were reconstructed based on detailed analyses of lithostratigraphy, grain-size, pollen assemblages and the chemical weathering intensity of the sediments inside Zhiren Cave. The results show that major climatic changes in the Middle Pleistocene led to the accelerated incision of local streams and the erosion of cave sediments by controlling the regional hydrological response during the Early to Middle Pleistocene. After ~300 ka, increased climatic contrasts between glacial and interglacial periods dominated the accumulation of sediments and the occupation of mammals and early modern humans in Zhiren Cave. Gradually desiccating climatic conditions and reduced forest cover during the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6) may have define a temporal window for the human occupation of Zhiren Cave, providing ideal environmental conditions. However, floodwater incursion and/or dense vegetation cover corresponding to a much warmer and wetter climate in the subsequent last interglacial (MIS 5) may have discouraged humans from further occupying Zhiren Cave. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Cave filling; Glacial-interglacial; Middle Pleistocene transition; Modern human","cave; climate variation; fossil assemblage; glacial-interglacial cycle; hominid; human activity; Pleistocene; settlement pattern; China; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079070904

There is a clear imperative to keep a large proportion of fossil fuel reserves underground to keep global temperature rise under 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Yet, there is no global overview of supply-side initiatives taken to constrain fossil fuel production, making it difficult to track trends, compare efforts across countries, and assess the effectiveness of different supply-side approaches. The Fossil Fuel Cuts Database presented here identifies 1302 initiatives implemented between 1988 and 2017 in 106 countries across the seven major types of supply-side approaches. Documenting temporal and geographical patterns, we show a rapid growth in the number of supply-side initiatives taken during the past decade and their highly uneven adoption across the world. Most initiatives occurred in countries with low economic dependence on fossil fuel production and limited fossil fuel exports, with the partial exception of Canada and Norway at the national level, and the US at the sub-national level. We discuss policy implications and the need for further research to identify adoption factors, effectiveness, and policy implications. The documentation of a wide range of supply-side initiatives serves as a reminder that constraints on fossil fuel production need to be analysed and considered on a par with demand-side interventions, including in Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Key policy insights Supply-side constraint initiatives have increased in the past decade, suggesting growing policy take-up and potential mitigation impacts. Supply-side initiatives clearly emphasize the key role and responsibility of major carbon producers, and help mobilize demand for greater accountability. Supply-side initiatives take many forms and can suit the capabilities of different actors, from civil society organizations to governments. Supply-side initiatives can usefully complement demand-side measures and help tackle free-rider problems. Larger coalitions of fossil fuel producers are required to address uneven adoption, prevent the relocation of production, and help producers transition away from fossil fuels. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","blockades; divestments; Fossil Fuel Cuts Database; Fossil fuels; moratorium; supply-side","adaptive management; climate change; database; demand-side management; environmental policy; fossil fuel; oil production; policy implementation; trend analysis; Canada; Norway; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079706725

For the socioeconomic analysis, a Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) method was used to estimate production of goods and services, value added creation and employment opportunities. For the environmental evaluation, an Environmental Footprint (EF) analysis was performed. The levelized electricity costs and the greenhouse gas emissions abatement costs were also calculated. Results showed that the socioeconomic effects are relevant, although only a 23% of these effects remain in Turkey. The environmental profile is also good in terms of climate change impacts, showing substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel alternatives for electricity generation. Regarding the life cycle stages of the technology, the highest environmental impacts are produced in the PV manufacturing processes. The electricity produced is still more costly than fossil-based technologies and in the highest range of PV technologies, but greenhouse gases abatement costs are not so high when compared to other references. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV); Environmental footprint (EF); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Multi-regional input-output (MRIO); Sustainability","Climate change; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Building integrated photovoltaic; Electricity generation; Employment opportunities; Environmental evaluation; Environmental footprints; Levelized electricity cost; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084337291

Crop residues, like coffee stems, are burned in the field, used for domestic cooking or coffee drying in processing plants having significant environmental and health implication to rural communities. This research investigated the environmental impacts of replacing current practices with modern bioenergy applications in the Colombian coffee sector. A biomass gasification system to produce decentralised energy from coffee stems was considered, and the environmental impacts of such bioenergy implementation were evaluated. A lifecycle assessment was conducted to quantify the environmental performance of this bioenergy system and compare it to current residues uses and energy needs that feature small-to large-scale coffee farms. The results show that deploying modern bioenergy could result in reductions in 48–86% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and up to 98% less particulate matter formation when current practices and fossil-based energy are replaced. However, negative impacts should be considered as substituting grid electricity, largely generated from hydro-electricity, could increase GHGs by 68% and fossil fuel consumption by 73%. The results also show the relevance of understanding the environmental performance of bioenergy systems compared to reference scenarios; this allowed to evaluate and identify environmental trade-offs from modern bioenergy implementations. To maximise benefits and minimise the limitations of these systems, it is important to conduct whole-system assessments that inform on the wider environmental impacts of using agri-residues for bioenergy generation in a region- and system-specific context. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Coffee stems; Colombia; Environmental trade-offs; Gasification; Lifecycle assessment","Agricultural wastes; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Tropics; Bio-energy systems; Biomass gasification system; Current practices; Decentralised energies; Environmental performance; Health implications; Life-cycle assessments; Particulate matter formations; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087508341

It has been impossible to completely rely on pollution source control measures to solve this problem for a long time due to the diversity and complexity of pollution sources. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore alternate solutions to significantly improve air quality through increasing the capacity of green space in cities as these locations can provide multiple ecosystem services. In this study, a three-dimensional classification system was created by utilizing Beijing's urban forest as a study area. Considering the meteorological factors, change of month and time and the characteristics of the forest itself, the significance and difference of reducing the concentration of atmospheric suspended particulate matter by the forest with different vegetation structures were tested. The results showed that meteorological factors such as wind velocity, temperature, and relative humidity all had a very significant effect on the concentration of atmospheric suspended particulate matter in the conditions of this study. The concentration was highest in winter, followed by spring and autumn, and lowest in summer. The concentration in the morning was the lowest of the day, increasing in the noon and afternoon with time. It was the lowest in the closed single-layered mixed forest, and the highest in the open lawn green space. By comparing the forest with gradient areas of 0.5 ha and 3.0 ha, it was found that with the increase in the area, the green space did not necessarily show a better dust retention effect, and the vegetation structure type of the green space often had more important influence. There was a very significant correlation between vegetation structure and plant diversity (Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index and Simpson Diversity Index). Biodiversity could significantly support and strengthen urban forest ecological service functions that improve air quality. Increasing the plant species diversity could lead to lower particulate matter concentration. The research conclusions could provide theoretical and practical bases for how to select the combination of vegetation structure in the planning and design of urban forest oriented to improve air quality. © 2020 by the authors.","Area; Biodiversity; Green space; Meteorological factors","Air quality; Atmospheric humidity; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forestry; Pollution control; Vegetation; Classification system; Ecological services; Meteorological factors; Planning and design; Plant species diversity; Shannon-wiener diversity indices; Suspended particulate matters; Vegetation structure; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; complexity; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; greenspace; park design; pollutant source; relative humidity; suspended particulate matter; urban design; urban forestry; urban planning; urbanization; Air Quality; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants; Pollution Control; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090952438

A pressing question to address is if plant diversity will increase or decrease in this warming world since contradictory pieces of evidence exit of accelerating plant speciation and plant extinction in the Anthropocene. Results: Comparison may be made of the Anthropocene with the past geological times characterised by a warming climate, e.g., the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) 55.8 million years ago (Mya) - a period of ""crocodiles in the Arctic"", during which plants saw accelerated speciation through autopolyploid speciation. Three accelerators of plant speciation were reasonably identified in the Anthropocene, including cities, polar regions and botanical gardens where new plant species might be accelerating formed through autopolyploid speciation and hybridization. Conclusions: However, this kind of positive effect of climate warming on new plant species formation would be thoroughly offset by direct and indirect intensive human exploitation and human disturbances that cause habitat loss, deforestation, land use change, climate change, and pollution, thus leading to higher extinction risk than speciation in the Anthropocene. At last, four research directions are proposed to deepen our understanding of how plant traits affect speciation and extinction, why we need to make good use of polar regions to study the mechanisms of dispersion and invasion, how to maximize the conservation of plant genetics, species, and diverse landscapes and ecosystems and a holistic perspective on plant speciation and extinction is needed to integrate spatiotemporally. © 2020 The Author(s).","Anthropocene; Biodiversity; Conservation; Plant extinction; Plant speciation","biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; plant; species differentiation; species extinction; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Genetic Speciation; Greenhouse Effect; Plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091129176

We outline its main features, together with Senator Bernie Sanders’ more detailed, fully costed version, exploring its implications for policymaking and social science-based energy research. We focus on two of its most striking characteristics: its macroeconomics; and its inextricable linkage of climate change mitigation and the reduction of economic inequality. We find Sanders’ GND economically credible and argue that the GND's use of Keynesian demand-side macroeconomics challenges governments, policymakers and citizens to think anew about the nature of money. We suggest social scientists need to challenge neoclassical economic assumptions, which, we argue, enable both climate destruction and inequality to continue. We find the GND's combining of climate protection and equality credible, and argue that shifting the debate away from neoclassical understandings of public debt to careful assessments of inflationary impacts and resource needs will generate more productive analysis. We offer these insights as a first look at the GND and challenge others to join in this research. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate change mitigation; Economic inequality; Green New Deal; Keynesian economics; Modern monetary theory",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082839190

Yet, the literature is missing a normative cartography—that is, a mapping of the distribution of moral duties in the real world—which is tailored to a context of polycentric governance. This paper answers the question: how can moral duties be distributed in a context of polycentric climate governance such as to diminish the problem of non-compliance? This implies the following question: do duties change in situations of non-compliance in a context of polycentric governance, and if so how? Acknowledging polycentric governance is the key to an effective distribution of moral duties, as it allows for a more accurate mapping of non-state and subnational actors’ duties in leading the charge against climate change. Correspondingly, a normative cartography fitted to this context will be instrumental in showing how morally informed climate governance can diminish the problem of non-compliance. This paper focusses on the distribution of moral duties in a context of polycentric governance as a contributing factor to inducing agents to act according to the collective goal. It argues that a more fine-grained distribution of climate duties, tailored to polycentric climate governance, contributes to addressing the problem of non-compliance. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate ethics; Collective action; Moral duties; Non-compliance; Polycentric climate governance; The Paris agreement","action plan; climate change; compliance; environmental policy; governance approach; leadership; mitigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087737469

The 9Be(38Ca,40Sc+γ)X reaction at 60.9 MeV/nucleon mid-target energy selectively populates states in 40Sc for which the transferred proton and neutron couple to high orbital angular momentum. In turn, due to angular-momentum selection rules in proton emission and the nuclear structure and energetics of 39Ca, such states in 40Sc then exhibit γ-decay branches although they are well above the proton separation energy. This work uniquely complements results from particle spectroscopy following charge-exchange reactions on 40Ca as well as 40Ti EC/β+ decay which both display very different selectivities. The population and γ-ray decay of the previously known first (5−) state at 892 keV and the observation of a new level at 2744 keV are discussed in comparison to the mirror nucleus and shell-model calculations.

It is of vital importance to develop optimal energy development strategy for electric power-dependent regions by considering the complex interaction among carbon price, carbon emission control, and carbon-responsibility transfer. In order to fill the research gap on the optimal choice of carbon-price mechanism at the urban level, this study is the first attempt to express uncertainties embodied in the carbon price mechanism as interval values, probability distribution and downside risks. The developed risk-aversion-based interval two-stage stochastic programming (RITSP) model is effective in analyzing the effect of internal and electric-transmission related carbon-tax on power system structure. It is discovered that carbon compensation policy for imported electricity is more suitable for Tianjin's power system development. Tianjin would primarily purchase electricity from Inner-Mongolia. With the increase of carbon emission tax, Tianjin would import increasing proportion of electricity from Gansu. Due to the limited endowment of renewable energy in Tianjin, the impact of carbon emission limitations on the renewable energy power generation structure of is trivial, and it has a greater impact on stimulating the development of CCS technology. What's more, Tianjin's future power system planning is more inclined to develop CCS rather than renewable energy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon-emission transfer; Carbon-price mechanism; Downside risk; Energy system management; Interval two-stage stochastic programming","carbon; carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon emission; climate change; compensation system; development strategy; mitigation; power generation; price dynamics; probability; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; climate change; cost benefit analysis; electric power plant; electricity; energy conversion; environmental planning; renewable energy; risk management; sustainable development; China; electricity; uncertainty; China; Gansu; Mongolia; Tianjin; Carbon; China; Electricity; Renewable Energy; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085132446

Namely, we examine the effects of pollution prevention and waste management (PPWM) practices, green supply chain (GSC) practices, and outsourcing on reducing local and supply chain GHG emissions. Design/methodology/approach: Using ASSET4 and deploying first-differencing fixed-effects panel data models, the study conducts a large-scale empirical examination on the effects of these focal strategic environmental options on GHG emissions. Findings: This study finds that PPWM practices reduce local GHG emissions and that GSC practices reduce supply chain GHG emissions. The results also show that outsourcing does not reduce local GHG emissions and has an adverse effect on supply chain GHG emissions. Practical implications: The study findings indicate that environmental practices are effective in reducing GHG emissions. However, they are effective only in their corresponding domain. Further, outsourcing is not a viable strategic option, and managers should be mindful of its undesired environmental consequences. Originality/value: Firms undertake strategic environmental options, such as implementing environmental practices and reallocating production activities, to improve their environmental performance. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these options on reducing GHG emissions has not been thoroughly examined. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental practices; GHG emissions; Outsourcing; Panel model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090136940

Herein, anion regulation of a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like tungsten-based heterostructure supported on nickel foam is demonstrated to play a crucial role in boosting the catalytic performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At high temperature (700 °C), the volatile CNx species decomposed from urea are captured by WO3 on the nickel foam, and then, the insufficient nitridation and carbonization occurred simultaneously, forming an N-doped W2C/WC heterostructure (N-W2C/WC-700). The resulting N-W2C/WC array exhibits a small overpotential of 63 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 73 mV dec-1 in alkaline media, accompanied by a negligible loss after 60 h.

China is at a critical stage of environmental pollution control. Assessing the health impact of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter equal or lower than 2.5 micrometers) on the death toll from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in heavily polluted counties and cities is of great importance to the formulation of air defense policies related to PM2.5. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to analyze the effects of PM2.5 exposure on the death toll of circulatory system diseases in 16 districts, counties and cities in Shijiazhuang from 2014 to 2016 after controlling the long-term trend of the time series, seasonal effects, holiday effects, air temperature, relative humidity and other factors. The average PM2.5 concentration was 121.2 ± 96.6 μg/m3; during the corresponding period, the daily mean mortality of circulatory system diseases in Shijiazhuang was 4.6 ± 4.7. With the increase of PM2.5 by 10 μg/m3, the risk of total death from circulatory system diseases with a lag of two days (lag02) increased by 3.3%‰ (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0025, 1.0041). The relative risk (RR) of the effect of PM2.5 exposure on the death toll of the circulatory system in Shijiazhuang is consistent with the spatial distribution of the PM2.5 concentration and the mortality of circulatory system diseases: the RR of the eastern plain with heavy pollution and a relatively dense population is high, while the RR of the western mountainous area with relatively light pollution and a relatively sparse population is low. For every 10-μg/m3 increase of PM2.5, the risk of the increasing death toll from circulatory system diseases in Luancheng of the eastern plain is the highest at 11.9%‰ (95% CI: 1.0071, 1.0168), while the RR of Pingshan of the western mountainous area is the lowest at 2.1%‰ (95% CI: 0.9981, 1.0062). Conclusions: Based on the epidemiological analysis and GAMs model, after controlling for other confounding factors, PM2.5 exposure increased the death risk of the circulatory system in Shijiazhuang, and the risk is higher in heavily polluted plain areas. It provides a scientific basis for formulating scientific air pollution prevention and control policies and provides a reference for improving the prevention awareness of sensitive groups. © 2020 by the authors.","Circulatory system mortality; Health risk assessment; PM2.5 exposure; Shijiazhuang","Air pollution; Cardiovascular system; Humidity control; Risk assessment; Air pollution prevention; Cerebrovascular disease; Circulatory systems; Confidence interval; Environmental pollution control; Generalized additive model; PM2.5 concentration; Shijiazhuang , China; Air pollution control; cardiovascular system; epidemiology; health risk; mortality; particulate matter; pollution effect; risk assessment; spatial distribution; China; Hebei; Shijiazhuang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092428078

However, total ecosystem C storage that includes soil organic C (SOC) must be considered to determine whether planting trees for climate change mitigation results in increased C storage. We show that planting two native tree species (Betula pubescens and Pinus sylvestris), of widespread Eurasian distribution, onto heather (Calluna vulgaris) moorland with podzolic and peaty podzolic soils in Scotland, did not lead to an increase in net ecosystem C stock 12 or 39 years after planting. Plots with trees had greater soil respiration and lower SOC in organic soil horizons than heather control plots. The decline in SOC cancelled out the increment in C stocks in tree biomass on decadal timescales. At all four experimental sites sampled, there was no net gain in ecosystem C stocks 12–39 years after afforestation—indeed we found a net ecosystem C loss in one of four sites with deciduous B. pubescens stands; no net gain in ecosystem C at three sites planted with B. pubescens; and no net gain at additional stands of P. sylvestris. We hypothesize that altered mycorrhizal communities and autotrophic C inputs have led to positive ‘priming’ of soil organic matter, resulting in SOC loss, constraining the benefits of tree planting for ecosystem C sequestration. The results are of direct relevance to current policies, which promote tree planting on the assumption that this will increase net ecosystem C storage and contribute to climate change mitigation. Ecosystem-level biogeochemistry and C fluxes must be better quantified and understood before we can be assured that large-scale tree planting in regions with considerable pre-existing SOC stocks will have the intended policy and climate change mitigation outcomes. © 2020 The Authors.

Ecosystem legacy of secondary forests was categorized as continuous forest, non-continuous forest, reassembled after conversion to other land uses, and novel reassembled forests of non-native species. Landscape diversity, including landforms that create varied local climatic and soil conditions, can buffer changing climate to some extent by allowing species from warmer climates to exist on warm microsites, while also providing refugial locations for species that grow in cool climates. We present five frames that allow forest managers to visualize a trajectory of change in the context of projected regional climate change, which are: Frame 1 (persistence), keep the same dominant tree species with little change; Frame 2 (moderate change), keep the same tree species with large changes in relative abundance; Frame 3 (forest biome change), major turnover in dominant tree species to a different forest biome; Frame 4 (forest loss), change from a forest to a non-forest biome; and Frame 5 (planted novel ecosystem), establish a novel ecosystem to maintain forest. These frames interact with ecosystem legacies and landscape diversity to determine levels of ecosystem resilience in a changing climate. Although forest readiness to adapt to Frame 1 and 2 scenarios, which would occur with reduced greenhouse gas emissions, is high, a business as usual climate change scenario would likely overwhelm the capacity of ecosystem legacies to buffer forest response, so that many forests would change to warmer forest biomes or non-forested biomes. Furthermore, the interactions among frames, legacies, and landscape diversity influence the transient dynamics of forest change; only Frame 1 leads to stable endpoints, while the other frames would have transient dynamics of change for the remainder of the 21st century. © 2020 by the authors.","Boreal forest; Climate adaptation; Ecosystem legacy; Landscape diversity; Temperate forest; Transient dynamics","Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Business-as-usual; Climate change scenarios; Ecosystem resilience; Landscape diversity; Non-native species; Regional climate changes; Relative abundance; Transient dynamics; Climate change; adaptation; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem service; forest dynamics; forest management; landscape change; temperate forest; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Forests; Frames; Greenhouse Gases; Land Use; Trees",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091201202

We explain how a variety of hidden subsidies created financial dependency in communities hosting nuclear power plants and led to local officials hoping to restart nuclear power plants after the meltdowns despite wide-scale opposition. Later, the introduction of a feed-in tariff (FiT) brought a wider range of towns into the field of renewable energy, but vulnerable towns with weaker social networks continue to bear a large share of Japan's energy infrastructure. Courts, prefectures, and local firms have become intervening agents in the renewable energy market, but utilities have pushed back, encouraging the state to overturn the FiT and create auctions for renewable power contracts instead. With subnational governments and courts more powerful in energy policy since the meltdowns, and a variety of new actors involved in renewable energy, post-Fukushima energy policy has become more democratized.

Positron-emission tomography (PET) using either 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) or amyloid-tracers is a well-established, non-invasive tool in the clinical diagnostics of AD assessing two major pathological hallmarks. 18F-FDG-PET is able to detect early changes in cerebral glucose metabolism and amyloid-PET shows cerebral amyloid load. However, the suitability of 18F-FDG- and amyloid-PET in the widely used 5XFAD mouse model of AD is unclear as only a few studies on the use of PET biomarkers are available showing some conflicting results. The aim of this study was the evaluation of 18F-FDG-PET and amyloid-PET in 5XFAD mice in comparison to neurological deficits and neuropathological changes. Seven- and 12-month-old male 5XFAD mice showed a significant reduction in brain glucose metabolism in 18F-FDG-PET and amyloid-PET with 18F-Florbetaben demonstrated an increased cerebral amyloid deposition (n = 4–6 per group). Deficits in spatial reference memory were detected in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice in the Morris Water Maze (n = 10–12 per group). Furthermore, an increased plaque load and gliosis could be proven immunohistochemically in 5XFAD mice (n = 4–6 per group). PET biomarkers 18F-FDG and 18F-Florbetaben detected cerebral hypometabolism and increased plaque load even before the onset of severe memory deficits. Therefore, the 5XFAD mouse model of AD is well-suited for in vivo monitoring of AD pathologies and longitudinal testing of new therapeutic approaches. © Copyright © 2020 Franke, Irwin, Bayer, Brenner, Beindorff, Bouter and Bouter.","5XFAD Alzheimer model; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-PET; FDG-PET; Florbetaben","amyloid; biological marker; florbetaben; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; glucose; 5xFAD mouse; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain region; brain size; controlled study; evaluation study; gliosis; glucose metabolism; image analysis; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; male; memory disorder; Morris water maze test; mouse; neuroimaging; neuropathology; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; reference memory; standardized uptake value",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091755244

We recorded species, diameter at breast height, and height of trees located between East Broad Street and Carlton Street (north-south direction) and East Campus Road and Lumpkin Street (east-west direction) covering an area of 94.1 hectares. We used i-Tree Eco V6 for estimating carbon stock. There are 6,915 trees in the study area, out of which 73.0 percent (5,049 trees), 32.3 percent (2,236 trees), and 0.7 percent (50 trees) are native, understory, and invasive, respectively. The total carbon stored in trees is 3,450.4 t (SD = 65), and the annual sequestration rate is about 65 t. The University of Georgia should adopt a multifaceted approach for offsetting or reducing the overall carbon emissions, as annual sequestered carbon in measured trees is only 0.11 percent of the total carbon emitted by the university in 2018. This study highlights the role of trees in meeting the carbon reduction challenges faced by colleges and universities across the United States and beyond, and contextualizes the role of green spaces in general, and trees, in particular toward the ongoing movement of sustainable universities and campuses worldwide. Study Implications: Across the United States and beyond, universities and colleges are actively exploring ways to reduce their overall environmental footprint for achieving sustainable development goals. Trees located on the campuses of universities and colleges provide various ecosystem services, including carbon storage and annual sequestration. We advise that universities and colleges should explore other options to reduce or offset their annual carbon emissions, as the quantity of carbon annually sequestered in trees located on the main campuses could be small relative to their overall annual carbon emissions. © The Author(s) 2020.","Colleges and universities; Ecosystem services; Green spaces; Sustainability","Carbon capture; Ecosystems; Storage as a service (STaaS); Sustainable development; Colleges and universities; Diameter-at-breast heights; Ecosystem services; Environmental footprints; Multi-faceted approach; Sustainable universities; Universities and colleges; University of Georgia; Forestry; carbon; ecosystem service; greenspace; sustainability; tree; university sector; Carbon; Chelation; DBH; Ecosystems; Forestry; Georgia; Trees; Universities; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096360682

Windows in commercial buildings are also responsible for 34% of commercial space conditioning energy use and 1.5% of total energy use in the United States. Therefore, controlling the heat gain and loss from windows in commercial buildings would save a significant amount of energy and subsequently reduce the carbon footprint. As the main function of shading is to moderate light rays, whether intercepting or allowing them to enter, having well-designed shading can improve building energy performance. However, shading should be designed carefully since decreasing the cooling load may result in increased heating load and vice versa. In addition, in designing window shading, achieving a balance between energy load reduction and light energy consumption is always challenging. This study proposes a new approach to designing kinetic exterior window shading for small commercial buildings, which changes the geometrical parameters of the exposed glazing area (EGA) of existing windows. To achieve this, first an optimization code was developed based on the hill climbing algorithm. The developed optimization code was then coupled with EnergyPlus software to determine the optimum area of the EGA, its optimum width to height ratio, and its optimum location in an existing window. To illustrate the application of the proposed shading and evaluate building energy performance a model was designed and presented in DesignBuilder software. The study showed the significant amount of energy saved by applying the proposed shading. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Commercial buildings; Optimum geometrical shading design parameters; Simulation-based optimization; Window shading","Application programs; Carbon footprint; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Geometry; Light; Office buildings; Population statistics; Building energy performance; Commercial building; Heat gain and loss; Hill climbing algorithms; Optimization code; Optimization method; Optimum location; Space conditioning; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086497914

While this has brought economic benefits to the region, it has also resulted in considerable environmental and health impacts associated with air pollution. This study presents the first spatial econometric assessment of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for Southeast Asia. Spatial panels, while important in studies involving geographical units, have, to date, been underutilised in many EKC studies. In this study, the income–pollution trajectories of three air pollutants—nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)—are examined through standard and spatial EKC models that regress per capita emissions on several socioeconomic indicators. The econometric assessment utilises data from 1993 to 2012 for nine Southeast Asian countries at varying levels of economic development. An inverted U-shaped curve is found for all pollutants, thus confirming the existence of an EKC. Spatial spillovers are not found for NOx emissions but are supported for SO2 and PM2.5 emissions. While an EKC is supported, most countries are still on the upward sloping portion of the inverted U-shaped curve. This highlights the urgent need to establish and enforce effective policies to abate emissions in light of the current extent of health issues associated with ambient air pollution in the region. In particular, results presented here point to policies that increase the share of renewable energy as a potentially effective emissions abatement strategy as policymakers in the region attempt to steer a path towards sustainable development. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","air pollution; economic growth; EKC; Southeast Asia; spatial panels; sustainable development","atmospheric pollution; econometrics; economic growth; environmental economics; Kuznets curve; panel data; spatial analysis; sustainable development; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087798348

However, achieving such rapid reductions may depend on early retirement of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. Here, we analyze future fossil fuel electricity demand in 171 energy-emissions scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), evaluating the implicit retirements and/or reduced operation of generating infrastructure. Although IAMs calculate retirements endogenously, the structure and methods of each model differ; we use a standard approach to infer retirements in outputs from all six major IAMs and - unlike the IAMs themselves - we begin with the age distribution and region-specific operating capacities of the existing power fleet. We find that coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with international climate targets (i.e. keeping global warming well-below 2 C or 1.5 C) retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case. If plants are built to meet projected fossil electricity demand and instead allowed to operate at the level and over the lifetimes they have historically, the roughly 200 Gt CO2 of additional emissions this century would be incompatible with keeping global warming well-below 2 C. Thus, ambitious climate mitigation scenarios entail drastic, and perhaps un-appreciated, changes in the operating and/or retirement schedules of power infrastructure. © 2020 The Author(s).

Policy makers determine public infrastructural decisions, such as climate and renewable targets, and transmission infrastructure, and the optimal generation capacity expansion follows. Policy makers therefore require planning models that can determine the optimal generation capacity mix in the long run under various scenarios, including policy choices. This work presents a planning model based on linearised alternating current optimal power flow which determines optimal generation capacity expansion and operation, in a least-cost manner, given global and local technical constraints, as well as policy decisions. We apply the model to a test case of the island of Ireland, which has two weakly interconnected systems, high renewable generation targets and low storage and interconnection. We determine the optimal generation expansion and operation out to 2030 considering the effects of increased multi-area interconnection, existing fossil fuel generation phase-out and increased renewable generation targets and carbon prices. Our results find that costs and emissions are driven primarily by the decommissioning of old inefficient generation units. High renewable targets, on the other hand, render increased carbon prices relatively ineffective in reducing system emissions. Furthermore, high renewable generation targets crowd out low-carbon power generation options such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). The strategic north-south interconnection has little effect on renewable energy source installations required to achieve renewable power generation targets but does impact on security of supply and the congestion level across the island. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decision support tool; Electricity generation expansion mix; Generation expansion planning; GHG emissions; Renewable integration; Strategic network interconnection","alternative energy; carbon storage; electricity generation; energy planning; network analysis; numerical model; resource development; stochasticity; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084668231

This paper examines India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and its effects on climate risk reduction. Although the MGNREGA was not designed specifically as a climate programme, it incorporates three key elements with the potential to advance pro-poor climate assistance objectives: (a) social protection through the provision of minimum wage labour; (b) the development of small-scale, natural resource-focused infrastructure; and (c) a decentralized, ‘community-based’ planning architecture. Analysis of a primary dataset comprising 1400 households and 798 projects in India's state Himachal Pradesh, interpreted through intensive qualitative fieldwork, shows that both projects and labour have helped vulnerable households confront climate and other risks, while the Act's decentralized architecture has expanded the channels for citizens to claim support for local challenges. The paper argues for the importance of building a broader ‘ecosystem’ of support to target diverse local needs, and of the need to strengthen the political architectures through which vulnerable groups access these benefits on the ground–especially in the context of decentralized approaches for climate assistance. © 2019 The Author(s).

Data are from the Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) that forms the basis of checking nationwide compliance with ambient air quality directives. We determine the mean O3 trend across all AURN sites to be 0.41 ± 0.07 μg m−3yr−1, composed of larger trends in suburban and urban environments (0.36 ± 0.11 μg m−3yr−1–0.75 ± 0.16 μg m−3yr−1) than in the rural environment (0.16 ± 0.07 μg m−3yr−1); consequently the gap between urban and rural surface O3 across the UK has steadily declined from 20 μg m−3 to 12 μg m−3 until 2012 when it has since stalled. These trends in urban surface O3 are coincident with and likely caused by a pronounced decline in surface concentrations of NO2 (proxy for NOx), which we link to reduced emissions from the transport sector. Using a gamma probability distribution to describe changes in surface O3, we find an increase in the probability of high mean O3 and an associated decrease in the probability of extreme (elevated) O3 events. We find no discernible trend in the number of days per year that exceed the 8-h mean O3 value of 100 μg m−3 set by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) or a similar metric of 120 μg m−3 set by the EU. These exceedances, typically occurring during summer months across the network, range from 499 exceedances in 2010 to in excess of 2300 exceedances in 2003 and 2006. We find that 50% of these exceedances occur at temperatures greater than 18∘C (21∘C) in rural (urban) environments. With 50% (95%) of the 66 million UK inhabitants living and working within 12 km (50 km) of an AURN site, our analysis is relevant to a large fraction of the UK population.

Such plants are considered sensitive to small changes in climate. We coupled field observations (1974, 1993, 2019) about the abundance and vigor of small populations of ten remnant boreal plant species persisting in the uppermost elevations of spruce-fir forests of the Chiricahua Mountains, together with modeling of the species sensitivities to three stress factors associated with climatic change: warming, drought, and forest fire, in order to explore the persistence of frontier boreal plant species during climate change. We hypothesize that populations of these cryophilic plants have declined or become locally extinct during an adverse warming period since 1993, enforced by two large forest fires (1994, 2011). We used plant traits and principal component analysis to evaluate sensitivities of the studied plants to the combined actions of warming, drought, and forest fires. Our model predicted selective sensitivity to warming for two species: Vaccinium myrtillus and Rubus parviflorus. Other cryophilic species could be more sensitive to drought and fire. We surveyed the study area in 2019 and found eight of the ten previously investigated species still occur in the area. Five species occurred in wet canyons at lower elevations, but three species persisted in low vigor at the uppermost elevation, which was highly affected by fires. Neither warming-sensitive species showed signs of decline: populations of R. parviflorus increased in abundance and vigor, while V. myrtillus persists without significant changes since 1993. Despite the recorded increase in temperature in the study area >1 °C between years 1975–1993 and 1994–2019, our study did not find direct evidence of warming effects on the observed species. We conclude that severe wildfires and the multi-decadal decrease in precipitation rather than warming are the main limiting factors of remarkable but limited persistence of the remnant boreal species in the Chiricahua Mountains. Our study demonstrates how field observations can be combined with modeling to evaluate species selective responses to different environmental stress factors to make better environmental management decisions, particularly in light of climate change. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate warming; Drought; Forest fire; Plant traits; Remnant boreal plants; Warming tolerance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086108357

Several mathematical models have been developed in different regions to quantify chill requirements of tree species and cultivars. The Dynamic model has emerged as the most plausible and reliable model, yet all chill models have been found inadequate in at least some growing regions. Accurate models are crucial for the development of quantitatively appropriate climate change adaptation strategies for temperate orchards. To demonstrate the importance of model choice we compared the outputs from 13 agricultural and forest chill models using past and projected future weather data for nine sites in Chile, Tunisia and Germany. To evaluate chill risk, we used a weather generator calibrated with 45 years of temperature data to generate 100 years of synthetic temperature records per scenario for multiple climate scenarios. Chill was computed for 10 past scenarios and projected for 60 future scenarios (for 2050 and 2085 according to greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, using projections from 15 climate models). Results show that estimations differ substantially across chill models, even for the same sites and scenarios. The “Chilling Hours” model and the “Chilling Rate” function showed high sensitivity across regions in future scenarios. The “North Carolina”, “Utah”, “Modified Utah” and “Low Chill” models all suggest negative chill levels for past and future scenarios in Tunisia (despite the thriving fruit tree industry there). Only two models projected chill decreases in all sites. In Mediterranean climate areas (central Chile and Tunisia) the “Dynamic” and “Positive Utah” models forecasted similar chill reductions for future scenarios, whereas in temperate locations (Germany) the “Dynamic” model forecasted lower chill increase compared with the “Utah” and “Positive Utah” models. Despite the “Dynamic” and the “Positive Utah” models showing similar performance among climates, the “Dynamic” model appears to be the best current option, due its more physiologically credible structure. However, further research is needed to develop or identify models that are valid across wide climatic gradients. Our results show that a major source of variation and inaccuracy in chilling assessments is the choice of the chill model used to make the assessment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chill accumulation models; Endo-dormancy; Fruit and nut trees; Insufficient winter chill; Phenology","adaptive management; climate change; cultivar; deciduous forest; deciduous tree; ecological modeling; fruit; Mediterranean environment; orchard; temperate environment; tree; Chile; Germany; Italy; Tuscany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085769936

Vulnerability assessments for the Intermountain West regard wildlife and vegetation and their disturbance as two key resource areas in terms of ecosystems when considering climate change issues. Despite the adaptability potential of certain wildlife, increased temperature estimates of 1.67-2 °C by 2050 increase the likelihood and severity of droughts, floods, heatwaves and wildfires in Utah. As a consequence, resilient flora and fauna could be displaced. The aim of this study was to locate areas of habitat for an exemplary species, i.e., sage-grouse, based on current climate conditions and pinpoint areas of future habitat based on climate projections. The locations of wildlife were collected from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) observations in addition to normal temperature and precipitation, vegetation cover and other ecosystem-related data. Four machine learning algorithms were then used to locate the current sites of wildlife habitats and predict suitable future sites where wildlife would likely relocate to, dependent on the effects of climate change and based on a timeframe of scientifically backed temperature-increase estimates. Our findings show that Random Forest outperforms other competing models, with an accuracy of 0.897, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.917 and 0.885, respectively, and has great potential in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), which can provide useful insights into habitat predictions. Based on this model, our predictions show that sage-grouse habitats in Utah will continue to decrease over the coming years due to climate change, producing a highly fragmented habitat and causing a loss of close to 70% of their current habitat. Priority Areas of Conservation (PACs) and protected areas might be deemed insufficient to halt this habitat loss, and more effort should be put into maintaining connectivity between patches to ensure the movement and genetic diversity within the sage-grouse population. The underlying data-driven methodical approach of this study could be useful for environmentalists, researchers, decision-makers, and policymakers, among others. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Machine learning; Sage-grouse; Species distribution modeling","adaptive management; climate change; conservation planning; environmental disturbance; habitat loss; habitat management; machine learning; protected area; waterfowl; wildlife management; Intermountain West; United States; Utah; Centrocercus urophasianus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091200280

Because of drought conditions and fragile ecology, these regions cannot develop agriculture at the expense of the environment. Given the challenges of global warming, the green total factor productivity (GTFP), taking CO2 emissions as an undesirable output, is an effective index for measuring the sustainability of agricultural development. Agricultural GTFP can be influenced by both internal production factors (labor force, machinery, land, agricultural plastic film, diesel, pesticide, and fertilizer) and external climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration). In this study, we used the Super-slacks-based measure (Super-SBM) model to measure agricultural GTFP during the period 2000–2016 at the regional level. Our results show that the average agricultural GTFP of most provinces and autonomous regions in arid and semi-arid regions underwent a fluctuating increase during the study period (2000–2016), and the fluctuation was caused by the production factors (input and output factors). To improve agricultural GTFP, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu should reduce agricultural labor force input; Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Shanxi should decrease machinery input; Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Shanxi should reduce fertilizer input; Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia should reduce diesel input; Xinjiang and Gansu should decrease plastic film input; and Gansu, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia should cut pesticide input. Desirable output agricultural earnings should be increased in Qinghai and Tibet, and undesirable output (CO2 emissions) should be reduced in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Shaanxi. Agricultural GTFP is influenced not only by internal production factors but also by external climate factors. To determine the influence of climate factors on GTFP in these provinces and autonomous regions, we used a Geographical Detector (Geodetector) model to analyze the influence of climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration) and identify the relationships between different climate factors and GTFP. We found that temperature played a significant role in the spatial heterogeneity of GTFP among provinces and autonomous regions in arid and semi-arid regions. For Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, a suitable average annual temperature would be in the range of 7°C–9°C; for Gansu, Shanxi, and Ningxia, it would be 11°C–13°C; and for Shaanxi, it would be 15°C–17°C. Stable climatic conditions and more efficient production are prerequisites for the development of sustainable agriculture. Hence, in the agricultural production process, reducing the redundancy of input factors is the best way to reduce CO2 emissions and to maintain temperatures, thereby improving the agricultural GTFP. The significance of this study is that it explores the impact of both internal production factors and external climatic factors on the development of sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions, identifying an effective way forward for the arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China. © 2020, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","agricultural GTFP; arid regions; climate change; CO2 emissions; Geodetector; semi-arid regions; Super-slacks-based measure (Super-SBM) model","agricultural development; agricultural production; arid region; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; sustainability; total factor productivity; China; Gansu; Nei Monggol; Ningxia Huizu; Qinghai; Shaanxi; Shanxi; Xinjiang Uygur; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092553664

Four axial cyclones with different structural parameters were studied by numerical simulation and verification experiments. A numerical model of a two-phase flow in the cyclone separator was established and the separation efficiency and pressure loss of cyclone separators were simulated by employing the Reynolds stress model (RSM) for turbulence modeling. A test rig was constructed and the diameter distributions of droplets at the inlet and outlet of the separator were measured by a Malvern laser particle size analyzer to verify the simulation model. The results indicated that a multi-stage swirler can improve the tangential velocity to strengthen the gas swirling in the cyclone body effectively, thereby improving the separation efficiency of the cyclone. The effects of the multi-stage swirler on the flow field were analyzed, for a better understanding of the mechanisms of the flow field in the separation region for improved performance. The tangential velocities of cyclones Sep-C and Sep-B were found to be 1.5 to 2 times higher than that of the single-stage cyclone Sep-O, although the separation efficiency of Sep-C was reduced significantly when the velocity was greater than 7.9 m/s. Based on the results of this study, cyclone Sep-B was considered to be the best performing axial-flow cyclone within the acceptable pressure drop range and was proposed as a demister in power plant. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Axial cyclone separator; numerical simulation; separation performance; swirler; water droplets separation","Axial flow; Computer simulation; Drops; Efficiency; Flow fields; Mist eliminators; Numerical models; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Power plants; Reynolds number; Turbulent flow; Two phase flow; Diameter distributions; Laser particle size analyzer; Power-plant emissions; Reynolds stress models; Separation efficiency; Separation performance; Swirlers; Water droplets; Cyclone separators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068222473

This paper explores the physical-chemical properties of biochar and finds out its reason-manifestation-influencing factors for ""carbon sequestration reduction"". A series of life cycle assessment calculation methods were introduced to biochar from China's four main biomasses (i.e., crop straw, firewood and forest trees, livestock manure, and urban organic waste). According to the evaluation of ""carbon sequestration function""and ""emission reduction benefit"", the greenhouse gas emission reduction (i.e., CO2e, where CO2e is CO2 equivalent) is 4.51 × 108, 2.66 × 108, 4.18 × 108, and 3.01 × 108 t of CO2e for raw materials, respectively. The total potential of biochar to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is 14.36 × 108 t of CO2e, which is equivalent to 15.23% of China's total greenhouse gas emissions. Through economic analysis of farmers and pyrolysis plants, it can be concluded that, when the carbon trading price is 300 CNY t-1 of CO2e, it will result in an economic gap of 21.3 × 1010 CNY a-1, which requires a certain subsidy from the government. For crop stalks, firewood, woods, and livestock manure biomass resources are 7200, 7000, and 2500 CNY hm-2 a-1, respectively. If the carbon trading price can be increased to 600 CNY t-1 of CO2e, both the farmers and the pyrolysis plant will have huge economic benefits. Finally, the existing bottlenecks of the technology are analyzed; the corresponding prospects are put forward; and the existing biomass utilization balance issues are discussed.

Results show that during 2004–2016: (1) transportation demand and urbanization were dominant in TCEs growth, while energy intensity and industrial structure were the key factors of CO2 emissions reduction. (2) The effects exerted by age structure and CO2 emission factor change were relatively mild. The former one has a stable promoting effect, while the latter one inhibits TCEs growth. Additionally, the influence of spatial pattern on the growth of CO2 emissions from transportation was limited. (3) Energy structure and energy intensity played more important roles in reducing emissions of the transport sector in the eastern region. The effects of population size on the eastern region were much greater than those of the central and western regions, presenting the phenomenon of “eastern agglomeration”.

This fraction contains hydrogen, carbon-monoxide, carbon-dioxide and hydrocarbons. The pyrolysis oils have oxygen-containing compounds, such as alcohols, aldehyde, ketones, carboxylic acids or phenol and its derivative. Not only the reactor configurations but also the catalysts had an effect to the product properties, because the catalysts with alkali characters showed advanced behaviour in the reduction of oxygenated hydrocarbons, while high synthetic zeolite catalysts can increase the saturation and isomerization reactions. The long-term behaviour of the pyrolysis oils was followed by an accelerated aging test at 80 °C till 7 days. The catalysts can effectively reduce the rate of density and viscosity increase during the aging and the alkali catalysts showed beneficial properties in reducing the acidic components.

In an 116-day greenhouse experiment simulating a nearby savannah, response to four amendment treatments (no treatment, incorporated biochar, incorporated woodchips, and surface woodchips) was tested across two field soils (Chiricahua and Hathaway) and four simulated precipitation treatments (100, 80, 60, and 40% of average) in a replicated design. Soil type, amendment treatments, and simulated precipitation all had significant (p ' 0.01) effects on aboveground biomass. The surface woodchip treatment averaged the highest biomass production of the amendment treatments (489 kg/ha) and the incorporated woodchips had the lowest (298 kg/ha). Aboveground biomass decreased with decreasing precipitation (533, 468, 350, and 216 kg/ha, respectively). Biochar amended soils averaged 5–10% higher volumetric water content than the woodchip amendments and controls through a 28-day dry down. Microbial nitrogen and phosphorus acquiring activities were higher in Hathaway soils while carbon activities were higher in Chiricahua soils. The surface woodchip treatment resulted in a different species composition than the other amendment and control treatments (p ' 0.01). None of the amendment treatments ameliorated low precipitation conditions for plants. Contrary to expectations, carbon and phosphorus exoenzyme activities were highest in the lower precipitation treatments (60 and 40%) and nitrogen exoenzyme activities remained high in Hathaway soils regardless of precipitation. Surface application of woodchips increased vegetation as well as carbon and phosphorus exoenzyme activities while incorporating woodchips suppressed vegetation. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration","aboveground biomass; Arizona; drought; exoenzyme and extracellular enzyme activities; Sonoran desert; volumetric water content","aboveground biomass; biochar; drought; enzyme activity; microbial activity; semiarid region; soil amendment; soil moisture; water content; Arizona; Sonoran Desert; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084005882

Four meteorological factors and two socioeconomic factors, i.e., the decline of intra-city mobility intensity (dIMI) representing the effect of traffic mobility and the decline rates of the secondary industrial output values (drSIOV), were adopted in the regression analysis. Then, multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), a model allowing the particular processing scale for each independent variable, was applied for investigating the relationship between PM pollution reductions and influencing factors. For comparison, ordinary least square (OLS) regression and the classic geographically weighted regression (GWR) were also performed. The research found that there were 16% and 20% reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration across China and significant PM pollution mitigation in central, east, and south regions of China. As for the regression analysis results, MGWR outperformed the other two models, with R2 of 0.711 and 0.732 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The results of MGWR revealed that the two socioeconomic factors had more significant impacts than meteorological factors. It showed that the reduction of traffic mobility caused more relative declines of PM2.5 in east China (e.g., cities in Jiangsu), while it caused more relative declines of PM10 in central China (e.g., cities in Henan). The reduction of industrial operation had a strong relationship with the PM10 drop in northeast China. The results are crucial for understanding how the decline pattern of PM pollution varied spatially during the COVID-19 outbreak, and it also provides a good reference for air pollution control in the future. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Both maps, however, emphasized dryland regions, with arid biomes making up 36%–42% of potential restoration area. Dryland biomes have repeatedly been recognized as inappropriate regions for expanding tree cover due to the risks of biodiversity loss, water overconsumption, and fire, so maps that highlight these regions for restoration must sustain careful scrutiny. Here, I show that both recent attempts to map restoration potential in arid regions have been hindered by underlying errors in the global tree cover maps they used. Systematic underestimates of existing sparse tree cover led directly to large overestimates of the potential for tree recovery in drylands. The Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities (Laestadius et al., Unasylva, 2011, 62, 47) overestimated tree restoration potential across a third of arid biomes by between 7% and 20% (55–166 million hectares [Mha]). Similarly, Bastin, Finegold, Garcia, Mollicone, et al. (Science, 2019, 365, 76) overestimated tree restoration potential across all arid biomes by 33%–45% (316–440 Mha). These inaccuracies limit the utility of this research for policy decisions in drylands and overstate the potential for tree planting to address climate change. Given this long-standing but underappreciated challenge in mapping global tree cover, I propose various ways forward that keep this lesson in mind. To better monitor and restore tree cover, I call for re-interpretation and correction of existing global maps, and for a new focus on quantifying sparse tree cover in drylands and other systems. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","afforestation; desertification; dry forests; ecosystem restoration; forest landscape restoration; global forest change; grasslands; REDD+; remote sensing; savannas","arid region; biome; policy analysis; restoration ecology; vegetation cover; vegetation mapping; climate change; ecosystem; forest; statistical bias; tree; Bias; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087303067

This requires a fast turnover of varieties in a system capable of injecting significant amounts of genetic diversity into productive landscapes. Crop improvement is a pivotal strategy to cope with and adapt to climate change. Modern breeding may rely on the genomics revolution to speed up the development of new varieties with adaptive potential. However, centralized breeding may not adequately address smallholder farmers’ needs for more locally acclimatized varieties or groups of varieties. This, in turn, constrains adoption of new varieties that reduces the effectiveness of a resource-intensive breeding process, an issue that may be overcome with participatory, decentralized approaches. Whether high-tech centralized breeding or decentralized participatory approaches are better suited for smallholder farmers in the global South is hotly debated. Sidestepping any false dichotomies and ideological issues in these debates, this review provides a perspective on relevant advances in a breeding approach that combines the two approaches and uses genomics for trait mining from ex situ collections of genetic materials, participatory multilocation trials and crowdsourced citizen science. It argues that this new combination of high-tech centralized and participatory decentralized methods can provide a coherent and effective approach to breeding for climate adaptation and the present review advocates on a different way forward for the future research. © Copyright © 2020 Fadda, Mengistu, Kidane, Dell’Acqua, Pè and Van Etten.","a high-tech crop improvement; Ethiopia; genetic diversity; participatory crop improvement; Seeds for Needs; smallholder farmers",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091774071

Adding woodchip amendments to soils is a common strategy for mitigating soil degradation as amendments may enhance soil carbon and increase plant cover. We assessed the effect of surface or incorporated woodchip addition and incorporated wood-derived biochar on soil carbon dynamics and microbial activities as well as plant cover in semiarid soils that had been removed and replaced. We found that woodchips at the soil surface increased soil organic carbon (SOC), and both surface and incorporated woodchips increased the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. The incorporation of woodchips inhibited plant cover yet increased soil CO2 efflux and dissolved organic matter stoichiometry. Surface woodchips also significantly enhanced microbial activities but not plant cover. A significant amount of the soil efflux in response to incorporating woodchips was explained by plant cover and exoenzyme activities, but this was not the case for other amendment treatments. Biochar, thought to be more resistant to decomposition, neither stimulated nor reduced microbial activities or plant cover and did not influence SOC or DOC. Our findings demonstrate that the influence of woodchip amendments on microbial processes and soil carbon dynamics depends on the location of application and that coarse fast-pyrolysis biochar has limited influence on soil processes over a 22-month study in a water-limited ecosystem. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration","drylands; exoenzyme and extracellular enzyme activities; revegetation; soil management; soil respiration; Sonoran Desert","biochar; enzyme activity; microbial activity; organic carbon; revegetation; semiarid region; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil degradation; soil management; soil respiration; Sonoran Desert",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084007536

A key sector to achieve this goal is road transport, where emissions show no signs of reducing but continue to grow. A review of policies undertaken by EU member states and the G20 to reduce transport emissions reveals that both present and planned policies focus on binding supply-side measures, but offer only weak demand-side incentives. To address this imbalance, we developed a downstream, demand-side policy prototype through an expert interview design process. We call the prototype ""cap-and-surrender"" because it caps road emissions, and then allocates tradable emission allowances to individual vehicles that drivers surrender at each fill-up. Allowance pricing, both by the state and in the secondary market, is designed to incentivize decarbonization of the sector. Though the system would require significant investment, its revenue potential to the state should exceed this investment by several multiples. We discuss the potential economic, environmental and social impacts of the policy, as assessed by European transport experts. We find that the approach can deliver significant transport emission reductions in an effective and economically efficient manner. Through the appropriate design of national allocation rules and a gradual phasing in of cap and surrender, potential negative social consequences can be mitigated, and public acceptance of the policy promoted. © 2020 by the authors.","Cap and trade; Decarbonization of the transport sector; Economic and environmental impacts; Policy review; Road transport; Societal impact","carbon emission; demand-side management; design method; European Union; investment incentive; market conditions; questionnaire survey; road transport; supply chain management; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091170498

Demand growth is further accelerated by the implementation of climate policies and strategies to replace fossil resources with biomass. There are, however, concerns about the size of the prospective biomass demand and the environmental and social consequences of the corresponding resource mobilization, especially concerning impacts from the associated land-use change. Strategically integrating perennials into landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture can, for example, improve biodiversity, reduce soil erosion and nutrient emissions to water, increase soil carbon, enhance pollination, and avoid or mitigate flooding events. Such “multifunctional perennial production systems” can thus contribute to improving overall land-use sustainability, while maintaining or increasing overall biomass productivity in the landscape. Seven different cases in different world regions are here reviewed to exemplify and evaluate (a) multifunctional production systems that have been established to meet emerging bioenergy demands, and (b) efforts to identify locations where the establishment of perennial crops will be particularly beneficial. An important barrier towards wider implementation of multifunctional systems is the lack of markets, or policies, compensating producers for enhanced ecosystem services and other environmental benefits. This deficiency is particularly important since prices for fossil-based fuels are low relative to bioenergy production costs. Without such compensation, multifunctional perennial production systems will be unlikely to contribute to the development of a sustainable bioeconomy.

However, studies on nuclear reactor safety often run up against the problem of estimating the probability of a major accident from patchy and limited empirical data. Here, we describe a simple probabilistic model of catastrophic nuclear reactor accidents based on a set of four assumptions. The model treats the accident probability in each of n reactors as a variable and returns the probability of a major accident in the reactor fleet.

However, how different elements and types of natural environments associate with mental health is still largely unknown. In this study, we perform a detailed analysis on a large, nation-wide data set of mental health records (908 553 individuals) for Denmark combined with remotely-sensed land cover and vegetation density data. We explore associations between growing up surrounded by different environments and rates of a spectrum of 18 psychiatric disorders. Childhood land cover exposure for urban, agricultural, near-natural green space, and blue space was determined around the residence of each individual. Vegetation density and air pollution were evaluated as potential pathways. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate rates as hazard ratios and then adjusted for potential confounding from other known risk factors. For 12 of 18 disorders, rates were lower for children growing up in environments with more natural elements (near-natural green space, blue space, and agriculture) compared to children growing up in urban environments. High vegetation density was associated with lower rates for most disorders within all the examined environments, whereas mitigation of air pollution by natural environments seemed a less important potential pathway. Rates were not notably changed by adjustment for urbanization, parental and municipal socioeconomic status, family history of mental illness, and parents’ age. In conclusion, we found that growing up surrounded by a range of natural environments such as near-natural green space, blue space, and agriculture may lower rates of psychiatric disorders. Our results show the importance of ensuring access to natural environments from as nature-based solutions for improved public health and sustainable, livable cities. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Green space; Mental health; Psychological ecosystem services; Remote sensing","age structure; atmospheric pollution; environmental effect; land cover; life satisfaction; mental health; psychology; remote sensing; urbanization; agricultural land; air pollution; anorexia nervosa; Article; bipolar disorder; borderline state; Denmark; depression; disease association; distress syndrome; eating disorder; environmental factor; hazard ratio; human; intellectual impairment; mental disease; mood disorder; obsessive compulsive disorder; personality disorder; priority journal; proportional hazards model; psychosomatic disorder; risk factor; schizoaffective psychosis; urban area; vegetation; air pollution; child; city; Denmark; environment; mental disease; Denmark; Air Pollution; Child; Cities; Denmark; Environment; Humans; Mental Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086454720

It has been used recently to explain low fracture conductivity in the field as well as the long-term downward trend of laboratory-measured American Petroleum Institute conductivity data (Liang et al. 2015). However, researchers disagree about the source of such overgrowth minerals and the involvement of proppant in the process. In addition, the diagenesis process has not been investigated in the case of carbonate-rich shale formations. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to experimentally investigate the proppant diagenesis process during hydraulic fracturing of the Eagle Ford Shale Formation and to determine the role of the proppant in the process. Diagenesis was studied after aging a mixture of proppant and formation samples in deionized water for 3 weeks at 325F and 300 psia. Outcrop cores of the Eagle Ford Shale Formation were crushed and sieved to 50/100 US-mesh size. The ceramic, sand, and resin-coated-sand (RCS) proppants of 20/40 US-mesh size were tested. The proppant surface was studied for mineral overgrowth and/ or dissolution before and after aging using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The concentration of the cations leached into the solution was measured by analyzing the supernatant samples using inductively coupled plasma (ICP)/optical-emission spectroscopy, while the sulfate-ion concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer. The proppants and the Eagle Ford Shale Formation samples were analyzed after aging separately at the same conditions to explain the sources of the leached ions and the observed overgrowth and/or precipitated minerals. The Eagle Ford Shale was found to be the source of calcium sulfate and calcium zeolite precipitates because of dissolution/ precipitation reactions with water. Only the ceramic proppant was found to induce an additional mineral overgrowth of iron calcium zeolite on its surface. Conversely, the sand and RCS proppants did not encounter any precipitates/overgrowth minerals. These proppants only changed the elemental composition of the precipitated zeolite from the formation/fluid interaction, showing increased silicon and decreased calcium and aluminum concentrations. The proppant dissolution was observed with all types of proppants, as indicated by the presence of silicon ions in the solution after aging. A thermodynamic modeling study was conducted and confirmed the possibility of formation of the observed precipitate and overgrowth minerals at the equilibrium state of the rock and proppant mixture in water. Finally, the breaking and peeling of the phenol formaldehyde resin from the RCS proppant particles at static conditions was observed for the first time (to the best of the authors’ knowledge) using the SEM technique. The study contributes to the understanding of the scale formation and the mechanisms that damage fracture conductivity in the Eagle Ford Shale. Results impact the choice of fluid and proppant for fracturing optimization and long-term production sustainability in the Eagle Ford Shale reservoirs.

However, despite the many potential benefits biochar application offers, it is important to quantify any ecological impacts that may result from soil amendment in order to avoid potentially causing negative effects upon soil biota which are crucial in the many ecosystem services provided by soil. Any impacts on earthworms in particular are important to evaluate because of their pivotal role in organic matter breakdown, nutrient cycling and soil formation. In this study, we conducted a series of ecotoxicological assays to determine lethal and sublethal (avoidance, mass change and moisture content) effects of heavy biochar applications that reflect levels that may be used in soil restoration efforts. Two earthworm species, Eisenia fetida, an epigeic species, and Lumbricus terrestris, an anecic species, were utilised as test organisms. Two types of biochar, produced from wheat straw and rice husk feedstocks, respectively, were applied to OECD artificial soil and to a natural soil (Kettering loam) at rates of up to 20% w/w. The influence of biochar application on soil porewater chloride, fluoride and phosphate concentrations was also assessed. The biochar applications induced only a subtle level of avoidance behaviour while effects on survival over a 4-week exposure period were inconsistent. However, death and physical damage to some individual earthworms at high biochar application rates were observed, the mechanisms and processes leading to which should be investigated further. Earthworm development (mean mass change over time) proved to be a more sensitive measure, revealing negative effects on L. terrestris at 10% and 20% (w/w) wheat biochar applications in OECD soil and at 20% (w/w) applications of both biochars in Kettering loam. The moisture content of E. fetida remained remarkably consistent across all treatments (~ 82%), indicating that this is not a sensitive measure of effects. The high rates of biochar application resulted in increased chloride (2 to 3-fold) and phosphate (100-fold) concentrations in simulated soil porewaters, which has important implications for soil fertility and production but also for environmental management. © 2019, The Author(s).","Biochar; Earthworms; Ecotoxicology; Eisenia fetida; Lumbricus terrestris; Soil amendment","biochar; carbon sequestration; earthworm; ecological impact; ecosystem service; ecotoxicology; soil amendment; soil biota; soil ecosystem; soil fertility; soil improvement; Kettering; Ohio; United States; Eisenia fetida; Lumbricus terrestris; Triticum aestivum; biochar; charcoal; animal; ecosystem; Oligochaeta; soil; soil pollutant; Animals; Charcoal; Ecosystem; Oligochaeta; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062043950

We apply the before-after-control-intervention approach and quasi-experimental methods to evaluate the effectiveness of REDD+ interventions in reducing deforestation at municipal (meso) and community (micro) scales. Difference-in-differences regression and propensity score matching did not show an overall reduction in forest cover loss from REDD+ projects at both scales. However, Synthetic Control Method (SCM) analyses demonstrated mixed REDD+ effectiveness among intervened municipalities and communities. Funding agencies and number of REDD+ projects intervening in a municipality or community did not appear to affect REDD+ outcomes. However, cattle production and commercial agriculture land uses tended to impede REDD+ effectiveness. Cases of communities with important forestry enterprises exemplified reduced forest cover loss but not when cattle production was present. Communities and municipalities with negative REDD+ outcomes were notable along the southern region bordering Guatemala and Belize, a remote forest frontier fraught with illegal activities and socio-environmental conflicts. We hypothesize that strengthening community governance and organizational capacity results in REDD+ effectiveness.

We present five dimensions or “genes,” that is, the focus and strategic intent or orientation of the platform (what), the participating sides, actors and groups (who), the actions, flows and coordination mechanisms (how), and the value drivers, benefits and externalities (why), and the rules regulating the affiliation and interaction processes (governance). We also present and discuss 30 subtopics or management items that are associated with the five dimensions defined. We then apply the conceptual model to analyze a case in the climate change endeavor and to show how competitive and cooperative dynamics can be virtuously integrated to provide individual- and company-driven responses to a timely socioenvironmental issue.

In order to improve efficiency, have a cleaner environment and achieve economic benefits, the present study aims to propose an optimal system for the indirect water bath heaters in natural gas city gate stations. The optimization procedure is carried out by designing a control system to gain an eligible discharge temperature for the heater based on the gas entry conditions to the city gate station. The controller calculates the temperature of hydrate formation in terms of passing gas pressure and gives this information to the torch of the heater for regulating fuel consumption. A comprehensive study is accomplished based on energy, exergy, environment and economic analysis for different pressure reduction stations. The results indicate that employing the proposed system decreases the amount of fuel consumption and greenhouse gases emissions along with increasing system efficiency. Analyzing the results reveals that using the proposed system leads to a maximum of 28.54% relative increment in the heater efficiency compared to the conventional system (at this condition, the heater efficiency of the conventional and proposed system is η = 36.12% to η = 46.43%, respectively). Furthermore, with choosing a heater with a capacity of 100,000 SCMH, it is possible to reduce the pollutants emissions and total costs down to 142.6 tons per year and 3,671,000 $ per year, respectively.

This complementary and holistic approach of ‘bulk’- and surface-sensitive techniques demonstrates that the electro-reduction of CuxO foams into metallic Cu is completed before hydrocarbon (e.g., ethylene, ethane) and alcohol (e.g., ethanol, n-propanol) formation sets in. There are, however, substantial differences in the potential dependence of the oxide reduction when comparing the ‘bulk’ with the respective ‘surface’ processes.

In the United States, discussions about comprehensive national policies to avert climate change have begun, with “Green New Deal” proposals and climate plans put forth by members of Congress and presidential candidates. Oceans are largely absent or separate from these nascent policy proposals. Here, we highlight a policy framework to develop terrestrial and ocean-integrated policies that can complement and enhance terrestrial-focused initiatives focused on four specific sectors: 1) energy; 2) transportation; 3) food security; and 4) habitat restoration. Given political friction and constrained budgets, an integrated policy framework offers greater potential to achieve a portfolio of mitigation and adaptation goals in a cost-effective manner, beyond what could be realized with marine or terrestrial policy solutions alone. © 2020 The Authors.

Based on previous studies on particulate recovery via fine-sieving technologies, alkali pretreatment was used to improve the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production from the fine-sieving fractions (FSF). Hydrolysis performance and methane production were monitored to evaluate the reasons for the SCFA boost. Besides, the microbial community structure was evaluated by high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, mass balance and financial benefits were preliminarily estimated. The results showed that alkali pretreatment effectively promoted the generation of SCFAs with 234 mg/g volatile suspended solids (VSS), almost double that of the control test. This was partially attributed to the efficient hydrolysis, with soluble polysaccharides and protein increased by 2.1 and 1.2 times compared to that of the control, respectively. Inhibition of methanogens was also devoted to the accumulation of SCFAs, with no methane production until 150 h at high pH value. Finally, a preliminary evaluation revealed that 44.51 kg/d SCFAs could be supplied as the electron donor for denitrification, significantly reducing the cost in ECS addition for most wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with carbon insufficiency. © 2020 by the authors.

Engine performance is strongly dominated by fuel oxidation chemistry, and thus a more accurate determination of the coefficients of the reactions ruling its oxidation is essential for the utilization of n-pentanol in combustion engines. The reactions involving 1‑hydroxy‑1-pentyl and molecular oxygen were found to play an important role in controlling the low temperature oxidation chemistry, but have not been investigated experimentally or theoretically; this is also the case for the reactions of the 1‑hydroxy‑1-peroxypentyl radical, which is formed by the addition of oxygen to the radical center of 1‑hydroxy‑1-pentyl. This work presents a theoretical study with high level ab initio calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/cc-pVTZ level of theory to shed light on the fate of the 1‑hydroxy‑1-peroxypentyl radical. The rate coefficients of all the possible intra-molecular hydrogen shift reactions of that radical were computed using variational transition state theory with small curvature tunneling corrections. For certain reactions, tunneling and variational effects are very pronounced, proving the need for robust methodologies to account for these effects. The hydrogen shift reaction leading to a concerted HO2 elimination and formation of n-pentanal is the dominant pathway and governs the reactivity of 1‑hydroxy‑1-peroxypentyl radical at any temperature. The reverse of this reaction was thereby investigated as well. For this prominent pathway, the effects of multistructural (multiple conformers) torsional anharmonicity of the stationary points were taken into account in order to refine the forward and reverse rate coefficients. The rate coefficients calculated at room temperature are compared to those calculated using a previously developed cost-effective multi-conformer transition state theory approach. The system-specific quantum Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel (SS-QRRK) theory was used to compute the pressure-dependent rate coefficients, which indicate significant pressure dependence at intermediate and high temperatures. Implementation of the calculated reaction rate coefficients in chemical kinetics models of n-pentanol revealed that our computed rate coefficients enable better insights into the chemistry of n-pentanol, and help to understand how n-pentanal is formed. © 2020","Ab initio; HO2 elimination; Multistructural anharmonicity; N-pentanol; Oxidation","Calculations; Cost effectiveness; Electronic states; Engines; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Molecular physics; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Temperature; Compression ignition engine; High-level ab initio calculations; Low-temperature oxidation; Reaction rate coefficients; Small-curvature tunneling; Torsional anharmonicity; Transition state theories; Variational transition state theory; Molecular oxygen; 1 hydroxy 1 pentyl radical; alcohol; butanol; hydrogen; methanol; oxygen; pentane; pentanol; pentobarbital; radical; unclassified drug; ab initio calculation; alcohol oxidation; Article; combustion; electric potential; elimination reaction; flame; isomerization; light; oxidation kinetics; partition coefficient; priority journal; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085763828

The analysis and evaluation of the RDE test results reveal that the cold-start emissions account for a significant proportion of the urban trip emissions, and that the moving average window (MAW) method is not suitable for statistically processing the RDE test data that include the cold-start emission data. Additionally, three on-road emission tests including a cold-start test and two hot-start tests at different vehicle thermal states were designed to evaluate the effect of the initial vehicle thermal state on the vehicle start emissions. The results demonstrate that the thermal state of the TWC converter thermal state has a more direct and important effect on the cold-start emissions in the RDE test. Via a comparative analysis of the instantaneous characteristics of pollutant emission rates, fuel–air equivalent ratios, catalytic converter temperatures, vehicle trip dynamic parameters, etc., it is inferred that driving behavior has a more significant and sensitive impact on the cold-start emissions than on the non-cold-start emissions in the RDE test. Based on the RDE tests performed at different ambient temperatures, it is also indicated that the impact of the ambient temperature on the cold-start emissions is only a secondary factor relative to driving behavior. As a result, the trip dynamic conditions, specifically those for the cold-start period, should be set more reasonably and effectively in future RDE regulations to ensure the consistency of the cold-start emission test results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ambient temperature; Cold-start emissions; Driving behavior; Emission regulations; Real Driving Emissions (RDE); Vehicle thermal state","Temperature; Analysis and evaluation; Comparative analysis; Dynamic parameters; Equivalent ratios; Light duty vehicles; On-road emissions; Pollutant emission rates; Testing and evaluation; Vehicles; data processing; testing method; traffic emission; transport vehicle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087201999

In addition to the cultivar, the rootstock, clone and region of production can influence the phenolic concentrations of wines. In this context, this study evaluated the rootstocks ‘SO4’ (Vitis berlandieri x Vitis riparia), ‘Gravesac’ (‘161-49C’ x ‘3309C’) and ‘3309C’ (Vitis riparia x Vitis rupestris) grafted with Tannat cultivar clones (‘Californian’, ‘944’, ‘717’, ‘398’ and ‘794’) to assess the physicochemical, phenolic and sensorial composition of the wine produced in the Campanha Gaúcha (RS) region, Southern Brazil, in a subtropical climate region. A vineyard planted in 2007 was used in this study (for 3 years during 2015, 2016 and 2017). The wine composition and the sensorial profile were evaluated as dependent variables. This study showed that the rootstocks and the Tannat clones did not influence the dependent variables evaluated and that the genetic materials and their combinations presented high oenological potential, providing wines with high alcohol content, colour and phenolic compound concentrations. This study suggests the diversification of rootstocks and clones as a way of increasing genetic variability, avoiding the cultivation of a single rootstock and clone. © 2020.

This was partially catalysed by the ‘ultimatum strategy’ of the European Union (EU), where the Union persistently threatened to take unilateral steps in the absence of multilateral action. As this article analyses, it appears that the Union is reluctant to relinquish its unilateral approach and align fully with both the ICAO Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme and the IMO Global Data Collection Scheme. This raises questions under public international law as to the relationships between these competing measures. Amidst rising political pressures, this article considers the extent to which the unfolding multilateral policies of the ICAO and IMO may limit the regulatory competence of the EU. While the EU is an independent legal entity, it has been conferred far-reaching competences by its Member States who are themselves members of these other international organisations. Given the lack of clarity on clear hierarchical rules, an important role remains for the customary law of state jurisdiction in governing regulatory competence more generally. The final part of this article engages with recent discussions on the existence of an obligation to exercise jurisdictional self-restraint. It reflects on the tensions arising between respect for states’ regulatory autonomy and the prevention of ‘dangerous’ anthropogenic climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).","Aviation; Climate change; Emissions; EU; Jurisdiction; Maritime transport; Reasonableness; Unilateralism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086406785

To this end, we modelled four mitigation scenarios in addition to the reference scenario. Increased renewables penetration, energy efficiency improvements, and fuel switching are identified as key mitigation strategies in the Nigerian NDC. Our results reveal profound restructuring of the Nigerian energy system with changes in the supply mix which mainly favour the deployment of solar PV. Our analysis shows that the residential sector has the largest potential for reducing energy demand while the power sector should be the focus for CO2 emissions mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the impacts of carbon tax on the energy system. Our analysis discloses a significant improvement in energy security due to mitigation actions.

The present study develops an integrated approach, based on acoustic emission (AE) signals, in order to detect and locate leaks in flanged pipes. It is depicted into two main steps: leak detection (leak regional location) and precise leak location. The proposed method adopts the principal component analysis (PCA) as a semi-supervised learning method, relying on the Hotelling's T2 statistic and the Q statistic (squared prediction error (SPE)) as the residuals, to detect the leak occurrence. Once the leak pipe segment is located, the precise leak location adopts variational mode decomposition (VMD) to decompose the leak AE signals to obtain the domain frequency band for determining the wave speed in combination with the dispersive curve of guided wave. Furthermore, de-noised signals can be obtained by reconstructing the intrinsic mode functions (IMF) of the VMD based on the energy ratio and after the basic cross-correlation is calculated to obtain the time delay of the de-noised signals. For illustrative purposes, an experimental setup, which includes 5 different leak apertures (10, 12, 15, 20 and 27 mm), is used for investigation. The experimental validations show that the PCA-based method can detect and locate a leak in a certain pipe segment. In addition, the precise leak location errors are all in acceptable interval values ranging from 0.8% up to 12.1%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-correlation; Flanged pipe; Guided wave; Leak detection and location; Principal component analysis","Acoustics; Guided electromagnetic wave propagation; Integrated control; Leak detection; Learning systems; Location; Petroleum transportation; Principal component analysis; Semi-supervised learning; Signal denoising; Acoustic emission signal; Experimental validations; Integrated approach; Intrinsic Mode functions; Oil and gas transportation; Principle component analysis; Semi-supervised learning methods; Squared prediction errors; Acoustic emission testing; article; cross correlation; decomposition; intrinsic mode function; learning; prediction; principal component analysis; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084527204

In this framework, PEVs represent loads to satisfy in the grid-to-vehicle (G2V) mode, while also serving as distributed storage when equipped with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, and can provide both economic and environmental benefits if properly managed. The contribution of this paper is to present a comprehensive multi-objective optimization model for the energy management of an LMES in the presence of PEVs, with the aim to combine maximization of LMES operator's profit with the minimization of CO2 emissions. The LMES supplies electricity, heat and cooling to a building cluster with PEVs, which can operate in both G2V and V2G modes. The problem consists of dispatching technologies in the LMES and finding the optimized charging/discharging strategies of PEVs in order to maximize the operator's profit while also reducing CO2 emissions, and it is addressed by formulating a multi-objective linear programming problem with the detailed modeling of interdependencies among energy carriers. The weighted sum method is used to represent the eco-environmental optimization problem, and it is solved by using CPLEX solver and considering a cluster of office buildings located in Italy as end-user of the LMES with PEVs owned by the offices’ employees. Testing results demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimization framework to maximize the operator's profit while also reducing the CO2 emissions, thanks to the optimal coordination of the multiple energy carriers in the LMES and the effective management of the flexibility collected at both supply and demand sides. Moreover, it is found that through the optimized charging and discharging strategies, the PEVs, acting as distributed energy storage, allow the provision of demand response services by also complementing renewable power to improve energy efficiency. In detail, under the economic optimization, most of flexibility collected from PEVs is sold into the wholesale market in order to maximize the operator's profit, whereas, under the environmental optimization, the power discharged from PEVs is exploited for self-use in the LMES to minimize environmental impacts by using a carbon-free source. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-environmental operation optimization; Flexibility management; Local multi-energy system; Mixed-integer linear programming; Plug-in electric vehicles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089106911

It has significant effects on human beings, animals, plants and the climate. Automobile vehicle exhaust contributes 64% of the CO pollution in urban areas. To control this exhaust pollution, various types of catalysts in catalytic converters have been investigated. Increasing costs of noble metals as a catalyst in automobile vehicles motivates the investigation of material that can be substituted for noble metals. Among the non-noble metals, copper (Cu) is found to be the most capable and highly active catalyst for CO oxidation, compared to precious metal catalysts. Lower cost, easy availability and advance preparation conditions with stabilizers, promoters and so on, make Cu a good choice as an auto exhaust purification catalyst. The oxidation of CO proceeds very quickly over Cu°, followed by Cu+ and Cu2+. The Cu2O catalyst is more active in an O2-rich atmosphere than in O2-lean conditions. The reduced species of copper (Cu0, Cu+) are essential for better CO oxidation but smaller Cu particles could be less active than the higher ones. There is a great deal of research available on the Cu catalyst for CO oxidation, but there is a gap in the literature for a review article individually applied to the Cu catalyst for CO oxidation. To fill this gap, the present review updates information on Cu catalysts in the purification of exhaust gases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive vehicle; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst; Copper and exhaust gas","Automobiles; Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Catalytic converters; Exhaust gases; Oxidation; Pollution control; Precious metals; Purification; Carbon monoxide emissions; Copper oxide catalysts; Exhaust purification; Increasing costs; Oxidation of CO; Precious metal catalysts; Preparation conditions; Vehicle exhausts; Copper oxides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084176957

It is not only the conduit of water and field carbon, but also the linear-like wetland with complex carbon cycling. However, the contribution of ditches system to CO2 and CH4 emission has rarely been assessed. To understand the emission pattern of CO2 and CH4 from ditches, this study investigated the emission fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in a three-level ditches system in Chengdu Plain, China. The results showed that the emission of CO2 and CH4 ranged from 70.38 to 950.40 mg C m−2 h−1 and 6.51–74.99 mg C m−2 h−1, respectively, and was higher in spring and summer than other seasons in all ditches (P &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, the emission of CO2 and CH4 increased along with the decreasing ditches size. Besides, it is found that the precipitation, water table depth and water DO concentration might contribute to the emission of CO2, while CH4 was possibly influenced by precipitation, water table depth, temperature, water DO and DOC concentration. Moreover, it is suggested that terrestrial external input and in-situ metabolism might be the main sources of C emission, and in-situ source might largely contribute to CH4 emission. To reduce the C emission, it is necessary to improve fertilization and irrigation methods, limit soil pollutants transferring into ditches, and frequently dredge sediments in future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","C emission flux; Ditches; DOC; Precipitation; Source; Temperature","carbon dioxide; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved oxygen; methane; organic carbon; unclassified drug; water; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; cultivation; methane; seasonal variation; soil pollution; spatiotemporal analysis; wetland; agricultural land; air pollution; air temperature; Article; carbon footprint; China; circadian rhythm; concentration (parameter); environmental factor; farming system; irrigation (agriculture); land biome; metabolism; precipitation; rice; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; spring; summer; water supply; water table; water temperature; wind speed; Oryza; season; soil; Chengdu Plain; China; Sichuan; Carbon Dioxide; China; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Seasons; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086430593

The proposed approach consists of the comparison between the emissions and costs of travels carried out by traditional cars fueled by gasoline and those performed by shared light electric vehicles in six European cities (Bari, Berlin, Genoa, Malaga, Rome and Trikala) located in four different European countries (Italy, Germany, Spain and Greece). Based on the number of kilometers traveled and a set of conversion factors, the environmental impact and the cost of fuel/electricity are assessed for the two transport modes. Furthermore, the paper proposes a methodology to create a geographical scaled up scenario that allows to evaluate emissions and costs in case of an increased use of shared electric vehicles. The data analyzed revealed that the travel time of L-category electric vehicles might be longer compared to cars. Furthermore, by replacing car trips with L-category electric vehicles, CO 2 emissions could decrease of more than 70% in one year, thus reducing about 6, 082 kg of CO 2 emissions. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Environmental impact; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Light electric vehicles; Travel time; Conversion factor; European cities; European Countries; Scaled-up; Transport modes; Urban areas; Electric automobiles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099652543

We use a power plant dispatch model to quantify the effects of dispatching because of a tax on carbon or because of a tax on carbon, methane leakage, and air pollution. We explicitly model exhaust stack CO2 emissions, production costs, health damages caused by criteria air pollutants, and methane leakage from the natural gas infrastructure. We show that (1) the optimal coal-to-gas redispatch displaces 62-77% of coal energy, leaving some coal online, (2) the health benefits of redispatch are larger in magnitude than the climate benefits, (3) reducing methane leakage rates from 2.3 to 2.0% increases the net climate benefits of redispatch by $1.1B-$1.4B, (4) although internalizing methane leakage, climate damages, and health damages in the power plant dispatch maximizes the net benefits of redispatch, 75-87% of these benefits can be achieved using a carbon tax mechanism alone, and (5) when choosing an optimal carbon tax, focusing on climate at the exclusion of health - and vice-versa - provides less net benefit than looking at both issues jointly.

It is a matter of concern for almost all developed and developing countries. The National Air Quality Index (NAQI) in India was first initiated and unveiled by the central government under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign). It was launched to spread cleanliness, and awareness to work towards a clean and healthy environment among all citizens living in India. This index is computed based on values obtained by monitoring eight types of pollutants that are known to commonly permeate around our immediate environment. These are particulate matter PM10; particulate matter PM2.5; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide; lead; ammonia; and ozone. Studies conducted have shown that almost 90% of particulate matters are produced from vehicular emissions, dust, debris on roads, and industries and from construction sites spanning across rural, semi-urban, and urban areas. While the State and Central governments have devised and implemented several schemes to keep air pollution levels under control, these alone have proved inadequate in cases such as the Delhi region of India. Internet of Things (IoT) offers a range of options that do extends into the domain of environmental management. Using an online monitoring system based on IoT technologies, users can stay informed on fluctuating levels of air pollution. In this paper, the design of a low-price pollution measurement kit working around a dust sensor, capable of transmitting data to a cloud service through a Wi-Fi module, is described. A system overview of urban route planning is also proposed. The proposed model can make users aware of pollutant concentrations at any point of time and can also act as useful input towards the design of the least polluted path prediction app. Hence, the proposed model can help travelers to plan a less polluted route in urban areas. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air quality index (AQI); Cloud computing; Fine particulate matter; Green route planning; Internet of Things (IoT)","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); government; monitoring system; optimization; sensor; urban area; World Wide Web; Delhi; India; nitrogen dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; India; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; India; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086701257

Although changes in plant community composition imply changes in soil function, this relationship is not well understood. We investigated the relative importance of environmental (climatic, management and soil) variables and plant functional diversity (PFT composition and interactions) on soil activity and fertility along a climatic gradient. We collected samples of soil and PFT biomass (grasses, legumes, and non-legume forbs) in six extensively managed grasslands along a climatic gradient in the Northern Iberian Peninsula. Variation Partitioning Analysis showed that abiotic and management variables explained most of the global variability (96.5%) in soil activity and fertility; soil moisture and grazer type being the best predictors. PFT diversity accounted for 27% of the total variability, mostly in interaction with environmental factors. Diversity-Interaction models applied on each response variable revealed that PFT-evenness and pairwise interactions a_ected particularly the nitrogen cycle, enhancing microbial biomass nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, total nitrogen, urease, phosphatase, and nitrification potential. Thus, soil activity and fertility were not only regulated by environmental variables, but also enhanced by PFT diversity. We underline that climate change-induced shifts in vegetation composition can alter greenhouse gas-related soil processes and eventually the feedback of the soil to the atmosphere. © 2020 by the authors.","Extensively managed grasslands; Northern Iberian Peninsula; Plant community composition; Soil enzyme activity; Soil fertility; Soil microbial biomass",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090940677

Due to the measures for social distancing, an improvement of air quality was observed worldwide. In view of this scenario, we investigated the air quality improvement related to PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations during 90 days of quarantine compared to an equivalent period in 2019. We found a significant drop in air pollution of 45% of PM10, 46% of PM2.5, and 58% of NO2, and using a relative-risk function, we estimated that this significant air quality improvement avoided, respectively, 78, 337, and 387 premature deaths, respectively, and prevented approximately US $720 million on health costs. Moreover, we estimated that 5623 deaths by COVID-19 represent an economic health loss of US $10.5 billion. Both health and economic gains associated with air pollution reductions give a positive perspective of the efforts towards keeping air pollution reduced even after the pandemic, highlighting the importance of improving the strategies of air pollution mitigation actions, as well as the crucial role of adopting efficient measures to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 global health crisis. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Air quality; COVID-19; Economic burden; Health effects","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); epidemic; health risk; mitigation; mortality; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; strategic approach; viral disease; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092146482

We examine the potential for island invasive vertebrate eradications to have ecological and socioeconomic benefits. Specifically, we examine: (1) how SDGs may have been achieved through past eradications; and (2) how planned future eradications align with SDGs and associated targets. We found invasive vertebrate eradication to align with 13 SDGs and 42 associated targets encompassing marine and terrestrial biodiversity conservation, promotion of local and global partnerships, economic development, climate change mitigation, human health and sanitation and sustainable production and consumption. Past eradications on 794 islands aligned with a median of 17 targets (range 13-38) by island.

To curb this trend and reduce adverse environmental impacts, food waste reduction has been sat on the political agenda, together with ambitious material recycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets. This study analyses the environmental benefits of two waste management systems for household organic food waste, namely recycling by anaerobic digestion (AD) and incineration. Recycling rates, energy efficiency and GHG emissions are reviewed to determine the environmental profile of the downstream systems. The avoided GHG emissions achieved by the respective waste management strategies are further compared with the ones achieved by food waste prevention strategies. The study combines a material flow analysis (MFA) assessing the downstream system with published life cycle analysis (LCA) results for the upstream system. The method was demonstrated as a proof-of-concept case study for the city of Trondheim, Norway. It was found that the recycling of food waste with AD performs better in terms of recycling rates and GHG emissions than incineration, provided that diesel is substituted by biogas. However, the energy efficiency of the incineration process was found to be slightly higher than of the AD option. Nonetheless, relatively small reductions in food wastage (15% and 30%) resulted in large amounts of avoided emissions, outweighing the benefits of recycling strategies. For mitigating climate change, the prevention of food waste clearly stood out as the most effective strategy. Norwegian authorities should focus equally much on household food waste prevention than on optimising food waste management systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Avoided greenhouse gas emissions; Energy efficiency; Food waste prevention; Organic waste treatment; Recycling rates","Anaerobic digestion; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Food waste; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Recycling; Adverse environmental impacts; Environmental benefits; Environmental profile; Incineration process; Life cycle analysis; Material flow analysis; Waste management strategies; Waste management systems; Waste incineration; biogas; diesel fuel; anaerobic digestion; economic policy; energy use; food waste; greenhouse gas; incineration; life cycle analysis; material flow analysis; recycling; waste management; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; downstream processing; energy recovery; environmental policy; flow measurement; food waste; incineration; Norway; recycling; waste management; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084748841

In this scenario, it is of paramount importance to monitor and predict PM concentration. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are commonly used to forecast air pollution levels due to their accuracy. The use of partition on prediction problems is well known because decomposition of time series allows the latent components of the original series to be revealed. It is a matter of extracting the ""deterministic"" component, which is easy to predict the random components. However, there is no evidence of its use in air pollution forecasting. In this work, we introduce a different approach consisting of the decomposition of the time series in contiguous monthly partitions, aiming to develop specialized predictors to solve the problem because air pollutant concentration has seasonal behavior. The goal is to reach prediction accuracy higher than those obtained by using the entire series. Experiments were performed for seven time series of daily particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10-particles with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 micrometers, respectively) in Finland and Brazil, using four ANNs: multilayer perceptron, radial basis function, extreme learning machines, and echo state networks. The experimental results using three evaluation measures showed that the proposed methodology increased all models' prediction capability, leading to higher accuracy compared to the traditional approach, even for extremely high air pollution events. Our study has an important contribution to air quality prediction studies.

Earlier studies suggest that shifts may occur towards heavy vehicles, due to the relative inefficiency of lighter vehicles types. However, these studies have not taken into account the effects of changes in shipment size, as a response to pricing measures. Also, these studies have not considered emission-class dependent charges. Thirdly, no empirical disaggregate models or studies are available for the Netherlands for this problem. We present a discrete choice model for the joint choice of vehicle type and shipment size, estimated on a large dataset of disaggregate carrier freight trip data. The model explains variations in vehicle type choice for different transport purposes and contexts (e.g. commodity type, long-haul, urban transport, to/from logistic nodes). The analysis of emission based truck charging schemes shows that substitution towards low emission vehicles can be expected within the same vehicle class. It is also not likely that the truck charge will lead to a significant increase of shipment sizes or to substitution between vehicle types: a distance based truck charge increases transport costs but inventory costs restrain a shift to larger shipment sizes. This result points to a limited capability of supply chains to absorb transport cost increases by logistics re-organisation. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Emission based truck charge; Freight transport demand; Pricing policies; The Netherlands; Vehicle type and shipment size choice","discrete choice analysis; efficiency measurement; empirical analysis; environmental impact assessment; supply chain management; supply vessel; traffic emission; trucking; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085616784

Numerous studies have reported on the potential to slow down climate change through the sequestration of carbon in soil and trees. Freshwater wetlands hold significant potential for climate change mitigation owing to their large capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Wetlands among all terrestrial ecosystems have the highest carbon density and are found to store up to three to five times more carbon than terrestrial forests. The current study was undertaken to quantify carbon stocks of two carbon pools: aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB). Chosen study sites; Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park are distributed within the Colombo wetland complex. Colombo was recognized as one of the 18 global Ramsar wetland cities in 2018. A combination of field measurements and allometric tree biomass regression models was used in the study. Stratification of the project area was performed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Results: The AGB carbon stock, across strata, is estimated to be in the range of 13.79 ± 3.65-66.49 ± 6.70 tC/ha and 8.13 ± 2.42-52.63 ± 10.00 tC/ha at Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park, respectively. The BGB carbon stock is estimated to be in the range of 2.47 ± 0.61-10.12 ± 0.89 tC/ha and 1.56 ± 0.41-8.17 ± 1.39 tC/ha at Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park, respectively. The total AGB carbon stock of Kolonnawa wetland was estimated at 19,803 ± 1566 tCO2eq and that of Thalawathugoda wetland park was estimated at 4180 ± 729 tCO2eq. Conclusions: In conclusion, the study reveals that tropical freshwater wetlands contain considerable potential as carbon reservoirs. The study suggests the use of tropical freshwater wetlands in carbon sequestration enhancement plans in the tropics. The study also shows that Annona glabra, an invasive alien species (IAS), has the potential to enhance the net sink of AGB carbon in these non-mangrove wetlands. However, further studies are essential to confirm if enhanced carbon sequestration by Annona glabra is among the unexplored and unreported benefits of the species. © 2020 The Author(s).","Aboveground and belowground biomass; Freshwater wetlands; Tropical carbon stocks","aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; carbon sequestration; estimation method; freshwater environment; urban area; wetland; Sri Lanka; Annona glabra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091787857

At least 1217 local governments have so far declared a climate emergency; however, on a national government level, only seven such declarations have been made, most of which were in 2019. The exponential rise of local governments declaring a climate emergency is significant, and developing an understanding of how these responses are operationalised is critical. Previous studies indicate that local government practitioners conceptualise climate change as a complex emergency but tend to suggest ‘business as usual’ responses, unfit to deal with this complexity. Since these governments around the world have declared climate emergencies, it is unknown if the newly released climate emergency plans still tend to suggest such ‘business as usual’ response approaches or if we are now seeing the making of a more complex response to the complex threat of climate change. In this paper, we review two local governments' climate emergency plans: Auckland (New Zealand) and the City of Darebin (Melbourne, Australia). Our research develops a conceptual understanding of climate emergency mode (10 critical key attributes are articulated) and we reveal through the review of our two cases that this understanding is embedded in policy documents to varying degrees but give little explicit attention to processes of prioritisation or economic mobilisation. This research contributes to an initial understanding of a climate emergency mode in governance systems and provides a way forward from business as normal to a complex emergency response for climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Metropolitan planning, climate emergency; Urban climate governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087670541

In this sense, climate change is a considerable threat to the environment, affecting both human and natural systems, and in this context individuals have a very important role. Therefore, the paper aims to investigate, on the one hand, what determines people to undertake specific actions in fighting climate change and, on the other hand, what determines some people to engage in adopting multiple actions exhibiting extra mitigation behaviour compared to others, paving the way to an urban circular economy. In order to do that, multilevel logistic regression analysis using hierarchical data (individuals grouped in counties), reflecting group variability and group-level characteristics effects on outcomes at individual level has been applied. Special attention was given to modernisation thesis validation, stipulating that citizens from more developed and modernized countries are expected to manifest a higher level of extra mitigation compared to inhabitants of less-modernized nations. The empirical results revealed the positive association of pro-environmental factors, socio-demographic and economic factors with both specific and extra mitigation behaviour in fighting climate change. An important finding of the empirical research highlighted the validation of the modernisation thesis, even if partially, and the reinforcement of the modernisation thesis impact on the extra mitigation behaviour determined by the urban area segmentation. The extra commitment behaviour reflected by citizens’ multiple actions in fighting climate change ensures progress to a circular economy through its contribution to waste reduction, eco-shopping increase, on eco-friendly transportation increase or domestic energy reduction. We believe that a shift in citizens’ attitude towards climate change is needed, taking into account that a lot must be done” to effectively respond to climate change, paving the way for the circular economy. © 2020 by the authors.

The next challenge is a tendency of more strict environmental standards and restrictions for power generation equipment. The paper considers one option to meet these challenges — using technologies based on compressorless combined cycle plant with complete capturing of CO2 in liquid state (developed by JIHT in cooperation with NPO Almaz). This technology offers efficient production of heat and power from hydrocarbon fuel with a minimal environmental impact. This plant can be incorporated into a power-engineering complex with chemical products outcome. According to the developed scheme, the hydrocarbon fuel is burnt in a mixture of oxygen, provided by an air-separation setup (or another source), steam, and carbon dioxide. The components are compressed in the liquid phase. The heat from exhaust gas is recuperated in a developed heat recovery system. The steam condensation takes place, and the heat of condensation is utilized for district water heating in water utility grids and for capturing of CO2 in liquid phase. Through varying of proportions between H2O and CO2 inputs, the proportions in generation of electric power and heat can be varied in a wide range. Our estimates demonstrate that this new plant has a thermal efficiency higher than for the best CCGT plants and close to the efficiency for the best worldwide analogs. © 2020, V.V. Datsenko, Yu.A.

The region faces challenges from multiple non-climate stressors such as poverty, environmental and climate shocks, and inadequate infrastructure. Addressing these deprivations in ways that reduce vulnerability associated with a changing climate are critical for the communities that live here. This paper combines data on flood risks derived from a climate–hydrology model under two future scenarios of RCP 4.5 and 8.5, with socio-economic data from communities in the Gandak basin, to demonstrate how mainstreaming climate change impacts into decision-making for sanitation interventions can reduce socio-economic vulnerability to flooding. A Cost-effectiveness analysis of the alternative interventions for sanitation reveals that gains are substantially higher under an intervention that takes note of climatic events, both for the present and in the future. Substantial health costs and inconvenience losses that are particularly acute for women during floods can be averted by investing in climate-friendly options.

Physicochemical analysis of spent HDD residuals from broad geographic regions was conducted to determine if the land application would be an environmentally safe option for disposal. Fifty-eight HDD samples were collected from 26 states throughout the United States. After separation of the liquid and solid portion, the materials were assessed for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), plant nutrients, soluble and total trace metals, total dissolved solids, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and potential ""leachable metals"". All trace metal concentrations in the digested solid portion were well below the limits for biosolids set by the EPA 40 Part 503 rule for land application. Metal concentrations did not exceed the limits of drinking water standards. Besides the total amount of solids, there was nothing chemically limiting HDD residuals from land application.

The impact of increasing [CO2] on the physiology and growth of plants and on the composition, dynamics and productivity of plant communities have been studied extensively in the past few decades. However, the responses to CO2 elevation can be altered by other environmental and biological factors. Such interactions, particularly those involving multiple factors, are complex and not well understood. In this study, we investigated the interactive effects of CO2 elevation, nutrient availability and root interaction between plants on the total seedling photosynthesis, growth, and biomass allocation of two boreal conifer tree species, black spruce and white spruce. Seedlings were exposed to two [CO2] (380 vs. 720 µmol mol−1) and two nutrient levels (low vs. high) with or without root interaction. We found that each of the three treatments influenced the effects of others and the two species also responded differently to those interactions. Root interactions reduced seedling growth only when nutrient supply was high. White spruce was more sensitive root interaction than black spruce while black spruce was more sensitive to the negative impact of low nutrient supply than white spruce. Surprisingly, CO2 elevation and its interactions did not significantly affect seedling growth. The CO2 elevation significantly increased total seedling photosynthesis while root interaction reduced it and the reduction was greater under the elevated CO2. The photosynthetic response to CO2 elevation was more sensitive to nutrient availability in white spruce than in black spruce. Seedling biomass was more sensitive to the negative impact of root interaction and low nutrient supply in black spruce than white spruce. Root interaction reduced biomass allocation to leaf and the impact was reduced by low nutrient. Biomass allocation to leaf was more sensitive to low nutrient supply in black spruce than white spruce. CO2 elevation reduced but root interaction increased root/leaf mass ratio, partially offsetting each other when both treatments were applied. The root/leaf ratio of white spruce was more sensitive to CO2 elevation while that of black spruce was more sensitive to root interaction and nutrient supply. Low nutrient supply and root interaction both had positive effect on root/leaf ratio and their effects were confounded when both were applied simultaneously. Therefore, their effects were observed only when one of them was absent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Boreal conifers; Boreal forests; Climate change; Interactive effect; Plant physiological ecology","Biomass; Ecology; Forestry; Nutrients; Photosynthesis; Biological factors; Biomass allocation; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Interactive effect; Nutrient availability; Photosynthetic response; Plant communities; Seedling biomass; Carbon dioxide; belowground biomass; biomass allocation; carbon dioxide; coniferous forest; elevation; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; physiology; plant community; seedling; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecology; Forestry; Nutrients; Photosynthesis; Coniferophyta; Picea glauca; Picea mariana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085728040

A total of 72 crossbreed pigs [(Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc], with an initial body weight of 50.28 ± 3.77 kg were used in a 70-day experiment with a completely randomized block design. There were two phases: phase 1 (days 0–35) and phase 2 (days 36–70). There were three diet conditions: 1) CON, corn-soybean-wheat basal diet; 2) TRT1, CON + 0.1% AJN root extract; and 3) TRT2, CON + 0.2% AJN root extract. There were six replicate pens per treatment and four pigs (two barrows and two gilts) per pen. Average daily gain (ADG) during phase 2 increased linearly with the dose of AJN root extract, while drip loss on day 3 and ammonia emission during phase 2 decreased linearly. However, the blood profile and fecal microbial community did not differ among the diet groups. In conclusion, AJN root extract increased ADG during days 36–70 and reduced drip loss from meat samples. It also reduced fecal ammonia emission, which improve the overall barn environment. © 2020","Achyranthes japonica Nakai root extract; Ecdysteroid; Finishing pigs","Achyranthes japonica nakai extract; growth promotor; plant extract; unclassified drug; Achyranthes; Achyranthes japonica nakai; ammonia formation; animal experiment; animal food; animal husbandry; animal tissue; anthropometric parameters; Article; average daily gain; blood chemistry; body weight gain; controlled study; dietary intake; drug effect; feces analysis; food quality; growth; meat; microbial community; nonhuman; pig; plant root; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088271031

In addition to this, carbon utilization has often been considered as a viable option for increasing the environmental benefits, while decreasing costs of the mere capture and storage system. This contribution proposes an optimization framework for the design of carbon capture, transport, utilization, and storage supply chains in the European context. Based on literature data, technologies converting CO2 into methanol and polyether carbonate polyols were selected as the most promising and incorporated into the optimization framework. The goal is to reduce 50% of European emissions from large stationary sources by 2030. Results highlight that, under our assumptions, the significance of carbon utilization in terms of a reduction of the environmental impact is likely to be a minor one: considering the current state of technologies only about 2.4% of the overall CO2 emitted from large stationary sources can be removed by chemical utilization. However, significant benefits can be obtained in terms of overall cost reduction thanks to revenues deriving from the chemicals being produced. © Copyright © 2020 d'Amore and Bezzo.","carbon capture utilization and storage; CO2 chemical conversion and utilization; European framework; mixed integer linear programming; supply chain optimization","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Anthropogenic emissions; Carbon utilization; Chemical utilization; Environmental benefits; European context; Optimization framework; Preliminary assessment; Stationary sources; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092690301

Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. Change in climate and the correlated global warming affects the quantity, intensity, and frequency of precipitation type as well as the frequency of extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, thunderstorms, floods, and hurricanes. Respiratory health can be particularly affected by climate change, which contributes to the development of allergic respiratory diseases and asthma. Pollen and mold allergens are able to trigger the release of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators that accelerate the onset the IgE-mediated sensitization and of allergy. Allergy to pollen and pollen season at its beginning, in duration and intensity are altered by climate change. Studies showed that plants exhibit enhanced photosynthesis and reproductive effects and produce more pollen as a response to high atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). Mold proliferation is increased by floods and rainy storms are responsible for severe asthma. Pollen and mold allergy is generally used to evaluate the interrelation between air pollution and allergic respiratory diseases, such as rhinitis and asthma. Thunderstorms during pollen seasons can cause exacerbation of respiratory allergy and asthma in patients with hay fever. A similar phenomenon is observed for molds. Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can have positive health benefits. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

In this regard, numerous two-dimensional electrocatalysts such as mono/binary compounds synthesized from group IV, III-V and V elements with compatible activity towards hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction and CO2reduction have been reported. Motivated by the novel approach of material design and the need for better and cheaper electrocatalytic materials, we have investigated the ground state properties of the GeSb monolayer using state-of-the-art density functional theory. The computed electronic properties reveal the metallic nature of the pristine GeSb monolayer, indicating its potential for utilization as an electrocatalyst. The site-dependent catalytic response of the GeSb monolayer indicates that the Sb-site is more sensitive towards hydrogen adsorption amongst the considered sites. The computed adsorption and Gibbs free energies follow the trend ofEads/GibbsSb&lt;Eads/GibbsEads/GibbsGe Finally, we have investigated the role of arsenic (As) and bismuth (Bi) doping on the catalytic activity of the GeSb monolayer. We notice that the electron density modulation occurs at the Sb-site due to incorporation of substitutional doping which results in a 72% enhancement in the catalytic activity of the monolayer on As substitution. The present study envisages that the electron density modulation can be utilized as a pathway for tailoring the catalytic activity of a system for the hydrogen evolution reaction. © the Owner Societies 2020.",,"Bismuth compounds; Catalyst activity; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Electron density measurement; Electronic properties; Electrons; Gas adsorption; Germanium compounds; Gibbs free energy; Ground state; Hydrogen; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Modulation; Monolayers; Oxygen; As substitutions; Catalytic response; Density modulation; Electrocatalytic materials; Energy generations; Ground state properties; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen evolution; Antimony compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091191865

The schemes are based on the year-to-year increment approach and the coupled climate patterns between the winter SAT over China and its predictors. Observed North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) from the preceding July to September, Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) in the preceding August and winter sea level pressure (SLP) over pan Eurasia from version 2 of the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) are selected as the predictors based on the fundamental physics. Individual-predictor schemes (IP-schemes), that is, SLP-scheme, SST-scheme, SIC-scheme, indicate that these predictors exhibit prediction skills in different regions. Multi-predictor scheme I (MP-schemeI) is developed by combining three predictors. However, MP-schemeI shows limited skill in predicting SAT over Northeast China (NECTA), due to the limited skill of CFSv2 over the extratropics. Thus, MP-schemeII is established, in which a hybrid downscaling model for NECTA is constructed. These two MP-schemes have comparable prediction skill over China, but MP-schemeII outperforms MP-schemeI over NEC. The temporal (spatial) anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) increases from 0.23 (0.15) in MP-schemeI to 0.36 (0.21) in MP-schemeII, and the ratio of the same sign of anomalous years (Anomalous-RSS) improves from 39.1% to 56.5% over NEC. For the winter SAT over China, the MP-schemes greatly enhance the prediction compared with CFSv2 outputs and the IP-schemes. The temporal (spatial) ACC increases from 0.29 (0.05) in CFSv2 to 0.52 (0.29) in the MP-schemes, and the station-average root-mean-square error decreases by about 48.0% compared with CFSv2. Moreover, the RSS (Anomalous-RSS) of the winter SAT over China is 55.9% (47.4%) in CFSv2 and 64.7% (63.2%) in the MP-schemes. This indicates that the MP-schemes perform better in predicting anomalous winters. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","Arctic sea ice; CFSv2; China and Northeast China; hybrid climate prediction; North Pacific sea surface temperature; two-month-leading; year-to-year increment","Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Mean square error; Sea ice; Sea level; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Arctic sea ice; CFSv2; Climate prediction; Northeast China; Sea surface temperature (SST); two-month-leading; year-to-year increment; Forecasting; climate modeling; downscaling; prediction; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; surface temperature; weather forecasting; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079149411

Among the many possible solutions, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) have the potential to de-carbonise the automotive sector without the range anxiety of present and future batteries. The interaction between physical and chemical processes in PEMFC is crucial to their maximum attainable efficiency, albeit the complexity of such interplay still limits a complete understanding of the governing processes. In this paper a canonical PEMFC from literature is simulated using 3D-CFD, and results are compared against experiments. A Eulerian multi-phase/multi-physics non-isothermal framework is used to account for both fluid (gas channels, porous gas diffusion layers) and solid (bi-polar plates, membrane), as well as for electrochemical and sorption reactions. The model is also able to account for the heat balance and for the liquid water formation at cathode catalyst layer, as well as to predict the water transport and the membrane hydration state fundamental for high-efficiency operation. Simulations are compared with measurements and polarization curves are analysed for two membrane thicknesses and rib/channel spacing. The study presents the investigation possibilities given by 3D-CFD in the field of PEMFC and how this can be used to design high efficiency fuel cells.

The purpose of this study was to explore whether physical activity opportunities moderate the relationships among air and water pollution, and measures of health. Aggregate data were collected at the county level in the United States (n = 3104). Variables included the mean daily density of fine particle matter (air pollution), reported cases of health-related drinking water violations (water pollution), subjective ratings of poor or fair health (overall health), the number of physically and mentally unhealthy (physical and mental health, respectively), and the percentage of people living in close proximity to a park or recreation facility (access to physical activity). Air and water pollution have a significant positive effect on all measures of residents’ poor health, while physical activity opportunities only have a negative effect on overall health and physical health. Access to physical activity only moderates the relationship between air pollution and all health outcomes. Since physical activity behavior can be more rapidly changed than some causes of pollution, providing the resident population with better access to physical activity can represent an effective tool in environmental health policy. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Emissions increase air pollution intake (and damage health) of travelers (internal costs), and of non-travelers (external costs). This research constructs a framework modeling the microscopic production of emission cost from the vehicle and link level and applies it to a metropolitan road network. It uses project-level Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) simulations to model link-specific on-road emissions, and then employs the RLINE dispersion model to estimate on- and off-road concentrations of pollutants from vehicles. The internal and external emission costs are measured accordingly by counting the health damage costs of travelers and general population because of exposure. The framework is applied to the Minneapolis-St. Paul (Twin Cities) Metropolitan Area as a proof-of-concept. The estimates show that highways have higher emission concentrations because of higher traffic flow, but that the internal and external emission costs per vehicle kilometer traveled are lower. The emission costs that commuters impose on others greatly exceeds that which they bear.

Social insects employ two markedly different reproductive strategies with contrasting cost/benefit characteristics: independent colony foundation (ICF), which is associated with high dispersal range and high risk, and dependent colony foundation (DCF), characterized by low risk but low dispersal. The ant Myrmecina nipponica employs both of these strategies, with the frequency of each apparently varying between populations. We combine molecular data with data on reproductive strategy from different populations of this species throughout Japan to explore how this polymorphism is linked to environmental factors and whether this relationship can help explain the current and historical biogeography of this species. Reproductive strategy exhibited a strong geographic pattern, with ICF predominant in southern populations and DCF more common in northern and southern highland populations. Molecular analyses clearly divided populations into broad geographic regions, with the southern lowland populations basal to (southern highland (+ northern)) populations. Intra-population polymorphism in colony-founding strategy was widespread, and polymorphism was reconstructed as the likely ancestral state. The frequency of different strategies was linked with climate, with DCF more common in colder areas. A recent inferred origin to the northern lineage suggests that colonization of northern Japan was a rapid event coincident with warming at the end of the Last Glacial Maxima, likely facilitated by the cold-adaptive advantages of DCF. We discuss how such polymorphisms could help explain the biogeography of this and other social insects. © 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Ecosystem-level gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE) were assessed using multi-temporal MODIS remote sensing data and its response to climatic variables were analyzed in well-preserved native forests, degraded native forests by selective harvesting and pine plantations. Field measurements of leaf area index (LAI), tree density, basal area, tree high, diameter at breast height and understory cover was implemented. The GPP was high throughout the year across all three-land use types. Selective harvesting of commercial trees resulted in a significant decrease in tree density and in basal area compared to well-preserved native forests but did not have a negative impact on GPP. Mean annual ET was similar between both native forests because although the degraded forest had a lower tree density they had a greater maximun DBH per tree than the well-preserved forests and therefore high transpiration. The WUE was similar across the ecosystem types. Removal of 5.5 m2 of canopy trees produced a compensatory change in ecosystem structure and function resulting in the maintenance of GPP and ET. Replacement of native forests by pine plantations for wood production did not change annual GPP compared to native forests, but the final carbon assimilation should be lower due to the CO2 released before canopy closure and after harvesting. All climatic variables were linearly and significantly related to monthly GPP, ET and WUE with the exception of precipitation with monthly GPP. Finding forest management techniques for increasing carbon assimilation is of importance for limiting the rise of global CO2 emissions and for regulation of the water cycle. © 2020","Afforestation; Evapotranspiration; Gross primary productivity; Leaf area index; Modis; Pinus taeda; Selective timber extraction","basal area; climate change; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; ecosystem structure; forest management; land use; plantation; satellite data; selective logging; subtropical region; water use efficiency; Argentina; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087212475

Methods: Data come from the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) DBS laboratory reports and the HRS merged with the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Global Historical Climate Network Daily (NCDC GHCN-Daily) and the NCDC Local Climatological Data, by zip code. We ran regression models to examine the associations between assay values based on DBS for five analytes (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), and cystatin C) and the characteristics of DBS cards and drops, shipping time, and temperature, and humidity at the time of collection. Results: We found cholesterol measures to be sensitive to many factors including small spots, shipping time, high temperature and humidity. Small spots in DBS cards are related to lower values across all analytes. Longer DBS transit time before freezing is associated with lower values of total and HDL cholesterol and cystatin C. Results were similar whether or not venous blood sample values were included in equations. Conclusions: Small spots, long shipping time, and exposure to high temperature and humidity need to be avoided if possible. Quality of spots and cards and information on shipping time and conditions should be coded with the data to make adjustments in values when necessary. The different results across analytes indicate that results cannot be generalized to all DBS assays. © 2020 The Authors.

The STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Region on Population, Affluence, and Technology) human structural ecology framework is extended by drawing from science and technology studies (STS) to theorize urban form as a sociotechnical system involving practices and knowledge that contribute to urban land use as a material artifact on the landscape influencing emissions. Questions addressed are: (1) ""What is the influence of urban form on total sector CO2 emissions?"" and (2) ""How does the influence of urban form on CO2 emissions differ for metropolitan versus non-metropolitan status?"" Spatial error regression models were estimated using county-level CO2 emissions data from Project Vulcan. The National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) was used to quantify measures of urban form. Other independent variables were derived from U.S. Census data. Results demonstrate carbon reduction benefits achievable through a developed land use mix containing a greater proportion of high intensity relative to low intensity use. Urban form matters, but it matters differently in terms of sign, significance, and interpretation depending on emission sector and metro versus non-metro status. A focus on urban form provides policymakers potential leverage for carbon mitigation efforts that focus on total emissions as opposed to per capita emission. A feature of the research is its integration of concepts and theory from structural human ecology, STS, land change science, and GIScience. © 2020 by the author.","CO2 emissions; GIScience; Land change science; Socio-technical system; STIRPAT; Urban form","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data interpretation; GIS; land use change; landscape change; policy making; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092407065

At the same time, the tectonic evolution of the Southern Ocean was characterized by the opening and deepening of circum- Antarctic gateways, which affected both surface- and deepocean circulation. The Tasmanian Gateway played a key role in regulating ocean throughflow between Australia and Antarctica. Southern Ocean surface currents through and around the Tasmanian Gateway have left recognizable tracers in the spatiotemporal distribution of plankton fossils, including organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts. This spatiotemporal distribution depends on both the physicochemical properties of the water masses and the path of surface-ocean currents. The extent to which climate and tectonics have influenced the distribution and composition of surface currents and thus fossil assemblages has, however, remained unclear. In particular, the contribution of climate change to oceanographic changes, superimposed on long-term and gradual changes induced by tectonics, is still poorly understood. To disentangle the effects of tectonism and climate in the southwest Pacific Ocean, we target a climatic deviation from the long-term Eocene cooling trend: the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; ∼ 40 Ma). This 500 kyr phase of global warming was unrelated to regional tectonism, and thus provides a test case to investigate the ocean’s physicochemical response to climate change alone.We reconstruct changes in surface-water circulation and temperature in and around the Tasmanian Gateway during the MECO through new palynological and organic geochemical records from the central Tasmanian Gateway (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1170), the Otway Basin (southeastern Australia), and the Hampden Beach section (New Zealand). Our results confirm that dinocyst communities track specific surface-ocean currents, yet the variability within the communities can be driven by superimposed temperature change. Together with published results from the east of the Tasmanian Gateway, our new results suggest a shift in surface-ocean circulation during the peak of MECO warmth. Simultaneous with high sea-surface temperatures in the Tasmanian Gateway area, pollen assem-blages indicate warm temperate rainforests with paratropical elements along the southeastern margin of Australia. Finally, based on new age constraints, we suggest that a regional southeast Australian transgression might have been coincident with the MECO. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

The Equidistance Quantile Matching Method was used to design the IDF curves. The simulated curves presented differences when related to the existing curve. The largest differences were for the MIROC5 (146% in RCP 8.5) and the smallest differences were for the CanESM2 (20.83% for RCP 8.5). This result demonstrates that the method incorporates changes in future climate variability. The spatial resolutions of each model influenced their IDF curves, which led the CanESM2 curves to not present satisfactory results that are different from the MIROC5 curves, which were the ones that best represented the possible future differences. © IWA Publishing 2020.","Climate change; Hydraulic projects; Risk management","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Risk management; Climate policy; Future climate scenarios; General circulation model; Global climates; Hydraulic projects; Matching methods; Possible futures; Spatial resolution; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; computer simulation; future prospect; global climate; model test; model validation; weather forecasting; Amazonia; Brazil; Tapajos Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088899836

Illumination with 365 nm light, close to the peak plasmon resonance of silver, selectively enhanced 5 of the 14 typically observed copper CO2 reduction products while simultaneously suppressing hydrogen evolution. At low overpotentials, carbon monoxide was promoted in the light and at high overpotentials ethylene, methane, formate, and allyl alcohol were enhanced upon illumination; generally C1 products and C2/C3 products containing a double carbon bond were selectively promoted under illumination. Temperature-dependent product analysis in the dark showed that local heating is not the cause of these selectivity changes.

The adoption of sustainable biofuel production technologies that do not place large demands on agricultural or forested lands, has the potential to make a substantial contribution to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions while reducing biodiversity losses and degradation of native ecosystems resulting from high demand for land. With their high productivity per unit area and ability to grow on non-arable lands, microalgal biofuel production systems could become a major sustainable alternative to biofuel production from food crops (first-generation biofuels). However, the potential impacts of microalgal biofuels on food production, biodiversity, and carbon storage, compared to other biofuel production alternatives, are largely unknown. In the present study, the most suitable areas for siting microalgae production farms to fulfill 30% of future transport energy demands were determined within four Neotropical countries with high population densities and high importance for agricultural expansion and biodiversity conservation globally (Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela). These results were contrasted with the best areas for siting oil palm and sugarcane crops to fulfill the same target in future transport energy demands. Microalgal production systems offer the most sustainable alternative for future biofuel production within the Neotropics. Meeting 30% of future transport energy demands with microalgal biofuels reduced land area requirements by at least 52% compared to oil palm and sugarcane. Furthermore, microalgal biofuel production reduced direct competition with agricultural lands, biodiverse areas, and carbon-rich systems within countries, with little overlap with the biodiverse and carbon-rich rainforests. This study can guide decision making towards the identification and adoption of more sustainable biofuel production alternatives in the Neotropics, helping in avoiding unnecessary environmental impacts from biofuel expansion in the region. © 2020 The Author(s).

The role of perception can be relevant in exploring effects and pollution control actions. The purpose of this study was to explore studies that analyse people’s perception, together with the measurement of air pollution, in order to elucidate the relationship between them. We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In March 2020, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were explored in an attempt to search for studies published from 2000 to 2020. The review included 38 studies, most of which were conducted in China (n = 13) and the United States (n = 11) and published over the last four years (n = 26). Three studies were multicenter investigations, while five articles were based on a national-level survey. The air quality (AQ) was assessed by monitoring stations (n = 24) or dispersion models (n = 7). Many studies were population questionnaire-based, air monitoring and time-series studies, and web-based investigations. A direct association between exposure and perception emerged in 20 studies. This systematic review has shown that most of the studies establish a relationship between risk perception measurement. A broad spectrum of concepts and notions related to perception also emerged, which is undoubtedly an indicator of the wealth of available knowledge and is promising for future research. © 2020 by the authors.

Regrowing natural forests is a prominent strategy for capturing additional carbon3, but accurate assessments of its potential are limited by uncertainty and variability in carbon accumulation rates2,3. To assess why and where rates differ, here we compile 13,112 georeferenced measurements of carbon accumulation. Climatic factors explain variation in rates better than land-use history, so we combine the field measurements with 66 environmental covariate layers to create a global, one-kilometre-resolution map of potential aboveground carbon accumulation rates for the first 30 years of natural forest regrowth. This map shows over 100-fold variation in rates across the globe, and indicates that default rates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)4,5 may underestimate aboveground carbon accumulation rates by 32 per cent on average and do not capture eight-fold variation within ecozones. Conversely, we conclude that maximum climate mitigation potential from natural forest regrowth is 11 per cent lower than previously reported3 owing to the use of overly high rates for the location of potential new forest. Although our data compilation includes more studies and sites than previous efforts, our results depend on data availability, which is concentrated in ten countries, and data quality, which varies across studies. However, the plots cover most of the environmental conditions across the areas for which we predicted carbon accumulation rates (except for northern Africa and northeast Asia). We therefore provide a robust and globally consistent tool for assessing natural forest regrowth as a climate mitigation strategy. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon; aboveground biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; ecozone; environmental conditions; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; naturalness; regrowth; Article; bioaccumulation; biogeographic region; carbon footprint; climate change; concentration (parameter); forest; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; land use; plant growth; prediction; priority journal; carbon sequestration; ecosystem restoration; environmental protection; forestry; geographic mapping; growth, development and aging; information processing; international cooperation; kinetics; metabolism; prevention and control; tree; Africa; Asia; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Forestry; Forests; Geographic Mapping; Global Warming; Internationality; Kinetics; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091432763

One emerging pathway municipalities have used to achieve clean energy goals is through including these objectives in electric franchise agreements. An electric franchise agreement is a negotiated contract between a municipality and an electric service provider which among other stipulations grants the utility the right to serve customers in the municipality's jurisdiction. This is the first nationwide assessment of the municipal opportunity to pursue franchise agreements with electric service providers, along with the potential impact of these agreements on achieving clean energy goals. We conclude that municipalities across at least 30 states have the authority to pursue franchise agreements. Our bounding scenarios suggest widespread deployment of renewable energy via franchise-driven partnerships could result in 164 – 911 TW h of renewable energy potentially serving 15.8 – 87.7 million households. Though there is immense opportunity to leverage franchise agreements to achieve renewable energy objectives, future deployment will be dependent on the negotiations between an electric service provider and individual municipalities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric service providers; Franchise agreements; Local government; Municipalities; Renewable energy; Solar","Carbon emissions; Clean energy; Electric services; Franchise agreements; Potential impacts; Renewable energies; Energy policy; alternative energy; carbon emission; electricity supply; emission control; energy policy; environmental economics; negotiation process; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086085046

The transition from solid to clean fuels in households has the potential to substantially improve public health. India has implemented large initiatives to promote clean fuel access, but how these initiatives will reduce PM2.5 exposure and the associated health benefits have not yet been established. We quantified the impacts of a transition of household energy from solid fuel use to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) on public health in India from ambient and household PM2.5 exposure. We estimate that the transition to LPG would reduce ambient PM2.5 concentrations by 25%. Reduced exposure to total PM2.5 results in a 29% reduction in the loss of healthy life, preventing 348 000 (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 284 000-373 000) premature mortalities every year. Achieving these benefits requires a complete transition to LPG. If access to LPG is restricted to within 15 km of urban centres, then the health benefits of the clean fuel transition are reduced by 50%. If half of original solid fuel users continue to use solid fuels in addition to LPG, then the health benefits of the clean fuel transition are reduced by 75%. As the exposure-outcome associations are non-linear, it is critical for air pollution studies to consider the disease burden attributed to total PM2.5 exposure, and not only the portion attributed to either ambient or household PM2.5 exposure.

This paper proposes the use of an Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP) system coupled with a Horizontal Earth-To-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHX) to reduce energy consumption in buildings. The novelty is to geothermally pre-heat or pre-cool the air source of the ASHP through the EAHX, reducing the electric power needed, keeping constant heating/cooling capacity. The behaviour of ASHP-EAHX system has been investigated by a numerical model implemented in TRNSYS. A total of 54 combinations have been obtained and tested varying ground thermal properties, burial depth, air flow rate and pipe length. The model has been validated with a real case showing a good agreement between simulated and monitored data. The study is focused on the city of Turin (North of Italy), compared with Brindisi (South of Italy), and extremely cold and hot climates like Tromsø (Norway) and Béchar (Algeria), respectively. The ASHP-EAXH performance has been investigated, by the comparison with the traditional ASHP, using different coefficients, such as the Coefficient of Performance (COP), the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER), the Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCOP), and the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER). The paper reveals how the ASHP-EAHX system show higher performance compared to the traditional ASHP, in all seasons. The overall merit is, for cold extremely climate, the reduction of the shutdown periods, when the outside temperature is below the limit operating temperature, and to allow the extension of the use of the heat pump to locations, where it is currently not convenient for the average outside temperature lower than the limit operating temperature of the heat pump. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP); Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHX); Geothermics; Ground; SCOP; SEER","Coefficient of performance; Energy utilization; Geothermal energy; Pumps; Temperature; Coefficient of performances (COP); Earth-to-air heat exchanger; Energy efficiency ratio; Numerical and experimental analysis; Operating temperature; Reduce energy consumption; Seasonal coefficients; Seasonal energy efficiency ratios; Air source heat pumps; air temperature; airflow; comparative study; energy efficiency; experimental study; geothermal power; numerical method; pump; seasonal variation; Algeria; Bechar; Brindisi; Italy; Norway; Piedmont [Italy]; Puglia; Torino [Piedmont]; Troms; Tromso; Turin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083356823

In addition to diesel generators, various combinations of distributed generators and storage technologies are considered to form different hybrid power systems. Optimal design of the hybrid power systems is implemented using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. The performance of the PSO in optimizing the above hybrid systems is discussed in detail. Whilst meeting the power system operational constraints, the minimum levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of all systems, with various combinations of system components, are calculated. Simulation results obtained for each optimized system are carefully described and analysed. The annual operations of various components in each system are then compared and discussed in detail. A sensitivity analysis by varying the cost of wind turbines and the photovoltaic is also conducted for all hybrid systems. It has been found that the inclusion of energy storage systems (battery and flywheel) can reduce the LCOE and CO2 emission significantly compared to the inclusion of renewable generations (solar and wind) alone. The diesel-wind-solar-battery system is the eco-friendliest with an annual CO2 emission of 451 t compared to the reference diesel system (1064 t). In addition, the hybrid system consisting of diesel, wind, solar, battery and flywheel is found to be the most economic with a LCOE of 58.94 ¢/kWh compared to the diesel system with a LCOE of 67.17 ¢/kWh. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","energy storage; isolated remote area power system; optimal sizing; particle swarm optimisation; renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Flywheels; Hybrid systems; Sensitivity analysis; Thermoelectricity; Wheels; Cost of electricity; Distributed generators; Energy storage systems; Hybrid power systems; Operational constraints; Particle swarm optimisation; Renewable generation; Storage technology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086264886

The climate adaptation framework was developed following the Urban Adaptation Support Tool (AST), adapted to the Portuguese reality. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to provide future projections with a high level of spatial resolution over the study area, increasing the accuracy of the identification of future climatic vulnerabilities.

The chamber method is the most common method to quantify GHG fluxes from soil–plant systems and to better understand factors affecting their generation and mitigation. The objective of this study was to review and synthesize literature on chamber designs (non-flow-through, non-steady-state chamber) and associated factors that affect GHG nitrous oxide (N2O) flux measurement when using chamber methods. Chamber design requires consideration of many facets that include materials, insulation, sealing, venting, depth of placement, and the need to maintain plant growth and activity. Final designs should be tailored, and bench tested, in order to meet the nuances of the experimental objectives and the ecosystem under study while reducing potential artifacts. Good insulation, to prevent temperature fluctuations and pressure changes, and a high-quality seal between base and chamber are essential. Elimination of pressure differentials between headspace and atmosphere through venting should be performed, and designs now exist to eliminate Venturi effects of earlier tube-type vent designs. The use of fans within the chamber headspace increases measurement precision but may alter the flux. To establish best practice recommendations when using fans, further data are required, particularly in systems containing tall plants, to systematically evaluate the effects that fan speed, position, and mixing rate have on soil gas flux. © 2020 The Authors.

As with Green Revolutions in Asia and Mexico, agricultural innovations (hybrid seeds, agronomic engineering, market linkages,and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides) are promoted as essential catalysts of agriculture-led economic growth. Intensification programs are now frequently linked to Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), which attempts to build resilience and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while increasing crop yields. This article considers who and what is resilient in Africa's Green Revolution. We report on a multi-season study of smallholder food producers' experiences with Rwanda's Crop Intensification Program (CIP) and related policies that aim to commercialize subsistence agriculture while implementing CSA. We suggest that there are fundamental limits to the climate resilience afforded by CSA and development efforts rooted in Green Revolution thinking. Our findings illustrate that such efforts foreground technology and management adjustments in ways that have reduced smallholder resilience by inhibiting sovereignty over land use, decreasing livelihood flexibility, and constricting resource access. We put forth that rural development policies could better promote climate-resilient livelihoods through: 1) adaptive governance that enables smallholder land use decision-making; 2) support for smallholder food producers’ existing agro-ecological strategies of intensification; 3) participatory approaches to visualize and correct for inequalities in local processes of social-ecological resilence Such considerations are paramount for meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and building climate-resilient food systems. © 2020 The Authors","Agricultural intensification; Climate change; Climate Smart Agriculture; Food sovereignty; Resilience; Vulnerability","agricultural intensification; alternative agriculture; crop yield; economic growth; green revolution; smallholder; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Asia; Mexico [North America]; Rwanda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086161069

However, quantifying the sources of organic matter (OM) in estuarine and coastal sediments, where mangroves occur but are not the only source of OM, is challenging due to the variety of OM sources and diverse transport processes in these dynamic environments. The sources of OM in subtidal surface sediments of two mangrove-fringed estuaries in Hainan Province, China, were investigated using the mangrove-specific biomarker taraxerol and other lipid biomarkers, as well as stable carbon isotopes. Mixing models based on the concentration of taraxerol, plant wax n-alkanes and δ13COM indicate that terrestrial non-mangrove plant OM accounted for 40–57% of the OM in the two estuaries, phytoplankton OM accounted for 24–45%, and OM from mangroves comprised 15–19% of the total. Terrestrial plants contributed 10–21% more of the OM to subtidal sediments of Bamen Bay, which is on the wetter, eastern side of Hainan Island, than to Danzhou Bay, but the phytoplankton OM fraction was 16–24% lower than that in Danzhou Bay subtidal sediments. In both estuaries, mangrove and phytoplankton OM fractions increased seaward while the terrestrial OM fraction decreased. On a seasonal basis, lipid biomarker concentrations indicated a small change of OM sources. The biomarker and carbon isotope approach used here can be applied to semi-quantitatively estimate spatial and temporal variations of the sources of organic carbon in tropical estuarine and coastal sediments, a major sink for carbon in the ocean. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blue carbon; Coastal biogeochemistry; Lipid biomarkers; Mangroves; Stable carbon isotopes; Taraxerol","Biogeochemistry; Biomarkers; Ecosystems; Forestry; Isotopes; Organic carbon; Paraffins; Phytoplankton; Sediments; Coastal ecosystems; Dynamic environments; Organic matter source; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatio-temporal variation; Stable carbon isotopes; Subtidal sediments; Terrestrial forests; Estuaries; bay; coastal sediment; coastal zone; estuarine sediment; mangrove; organic matter; sediment chemistry; spatiotemporal analysis; subtidal environment; terrestrial environment; China; Danzhou; Hainan; Hainan; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088009773

This work addresses the understanding of the fundamental aspects of oil transport and combustion gas flow in the cylinder kit, using simulation tools and high-performance computing. A dynamic three-dimensional multi-phase, multi-component modeling methodology is demonstrated to study cylinder-kit assembly tribology during the four-stroke cycle of a piston engine. The percentage of oil and gas transported through different regions of the piston ring pack is predicted, and the mechanisms behind this transport are analyzed. The velocity field shows substantial circumferential flow in the piston ring pack, leading to blowback into the combustion chamber during the expansion stroke. Oil initialization and management of a continuous supply of oil throughout the cycle are observed to govern how much oil would be lost to the crankcase and combustion chamber. The calculated blow-by results agree with the results of a quasi-one-dimensional cylinder-kit analysis system of programs known as CASE (Cylinder-kit Analysis System for Engines). Implementing this three-dimensional methodology leads to a better understanding of cylinder-kit fluid flow physics.

To overcome the economic barriers, the production of value-added chemicals was desired by compensating for the overall processing cost. Here, we engineered cyanobacteria for photosynthetic squalene production and cultivated them in a scalable photobioreactor using industrial flue gas. First, an inducer-free gene expression system was developed for the cyanobacteria to lower production const. Then, the recombinant cyanobacteria were cultivated in a closed photobioreactor (100 L) using flue gas (5% CO2) as the sole carbon source under natural sunlight as the only energy source. Seasonal light intensities and temperatures were analyzed along with cyanobacterial cell growth and squalene production in August and October 2019. As a result, the effective irradiation hours were the most critical factor for the large-scale cultivation of cyanobacteria. Thus, an automated photobioprocess system will be developed based on the regional light sources.

Among these polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are microbial polyesters synthesized and accumulated intracellularly as a storage material of carbon, energy, and reducing power under unfavorable growth conditions in the presence of excess carbon source. PHAs have attracted considerable attention for their wide range of applications in industrial and medical fields. Since the first discovery of PHA accumulating bacteria about 100 years ago, remarkable advances have been made in the understanding of PHA biosynthesis and metabolic engineering of microorganisms toward developing efficient PHA producers. Recently, nonnatural polyesters have also been synthesized by metabolically engineered microorganisms, which opened a new avenue toward sustainable production of more diverse plastics. Herein, the current state of PHAs and nonnatural polyesters is reviewed, covering mechanisms of microbial polyester biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and enzymes involved in biosynthesis of short-chain-length PHAs, medium-chain-length PHAs, and nonnatural polyesters, especially 2-hydroxyacid-containing polyesters, metabolic engineering strategies to produce novel polymers and enhance production capabilities and fermentation, and downstream processing strategies for cost-effective production of these microbial polyesters.

In this study, we examined sociodemographic differences in access to green spaces of different sizes for 14,385 census block groups in 12 U.S. cities using a 'just sustainabilities' framework. We classified green spaces into street-level greenery (XS), neighborhood parks (S-L; walking and cycling access), and large parks (XL; walking, cycling, and driving access). We ran spatial filtering models at the census block group level using different thresholds based on transportation modes. We uncovered a complex picture of inequality, with consistent injustices for XS green space, and fewer injustices for S-L and XL green space based on socioeconomic status and age, and some instances of just distributions for S-L and XL green space based on race/ethnicity. Our findings present a concerning picture for 'just sustainabilities': the green space type that is most often part of sustainability and climate adaptation strategies-street greenery-is unjustly distributed, likely as a result of structural racism in U.S. institutions. By examining multimodal access to green spaces of different sizes, this study helps urban greening professionals develop more just and sustainable strategies. © 2020 by the authors.","Environmental justice; Green space; Green space size; Just sustainabilities; Street greenery","greenspace; neighborhood; socioeconomic status; sustainability; transportation mode; urban area; urban ecosystem; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090343922

Regional factors of air pollution involve regional equity, and only a few researches tackled long-term power planning with mitigation of air pollution. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop a balanced long-term power planning model with compromise solutions and to decide the power generation configuration under seasonal, regional and air pollution factors in addition to cost. Based on empirical study of Taiwan, the future thinking of air pollution reduction should accept transmission from renewable energy between regions due to the cost effective and environmental benefits. The renewable energy and minor increase in non-renewable energy with better equipment will mitigate the emissions. The coal power will be the source of flexible scheduling at peak load. Interregional cooperation with seasonal power dispatching has become the future direction. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide suggestions when decision makers’ preference change. This study can serve as a decision support system for policymakers and a platform for stakeholders to discuss future visions on power planning.

Under climate change, projected higher air temperature and stronger surface energy fluxes will lead to increased water temperatures, exacerbating thermal extremes. However, cold hypolimnetic releases from thermally stratified reservoirs can depress tailwater temperatures and therefore alleviate thermal extremes. Thermal extremes are more harmful when they coincide with low flows, which we refer to as 'hydrologic hot-dry events'. To assess multi-sectoral impacts of climate change over large regions, we evaluate thermal events according to three impact attributes: duration (D), intensity (I), and severity (S). We apply an established model framework to simulate streamflow and stream temperature over the southeastern US regulated river system. We quantify climate change impacts (by the 2080s under RCP8.5) by comparing historical and future periods and quantify regulation impacts by comparing unregulated and regulated model setups. We find that climate change will exacerbate thermal extremes (all three metrics) in both unregulated and regulated model setups, albeit less in the regulated setup. Thermal mitigation from reservoir regulation will be stronger under climate change, decreasing the three metrics compared to the unregulated case. Even so, thermal extremes in the regulated setup will still be more severe under climate change, and only 12.2%, 19.7%, and 26.0% of D, I, and S can be mitigated by reservoirs. Despite stronger reservoir stratification, the number of regulated river segments that experience simultaneous high temperature and low flow events (hydrologic hot-dry events) will increase by 21.4% by the 2080s under RCP8.5. These events will have a median annual duration of 10.3 day/year, over 10 times the historical value. © 2020 The Author(s).

During the formation of inflammatory conditions, the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation plays an important regulator. Carbon monoxide (CO) arising from heme degradation, catalyzed particularly by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), has been shown to own cytoprotective effects including anti-inflammation and antioxidant. Here, we determined the novel mechanisms of carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) on PM-induced inflammatory responses in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs). Methods: The effects of CORM-2 on the expression of various inflammatory proteins induced by PM were determined by Western blot, real-time PCR, promoter assay, and ELISA. The involvement of signaling molecules in these responses was studied by using the selective pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs. Results: We proved that PM enhanced C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β release, which were reduced by preincubation with CORM-2. Transfection with PKCα siRNA and preincubation with the ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-cysteine, NAC), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium, DPI), or the mitochondria-specific superoxide scavenger (MitoTEMPO) inhibited PM-mediated inflammatory responses. In addition, PM-regulated PKCα and NADPH oxidase activation as well as NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived ROS generation were inhibited by CORM-2, but not inactivate CORM-2 (iCORM-2) pretreatment. At the end, we confirmed that CORM-2 improved PM-induced inflammatory responses via the induction of Nrf2 activation and HO-1 expression. Conclusion: We suggest that CORM-2 inhibits PM-induced inflammatory responses in HOKs via the inhibition of PKCα/ROS/NLRP3 inflammasome activation combined with the induction of Nrf2/HO-1 expression. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon monoxide; NLRP3 inflammasome; Oral mucosal; Particulate matter; Reactive oxygen species","acetylcysteine; C reactive protein; carbon monoxide releasing molecule 2; diphenyliodonium salt; heme oxygenase 1; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; messenger RNA; oxidoreductase; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; small interfering RNA; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; carbon monoxide; heme oxygenase 1; HMOX1 protein, human; inflammasome; NFE2L2 protein, human; organometallic compound; protective agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; transcription factor Nrf2; tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer; Article; cell assay; cell level; cell protection; controlled study; cytokine release; enzyme activation; enzyme analysis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exposure; gene expression regulation; human; human cell; human oral keratinocyte; immune response; keratinocyte; mouth inflammation; oxidative stress; particulate matter; priority journal; promoter assay; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; upregulation; urban particulate matter; Western blotting; cell culture; drug effect; inflammation; keratinocyte; metabolism; mitochondrion; particulate matter; pharmacology; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Carbon Monoxide; Cells, Cultured; Heme Oxygenase-1; Humans; Inflammasomes; Inflammation; Keratinocytes; Mitochondria; NADPH Oxidases; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Organometallic Compounds; Particulate Matter; Protective Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087036425

The proposed approach is applied to a recent stated preference study in which the residents of the Eastern Shore of Virginia answer choice questions about alternative coastal climate change adaptation plans. While the double hurdle latent class model avoids self-contradictory assumptions, estimates and tests show that, compared with an unrestricted latent class model, it achieves a significantly better statistical fit and maintains the capability to link the heterogeneity of participants’ preferences to their attributes. Moreover, the double hurdle latent class model also provides important implications in how to conduct welfare analysis based on different behavioral patterns of different groups, which leads to nontrivial changes in welfare measures.

A quantitative sustainability assessment model was constructed for the resulting hybrid district heating systems. Indicators on energy, environment, economic, and societal aspects were used to evaluate the composite sustainability index of hybrid systems with information entropy method. The results demonstrate that a district heating system coupled to compound parabolic concentrator-photovoltaic/thermal solar collector system with 100% photovoltaic coverage ratio is the ideal system for the case study when the annual cost saving ratio is given the highest impact in the composite sustainability index. A detailed analysis on the annual cost saving ratio shows that a higher ambient temperature, solar beam irradiance and grid electricity price would have a positive impact on the annual cost saving ratio. It can be concluded that the quantitative sustainability evaluation approach proposed helps to select the ideal hybrid system. © 2020","District heating systems; Geothermal heat pump; Photovoltaic/thermal solar collector; Quantitative sustainability evaluation","Cost benefit analysis; District heating; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gases; Heating equipment; Hybrid systems; Sensitivity analysis; Solar collectors; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Absorption heat pumps; Compound parabolic concentrator; District heating system; Information entropy method; Renewable energies; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability evaluations; Sustainability index; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086426081

We determined the contents and compositions of ASs and PLFAs in the soils of five long-term (12 years) practices of land management: bare land (BL), grassland (GL), and land with continuous wheat (WC), soybean (SC), and maize (MC) cropping systems. BL and GL were not fertilized, but WC, SC, and MC were supplied with either mineral fertilizer (WCF, SCF, and MCF, respectively) or no fertilizer as controls (WC, SC, and MC, respectively). The contents of ASs and PLFAs in WC, SC, and MC were somewhere in the middle of those between GL and BL. Soils amended with maize material accumulated more ASs than soils amended with soybean or wheat material. The AS contents were 7.2 and 10.3% lower in WCF and SCF than WC and SC, respectively, but were 6.4% higher in MCF than MC. The contribution of fungi to the pools of soil organic carbon were significantly lower when mineral fertilizer was added, indicated by structural equation modeling under a continuous supply of N. The new carbon accumulated by microbes was positively contributed more by residues derived bacteria than from fungi.

To understand the mechanism of zinc electrocatalysts toward the CO2RR, a series of thermally oxidized zinc foils is prepared to achieve a direct correlation between the chemical state of the electrocatalyst and product selectivity. The evidence provided by in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray diffraction significantly demonstrates that the Zn(ii) and Zn(0) species on the surface are responsible for the production of carbon monoxide (CO) and formate, respectively. Specifically, the destruction of a dense oxide layer on the surface of zinc foil through a thermal oxidation process results in a 4-fold improvement of faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate toward the CO2RR. The results from in situ measurements reveal that the chemical state of zinc electrocatalysts could dominate the product profile for the CO2RR, which provides a promising approach for tuning the product selectivity of zinc electrocatalysts.

In this study, we use quantum chemistry to investigate the most probable transition states, intermediates and products in the process of heterogeneous reduction between char and N2O and to study the behavior of oxygen remaining on the surface of char. The oxygen-containing char surface, both the armchair and zigzag char, are beneficial to the adsorption of N2O, but inhibits the reduction of N2O. The mechanism and reaction rate between N2O and two char models are different, which allowed us to study the different effects of oxygen on the heterogeneous reduction of N2O by two char models. The results show that the adsorption rate constant of N2O in the zigzag model is always greater than that of the armchair model and oxygen has a significant effect on the desorption of N2 on the surface of armchair char. The behavior of oxygen remaining on char surface will take place CO2 desorption, and it markedly occurs when the rate constants are higher than 10° s−1 (&gt;1000 K).

The purpose of this study is to accurately measure CO2 emissions at the city scale in China and examine the environmental Kuznets curve, thereby providing a reference for decision-making. Corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data were used to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions at the provincial and city scales in China. Then, based on the STRIPAT model, 291 cities in China were used to verify the environmental Kuznets curve. Our results show that on the provincial scale, the R2 between the estimated value and the statistical value of carbon dioxide reaches 0.85. Western cities in China emit more CO2, as do economically developed cities and industry- and mining-dominated cities. There are two CO2 emission hot spots in the north and one cold spot in the south. It was found that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists. This study has practical value in utilizing NPP-VIIRS data for the estimation of city CO2 emissions. The results also have academic value for determining factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions and can provide a reference for relevant decision makers.

Climate change law was studied. This research methods include accumulative anomaly method, linear trend estimation, Mann-Kendall trend test and Morlet wavelet analysis. Results showed as following: (1) temperature has an obviously upward trend, but the differences between annual average temperature, annual average maximum temperature, and annual average minimum temperature are at little level. The trend in precipitation is not prominent in the period. The average values for the first 10 years of this century and the last 30 years are the chronological and period maximum. (2) The increase rate of temperature in spring is greatest during four seasons, and the significant is also the biggest. The increase rate of temperature in winter is greater than autumn, but the significant is reverse. Precipitation increases in summer and winter, but decrease in spring. (3) Mutation years of temperature and precipitation change were mainly in 1996-1998 and 2002-2004. (4) For period change, temperature and precipitation showed stable changes at a shorter time scale, such as 10 years or 2-3 years, and some longer scale period change for 30 years for mean average temperature. Overall, climate change over Nantong was consistent with other regions in China, and it also had its own unique features in some aspects. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The constant technological revolution offers opportunities for small farms not to be abandoned, thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). This technology allows them to continue to manage remotely using smartphones/tablets/laptops. This new system contributes to the mitigation of climate change from several aspects: reduction of water footprint and energy consumption (in the pumps that pressurize the grid, such as in the optimization of the proposed solution, by using batteries that communicate in low radiation of electric and magnetic alternating fields (LoRad), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), or narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), or clean energy). The analysis of these data and the incorporation of new IoT technologies facilitate the maintenance of green roofs and ensure the continuity of these farms. The direct benefit obtained is remarkable CO2 removal that prevents desertification by the abandonment of arable land. This communication shows the implementation of a Smart Agri system in areas with micro-plots (surface less than 0.5 ha) with low-cost technology based on long-range (LoRa) systems, easily maintainable by personnel with basic knowledge of automation, which transforms into a very interesting solution for regions with development roads. In addition, complex orography and difficult access are added in both physical and technological environments. The main technical limitations found in such plots are poor coverage for mobile phones and unworkable and expensive implementation by wiring or WiFi/radio systems. Currently, thanks to the Smart Agri system implemented in this WUA in Murcia, farmers can manage and control the irrigation systems in their plots from home. Then, they cannot lose their crops and respect the isolation conditions imposed by the Spanish government as a result of the alarm caused by COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

A negative temperature–size relationship (TSR) is claimed to be one of the universal responses to climatic warming. Studies on extant biota also predicted that groups with narrow latitudinal range, tropical affinity, and higher body size would show higher sensitivity to climatic fluctuation. To confirm the generality of these relationships among marine ectotherms, we compiled the data on body size and global temperature over the Cenozoic using a global database of marine molluscs of Class Gastropoda and Bivalvia. Molluscan species do not show any signature of TSR for any taxonomic, regional, or ecological category during the Cenozoic. We did not find any evidence supporting heightened response in groups with limited latitudinal spread or with large body size. The body-size response of tropical species is not different from those of temperate species. Response of infauna and epifauna does not show any difference either and hence, refutes the predicted variation due to difference in their thermal-specialisation. Our results highlight the limited validity of ‘universal rules’ in explaining the climate-induced morphological response of marine communities in deep time and underscore the complexity in generalising the biotic outcome of climatic fluctuation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bivalvia; body size; Climate change; ecological selectivity; Gastropoda; TSR (Temperature size relationshsip)","body size; Cenozoic; climate effect; community response; ectothermy; historical ecology; mollusc; morphology; Bivalvia; Gastropoda; Mollusca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059458999

This study evaluated source sensitivities and apportionments of ambient ozone and PM2:5 concentrations over Japan with multiple numerical techniques embedded in regional chemical transport models, including a brute-force method (BFM), a high-order decoupled direct method (HDDM), and an integrated source apportionment method (ISAM), to update the source receptor relationships considering stringent emission controls recently implemented in Japan and surrounding countries. We also attempted to understand the differences among source sensitivities and source apportionments calculated by multiple techniques. While a part of ozone concentrations was apportioned to domestic sources, their sensitivities were small or even negative; ozone concentrations were exclusively sensitive to transport from outside Japan. Although the simulated PM2:5 concentrations were significantly lower than those reported by previous studies, their sensitivity to transport from outside Japan was still relatively large, implying that there has been a reduction in Japanese emissions, similar to surrounding countries including China, due to implementation of stringent emission controls. HDDM allowed us to understand the importance of the non-linear responses of PM2:5 concentrations to precursor emissions. Apportionments derived by ISAM were useful in distinguishing various direct and indirect influences on ozone and PM2:5 concentrations by combining with sensitivities. The results indicate that ozone transported from outside Japan plays a key role in exerting various indirect influences on the formation of ozone and secondary PM2:5 components. While the sensitivities come closer to the apportionments when perturbations in emissions are larger in highly nonlinear relationships including those between NH3 emissions and NHC4concentrations, NOx emissions and NO3 concentrations, and NOx emissions and ozone concentrations the sensitivities did not reach the apportionments because there were various indirect influences including other sectors, complex photochemical reactions, and gas aerosol partitioning. It is essential to consider non-linear influences to derive strategies for effectively suppressing concentrations of secondary pollutants. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

A critical aspect to understanding and tuning these factors for optimal catalysis revolves around controlling the electronic environments of the primary and secondary coordination sphere. Herein we report a series of para-substituted cobalt aminopyridine macrocyclic catalysts 2-4 capable of carrying out the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. Under catalytic conditions, complexes 2-4, as well as the unsubstituted cobalt aminopyridine complex 1, exhibit icat/ip values ranging from 144 to 781. Complexes 2 and 4 exhibit a pronounced precatalytic wave suggestive of an ECEC mechanism. A Hammett analysis reveals that ligand modifications with electron-donating groups enhance catalysis (ρ < 0), indicative of positive charge buildup in the transition state. This trend also extends to the CoI/0 potential, where complexes possessing more negative E(CoI/0) reductions exhibit greater icat/ip values. The reported modifications offer a synthetic lever to tune catalytic activity, orthogonal to our previous study of the role of pendant hydrogen bond donors. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Hydrogen bonds; Pollution control; Carbon dioxide reduction; Catalytic conditions; Coordination sphere; Electrochemical reductions; Electron-donating group; Electronic environments; Hammett analysis; Hydrogen bond donors; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091324340

A symbolic representation of spatio-temporal PM2.5 features is the key to effective air pollution regulatory plans that notify the public to take necessary precautions against air pollution. The self-organizing map (SOM) can cluster high-dimensional datasets to form a meaningful topological map. This study implements the SOM to effectively extract and clearly distinguish the spatio-temporal features of long-term regional PM2.5 concentrations in a visible two-dimensional topological map. The spatial distribution of the configured topological map spans the long-term datasets of 25 monitoring stations in northern Taiwan using the Kriging method, and the temporal behavior of PM2.5 concentrations at various time scales (i.e., yearly, seasonal, and hourly) are explored in detail. Finally, we establish a machine learning model to predict PM2.5 concentrations for high pollution events. The analytical results indicate that: (1) high population density and heavy traffic load correspond to high PM2.5 concentrations; (2) the change of seasons brings obvious effects on PM2.5 concentration variation; and (3) the key input variables of the prediction model identified by the Gamma Test can improve model's reliability and accuracy for multi-step-ahead PM2.5 prediction.

CVT is associated with communication between trucks and in this paper, it is represented using route connectivity for trucks along a defined length of a freeway. The route connectivity is based on density of freight trucks with sensors exhibiting communication range as discs of known radii. The model is then applied over a 30-mile length of the interstate-710 (I-710) freeway of the Southern California Region to evaluate reductions in emissions. It is found that there is substantial decrease in emissions with decrease in number of trucks used up to establish communication connectivity through sensor transmission along the studied I-710 stretch. In fact, a decrease in emissions is noted with initial increase in sensor transmission radius from 1000 ft to 8000 ft. However, beyond the radius of 9000 ft, emissions reductions become almost constant.

Design/methodology/approach: Using the monthly data for the Green Indexes from the USA, the Europe and the Asia-Pacific region over 2003-2019, the authors construct TSM trading strategies to examine the efficacy of regional Green Indexes as well as two diversified global green portfolios to offer abnormal return to attract investors, particularly speculators. The authors’ explore further whether such strategies could operate as hedging instrument. A comparison of results across different regions helps the authors establish a universal nature, if any, of investment in green stocks. Findings: The study finds that regional Green Indexes are unable to outperform the market. The global green portfolios perform significantly better. The inefficacy of the relevant time series momentum trading strategies rules out the possibility of speculations. However, the number of profitable momentum strategies is significantly higher for the diversified portfolios in longer run. The portfolios perform significantly better in outperforming the buy-only strategies as well. The stable market, escalated demand and the resulting increment in valuation of green stocks make adoption of greener technologies a choice rather than a forced obligation. This offers a solution to the problem of Tragedy of Common. Originality/value: Sustained increase in investment in green stocks is crucial from an environment perspective, as better valuation of their stocks would indubitably convince firms to reduce their carbon footprints. A continued enthusiasm however would require investors’ faith in it.

Aircraft unique location in the upper atmosphere and daily growth of air-based traffic require particular attention to the effects of these emissions. One way to cope with this problem is to develop and design more efficient combustion systems. In this research, the numerical modelling of combustion process inside a jet engine combustion chamber is presented. The investigated chamber is a theoretical can type chamber mounted with a double stage radial swirler. The advanced k-zeta-f turbulence model was utilised to model the turbulent behaviour, while the spray process was described by the Euler Lagrangian spray modelling approach. Two different modelling approaches for describing the combustion process were employed: reduced chemical mechanism and the 3-zone extended coherent flame (ECFM-3Z) combustion model. Considering the analysis of relevant physical quantities and taking into account the reduction of computational costs while using the ECFM-3Z combustion model, it was employed for analysis of the influence of spray and emission processes by varying number and positioning of fuel introduction nozzle holes. Increase in the number of nozzle holes and their correct positioning can result in emission reduction up to 60%. Such behaviour could be addressed to the specific spray cloud formation and smaller high-temperature regions. Results showed that the presented model can be used as a modern design tool in the early stage of the combustion chamber development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CFD; Jet engine; Modelling; NOx emission","Chemical analysis; Emission control; Jet engines; Nitrogen oxides; Spray nozzles; Turbulence models; Upper atmosphere; Chemical mechanism; Combustion pro-cess; Computational costs; Efficient combustions; Emission reduction; High temperature; Land-based sources; Physical quantities; Combustion chambers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087288539

A low hydrogen partial pressure is required for LCFA degradation by anaerobic bacteria, requiring the establishment of syntrophic relationships with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. However, high LCFA loads can inhibit methanogens, hindering biodegradation. Because it has been suggested that anaerobic degradation of these compounds may be enhanced by the presence of alternative electron acceptors, such as iron, we investigated the effect of sub-stoichiometric amounts of Fe(III) on oleate (C18:1 LCFA) degradation by suspended and granular methanogenic sludge. Fe(III) accelerated oleate biodegradation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the assays with suspended sludge, with H2-consuming methanogens coexisting with iron-reducing bacteria. On the other hand, acetoclastic methanogenesis was delayed by Fe(III). These effects were less evident with granular sludge, possibly due to its higher initial methanogenic activity relative to suspended sludge. Enrichments with close-to-stoichiometric amounts of Fe(III) resulted in a microbial community mainly composed of Geobacter, Syntrophomonas, and Methanobacterium genera, with relative abundances of 83–89%, 3– 6%, and 0.2–10%, respectively. In these enrichments, oleate was biodegraded to acetate and coupled to iron-reduction and methane production, revealing novel microbial interactions between syntrophic LCFA-degrading bacteria, iron-reducing bacteria, and methanogens. © 2020 by the authors.

Projected changes in climate along with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration will affect future production of these crops. We evaluated maize and alfalfa yield and evapotranspiration response to CO2 enrichment predicted by three process-based cropping system models, CropSyst, DSSAT and IFSM, in six counties of Pennsylvania and New York, using 25 years of daily weather and two concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (350 and 550 ppm). Positive effects of CO2 enrichment on crop growth have been documented using plants grown under controlled CO2 conditions; of particular relevance are results obtained in fields with free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology. For evaluation, simulation results were compared among models and to FACE experimental data. The three models simulated similar maize response to increasing CO2 for grain yield, total biomass yield and harvest index, with predicted responses within the ranges reported in FACE experiments. The models may have slightly overestimated the yield response of maize during wet years compared with FACE experiments. The models also simulated increased productivity of alfalfa within the bounds observed in FACE experiments. While DSSAT and IFSM predicted yield increases of about 20%, Cropsyst predicted an increase of 32%, which is in the upper bound of FACE experimental data. For both crops, models simulated a lesser reduction in evapotranspiration under increasing CO2 than that measured in FACE experiments. The larger response of alfalfa may either shift rotations towards more alfalfa, or allow for a shorter alfalfa phase in a rotation depending on market and other production constraints. While there were overestimations in simulating maize productivity under no water stress and uncertainties in simulating evapotranspiration that are relevant for local and regional hydrology, these models adequately represented crop yield response to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agroecosystem models; Alfalfa; CO2; Crop yield; Evapotranspiration; Maize","alfalfa; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); evapotranspiration; maize; numerical model; simulation; uncertainty analysis; water stress; New York [United States]; United States; Medicago sativa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087022962

Comparatively few studies have, however, examined how such expert knowledge is translated back into the local contexts where projects are implemented. This article explores these processes of translation for the case of forest-based carbon offsetting using a case study of the Trees for Global Benefits project in Uganda. Based on successive fieldwork in two project regions, it examines how climate change, carbon, and carbon trading are understood by project participants and what work these understandings perform as part of the governance of carbon offsets. The article identifies a distinctive “rendering local” of project logics and rationale, which occurs in part as a management strategy by the project organizers and is in part the outcome of participants’ own articulations of offsetting concepts within the socioecological contexts in which they are embedded. Although these often unruly translations provide tensions and contradictions within the sociomaterial assemblage that constitutes the offset market, they also serve to facilitate project management. The dynamics identified here highlight the uneven geographies of environmental knowledge as instrumental to the governance of the offset market, therefore warranting closer attention by scholars studying carbon forestry and neoliberal environmentalism more generally. © 2020 The Author(s).

Sustainable development clashes with the transport sector because of the latter's high fossil fuels usage, consumption of natural resources and emission of pollutant and greenhouse gases. Electric mobility seems to be one of the best options to achieve both the sustainability goals and the mobility needs. This paper critically analysed weaknesses, strengths and application fields of electric mobility, proposing a real case application of an e-mobility bus fleet in Sorrento peninsula (Italy). The aim and the originality of this research was to propose a public transport design methodology based on a ""strong sustainability"" policy and applied to a real case study. To be precise, the renewing of the ""old"" bus fleet with a diesel plug-in hybrid one charged by a photovoltaic system was proposed, aiming to both improve environmental sustainability and perform an investment return for a private operator in managing the transport service. The proposed case study is particularly suitable because the peculiar morphology of the Sorrento peninsula in Italy does not allow other types of public transport services (e.g., rail, metro). Furthermore, this area, rich in UNESCO sites, has always been an international tourist destination because of the environment and landscape. Estimation results show that the new e-mobility bus service will be able to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions up to the 23%, with a financial payback period of 10 years for a private investor. © 2020 by the authors.","E-mobility; Electric vehicle; Environmental impacts; Local emissions; New technologies; Plug-in hybrid; Revenue-cost analysis; Strong sustainability; Sustainable mobility; Weak sustainability;MaaS","electric vehicle; natural resource; public transport; sustainability; sustainable development; tourist destination; transportation policy; UNESCO; Campania [Italy]; Italy; Napoli [Campania]; Sorrento Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090388695

However, a central feature of the IoT is that the implications of cyber (in)security are no longer abstract.

The resulting cooperation and coordination challenges are transboundary in nature, occur at multiple levels across sectors, between institutions, and will impact all actors, both public and private, in complex, often highly politicised ways.

In practice, however, planning, management and evaluation of urban green spaces are rarely structured and evidence-based. This represents a missed opportunity to account for, track and foster the multiple benefits that green spaces are expected to deliver. To gain insight into this gap, this study assesses the availability and uptake of relevant evidence by city governments. Interviews, focus groups and quantitative surveys were applied in four medium-sized European cities: Coimbra (Portugal), Genk (Belgium), Leipzig (Germany), and Vilnius (Lithuania), covering the main governance and climatic gradients in Europe. Using straightforward data exploration and regression, we analyse which ecological, economic and social indicators are typically chosen by cities and why. Together with the city stakeholders, we derived a common set of benefit categories and key performance indicators which can be adapted to diverse local contexts. We conclude that cities tend to make pragmatic decisions when composing their indicator sets, but nevertheless cover multiple urban green space dimensions. Finally, we explore how indicator choice could be optimised towards a complementary and credible indicator set, taking into account a realistically feasible monitoring effort undertaken by the cities. © 2020 The Author(s).

Protecting and, where appropriate, increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks across these rangelands can help to promote on-site and public ecosystem services including forage production and climate change mitigation. A necessary step toward appropriately and effectively stewarding SOC is understanding baseline variability in SOC stocks and identifying how that variability relates to factors such as climate, soil texture, and topography. While these relationships have been examined at broader spatial scales and in other contexts, analysis for California's rangelands remains lacking. We leveraged a voluntary ecological monitoring program consisting of 45 working ranches to explore how SOC varies with geographic distance, climate, vegetation, soil type, and topography within and across three regions of California. We found that there was large variability in soil C stocks across the state, with the Central Coast region storing more SOC than the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys. Network-wide, SOC stocks ranged from 4.83 to 63.54 Mg ha−1 for 0–10 cm depth and 12.15–205.37 Mg ha−1 for 0–40 cm depth. As hypothesized, climate was the strongest predictor of SOC stocks across the entire network, and in general other predictor groups became more important at the regional level. Within each region, we found on average a sixfold difference in SOC stocks, with much of the variation unexplained by the predictor variables included. While some differences in SOC likely result from unaccounted variables such as soil mineralogy, conceivably some of the variation is also due to differences in past and current land use—indicating that there is potential to rebuild SOC through management. © 2020 The Authors","Climate; Grazing lands; Mediterranean-type climate; Random Forest; Soil texture; Variation partitioning analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086863370

Quantifying ecosystem services and their interactions as dependent on cropland management can help to formulate a more effective and sustainable land use management system. However, current academic efforts and cropland management practices based on the perspective of ecosystem services bundles and tradeoffs remain limited, especially in developing countries. This paper aimed to integrate ecosystem services into cropland protection and functional zoning. Taking Cixi County in the Hangzhou Bay area, China, as the case study area, five typical ecosystem services (food supply, carbon sequestration, hydrological regulation, soil fertility and recreation potential) delivered by croplands and their correlations were quantitatively assessed. The results demonstrated a heterogeneous spatial pattern of multiple ecosystem services and diverse interactions between them, which depended on regional specific conditions and agricultural activities. Further, we adopted the framework of ecosystem services bundles as a planning tool to support the spatial strategy of cropland management. Cropland protection priority and functional zoning were determined by hotspot analysis and clustering algorithms, respectively. The croplands in Cixi were classified into three protection grades and a zoning scheme comprising four functional types with policy guidelines was proposed based on the spatial cluster results. The integrative approach used in this study is applicable to supplement the current cropland management actions by incorporating the perspective of ecosystem services tradeoff and bundles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cropland; Ecosystem services bundles; Functional zoning; Hangzhou Bay area; Tradeoff and synergy","agricultural land; ecosystem service; farming system; guideline; land management; management practice; quantitative analysis; sustainable development; China; Cixi; Hangzhou Bay; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085652227

Although a number of studies have explored the costs of creating a carbon sink, such an assessment is lacking for China's GHG Voluntary Emissions Reduction Program. This study develops an economic carbon sink costs measurement model for the Pinus elliottii afforestation project, based on the land opportunity cost method, which incorporates carbon sink transaction costs and leakage costs. From this, an empirical analysis on the carbon sink costs and its sensitivity factors was conducted. The results show that, firstly, the carbon sequestration costs of afforestation projects are generally high, ranging from 44.2 Yuan/tCO2e to 425.4 Yuan/tCO2e with and without considering the benefits of wood, respectively. This is higher than the current average carbon sink price of 20 Yuan/tCO2e. Secondly, forestry carbon sink transaction costs have a positive impact on carbon sequestration costs, but the impact is weak. Thirdly, carbon sequestration costs are negatively affected by timber prices but positively influenced by increasing labor prices and discount rate, which is not conductive to the development of carbon sink afforestation projects. In order to strengthen role of forestry in combating climate change, the study holds that the government departments should take measures to reduce carbon sink transaction costs, establish and improve the forestry carbon sink compensation mechanism in the future, and encourage wood-processing companies to make technological innovations to produce and sell durable wood products. The project owners can explore multiple operating models to increase their revenue, including market and non-market benefits, when the carbon sink afforestation project has been launched according to relevant methodologies. © 2020 by the authors.","Afforestation project; Carbon sink costs; China ghg voluntary emission reduction program; Forestry carbon sink; Land opportunity cost","Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Cost reduction; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Reforestation; Timber; Carbon sequestration; Compensation mechanism; Emission reduction programs; Emissions reduction; Government departments; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Opportunity cost methods; Technological innovation; Cost benefit analysis; afforestation; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; coniferous forest; cost analysis; emission control; forestry; greenhouse gas; quantitative analysis; Carbon; China; Commerce; Cost Control; Greenhouse Gases; Reforestation; China; Jiangxi; Pinus elliottii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091062155

Previous MSAP results showed that the occurrence of PaWB related to changes of DNA methylation level; however, the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression remains obscure in paulownia. Therefore, in the present study, we applied WGBS and RNA-seq techniques to investigate the DNA methylation and gene expression changes between healthy Paulownia fortunei seedlings and the phytoplasma-infected ones. A map of methylated cytosines at the single base pair resolution of paulownia was constructed. Compared to the healthy seedlings, the DNA methylation level increased after phytoplasma infection, and the change of mCHH was the main methylation pattern. DMR analysis showed that 422,662 DMRs in the genome were identified, in which, 27,871 DMR-associated genes were differentially expressed. Finally, 436 genes with significant differences in their methylation levels and mRNA expression profiles were identified through integrated analysis of the DNA methylomic and transcriptomic. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these genes are mainly involved in plant hormone signal transduction, carbon metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. Two of DMR-associated genes were verified by BS- PCR. Finally, we selected TRP 1 and R2R3-MYB protein were closely related to the occurrence of PaWB.

China's Loess Plateau (CLP) has been experiencing climatic warming in recent decades and large-scale revegetation since the early 2000s. Understanding the combined effects of revegetation and climate change on ecosystem WUE patterns is important for a better prediction of future changes of the water and carbon cycles in the region. In this study, we decompose ecosystem WUE into a two-component process, i.e., the ratio of carbon uptake to plant transpiration, GPP/T, and the ratio of plant transpiration to total evapotranspiration, T/ET. Based on this, we investigate the temporal variations of ecosystem WUE and examine the underlying controls of WUE dynamics on CLP during 1985–2015. We find that ecosystem WUE on CLP remains more or less unchanged during 1985–1999 as a result of an increased T/ET that is largely offset by a decreased GPP/T induced by increases in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. In comparison, ecosystem WUE significantly increases during 2000–2015, owing to the increased leaf area index, which promotes the fraction of plant transpiration over total ET (i.e., T/ET). In facing the upcoming peak of greenness and continuing climate warming, our results suggest that CLP's ecosystem WUE may experience a downward trend in the future due to diminishing positive effects of leaf area index but increasing negative effects of atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. Our study highlights the importance of decomposing ecosystem WUE into component processes to better understand the mechanisms that underlying the changes of ecosystem WUE and to predict future ecosystem WUE dynamics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Loess plateau; Revegetation; Temporal dynamics; Water use efficiency","atmospheric pressure; biotic factor; climate change; evapotranspiration; leaf area index; net primary production; transpiration; vapor pressure; water use efficiency; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087520582

Distribution is a special and comprehensive form of activity in the logistics system, which is a close combination of logistics and business flow. Distribution is the process of allocating goods at the distribution center or other logistics nodes according to the requirements of the customer and handing them to the customer in the most reasonable way. After the economic work conference of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the government and enterprises put green and low carbon in a more important position, and industries such as urban construction and traditional manufacturing need to think about how to become greener, especially for the logistics and transportation industry. Based on this research background, the paper developed an intelligent vehicle scheduling system. Based on the summarization of a large number of applications at home and abroad, from the two aspects of the vehicle routing problem model and solution algorithm, the domestic and foreign research status of the vehicle routing problem is deeply analysed. According to different factors, the vehicle routing problem is based on the basic model and the derivative model.

So far, the work undertaken by the WIM Executive Committee (ExCom) has focused on enhancing understanding and awareness of the issue and promoting collaboration with relevant stakeholders. Delivering on the WIM's third function on action and support has lagged behind, and ‘the political’ nature of L&D has often been blamed for this. Key terrains of contention among Parties have included the positioning of L&D governance vis-à-vis the adaptation space and struggles around state liability and compensation. As a way to facilitate discussion on implementation options, recent research has suggested de-politicising aspects of the L&D debate; yet we have very little insight into how the politics are understood within the realm of international L&D governance. This paper brings an analysis of ‘the political’ into the picture by identifying the complex and underlying issues that fuel contention within UNFCCC L&D negotiations. It gives centre stage to the way different framings of norms and material interests affect the debate, and challenges the tendency in current L&D literature to overlook the socio-historical and political underpinnings of this area of policy-making. We employ a qualitative multi-methods research design which draws on content analysis of 138 official Parties’ submissions and statements, 14 elite interviews with key current and former L&D negotiators and is built on a foundation of 3 years of participant observation at COPs and WIM meetings. We approach this data with a political ethnographic sensibility that seeks to explore how meanings are constructed within and across different sources of data. Our empirical results show that, rather than being a monolithic dispute, L&D catalyses different yet intertwined unresolved discussions. We identify five areas of contention, including continued disputes around compensation; conflicts on the legitimacy of L&D as a third pillar of climate action; tensions between the technical and political dimension of the debate; debates over accountability for losses and damages incurred; and the connection of L&D with other unresolved issues under the Convention. © 2020","International relations; Loss and damage; Multi-methods; Negotiations; Political ethnography; Politics; UNFCCC","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; compensation system; conference proceeding; empirical analysis; liability; political discourse; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Mazowieckie; Poland [Central Europe]; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089425200

However, the spatial patterns of litter turnover time and its interrelation with these variables are rarely quantified. With a database of 1,378 litter turnover times and key associated climate, litter quality and soil properties (total of 20 variables), this study investigated the driving factors and spatial patterns of litter turnover time across Chinese terrestrial ecosystems. The mean litter turnover time was the longest in forest ecosystems, followed by that in grassland and cropland ecosystems. The litter turnover time varied significantly depending on the litter quality and climate zone, and increased exponentially as latitude increased. Mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) could accurately predict litter turnover time via negative exponential equations. Among these variables, MAT had the greatest influence on litter turnover time, which accounted for 37.4% of the variation, followed by litter quality (ecosystem types, litter types, C:N of litter and lignin content; 33.4%) and soil properties (sand content, soil pH and soil organic carbon (SOC); 29.2%) based on a boosted regression tree (BRT) model. Path analysis identified that MAT negatively affected litter turnover time both directly and indirectly through regulating soil properties and litter quality, which positively and directly affected litter turnover time. Finally, the spatial patterns of litter turnover time were obtained with a regional dataset of ecosystem types, MAT, sand content, soil pH and SOC as BRT model drivers. Overall, our results suggest that climate variables have contrasting effects on litter turnover time and could mediate the impact on litter turnover time by litter quality and soil properties. These results highlight important implications for climate-smart soil management and can be used to create reliable model predictions. Highlights: We explored the driving factors and spatial patterns of litter turnover time in various ecosystems Accurate estimates of litter turnover time were obtained from dataset from 1,378 experimental sites Litter turnover time exponentially increased as latitude increased Climate-mediated litter quality and soil properties controlled the litter turnover time. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","climate; litter quality; litter turnover time; soil property; terrestrial ecosystems","agricultural ecosystem; air temperature; forest ecosystem; grassland; lignin; litter; precipitation (climatology); regression analysis; spatial analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078030049

The magnitude of this flux could increase with permafrost thaw but might also be mitigated by microbial CH4 oxidation. Methane oxidation in oxic water has been extensively studied, while the contribution of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) to CH4 mitigation is not fully understood. We have investigated four Northern Siberian stratified lakes in an area of discontinuous permafrost nearby Igarka, Russia. Analyses of CH4 concentrations in the water column demonstrated that 60 to 100% of upward diffusing CH4 was oxidized in the anoxic layers of the four lakes. A combination of pmoA and mcrA gene qPCR and 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding showed that the same taxa, all within Methylomonadaceae and including the predominant genus Methylobacter as well as Crenothrix, could be the major methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) in the anoxic water of the four lakes. Correlation between Methylomonadaceae and OTUs within Methylotenera, Geothrix and Geobacter genera indicated that AOM might occur in an interaction between MOB, denitrifiers and iron-cycling partners. We conclude that MOB within Methylomonadaceae could have a crucial impact on CH4 cycling in these Siberian Arctic lakes by mitigating the majority of produced CH4 before it leaves the anoxic zone. This finding emphasizes the importance of AOM by Methylomonadaceae and extends our knowledge about CH4 cycle in lakes, a crucial component of the global CH4 cycle. © 2020","Anaerobic oxidation of methane; Arctic; Methanotroph; Methylobacter; Methylomonadaceae; Permafrost","Genes; Lakes; Methane; Oxidation; Permafrost; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Anaerobic oxidation of methanes; Anoxic layers; CH4 oxidation; Discontinuous permafrost; Methane oxidation; Methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB); Permafrost thaws; Stratified lakes; Anoxic water; lake water; methane; methane; RNA 16S; water; anoxic conditions; arctic environment; lake water; methane; microbial activity; oxic conditions; oxidation; permafrost; water quality; 16S rRNA gene; anaerobic metabolism; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial microbiome; bacterial strain; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); DNA barcoding; Geobacter; Geothrix; iron metabolism; lake ecosystem; mcrA gene; methane oxidizing bacterium; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylococcaceae; Methylotenera; microbial interaction; nonhuman; permafrost; pmoA gene; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; Russian Federation; taxonomy; anaerobic growth; Arctic; lake; microflora; oxidation reduction reaction; Igarka; Krasnoyarsk [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation; Siberia; Geobacter; Geothrix; Methylobacter; Methylotenera; Otus; Anaerobiosis; Arctic Regions; Lakes; Methane; Microbiota; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Russia; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085577166

We examined the impact of different air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, ozone, and SO2) on admission for all strokes in two Irish urban centres from 2013 to 2017. Methods: Using an ecological time series design with Poisson regression models, we analysed daily hospitalisation for all strokes and is-chaemic stroke by residence in Dublin or Cork, with air pollution level monitoring data with a lag of 0-2 days from exposure. Splines of temperature, relative humidity, day of the week, and time were included as confounders. Analysis was also performed across all four seasons. Data are presented as relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in each pollutant. Results: There was no significant association between all stroke admission and any individual air pollutant. On seasonal analysis, during winter in the larger urban centre (Dublin), we found an association between all stroke cases and an IQR increase in NO2 (RR 1.035, 95% CI: 1.003-1.069), PM10 (RR 1.032, 95% CI: 1.007-1.057), PM2.5 (RR 1.024, 95% CI: 1.011-1.039), and SO2 (RR 1.035, 95% CI: 1.001-1.071). There was no significant association found in the smaller urban area of Cork. On meta-analysis, there remained a significant association between NO2 (RR 1.013, 95% CI: 1.001-1.024) and PM2.5 (1.009, 95% CI 1.004-1.014) per IQR increase in each. Discussion: Short-term air pollution in winter was found to be associated with hospitalisation for all strokes in a large urban centre in Ireland. As Ireland has relatively low air pollution internationally, this highlights the need to introduce policy changes to reduce air pollution in all countries. © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

The purpose of PCC was to take a regional approach to issues such as climate change, environmental protection, and trade to mention a few issues. In 2013, PCC signed the Pacific Coast Action Plan on Climate and Energy, which was updated in 2016 with the Pacific Coast Climate Leadership Action Plan. Because the plan relies on public support and participation to achieve the goals of reducing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, an analysis of public beliefs about climate change is warranted. In addition, one potential renewable energy source that has been promoted for a clean energy source is wave energy. Using household public survey data conducted in the PCC, this study examines climate change beliefs and their impact on familiarity with, and support for, wave energy on the Pacific Coast. Study results suggest majorities of respondents in B.C. and the Pacific Coast states believe that the earth is getting warmer, and that it is mostly caused by human activities. In addition, those BC and U.S. respondents who believe in human-caused global warming are significantly more likely than nonbelievers to be familiar with wave energy technology and to have a positive attitude toward wave energy. However, when asked about a hypothetical trade-off between wave and tidal energy and potential harm to whales, those respondents believing in human-caused climate change are significantly more likely than non-believers to support the protection of whales over wave and tidal energy. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To create three different forecasting methods targeting the direct effect of aerosols on radiation, we use three different types of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data: (1) the Tegen aerosol climatology, (2) the persistence of measured AERONET AOD, and (3) the Goddard Earth Observing System model version 5 (GEOS-5) gridded forecasts of AOD. We evaluate each method at the Solana Generating Station, a concentrating solar power plant near Gila Bend, Arizona, and the University of Arizona, Tucson. We perform a retrospective DNI forecast analysis and find that including GEOS-5 forecast AOD improved the DNI forecast compared to using an aerosol climatology at both locations. At Tucson, where AOD is measured, we find that the persistence of measured AOD gives the best DNI forecast. However, the accuracy of that measured AOD reduces when translating it 225 km to Solana to forecast DNI 48 hours later. We then include the GEOS-5 AOD forecasts in one member of an operational forecast system and evaluate it against the other ensemble members that use the aerosol climatology. In clear-sky conditions, including GEOS-5 forecast AOD instead of the Tegen aerosol climatology, reduces the DNI forecast root mean square error by 27% at Solana. We found no significant differences during all-sky conditions because the relatively poor performance during cloudy conditions outweighs the improvements made in clear-sky conditions. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Aerosols; Climatology; Electric substations; Mean square error; Optical properties; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Aerosol optical depths; Concentrating solar power plant; Direct normal irradiances; Forecasting modeling; Goddard earth observing systems; Operational forecast system; Root mean square errors; University of Arizona; Weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094097539

Mining activities are always accompanied by environmental pollution, negatively affecting public health. To accurately assess the level of pollution, as well as quantify the effect of air pollution on human health, a number of structures, methods, and models provide tools to assess the benefits of this control for public health and related economic values. However, there has been no research in Vietnam applied specifically to this type of stone exploitation. This study offers a model to evaluate the economic damage caused by dust exposure from activities related to quarrying, overcoming the lack of continuous monitoring data.

Plant–microbe interactions are an understudied but potentially important factor governing plant range shifts. We studied the distribution and function of microbes present in high-elevation unvegetated soils, areas that plants are colonizing as climate warms, snow melts earlier, and the summer growing season lengthens. Using a manipulative snowpack and microbial inoculation transplant experiment, we tested the hypothesis that growing-season length and microbial community composition interact to control plant elevational range shifts. We predicted that a lengthening growing season combined with dispersal to patches of soils with more mutualistic microbes and fewer pathogenic microbes would facilitate plant survival and growth in previously unvegetated areas. We identified negative effects on survival of the common alpine bunchgrass Deschampsia cespitosa in both short and long growing seasons, suggesting an optimal growing-season length for plant survival in this system that balances time for growth with soil moisture levels. Importantly, growing-season length and microbes interacted to affect plant survival and growth, such that microbial community composition increased in importance in suboptimal growing-season lengths. Further, plants grown with microbes from unvegetated soils grew as well or better than plants grown with microbes from vegetated soils. These results suggest that the rate and spatial extent of plant colonization of unvegetated soils in mountainous areas experiencing climate change could depend on both growing-season length and soil microbial community composition, with microbes potentially playing more important roles as growing seasons lengthen. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","alpine plants; biotic interactions; climate change; plant–microbe interactions; range shifts","climate change; colonization; community composition; generalist; grass; growing season; inoculation; microbial community; performance assessment; snowpack; soil microorganism; soil moisture; survival; Deschampsia cespitosa; climate change; microbiology; plant; season; soil; Climate Change; Plants; Seasons; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086092801

The results show that facilitated access to capital makes investments in sustainable technologies more attractive for all firms, especially for small and medium enterprises. Without policy instruments such as carbon price, the decrease in emissions in the long-term is due to investments in natural gas-based technologies, as they typically have lower capital and operating costs, and also lower electricity consumption than coal-based production. Conversely, with policy instruments in place, a strong decrease in emissions occurs between 2060 and 2080 due to investors choosing natural gas and biomethane-based technologies, with carbon capture and storage. In the long term, natural gas and biomethane could compete, with the outcome depending on infrastructure, supply chain availability and land use constraints. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent -based modelling; Ammonia manufacturing; Energy systems modelling; Net-zero emissions","Ammonia; Autonomous agents; Carbon capture; Chemical industry; Coal industry; Computational methods; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Land use; Natural gas; Operating costs; Simulation platform; Supply chains; Agent-based modelling; Capital and operating costs; Electricity-consumption; Haber-Bosch process; Industrial enterprise; Investment decisions; Small and medium enterprise; Sustainable technology; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084943269

Palmer amaranth was controlled 100% by dicamba + glyphosate fb glufosinate and 2,4-D + glufosinate fb glufosinate 7 DAIT in 2018. However, herbicide performance was reduced due to delayed application and taller plants in 2019 with up to 23% less visual injury. To further investigate Palmer amaranth response to dicamba and glufosinate applied sequentially, a greenhouse study was conducted in 2019 where physiological measurements were recorded over a 35-day period. Treatments were applied to Palmer amaranth averaging 38 cm tall and included dicamba + glyphosate fb glufosinate 7 DAIT, the reverse sequence, and a single application of dicamba + glufosinate + glyphosate. Glufosinate severely inhibited mid-day photosynthesis compared to dicamba with up to 90% reductions in CO2 assimilation 1 DAIT. In general, Palmer amaranth respiration and stomatal conductance were not affected by herbicides in this study. Applications of dicamba + glyphosate fb glufosinate 7 DAIT was the only treatment hindered Palmer amaranth regrowth with 52% reduction in leaf biomass compared to nontreated control. These data suggest Palmer amaranth infested fields are more likely to be rescued with sequential applications of synthetic auxins and glufosinate, but consistent control of large Palmer is not probable. © 2020 by the authors.

Our results show that population-weighted exposure to locally defined extreme heat (i.e., ""population heat exposure"") would increase by a factor of 12.7-29.5 under a high-intensity greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and urban development pathway. Additionally, end -of-century population cold exposure is projected to rise by a factor of 1.3-2.2, relative to start-of-century population cold exposure. We identify specific metropolitan regions in which population heat exposure would increase most markedly and characterize the relative significance of various drivers responsible for this increase. The largest absolute changes in population heat exposure during the 21st century are projected to occur in major US metropolitan regions like New York City (NY), Los Angeles (CA), Atlanta (GA), and Washington DC. The largest relative changes in population heat exposure (i.e., changes relative to start-of-century) are projected to occur in rapidly growing cities across the US Sunbelt, for example Orlando (FL), Austin (TX), Miami (FL), and Atlanta. The surge in population heat exposure across the Sunbelt is driven by concurrent GHGinduced warming and population growth which, in tandem, could strongly compound population heat exposure.

Karst) on lands in various states of natural transition to a forest dominated by deciduous broadleaved tree species. Given the aspiration to bring emissions on balance with removals in the latter half of the 21st century in effort to limit the global mean temperature rise to “well below” 2°C, the effectiveness of such a policy is unclear given relatively low spruce growth rates in the region. Further convoluting the picture is the magnitude and relevance of surface albedo changes linked to such projects, which typically counteract the benefits of an enhanced forest CO2 sink in high-latitude regions. Here, we carry out a rigorous empirically based assessment of the terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) potential of large-scale spruce planting in Norway, taking into account transient developments in both terrestrial carbon sinks and surface albedo over the 21st century and beyond. We find that surface albedo changes would likely play a negligible role in counteracting tCDR, yet given low forest growth rates in the region, notable tCDR benefits from such projects would not be realized until the second half of the 21st century, with maximum benefits occurring even later around 2150. We estimate Norway's total accumulated tCDR potential at 2100 and 2150 (including surface albedo changes) to be 447 (±240) and 852 (±295) Mt CO2-eq. at mean net present values of US$ 12 (±3) and US$ 13 (±2) per ton CDR, respectively. For perspective, the accumulated tCDR potential at 2100 represents around 8 years of Norway's total current annual production-based (i.e., territorial) CO2-eq. emissions. © 2020 The Authors.

Resistance to a reduction in coal production and consumption comes from various actors, namely, coal corporations, unions, parts of civil society and the government – as well as their coalitions. Their opposition centres around the prospect of losing their business, past negative experiences with structural change, fears of rising energy prices and energy security concerns, as well as potential unemployment in regions almost entirely dependent on coal. This paper identifies key political and economic drivers and barriers of a reduction in coal production and consumption in Poland using the Triple Embeddedness Framework. Uneconomic coal mining, unavoidable energy infrastructure investments, rising air pollution levels and pressure from the European Union might provide new political momentum for a shift away from coal in line with international climate targets. However, results show that to achieve political feasibility, policies targeting a reduction in coal production and use need to be implemented jointly with social and structural policy measures, addressing a just transition for the affected regions in line with the vision of a ‘European Green Deal’. © 2020 The Authors","Coal phase-out; Energy transition; Poland; Political economy; Political feasibility; Triple embeddedness framework","Coal; Economics; Energy security; Investments; Climate targets; Coal production; Energy infrastructures; European union; Negative experiences; Policy measures; Political economy; Pollution level; Coal industry; coal; coal production; electricity generation; energy policy; European Union; fossil fuel; lignite; political economy; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089404385

The feedback between plants and their local environment throughout the whole spectrum soil-root-shoot-environment is crucial to accurately describe and evaluate the impact of environmental changes on plant development. This study presents a 3D functional structural plant model, in which shoot and root growth are driven by radiative transfer, photosynthesis, and soil hydrodynamics through different parameterisation schemes relating soil water deficit and carbon assimilation. The new coupled model is used to evaluate the impact of soil moisture availability on plant productivity for two different groups of flowering plants under different spatial configurations. Methods: In order to address different aspects of plant development due to limited soil water availability, a 3D FSP model including root, shoot, and soil was constructed by linking three different well-stablished models of airborne plant, root architecture, and reactive transport in the soil. Different parameterisation schemes were used in order to integrate photosynthetic rate with root water uptake within the coupled model. The behaviour of the model was assessed on how the growth of two different types of plants, i.e. monocot and dicot, is impacted by soil water deficit under different competitive conditions: isolated (no competition), intra, and interspecific competition. Key Results: The model proved to be capable of simulating carbon assimilation and plant development under different growing settings including isolated monocots and dicots, intra, and interspecific competition. The model predicted that (1) soil water availability has a larger impact on photosynthesis than on carbon allocation; (2) soil water deficit has an impact on root and shoot biomass production by up to 90 % for monocots and 50 % for dicots; and (3) the improved dicot biomass production in interspecific competition was highly related to root depth and plant transpiration. Conclusions: An integrated model of 3D shoot architecture and biomass development with a 3D root system representation, including light limitation and water uptake considering soil hydraulics, was presented. Plant-plant competition and regulation on stomatal conductance to drought were able to be predicted by the model. In the cases evaluated here, water limitation impacted plant growth almost 10 times more than the light environment. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Design/methodology/approach: Multifractal de-trended cross-correlation technique is used for this analysis based on the relevant literature. In addition, it is the most widely used approach to estimate multifractality because it generates robust empirical results against non-stationarities in the time series. Findings: It is revealed that industrial production causes long and short term environmental costs. The OECD IPI and atmospheric carbon emissions were found to have a strong correlation between the time domain. However, this relationship does not mostly take into account the frequency-based correlations with the tail effects caused by shocks that are effective on the economy. In this study, the long-term dependence of the relationship between the OECD IPI and atmospheric carbon emissions differs from the correlation obtained by linear methods, as the analysis is based on the frequency. The major finding is that the Hurst coefficient is in the range 0.40-0.75 indicating. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the local singular behavior of the time-series is analyzed to test for the multifractality characteristics of the series. In this context, the scaling exponents and the singularity spectrum are obtained to determine the origins of this multifractality. The multifractal time series are defined as the set of points with a given singularity exponent a where this exponent a is illustrated as a fractal with fractal dimension f(α). Therefore, the multifractality term indicates the existence of fluctuations, which are non-uniform and more importantly, their relative frequencies are also scale-dependent. Practical implications: The results provide information based on the fluctuation in IPI, which determines the main conjuncture of the economy. An optimal strategy for shaping the consequences of climate change resulting from industrial production activities will not only need to be quite comprehensive and global in scale but also policies will need to be applicable to the national and local conditions of the given nation and adaptable to the needs of the country. Social implications: The results provide information for the analysis of the environmental cost of climate change depending on the magnitude of the impact on the total supply. In addition to environmental problems, climate change leads to economic problems, and hence, policy instruments are introduced to fight against the adverse effects of it. Originality/value: This study may be of practical and technical importance in regional climate change forecasting, extreme carbon emission regulations and industrial production resource management in the world economy. Hence, the major contribution of this study is to introduce an approach to sustainability for the analysis of the environmental cost of growth in the supply side economy. © 2020, Sezer Bozkus Kahyaoglu, Hakan Kahyaoglu and Atahirou Mahamane Mahamane Lawali.","Climate change; Environmental Kuznets curve; Industrial production index; Multifractal detrended cross-correlation","carbon emission; correlation; empirical analysis; environmental economics; environmental issue; fractal analysis; industrial production; sustainability; time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082930624

The framework accounts for the energy and emissions arising from the operation of the building, the materials needed to build it, and the transportation of the residents. This provides a novel means to compare the impact of urban form on both building-related and transport-related emissions simultaneously. The building analysis performs detailed building energy simulations and embodied energy calculations. The transportation analysis estimates emissions reductions from eliminating personal vehicle trips through the mixed-use nature of the building, provision of an electric vehicle car sharing fleet, and a public transit hub with a rapid transit line. The framework is used to assess the new concept, referred to as a ‘Mothership’, which provides a potential holistic solution to urban sprawl through high-density mixed-use development that meets the needs of 10,000 people. It includes a high-performance building envelope, advanced energy systems, a public transportation hub and electric car sharing fleet. The analysis compares this method of development to the ‘urban sprawl’ that has characterized new development in North America. The comparison is performed for two case studies in British Columbia, Canada. Results show that the Mothership could reduce operational and embodied emissions by 73% and transportation emissions by 58% compared to low-density suburban development. A key takeaway is that transportation and embodied emissions become much more significant as operational emissions are reduced through high performance building design and clean electricity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building emissions; Building energy simulation; Emissions reduction; Transportation emissions; Urban design; Urban modeling","Advanced public transportation systems; Architectural design; Electric lines; Fleet operations; Materials handling; Rapid transit; Regional planning; Urban growth; Advanced energy systems; British Columbia , Canada; Building energy simulations; Energy and emissions; High performance buildings; Public transportation; Suburban development; Transportation analysis; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083109556

The associated emissions may partly counteract efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure. We have developed an approach for assessing methane leakage from marine decommissioned wells based on a combination of existing regional industrial seismic and newly acquired hydroacoustic water column imaging data from the Central North Sea. Here, we present hydroacoustic data which show that 28 out of 43 investigated wells release gas from the seafloor into the water column. This gas release largely depends on the presence of shallow gas accumulations and their distance to the wells. The released gas is likely primarily biogenic methane from shallow sources. In the upper 1,000 m below the seabed, gas migration is likely focused along drilling-induced fractures around the borehole or through non-sealing barriers. Combining available direct measurements for methane release from marine decommissioned wells with our leakage analysis suggests that gas release from investigated decommissioned hydrocarbon wells is a major source of methane in the North Sea (0.9-3.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.7-4.2] kt yr−1 of CH4 for 1,792 wells in the UK sector of the Central North Sea). This means hydrocarbon gas emissions associated with marine hydrocarbon wells are not significant for the global greenhouse gas budget, but have to be considered when compiling regional methane budgets. © 2020 The Authors","Central North Sea; decommissioned wells; Methane leakage; methane quantification; Seismic data; Water column imaging data; well integrity","Budget control; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Methane; Confidence interval; Direct measurement; Fossil-fuel infrastructures; Hydrocarbon-gas emissions; Leakage detection; Marine hydrocarbons; Mitigation strategy; Oil and gas provinces; Gas emissions; detection method; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; mitigation; seafloor; water column; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089081124

However environmental impacts of a possible CO2 seepage on bacterial community are lacking knowledge. This work addressed potential consequences on bacterial communities from Snøvit region in Barents Sea sediments. Long-term experiment (92 days) was carried out mimicking realistic conditions of pressure (∼30 bars) using the unique hyperbaric chamber (Karl Erik TiTank). The experiment was divided in three stages: i) 21 days of no CO2, ii) 50 days of simulation of carbon dioxide leakage (depletion of pH to 7.0) and iii) 14 days emulating a leakage cessation. Results suggested that bacterial communities can adapt to a CO2 leakage in short term. However, bacteria showed negative effects in terms of activity, community structure, and number of cells after long term CO2 exposure. After CO2 leakage cessation, bacterial communities did not show a significant recovery. These findings highlighted that, even though marine bacteria showed adaptation to the new conditions (acidified environment), in case of a small but continuous CO2 leakage marine bacteria might not be recovered upon pre-exposure status. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Climate change mitigation; High pressure; Impact; Microorganism alterations","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chemical resistance; Climate change; Environmental impact; Bacterial community; Carbon dioxide leakage; Carbon reservoirs; Climate change mitigation; Community structures; Long-term experiments; Marine bacterium; Realistic conditions; Bacteria; carbon dioxide; bacterium; carbon dioxide; community structure; experimental study; hydrocarbon reservoir; leakage; marine sediment; microbial community; acidification; adaptation; Article; bacterial cell; carbon footprint; carbon storage; community structure; marine bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; nonhuman; Norway; pressure; sea; sediment; bacterium; sediment; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Geologic Sediments; Oceans and Seas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087383385

This process shares a common issue with other redox reactions involved in energy-related schemes (i.e., proton reduction to hydrogen and water oxidation to oxygen), that is, the need for a catalyst in order to proceed at sustainable rates. Moreover, the reduction of CO2 faces an additional selectivity complication, since several products can be formed, including carbon monoxide, formic acid/formate, methanol, and methane. In this Mini-Review, we will discuss iron-based molecular catalysts that catalyze the reduction of CO2, focusing in particular on the selectivity of the processes, which is rationalized and guided on the basis of the reaction mechanism. Inspired by the active sites of carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, several synthetic systems have been proposed for the reduction of CO2; these are discussed in terms of key intermediates such as iron hydrides or Fe-CO2 adducts, where the ligand coordination motif, together with the presence of co-additives such as Brønsted acids, nucleophiles, or CO2 trapping moieties, can guide the selectivity of the reaction. A mechanistic comparison is traced with heterogeneous iron single-atom catalysts. Perspectives on the use of molecular catalysts in devices for sustainable reduction of CO2 are finally given.

In a rush to electrify their model ranges, global carmakers are investing heavily on developing new electrified powertrains. Within this context, this work focuses on the analysis of electric axles drives (eAxles) for a BEV (battery electric vehicle) sport car, with the aim to develop an analytical tool useful to perform predictive analysis in the concept design phase. Through a parametric definition of the procedure, the tool is able to ""adapt""to any drivetrain layout analysed. The tool actually allows to enter more than 100 input values including lubrication conditions (oil viscosity and operating temperature), gears (number, macrogeometry, mesh), bearings (number, type, geometry, mounting layout, angle mesh), shafts, oil seals, external layout and external fluid conditions. The tool allows to calculate efficiency matrices of the drivetrain system (both total matrices and single component matrices) for any desired set of speed, torque and temperature under steady state conditions. Moreover, the tool can be used to efficiently analyse different cooling concepts (oil bath, wet-sump, and dry-sump system) in order to define the correct choice of pump and intercooler, thus ensuring a proper lubrication and cooling of the gearbox and electric motor. Consequently, the tool allows to determine the optimal design of the whole ePowertrain in compliance with requested key performance indicators, such as efficiency, performance, packaging and cost. Effectiveness of the tool has been verified by applying it to an industrial application, namely a single speed and cascade of gears transmission, which had already been bench-tested. The efficiency matrices obtained analytically with the tool perfectly matched those obtained by bench testing the transmission, with an average deviation of less than 1%. © 2020SAE International.

Even though various technologies exist to exploit solar thermal energy in low-carbon processes, the use of solar thermal energy in the industry sector is currently minimal. The main obstacles are modeling an optimal integration and identifying its energy potential, economic feasibility and environmental benefits. The novelty of this study is the modeling of an integration of solar heat for an industrial process located in a topographically complex territory such as the Alps using the software Dymola – Dassault Systems®. The methodology proposed is structured in several steps: (I) industrial process characterization; (II) collection of local hourly data for radiation and climatic temperature; (III) study of the position of sun and components of incident angle; (IV) comparison among three solar technologies (CPC, LFR, PTC), in terms of efficiency, IAM and heat production; (V) focus on PTC: sizing of HTF, mass flow rate, HEX; (VI) focus on PTC: dynamic modeling with Dymola – Dassault Systems® (HTF temperature, solar heat, solar fraction); (VII) economic and environmental impact. In this paper, the case study of a pasta factory called “Felicetti”, located in the north-east of the Italian Alps, has been considered in order to investigate and evaluate the possibility of supplying solar heat for the drying process. The days of a week in June, exhibiting variable DNI, are used to demonstrate the dynamics and robust integration of the solar heat in the industrial process of pasta drying. The dynamic modelling results show that the PTC solar field can guarantee 23% of weekly energy coverage saving about 4.7 CO2/week.

Because the functional traits of plants influence the performance of individuals under different environmental conditions, we aimed to describe the functional traits of the most frequent tree species found in the Brazilian Mixed Subtropical Forest. We also aimed to test whether functional traits could be used to predict the impact of climate change on the future distribution of tree species. For selected species, certain functional traits were described, namely, wood density, leaf size, specific leaf area, leaf renovation regime, dispersal syndrome, maximum potential height, fruit type, presence of seed dormancy, and the desiccation tolerance of seeds. The geographical distributions of the selected species were modeled using the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) as a function of climatic variation. To predict the impact of climatic changes by 2070 relative to current climate, the best and worst scenarios in relation to the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) were used. While the best scenario assumes a strong reduction in GHG anthropogenic emissions, turning negative by 2070, the worst scenario assumes a continuous increase in GHG anthropogenic emissions over time. The functional traits were ordinated by Principal Components Analysis to identify the ecological strategies of each species. The relationship between functional traits and changes to the area of climatic suitability of each species was evaluated using regression trees. Functional traits predicted changes to suitable climatic areas in the worst-case scenario only. The suitable climatic area of more leathery leaf species was predicted to decline by 41.0% on average, whereas that of more membranous leaf species was predicted to decline by 14.0%. In particular, Araucaria angustifolia, which is considered the most representative species of the Mixed Subtropical Forest of Brazil, had the highest sensitivity to climate change. Consequently, our results suggest that this important forest formation will be strongly impacted by climate and will be under severe risk in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Araucaria angustifolia; Functional ecology; Global warming; Southern Brazil; Subtropical Forest","Biodiversity; Geographical distribution; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Plants (botany); Population distribution; Principal component analysis; Tropics; Anthropogenic emissions; Desiccation tolerance; Environmental conditions; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Maximum entropy algorithms; Potential indicators; Principal components analysis; Subtropical forests; Forestry; climate change; environmental conditions; global warming; leaf area; mixed forest; subtropical region; tree; Brazil; Araucaria angustifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084817508

However, there are areas occupied by agriculture and woodlands with an essential role in provisioning food and other services such as water and climate regulation. The objective of this work was to assess the effect of long-term land use and soil management practices on peri-urban soils in Zagreb (Croatia). Samples were collected at depth 0-10 cm within intensively tilled cropland (CROP) and vineyard (VINE), traditional grass-covered orchard (ORCH), and forest (FOR). The results showed that bulk density was significantly higher in VINE and CROP than in ORCH and FOR. The opposite dynamic was observed in water-holding capacity, air-filled porosity, aggregate stability, organic matter, and soil organic matter stocks (SOCS). Soil water infiltration was higher in FOR plot compared to the other plots. Overall, land-use change had a substantial impact on soil properties and SOCS, especially in CROP and VINE soils.

The northern part of Amazonia, and in particular the Guiana Shield, is much less studied, although past human occupations have also been documented in this region. Therefore, the actual impact of pre-Columbian societies on Guianan forests is still poorly known. Here we explore 12 sites in the dense forest of Nouragues, central French Guiana, ranging from a priori non-anthropogenic to clearly anthropogenic, using an anthracological approach. Soil charcoals were radiocarbon dated to assess the chronology of the past human occupations, and identified to determine shifts in vegetation cover. Our results show that two main periods of occupation can be distinguished on several sites in the Nouragues area: a first one between ca. 1,300 and 1,000 cal bp and a second one between ca. 600 and 400 cal bp. Charcoal identification reveals the presence of a secondary vegetation during this most recent period of occupation, as shown by the presence of pioneer and heliophilic taxa, suggesting that human activities induced and favored this kind of vegetation. The presence of valuable wood and edible species in the anthracological record could reflect selective exploitation of the former around dwelling areas and a concentration of the latter within anthropogenic sites. As shown by our anthracological results, all the sites which contained charcoal were once under forest cover, including those that are now covered by pseudo-bamboos or by liana forests. We therefore suggest that the type of human activity (e.g. dwelling or food production) may have had different impacts on the structure and composition of subsequent vegetation resulting either in anthropogenic forests or liana and pseudo-bamboo patches after land abandonment. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Amazonia; Anthracology; Charcoal; Historical ecology; Lasiacis thicket; Liana forest; Pre-Columbian occupation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077567072

The high use of fossil fuels and biomasses results in measurable air pollution, even in the mountain areas. Hydropower planning and implementation, in the face of the changing climate, is therefore paramount important. We focus here on Nepal, and particularly on the Dudh Koshi river basin, with a population of ca. 170,000 people, within an area with large potential for hydropower production. Our main objectives are to (i) preliminarily design a local hydropower grid based on a distributed run of river ROR scheme, and (ii) verify the resilience of the grid against modified hydrology under perspective climate change, until the end of the century. To do so, we set up and tune the Poli-Hydro semi-distributed glacio-hydrological model, mimicking the complex hydrology of the area. We then modify a state of the art algorithm to develop and exploit a heuristic, resource-demand based model, called Poli-ROR. We use Poli-ROR to assess the (optimal) distribution of a number of ROR hydropower stations along the river network, and the structure of the local mini-grids. We then use downscaled outputs from three general circulation models GCMs (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 8.5) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC AR5, to assess the performance of the system under future modified hydrological conditions. We find that our proposed method is efficient in shaping ROR systems, with the target of the largest possible coverage (93%), and of the least price (0.068 kWh-1 on average). We demonstrate also that under the projected hydrological regimes until 2100, worse conditions than now may occur, especially for plants with small drainage areas. Days with energy shortage may reach up to nf = 38 per year on average (against nf = 24 now), while the maximum daily energy deficit may reach as high as edef% = 40% (against edef% = 20% now). We demonstrate that our originally proposed method for ROR grid design may represent a major contribution towards the proper development of distributed hydropower production in the area. Our results may contribute to improve energy supply, and living conditions within the Dudh Koshi river. It is likely that our approach may be applied in Nepal generally. Impending climate change may require adaptation in time, including the use of other sources which are as clean as possible, to limit pollution. Our Poli-ROR method for grid optimization may be of use for water managers, and scientists with an interest in the design of optimal hydropower schemes in topographically complex catchments. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Hydrological modeling; Mini-hydropower; Nepal","Catchments; Climate models; Complex networks; Fossil fuels; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Optimization; River pollution; Rivers; General circulation model; Hydro power production; Hydrological condition; Hydrological modeling; Hydropower potential; Hydropower stations; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; State-of-the-art algorithms; Climate change; atmospheric pollution; biomass; catchment; climate change; drainage basin; hydrological modeling; hydrological regime; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; river basin; spatiotemporal analysis; water management; Himalayas; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092055197

In particular, a broad deployment of shared, on-demand AVs might significantly impact vehicle ownership and transportation energy consumption; projecting these impacts is essential for climate, infrastructure, and policy planning. However, it seems increasingly likely that AVs will be deployed gradually over a period of decades, in which case there may be geographic or functional variation in their availability. This might occur for a combination of technological, policy, and economic reasons. This manuscript seeks to advance a new framework for projecting AV impacts, with a particular focus on energy consumption impacts. Specifically, we introduce a framework for AV impacts that allows for AVs catering to specific operating environments or ride types. As a demonstration of this framework, we use the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS) to segment US household travel demand based on built environment and ride length. Our framework allows us to specify AV “availability” for each population segment and ride type and use that information to predict the impact of AVs. We analyze a case scenario where shared, on-demand AVs are mostly suited for short trips in highly urbanized environments. We project the impact on household relocation, private vehicle ownership, induced travel demand, and fuel consumption. Utilization of this framework would help identify policy levers for sustainable deployment of AVs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous Vehicles; Energy; Operation design domain; Operational design domain; Ridesharing; Sustainable transportation; Urban impacts","Energy policy; Energy utilization; Motor transportation; Automated vehicles; Built environment; Operating environment; Operational design; Transportation energy consumption; Transportation surveys; Transportation system; Vehicle ownership; Vehicles; demand analysis; policy implementation; policy making; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation policy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088101539

Adoption of LPG in resource-poor settings such as South Asia is low and driven by many factors. In Bangladesh, more than 90% of the rural population relies on biomass fuels for cooking. Identifying factors among households that self-adopt LPG, i.e. 'natural users' may provide insight into how LPG programs could be modified to improve the adoption of clean fuels. We aimed to assess factors that drive LPG adoption and use in a rural setting amongst natural users of LPG in Bangladesh. We conducted a household survey of natural users of LPG who were pregnant and were identified by a census listing of households in 63 villages of five unions of Tangail district. Of 337 existing pregnant natural users, we could complete interview of 299 women using a structured questionnaire which included socio-demographic, kitchen structure, cooking behaviours and potential factors related to LPG use. Nearly all natural users had multiple cookstoves, and 85% reported using LPG as an alternative fuel to their main cooking and fuel (traditional cooking with biomass fuels). Factors related to high use of LPG (defined as at least 50% of all cooking time in previous 24 h) included households in second wealth quintile, (adjusted Prevalence Ratio, aPR 3.03; 95% CI:1.15-8.00), middle wealth quintile, (aPR 2.72; 95% CI:1.01-7.30) and highest wealth quintile (aPR2.71;95% CI: 1.02-7.28. Health issues also influenced LPG use; if LPG was described as alleviating breathing problems (aPR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.08-2.52), there was more LPG use. Adoption of LPG stove as a backup option for emergency purpose cooking reduced greater use of LPG (aPR 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39-0.91). High use of LPG was associated with LPG cooking being reported as easy to use (aPR 4.13; 95% CI: 1.95-8.73). Women's perception that LPG alleviated breathing difficulties was associated with high-use of LPG cooking, as was household wealth and ease of use. Women who reported to use LPG only for emergency purposes were less likely to be high users. Clean fuel programs as well as being financially supportive could be modified to include a trial period so that the experience of LPG would further support clean cooking adoption. © 2020 The Author(s).

We conducted a systematic search of the relevant literature, and supplemented our findings with an analysis of review papers previously published on the topic. The results indicate that there have been no peer-reviewed experimental evaluations of community-wide interventions to reduce greenhouse gases involving electricity, refrigeration, or food. The lack of findings limits the conclusions which can be made about the efficacy of these efforts. As a result, we are not accumulating effective interventions, and some communities may be implementing strategies that are not effective. We advocate for the funding of experimental evaluations of multi-sector community interventions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such interventions would attempt to engage every sector of the community in identifying and implementing policies and practices to reduce emissions. Comprehensive multi-sector interventions are likely to have synergistic effects, such that the total impact is greater than the sum of the impact of the individual components. We describe the value of interrupted time-series designs as an alternative to randomized trials, because these designs confer particular advantages for the evaluation of strategies in entire communities. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Community intervention; Greenhouse gas emissions; Systematic review","electricity generation; emission control; greenhouse gas; literature review; policy implementation; strategic approach",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091389986

In order to assess its emissions, transport, atmospheric reactivity, and deposition pathways, worldwide Hg monitoring has been implemented over the past 10-20 years, albeit with only a few stations in the Southern Hemisphere. Consequently, little is known about the relative contribution of marine and terrestrial Hg sources, which is important in the context of growing interest in effectiveness evaluation of Hg mitigation policies. This paper constitutes Part 2 of the study describing a decade of atmospheric Hg concentrations at Cape Point, South Africa, i.e. the first long-term (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>></i> 10</span> years) observations in the Southern Hemisphere. Building on the trend analysis reported in Part 1, here we combine atmospheric Hg data with a trajectory model to investigate sources and sinks of Hg at Cape Point. We find that the continent is the major sink, and the ocean, especially its warm regions (i.e. the Agulhas Current), is the major source for Hg.</p> <p>Further, we find that mercury concentrations and trends from long-range transport are independent of the source region (e.g. South America, Antarctica) and thus indistinguishable. Therefore, by filtering out air masses from source and sink regions we are able to create a dataset representing a southern hemispheric background Hg concentrations. Based on this dataset, we were able to show that the interannual variability in Hg concentrations at Cape Point is not driven by changes in atmospheric circulation but rather due to changes in global emissions (gold mining and biomass burning). © Author(s) 2020.

To reach such significant reductions requires a rapid and strategic scaling of existing and emerging technologies and practices, coupled with economic and social transformations and novel governance solutions. Here we present a new 'Powers of 10' (P10) logarithmic framework and demonstrate its potential as a practical tool for decision makers and change agents at multiple scales to inform and catalyze engagement and actions, complementing and adding nuance to existing frameworks. P10 assists in identifying the suitable cohorts and cohort ranges for rapidly deploying climate and sustainability actions between a single individual and the globally projected ∼ 10 billion persons by 2050. Applying a robust dataset of climate solutions from Project Drawdown's Plausible scenario that could cumulatively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1051 gigatons (Gt) against a reference scenario (2190 Gt) between 2020 and 2050, we seek to identify a 'sweet spot' where these climate and sustainability actions are suitably scaled.

Hence, this pioneering study aimed to analyze the interdependencies of the bio-edaphic ecosystem during carbon sequestration on a national highway in Guwahati, Assam, India. To quantify the tree carbon stock, soil physicochemical properties, soil nutrients, bulk density, organic carbon, and soil carbon stock, trees with diameters at breast height (dbh) ≥ 2 cm and soil samples from different depths (0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, and 30–45 cm) were taken from six areas spread over 36 plots of equal size (2 × 10 m) arranged in a zig-zag manner. The studied parameters were compared among the different areas. It was found that the tree and soil carbon stock, along with soil nutrients, were greater in the Garchuk-Lokhra area (sample area-4). A significantly strong correlation was observed between the soil carbon stock and the above and below-ground biomass of trees (AGB, r = 0.865; BGB, r = 0.847), which indicated the co-dependencies of the bio-edaphic ecosystem in accumulating carbon. Peltophorum ferrugineum (Decne.) Benth is recommended for planting because it has emerged as a tolerant species and has the greatest carbon storage potential. The bio-edaphic ecosystem of the national highway is now on a carbon-friendly trajectory that follows the UNFCCC guidelines and the REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) strategy. However further research on carbon budgeting is required. © 2020Tree carbon stock; Soil carbon stock; REDD+ strategy; AGB; BGB; Ecology; Agricultural science; Environmental science; Earth sciences © 2020","AGB; Agricultural science; BGB; Earth sciences; Ecology; Environmental science; REDD+ strategy; Soil carbon stock; Tree carbon stock",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091114082

The quantitative fidelity of microkinetic models (MKMs), however, is often insufficient to conclusively infer the mechanistic details of a specific catalytic system. This can be attributed to a number of factors such as an incorrect model of the active site for which DFT calculations are performed, deficiencies in the hypothesized reaction mechanism, inadequate consideration of the surface environment under reaction conditions, and intrinsic errors in the DFT exchange-correlation functional. Despite these limitations, we aim at developing a rigorous understanding of the reaction mechanism and of the nature of the active site for heterogeneous catalytic chemistries under reaction conditions. By achieving parity between experimental and modeling outcomes through robust parameter estimation and by ensuring coverage-consistency between DFT calculations and MKM predictions, it is possible to systematically refine the mechanistic model and, thereby, our understanding of the catalytic active site in situ.Our general approach consists of developing ab initio informed MKM for a given active site and then re-estimating the energies of the transition and intermediate states so that the model predictions match quantities measured in reaction kinetics experiments. If (i) model-experiment parity is high, (ii) the adjustments to the DFT-derived energetics for a given model of the active site are rationalized within the errors of standard DFT exchange-correlation functionals, and (iii) the resultant MKM predicts surface coverages that are consistent with those assumed in the DFT calculations used to initialize the MKM, we conclude that we have correctly identified the active site and the reaction mechanism. If one or more of these requirements are not met, we iteratively refine our model by updating our hypothesis for the structure of the active site and/or by incorporating coverage effects, until we obtain a high-fidelity coverage-self-consistent MKM whose final kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are within error of the values derived from DFT.Using the catalytic reaction of formic acid (FA, HCOOH) decomposition over transition-metal catalysts as an example, here we provide an account of how we applied this algorithm to study this chemistry on powder Au/SiC and Pt/C catalysts. For the case of Au catalysts, on which the FA decomposition occurred exclusively through the dehydrogenation reaction (HCOOH → CO2+H2), our approach was used to iteratively refine the model starting from the (111) facet until we found that specific ensembles of Au atoms present in sub-nanometer clusters can describe the active site for this catalysis. For the case of Pt catalysts, wherein both dehydrogenation (HCOOH → CO2 + H2) and dehydration (HCOOH → CO + H2O) reactions were active, our approach identified that a partially CO*-covered (111) surface serves as the active site and that CO*-assisted steps contributed substantially to the overall FA decomposition activity. Finally, we suggest that once the active site and the mechanism are conclusively identified, the model can subsequently serve as a high-quality basis for designing specific goal-oriented experiments and improved catalysts.

Thus, in order to propose a suitable passive strategy in a building for given climatic condition, the development of a bioclimatic analysis tool is necessary to establish its potential study. In the present work, an analysis tool for the evaluation of the cooling potential of passive strategies for different Indian climatic zones is developed. A total of 18 cities representing four different climatic zones, namely hot-dry, hot-humid, temperate, cold and composite are selected for analysis. A comfort zone for each city is represented in the bioclimatic chart based on a recently developed India Model for Adaptive Comfort (IMAC). Passive cooling strategies are defined in the bioclimatic chart by extending the boundaries of the comfort zone. Climate analysis is carried out in terms of monthly averaged hourly measured climatic data points on the bioclimatic chart. Yearly, seasonal and monthly cooling potential of passive strategies like natural ventilation, thermal mass, thermal mass with night ventilation and direct evaporative cooling are evaluated using the bioclimatic analysis tool. Results show that comfort improvements are highest for natural ventilation with cooling potential in the range of 26.38–71.18% for all climatic zones of India. Thermal mass with night ventilation also shows good cooling potential for the composite climatic environment. Direct evaporative cooling is the more effective passive strategy for hot and dry climatic zone. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioclimatic analysis; Climatic zones; Cooling potential; India Model for adaptive comfort (IMAC); Passive cooling strategy","Energy conservation; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Adaptive comfort; Bioclimatic analysis; Climatic zone; Cooling potential; Passive cooling; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081916434

New environmental conditions sustaining N2 fixation have been revealed in recent years, enabling more accurate forecasting of future nitrogen inputs and localized hot spots. However, at present the paucity and biased geographical coverage of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity measurements impede attempts to reconcile global nitrogen budgets with observed rates. Most studies have been conducted at disparate spatiotemporal scales, including: (i) discrete and short duration measurements in small seawater volumes isolated from the environment, and (ii) spatial extrapolations and global models of diazotrophy projected over decades to centuries. We argue that this knowledge gap lies at the fine scales: dynamic seawater structures &lt; 200 km wide and &lt; 2 months lifetime. However, the spatiotemporal resolution of conventional oceanographic cruises, with stations separated by tens to hundreds of kilometers, is too poor to resolve fine scale processes. Bridging this gap requires leveraging high spatiotemporal resolution measurements. Here we present and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of contemporary methods and equipment able to provide high-resolution measurements at sea. We also provide insights into high-resolution sampling approaches to be developed in the near future. Increasing the spatiotemporal resolution of diazotroph activity and diversity will provide more realistic quantifications of nitrogen fluxes in the dynamic ocean. © Copyright © 2020 Benavides and Robidart.","cyanobacteria; diazotrophs; fine scale dynamics; N2 fixation; physical-biological coupling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092739389

The construction of analytical mathematical models for the prediction of these disturbances is almost impossible because the physical phenomena relating to the climate are often complex. We raise the question over the current and future PV system's sustainable energy production and whether climate disturbances will be affecting this sustainability and resulting in supply decline. Methods: In this paper, we tried to use deep learning as a tool to predict the evolution of the future production of any geographic site. This approach can allow for improvements in decision-making concerning the implantation of solar PV or CSP plants. To reach this aim, we have deployed the databases of NASA and the Tunisian National Institute of Meteorology relating to the climatic parameters of the case study region of El Akarit, Gabes, Tunisia. In spite of the colossal amount of processed data that dates back to 1985, the use of deep learning algorithms allowed for the validation of the previously made estimates of the energy potential in the studied region. Results: The calculation results suggested an increase in production as it was confirmed by the 2019 measures. The findings obtained from the case study region were reliable and seemed to be very promising. The results obtained using deep learning algorithms were similar to those produced by conventional calculation methods. However, while conventional approaches based on measurements obtained using hardware solutions (ground sensors) are expensive and very difficult to implement, the suggested new approach is cheaper and more convenient. Conclusions: In the existence of a protracted controversy over the hypothetical effects of climate change, making advances in artificial intelligence and using new deep learning algorithms are critical procedures to strengthening conventional assessment tools of the production sites of photovoltaic energy and CSP plants. © 2020 The Author(s).","ANN modeling and greenhouse effect; Deep learning; GHI estimation; PV production prediction","Climate change; Climate models; Decision making; Deep learning; Estimation; Learning systems; NASA; Photovoltaic effects; Calculation models; Calculation results; Climatic parameters; Conventional approach; Hardware solutions; Photovoltaic energy; Physical phenomena; Renewable energy fields; Learning algorithms; climate change; estimation method; photovoltaic system; power plant; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092366466

It plays key roles in the well-being of society in numerous ways. However, climate variability and land use land cover (LULC) change have caused spatiotemporal water supply variation. Disentangling the effects of climate variability from LULC change on water supply is crucial for sustainable water resource management. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to disentangle the relative contribution of LULC change and climate variability to the overall average annual water supply variation. Residual trends analysis combined with Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) annual water yield model was adopted to perform simulations and disentangle the relative impacts of climate variability and LULC change. Ground and satellite data were used in this study. The study area has experienced a significant increasing wetness trend and significant LULC dynamics between 2003 and 2017. As a result, an increasing water supply was observed due to the joint effects of climate variability and LULC change in the watershed (203 mm). The contribution of climate variability was 94%, whereas LULC contributes only 6% from 2003 to 2017. Climate variability negatively led to water supply variation while LULC change contributed positively from 2010 to 2017. Although the ongoing soil and water conservation (SWC) practices improved vegetation cover and water retention of the watershed, climate variability is the main driver of water supply variation. Therefore, SWC practices should incorporate ecosystem-based climate change adaptation strategies and scale up to community-based integrated watershed management to sustain water supply. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","climate variability; impact of LULC and climate variability; InVEST; LULC change; water yield","Climate models; Ecosystems; Land use; Soil conservation; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Climate variability; Integrated watershed management; InVEST; Land use/land cover change; LULC change; Soil and water conservation; Sustainable water resources; Water yield; Climate change; climate variation; land cover; land use change; partitioning; resource management; water management; water resource; water supply; water yield; Blue Nile Basin; Nile Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082201506

This is challenging for the scientific community as the longest initialized predictions are limited to 10 years (decadal predictions). Thus, to provide seamless information for the upcoming 50 years, information from decadal predictions and uninitialized projections need to be merged. In this study, the ability to obtain valuable climate information beyond decadal time scales by constraining uninitialized projections using decadal predictions is assessed. The application of this framework to surface temperatures over the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre region, shows that the constrained uninitialized subensemble has higher skill compared to the overall projection ensemble also beyond 10 years when information from decadal predictions is no longer available.

The lack of response from states can lead to many consequences. As consumption increases, so does the emission of harmful substances. According to the European Parliament, almost 30% of total CO2 (greenhouse gas affecting the greenhouse effect in the EU) comes from the transport sector, of which 72% is from road transport. Air pollution is a challenge for municipal authorities. According to the data, road transport accounted for approximately 5% of the creation of PM10 particles, ca. 7% of PM2.5 and approximately 32% for NOX. In Poland, suspended particles (PM10 and PM2.5) cause deaths of as many as 45,000 people a year. Therefore, it is necessary to undertake concrete efforts in order to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions as much as possible. Among them, solutions such as downsizing, hybridization of combustion engines or electrification are used. Based on the analyzes, the authors of the paper drew attention to the significant impact, in this process, of the modernization of energy infrastructure. Thanks to this, it is possible to simultaneously increase the share of zero-emission vehicles as well as the use of VtG (Vehicle to Grid) technology.

Understanding the perception of people and communities is critical for designing climate change adaptation strategies. Those most affected by climate change are populations in coastal regions that face extreme weather events and sea-level increases. In this article, geospatial perception of climate change is identified, and the research parameters are quantified. In addition to investigating the correlations of hotspots on the topic of climate change perception with a focus on coastal communities, Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to examine the research interactions. A total of 27,138 articles sources from Google Scholar and Scopus were analyzed. A systematic method was used for data processing combining bibliometric analysis and machine learning. Publication trends were analyzed in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Publications in English (87%) were selected for network and data mining analysis. Most of the research was conducted in the USA, followed by India and China. The main research methods were identified through correlation networks. In many cases, social studies of perception are related to climatic methods and vegetation analysis supported by GIS. The analysis of keywords identified ten research topics: adaptation, risk, community, local, impact, livelihood, farmer, household, strategy, and variability. “Adaptation” is in the core of the correlation network of all keywords. The interdisciplinary analysis between social and environmental factors, suggest improvements are needed for research in this field. A single method cannot address understanding of a phenomenon as complicated as the socio-environmental. This study provides valuable information for future research by clarifying the current context of perception work carried out in the coastal regions; and identifying the tools best suited for carrying out this type of research. © 2020","Big data; Climate change; Coastal; Machine learning; Perception","adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone; data mining; data processing; machine learning; perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100530459

In many minor islands, solar energy is not correctly exploited, and electrical heaters are connected to weak grids with very a high share of generation by fossil fuels. As a consequence, there is the necessity to assess the potential and the suitability of diffusion of alternative systems to avoid dependency on the electrical grid and reduce carbon emissions. This paper aims to evaluate the technical and economic performances of some alternative systems exploiting renewable energy for domestic hot water production. Four different systems were simulated and studied: a heat pump connected to the grid, a heat pump coupled with a photovoltaic plant, a heat pump combined with a solar thermal collector, and a solar thermal plant. Moreover, heat and electricity storages were studied for reducing impacts on the distribution network. The work presents data gathered for a study on energy-retrofit strategies on Lampedusa Island (Italy, 35°30′56″ north (N), 568 degree-days). Finally, to select the most cost-effective plant, an economic analysis of the chosen systems was carried out. This analysis shows that the best net present values are associated with the heat pump (HP) coupled with a stand-alone PV system and a small battery and solar thermal-assisted HP. The shortest payback time was calculated for the solar thermal system. © 2020 by the authors.","Domestic hot water; Energy consumption; Heat pump water heater; Renewable sources; Small islands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090193063

Its basic argument is that, among an array of national and international actors, it remains the state that can drive a successful politics of climate change. Without the heavy-lifting of the state and the state’s ability as a national entity to motivate behavioural change, neither the daunting scale nor imminent time-horizon of climate mitigation and adaptation is possible. The article shows how this specific argument, far from pitching anew nationalism against internationalism, can bring the two presently polarized movements together. The article then suggests that if these arguments are essentially valid, the discipline of International Relations needs to focus much more on the climate challenge, re-engage with its traditions of thought on the state and help harbour a specific disposition or mindset in the research and teaching of the discipline for the next decades: a fierce optimism. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate science; fierce optimism; governance; political agency; politics of climate change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089257712

Following this strategy, an extraordinary emission emerges from photoinduced intramolecular processes between silylene-bridged adjacent chromophores, e.g., intramolecular energy and/or electron transfer (PET). The reported compound displays an attractive blue emission that occurs no matter which of the linked chromophores is excited (i.e., regardless of the excitation wavelength in the range 240-360 nm). Excitation of CBL leads directly to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state formation within 35 ps, whereas excitation of DVB results in ""pumping""the CBL excited state via 300 fs energy transfer. In the latter case, DVB acts as an intramolecular photosensitizer of the ICT precursor. Both mechanisms, proceeding via ultrafast processes, are confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption experiments performed on the investigated bichromophoric compound and its individual Si-containing chromophores in acetonitrile solution. Analysis of the transient absorption bands allowed us to characterize the ICT excited state as a radical ion pair of carbazole radical cation and divinylbenzene radical anion linked by a silylene bridge.

Oil, due to its hydrophobic nature, acts as a water-repealing admixture and thus improves the durability of mortar. Further it may modify the pore size distribution of solid mortar as well as rheology of the fresh one. On the other hand, the presence of hydrophobic oil in mortar causes the reduction of carbonation and hydration (in case of hydraulic lime) and thus its dosage is a sensitive issue. Determination of the oil content in a sample of historic mortar is important for proper restoring of the given building or e.g. mosaic. There is currently not any standard procedure for quantification of an oil content in a solid matrix such is mortar. The present contribution aims to evaluate possibilities to determine content of oil in lime mortar by help of thermogravimetry with Evolved Gas Analysis. Set of model samples containing portlandite, calcite and various doses of linseed oil (0-20 % of dry components) was prepared. The results indicated that the solely thermogravimetry is not able to provide the desired information, but the EGA, especially the m/z = 55 signal, can be used as semiquantitative indicator of the oil content. © 2020 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093697576

Protected areas help safeguard the landscape from additional anthropogenic disturbances and, when properly designed, can help species cope with climate change impacts. When designed to protect the regional biodiversity rather than to conserve focal species or landscape elements, protected areas need to cover a representative sample of the regional biodiversity and be functionally connected, facilitating individual movements among protected areas in a network to maximize their effectiveness. We developed a methodology to define effective protected areas to implement in a regional network using ecological representativeness and functional connectivity as criteria. We illustrated this methodology in the Gaspésie region of Québec, Canada. We simulated movements for the endangered Atlantic-Gaspésie caribou population (Rangifer tarandus caribou), using an individual-based model, to determine functional connectivity based on this large mammal. We created multiple protected areas network scenarios and evaluated their ecological representativeness and functional connectivity for the current and future conditions. We selected a subset of the most effective network scenarios and extracted the protected areas included in them. There was a tradeoff between ecological representativeness and functional connectivity for the created networks. Only a few protected areas among those available were repeatedly chosen in the most effective networks. Protected areas maximizing both ecological representativeness and functional connectivity represented suitable areas to implement in an effective protected areas network. These areas ensured that a representative sample of the regional biodiversity was covered by the network, as well as maximizing the movement over time between and inside the protected areas for the focal population. © 2020 Bauduin et al.

To establish a fair method for diets’ comparison among the different regions, a novel functional unit (FU), that considers both the nutritional and the socio-economic dimensions, was developed. Diets in north–western regions have larger impacts due to the high caloric energy and ruminant meat intake, as well as for being less affordable. The adoption of the NDG-based diet can potentially reduce the environmental impacts (GHG emissions, blue water footprint and land use) between 15 and 60% of current regional eating patterns.

While carbon calculators have traditionally calculated emissions based on user input about e.g., food, heating, and traveling, a new development in this area is the use of transaction data to also estimate emissions based on consumption. Such carbon calculators should be able to provide users with more accurate estimations, easier input possibilities, and an incentive to continue using them. In this paper, we present the results from a survey sent to the users of such a novel carbon calculator, called Svalna. Svalna offers users the possibility to connect their bank account. The transaction data are then coupled with Environmental Extended Multi Regional Input Output data (EE-MRIO) for Swedish conditions which are used to determine a continuous overview of the user's greenhouse gas emissions from consumption. The aim of the survey was to (a) understand whether people are willing to connect their bank account, (b) whether they trust the calculations of their emissions, and (c) whether they think the use of Svalna has an effect on their behaviour. Furthermore, we wanted to know how Svalna could be improved. While the results of the survey showed that many users were willing to connect their bank account, a rather large part of the users perceived safety risks in doing so. The users also showed an only average level of trust in the correctness of the estimated greenhouse gas emissions. A lack of trust was attributed to experiencing technical problems but also to not knowing how the emissions were calculated and because the calculator could not capture all details of the user's life. However, many users still indicated that the use of Svalna had helped them to initiate action to reduce their emissions. In order to improve Svalna, the users wanted to be able to provide more details, e.g., by scanning receipts and get better options for dealing with a shared economy. We conclude this paper by discussing some opportunities and challenges for the use of transaction data in carbon footprint calculators. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon footprint calculator; Consumption; Transaction data; Trust","carbon emission; carbon footprint; data set; detection method; economic conditions; estimation method; greenhouse gas; heating; hydrocarbon entrapment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092457735

According to the European Commission (2018), the EU is already a global leader in the sustainable use of natural resources within an efficient bio-economy. The wood pellet industry is becoming more important and the use of wood pellets is increasing as one of the most important contributors to the renewable energy goals of the EU. Wood pellet is an environmentally acceptable product and its production contributes to desirable rural development and sustainable approach to the management of timber resources. This paper focuses on the market of wood pellets used for heating, pinpointing differences in consumers point of view, and drafting the possibilities of future consumption enhancement. Results revealed a relatively low use of wood pellets in all the three surveyed markets. The highest share of consumers of wood pellets came from the areas with less than 5,000 inhabitants. Such households were mostly over 20 years old. The most important factors to decide to use such source of energy were space (required for the heating system) followed by price of woode pellets. © 2020 by the author(s).","Croatia; Households; Renewable energy source; Slovakia; Slovenia; Wood industry; Wood pellets","Commerce; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Natural resources; Regional planning; Renewable energy resources; Wood; Alternative energy source; Developed countries; Energy from renewable sources; Environmentally acceptable; European Commission; Future consumption; Non-renewable energy sources; Renewable energy source; Pelletizing; alternative energy; energy resource; European Commission; European Union; greenhouse gas; rural development; timber; Commerce; Greenhouse Gases; Heating; Natural Resources; Pelleting; Wood; Croatia; Slovakia; Slovenia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091715562

Multi-Objective optimization of a grid-connected Hybrid PV/Wind Turbine (WT) based system was introduced to supply sufficient energy to a rural community in Ismailia Governorate, Egypt, considering the minimization of two objective functions namely Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and Cost of Energy (COE) while maximizing the Renewable Energy Fraction (REF) of the system as the third objective function, under different weather situations. Mathematical models were presented to estimate the output power of the hybrid system. The results showed the share of each component of the system in total energy supplying the electrical demand. In this paper, the interrelationship between the grid and the proposed hybrid system was studied in terms of the network's ability to sell or buy energy from the hybrid system, where three scenarios were proposed to study this relationship.

However, few studies have been performed to evaluate policies that could reduce transport-related emissions in the region. This study explores transport-related CO2 and air pollutant emissions in major Asian nations along with the impacts of transport, climate, and emission control policies using the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM)/Transport model. Our results show that by 2050, CO2 emissions in developing countries will be 1.4-4.7-fold greater than the levels in 2005, while most air pollutant emissions will show large reductions (mean annual reduction rates of 0.2% to 6.1%). Notably, implementation of transport, emission control, and carbon pricing policies would reduce CO2 emissions by up to 33% and other air pollutants by 43% to 72%, depending on the emission species. An emission control policy represents the strongest approach for short-term and mid-term reduction of air pollutants. A carbon pricing policy would lead to a direct reduction in CO2 emissions; more importantly, air pollutant emissions would also be eff;ectively reduced. Shifting to public transportation in developing countries can also greatly influence emissions reductions. An increase in traffc speed shows relatively small eff;ects, but can be meaningful in Japan. © 2020 by the authors.","AIM/transport model; Carbon pricing policy; Emission reduction benefits; Transport-related emissions; Transportation behaviors","atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; developing world; emission control; emissions trading; environmental tax; greenhouse gas; identification method; pollution tax; pricing policy; Asia; Japan; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091159967

In this study, taking advantage of the high quality of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products, we developed a new algorithm to estimate the BC columnar concentrations over China by simulating the BC and non-BC aerosol mixing states in detail. The results show that our new algorithm produces a reliable estimation of BC aerosols, in which BC columnar concentrations and their related parameters (aerosol absorption and BC surface concentration) show reasonable agreements and low biases compared with ground-based measurements. The uncertainties of BC retrievals are mainly associated with the surface and aerosol assumptions used in the algorithm, ranging from -14 to 44% at higher aerosol optical depth (AOD > 0.5). The proposed algorithm can improve the capability of space-borne aerosol remote sensing by successfully distinguishing BC from other aerosols. The acquired BC columnar concentrations enable the spatial pattern of serious BC aerosol pollution over East China to be characterized, showing that it exhibits higher levels in winter. These nationwide results are beneficial for estimating BC emissions, proposing mitigation strategies for air pollution, and potentially reducing the uncertainties of climate change studies.

People receive information about these norms directly from social interactions, such as with neighbors and friends, but also indirectly from media, as in reporting on national public opinion statistics. We assess how well the public understands the level of social consensus across different geographic scales—regional, state, and national—and test whether understanding these norms differentially relates to climate and energy policy support. Among a representative sample of Maryland adults surveyed in 2015 (n = 1547), nearly half underestimated the extent of the social consensus about climate change within their region, state, and country. Individuals’ consensus perceptions were significantly related to the true social consensus—estimated through survey data—at the regional scale; however, the size of the relationship was small. We found that consensus perceptions across all geographic levels related to support for climate policy, as mediated by climate belief certainty. But perceptions of social consensus at smaller spatial scales—e.g., regional—appear to have larger effects on public opinion. The results of this study suggest both the importance—and limitations—of geographies of social consensus and the role of attitudinal certainty as a mediator for this relationship. Conveying localized social consensus information may promote public support of climate policy. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Belief certainty; Climate and energy policy; Public opinion; Social consensus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086084845

The first is a fixed source type from industrial plants, which can be controlled or easily evaluated. The second is a mobile source type from the transport sector, especially from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs), which produce high emissions. However, the common methods of evaluation of the average value of CO2 emissions per kilometer of a vehicle use a general Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model that does not consider the topography or road conditions. This affects the accuracy of CO2 emission assessments and, in turn, affects the accuracy of any analysis needed to establish health policies and the management of public health within the affected area. In this paper, therefore, we present the development of emission coefficient calculations with varying topography conditions for MHDVs with consideration of the health effects on the populace. The study area was the Asian highway network in Thailand that passes through all regions and is geographically diverse. Data were collected from the Department of Highway's records, global positioning system (GPS) and electronic control unit (ECU) with data consisting of road data, slope, distance, traffic level and vehicle weight, as well as fuel consumption along the transportation route. To analyze and map out the correlation of the CO2 emission coefficients for each road slope, we determined the coefficient of the CO2 emissions using multiple linear regression analysis and validated this using Huber-White robust standard errors for heteroscedasticity. This method was more cost-efficient and time-efficient compared to the conventional approaches. We also created CO2 emission maps with risk points for health effects, and we propose policy designs and plans to manage the traffic level in each of these areas prone to higher levels of such emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Asian highway network; CO2 emissions; Health effects; MLR analysis; Road slope","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; fuel consumption; GPS; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; pollutant source; public health; regression analysis; traffic emission; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090322241

Many lubricant additives intended to reduce friction, commonly classified as friction modifiers (FM), are oil soluble organic-molybdenum compounds, such as molybdenum dithiocarbamate (MoDTC). The action of this additive is associated with the formation of low-friction tribolayers of MoS2, which is strongly dependent on the mechanochemical properties of the tribosystem. One important variable affecting the MoDTC activation process is the type of the relative movement between the rubbing surfaces. In this context, the present work is focused on the investigation of the influence of both reciprocating and unidirectional rotating tribotests on the tribological performance of MoDTC-containing oils. The objective is to explore if both testing configurations, under equivalent contact conditions, may generate comparable results in terms of friction, wear and Mo-based tribofilm formation. The tribological tests were conducted in SRV-4 (reciprocating motion) and MTM-2 (unidirectional rotating motion) tribometers under boundary lubrication regime. A fully-formulated engine oil (SAE 0W-20) with MoDTC FM additive and a PAO 8 + 0.6 wt.% of MoDTC oil were used as lubricants. Friction and wear were compared over a range of speed/load ratios, as a function of sliding time, and the resulting tribofilms were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Raman spectroscopy and Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM). The obtained coefficient of friction (CoF) values were as low as 0.06 in MTM and SRV tribometers under some particular normalized sliding conditions, but the overall CoF behavior as a function of sliding time was distinct for both test rigs. MoS2 regions were observed in SRV discs after the tribological tests, confirming the MoDTC activation for reciprocating tests, whereas Mo-based tribofilms were not detected in MTM samples, despite a noticeable friction reduction during part of the tests. The fully-formulated oil has resulted in the lowest friction and wear levels in both tribometers. © 2019","Boundary lubrication; Mechanochemistry; MoDTC-containing oils; Tribometers","Additives; Chemical activation; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Gas emissions; Internal combustion engines; Layered semiconductors; Lubricants; Molybdenum compounds; Petroleum additives; Scanning electron microscopy; Scanning probe microscopy; Testing; Tribology; Wear of materials; Boundary lubrication regime; Boundary lubrications; Coefficient of frictions; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Mechano-chemistry; MoDTC-containing oils; Molybdenum dithio carbamates; Tribometers; Friction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064279595

The coupled vessel-pipe dynamic analysis for a typical configuration is done in the frequency and time domain using the ORCAFLEX program. The system’s characteristics, such as vessel RAOs and pipe-axial-velocity transfer function, are identified by applying a broadband white noise wave spectrum to the vessel-pipe dynamic system. The frequency shift of the vessel’s RAO due to the encounter-frequency effect is also investigated through the system identification method. Additionally, the time histories of the tip-of-pipe velocities, along with the corresponding discharged droplet size and Weber numbers, are generated for two different sea states. The comparison between the stiff non-oscillating pipe with the flexible oscillating pipe shows the effect of the vessel and pipe dynamics to the discharged CO2 droplet size and Weber number. The pipe’s axial-mode resonance is the leading cause of the fluctuation of the discharged CO2 properties.

These databases were: (1) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), (2) NRCS Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO), and (3) Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA). We compared estimates of SOC density and concentration among databases and analyzed relationships between key soil properties and SOC densities and concentrations. Estimates of SOC density to a 20 cm depth which allows comparison among all three databases were 77 ± 1.2 Mg ha−1, 95 ± 0.3 Mg ha−1, and 39 ± 2.2 Mg ha−1 for SSURGO, RaCA, and FIA, respectively. Significant differences existed among databases in SOC density at shallow depth increments, and marked differences existed among databases in the soil depths measured. Analysis of the influence of soil texture and drainage class on SOC highlighted the importance of silt and clay in SOC retention. A hypothetical increase in forest and agricultural SOC was compared to reported Maine GHG emissions to illustrate potential policy implications in the use of soil databases. We conclude that all three databases are valuable but not interchangeable. The database should be carefully chosen to match the objectives of the user. © 2020 The Authors.

In this study, the extent to which various crop residues in the ten administrative regions of Ghana can contribute to the specific heat and electricity demands of each region was assessed. The conversion of residues from 22 crops to briquettes, biomethane and bioethanol-based electricity were examined using resource modelling to determine their potential contribution to wood fuels, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity demand respectively. The results indicate that, the Eastern Region generated the highest amount of crop residues at 2.3 Mt, mainly from cassava stalks while the Greater Accra Region generated the least amount of crop residue from the ten regions at 52.3 kt. The conversion of selected crop residues to briquettes would contribute to 53.6% of the national wood fuel demand, with Eastern and Brong Ahafo Regions recording the highest individual contributions of 27.7 and 20.5% respectively. Biomethane would contribute to 11.7% of LPG demand in all the ten regions. Electricity generated from bioethanol would supplement 91.2% of the national electricity demand.

This paper investigates the importance of climate change in ports through a research-based survey on data collected from participants at the Greenport Congress in Valencia in 2018. The data for this paper were obtained from the responses of 55 port professionals and environmental specialists that replied to a questionnaire survey during the Congress. Questionnaires were analyzed to identify the opinions and experience of delegates. A collaborative approach involving the free exchange of knowledge and experience between port professionals, industry practitioners and academia is the model most likely to deliver practicable options to the mutual advantage of operators, local communities, regulatory authorities and the environment. Based on the results of this survey, Climate Change occupies the 6th position among top 10 environmental port priorities and Carbon Footprint the 8th position. This reflects the importance of these two issues in the whole set of environmental priorities. Data collection has been identified as the main challenge ports encounter to implement a carbon management program. The need for a common port-sector Carbon Footprint scheme, which would benefit individual port authorities and the port-sector as a whole, was highlighted by the participants. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; Climate change; CO2 emissions; Ports","academic research; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental issue; implementation process; knowledge; port; prioritization; questionnaire survey; regulatory approach; Valencia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091387694

The proposed poly-generation system is driven by low-grade renewable or surplus heat, and utilizes waste exergy from liquefied natural gas vaporization for refrigeration and power augmentation. At nominal conditions (130 ◦C driving heat), approximately 561 and 151 kJ of refrigeration and useful power per kg of liquefied natural gas regasified are generated by the proposed system, respectively, at effective first-law and exergetic efficiencies of 33% and 35%, respectively. The Kalina sub-system condenser cryogenic heat rejection condition is found to triple the system useful electrical output compared with high ambient temperature condenser heat sinking conditions. Per million ton per annum of liquefied natural gas vaporization capacity, yearly net power savings of approximately 74 GWhe could be achieved compared to standard air-conditioning, electricity, and gas supply systems, resulting in 11.1 kton of natural gas saved and 30.4 kton of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions avoided annually. The yearly net monetary savings would range from 0.9 to 4.7 million USD per million ton per annum of liquefied natural gas regasified at local subsidized and international electricity market prices, respectively, with corresponding payback periods of 1.7 and 2.5 years, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

Individuals engage with community projects in numerous ways: cognitively (knowledge), affectively (emotions), and behaviourally (actions). One prevalent consideration that individuals consider is other peoples’ (lack of) engagement; given that the success of community-based approaches addressing climate change is dependent upon the actions, and participation, of all local residents. Findings from focus groups in seven urban communities in the UK are presented that illustrate clear elements of ‘Othering’ as part of individual engagements with community-based sustainability projects. Primarily, there is substantial consideration towards what other people within the community know, feel, and do to engage with community-based projects. Residents distinguish themselves in opposition to those they view as engaging, and not engaging, in the same way as themselves and indicate the need for equitable participation amongst all residents. These considerations have the potential to project particular barriers on wider community engagement if left to develop, cause tension, and are not resolved. Implications for participatory strategies to meaningfully and effectively engage individuals with community-based sustainability and transformational change are outlined.

Forest biomass estimation is vital for sustainable forest management, providing critical input data for implementing the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation-plus (REDD+) mechanism. This study investigates the total carbon pools—aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), forest floor biomass, and soil carbon—using field-based information in the muyong forest management system, which is native to Ifugao in the Philippines. This study reveals that a difference may be observed between the total carbon stock of the private woodlots (muyong) and that of the communal forest (bilid). The results indicate that the bilid forest has trees with a small diameter at breast height (DBH) and high tree density in contrast to the muyong, which has trees with high DBH and low tree density. The average carbon stock per unit area is higher in muyong (150.8 tC/ha) than in bilid (126.1 tC/ha). These findings are valuable in determining whether Ifugao’s muyong forest system should be included under the REDD+ framework. Human mediation and management helps forests to sequester a greater amount of carbon than they would without human intervention. Implementation of REDD+ should promote Ifugao’s ecosystem and biodiversity conservation and agroforestry practices in addition to protecting traditional agricultural practices and livelihoods in relation to rice terraces. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change mitigation; Forest carbon stocks; Muyong; REDD+","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Conservation; Deforestation; Agricultural practices; Biodiversity conservation; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Diameter-at-breast heights; Field-based information; Forest management systems; Sustainable forest management; Information management; carbon; carbon; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; environmental assessment; environmental policy; forest management; policy implementation; aboveground biomass; agroforestry; Article; belowground biomass; biomass; climate change; conservation biology; controlled study; environmental parameters; forest; forest carbon stock; nonhuman; Philippines; population density; reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation plus; soil; tree; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; Cordillera Administrative Region; Ifugao; Philippines; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089209806

This novel approach analyzes climate extreme events over the past four decades (1980–2016) using multiple gridded observation and reanalysis datasets. Furthermore, future changes in climate extremes are analyzed from 20 downscaled Earth System Models (ESMs) at high horizontal resolution (0.25° of latitude/longitude), under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Projected changes in the extreme indices are analyzed over mid-twenty-first century (2046–2065) and end-of-twenty-first century (2081–2100) relative to the reference period 1986–2005. Results show consistent warming patterns with increasing (decreasing) trends in warm (cold) extremes in the historical datasets. A similar but more intense warm pattern is projected in the mid and end of the twenty-first century. For precipitation indices, observations show an increase in consecutive dry days and a reduction of consecutive wet days over almost all Brazil. The frequency and intensity of extremely wet days over Brazil are expected to increase according to future scenarios. Designing effective adaptation and mitigation measures in response to changes in climate extremes events depends on this improved understanding of how conditions have and are likely to change in the future at regional scales. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate trends; CMIP5 models; Downscaling; ETCCDI; Hydrological basins; Scenarios","climate change; climate modeling; data set; extreme event; precipitation assessment; trend analysis; warming; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086586872

As a result of the continued efforts carried out during the last few years by our research group to design new boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes with improved photonic performance, two approaches were tested to develop a new generation of organic dyes able to display efficient and long-lasting laser emission in both target spectral regions. On the one hand, the annulation of aromatic benzofuran at the dipyrrin backbone leads to conformationally restricted dyes yielding photostable and bright laser emission beyond 600 nm at the far-red spectral region. On the other hand, a more pronounced shift to longer wavelengths reaching 725 nm at the near-infrared region is feasible, while keeping a reasonably high laser efficiency and tolerance to prolonged and intense pumping, based on aza-BODIPYs bearing peripheral aryl rings.

In particular, the scope of the work is to demonstrate that the proposed energy concept, based on the combination of low-energy building design and high-efficiency technical systems, allows the reduction of the final energy uses. After the evaluation of the energy needs, a low-temperature and small-size wood biomass district thermal plant was designed to be integrated with groundwater heat pumps (GWHP) and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, taking up the challenge to design an almost full-renewable urban district by means of a Multi-Energy System. The core is a biomass boiler coupled with a small combined heat and power (CHP) unit with a twin-screw steam expander (TSSE). The heat produced by the CHP satisfies a consistent fraction of space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) needs during the winter season. GWHPs coupled with PV satisfy remaining thermal needs in winter and the entire thermal needs in mid-season and in the summer period. The obtained outcomes prove the benefits of the combination of a wood biomass CHP with GWHPs and PV with a significant share of renewable energies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Heat pumps; Low-carbon district; Multi-energy systems; Photovoltaic systems; Wooden biomass","Architectural design; Biomass; Boilers; Carbon; Carbonization; Energy efficiency; Groundwater; Heat pump systems; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Temperature; Combined heat and power units; Domestic hot water; Groundwater heat pumps; Low energy buildings; Low-carbon settlements; Multi-energy systems; Renewable energies; Solar photovoltaic system; Zero energy buildings; alternative energy; biomass; combined heat and power; energy efficiency; heating; photovoltaic system; pump; scenario analysis; solar power; urban area; Italy; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086578009

In a combined optical and electron paramagnetic resonance study, we show that the doping of rreP3HT in solution occurs by integer charge transfer, resulting in formation of P3HT radical cations (polarons) for all of the dopants considered here. Remarkably, despite the different chemical nature of the dopants and dopant-polymer interaction, the formed polarons exhibit essentially identical optical absorption spectra. The situation is very different for the doping of rraP3HT, where we observe formation of a charge-transfer complex with F4TCNQ and of a ""localized""P3HT polaron on nonaggregated chains upon doping with BCF, while there is no indication of dopant-induced species in the case of Mo(tfd-CO2Me)3. We estimate the ionization efficiency of the respective dopants for the two polymers in solution and report the molar extinction coefficient spectra of the three different species. Finally, we observe increased spin delocalization in regioregular compared to regiorandom P3HT by electron nuclear double resonance, suggesting that the ability of the charge to delocalize on aggregates of planarized polymer backbones plays a significant role in determining the doping mechanism.

Air pollution is becoming a global problem. Urban areas have dense populations and a high concentration of emission sources: vehicles, buildings, industrial activity, waste, and wastewater. Tackling air pollution is an immediate problem in developing countries, such as North Macedonia, especially in larger urban areas. This paper exploits Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models with Long Short-Term Memory units to predict the level of PM10 particles in the near future (+3 hours), measured with sensors deployed in different locations in the city of Skopje. Historical air quality measurements data were used to train the models. In order to capture the relation of air pollution and seasonal changes in meteorological conditions, we introduced temperature and humidity data to improve the performance. The accuracy of the models is compared to PM10 concentration forecast using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The obtained results show that specific deep learning models consistently outperform the ARIMA model, particularly when combining meteorological and air pollution historical data. The benefit of the proposed models for reliable predictions of only 0.01 MSE could facilitate preemptive actions to reduce air pollution, such as temporarily shutting main polluters, or issuing warnings so the citizens can go to a safer environment and minimize exposure. © 2020 Polish Information Processing Society - as it is since 2011.","air pollution; deep learning; LSTM; RNN","Air quality; Autoregressive moving average model; Developing countries; Forecasting; Industrial emissions; Information systems; Information use; Recurrent neural networks; Solid wastes; Air pollution forecasting; Air quality measurements; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Environmental factors; Industrial activities; Meteorological condition; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Temperature and humidities; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095765631

ICTs are often associated with the path to reducing CO2 emissions; however, do they lead to that path? Or are they themselves a growing source of energy consumption and emissions? The current study estimates the effect of ICT, trade, economic growth, financial development, and energy consumption on carbon emissions in South and Southeast Asian (SSEA) region for the period of 1990–2014. Moreover, the study also tried to validate the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions. Cluster analysis was used to identify two groups (potential and advanced countries) based on their social development score. The long-run connection between the variables was examined and the long-run elasticities of ICT, financial development, energy consumption, trade, and economic growth with respect to CO2 emissions were estimated. Besides, individual country-wise long-run coefficients were found. Results show that financial development and ICT deteriorated the environment quality in the SSEA region, suggesting ICT goods and services are not energy-efficient in both potential and advanced countries and that most of the financial investment was made in non-friendly environmental projects, in potential countries. On the contrary, in advanced countries, financial development mitigates CO2 emissions. In addition, results also confirmed an inverted U-shaped relationship for all the considered three panels such as potential, advance, and full-countries panels, confirming EKC. Causality findings showed a bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and energy consumption as well as unidirectional causality from trade, economic growth, financial development, and ICT to CO2 emissions. Policymakers should be aware of the ICT impact on energy consumption and strengthen the regulation of their manufacture to facilitate the integration of energy efficiency into user routines. Due to the increasing use of standby mode and Wi-Fi assistive devices, the rapid implementation of legislation regulating these technologies to make them more efficient is recommended. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asian countries; Cluster analysis; CO2 emissions; Economic growth; EKC; ICT","carbon emission; cluster analysis; economic conditions; economic growth; empirical analysis; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; information and communication technology; Kuznets curve; trade-environment relations; South Asia; Southeast Asia; carbon dioxide; cluster analysis; economic development; interpersonal communication; investment; Carbon Dioxide; Cluster Analysis; Communication; Economic Development; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086475062

Automotive electronics, such as sensors/actuators and microcontrollers (commonly known as electronic control units (ECU) which control one or more of the electrical systems or subsystems in a vehicle), play a key role in ICT. Sensors/actuators are key in electronic ICT devices, starting with the data collection and data communication with the internet. The latest two big trends of electrification and automation in vehicles, are projected to increase the use of worldwide automotive sensors from 7.5 billion units in 2017 to 11.0 billion units by the year 2024. A representative state-of-the art automotive sensor system, (i.e., an ultrasonic backup system), including the ECUs controlling the vehicle electrical systems/subsystems, has been considered to estimate the energy footprint in terms of manufacturing and operational energy of global automotive sensors use. A widely used life cycle energy assessment method (i.e., cumulative energy demand) was used as both direct and indirect (including the extraction, manufacturing, and disposal of the raw and auxiliary materials) energy use can be considered for the energy footprint estimation. The embodied manufacturing energy impacts of the system was estimated to be 559 MJ/system, compared to the 417 MJ/system for lifetime system power and additional gasoline use. The share of purchased energy to the embodied energy where the upstream energy isn't included in the former case, is less than 10% and ~ 85% for the component manufacturing and vehicle operation energy uses, respectively. As the purpose of this ultrasonic backup system is to prevent rear crashes, an estimated 1.0 MJ/system is avoided from reduced lifetime vehicular repairs (from an estimated 11% chance of requiring a rear bumper replacement). While all of this is small compared to the overall automotive manufacturing and use energy, the 11 billion automotive sensors expected to be produced in 2024 could require 1540 PJ for manufacturing and those sensors would require an additional 780–1150 PJ for lifetime energy use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Automotive electronics manufacturing; Automotive sensors; Embodied energy; Ultrasonic backup system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087960100

In this study, sediment cores from four lakes in Cajas National Park, southern Ecuador, situated approximately 200 km downwind of active volcanoes in the Northern Andes Volcanic Zone, were analysed to document the regional history of tephra fall extending back around 3,000 a cal BP. The ages of the lacustrine sedimentary sequences were constrained using a total of 20 AMS radiocarbon ages on plant remains. The tephra layers were correlated among the lakes based on their radiocarbon age, elemental composition, colour, and grain morphology. We found five unique tephra layers, each at least 0.2 cm thick, and further constrained their ages by combining the results from two age-depth modelling approaches (clam and rbacon). The tephra layers were deposited 3,034±621, 2,027±41, 1,557±177, 733±112, and 450±70 a cal BP. The ages of all but the youngest tephra layer overlap with those of known eruptions from Tungurahua. Some tephra layers are missing as macroscopic layers in several cores, with only two of the five tephra layers visible in the sediment of three lakes. Likewise, previous studies of lake sediment cores from the region are missing the four youngest tephra layers, further highlighting the need to sample multiple lakes to reconstruct a comprehensive history of fallout events. The newly documented stratigraphic marker layers will benefit future studies of lake sediments in Cajas National Park. © 2020, Servicio Nacional de Geologia y Mineria.

The methodology applied includes an estimation of the bike's range under different routes and riders, the riders' opinions and a financial evaluation of the hydrogen fuel cost compared to other urban vehicle alternatives. The results showed a minimum median range-to-energy consumption ratio of 20.5 km/kWh, while the maximum hydrogen cost was found to reach 0.025 €/km when refuelling the hydrogen bicycle in an autonomous hydrogen station.

It limits greenhouse gas emissions of its member states and aims at facilitating an efficient allocation of emission reduction across national borders. Accompanying this policy at the European level, individual member states have introduced national mitigation policies, including renewable energy (RES) expansion measures or coal phase-outs. This study examines to what extent national policies affect the effectiveness of the EU ETS and to what degree the impact is reflected in prices for European Union Allowances (EUA). To investigate this question, a fundamental optimization model of the European electricity markets is deployed and model endogenous EUA prices are derived with a set of future market scenarios. Overall findings indicate that fundamental market forces strongly affect EUA prices. Furthermore, national policies play a critical role: The expansion of RES does not affect the capacity of the EU ETS to provide sufficient price signals for the desired level of decarbonization but a coal phase-out has a strong price-suppressing effect. A withdrawal of certificates can re-establish the effectiveness of the EU ETS but prices can rise drastically when overestimating the necessary amount. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Coal phase-out; Energy systems analysis; EU ETS; Renewable energies","Carbon; Coal; Coal industry; Commerce; Emission control; Expansion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International law; Carbon mitigation policies; Climate protection; Efficient allocations; Emission reduction; Emission trading systems; Mitigation policies; Optimization modeling; Suppressing effects; Costs; alternative energy; carbon emission; coal; emission control; emissions trading; environmental policy; European Union; mitigation; optimization; pollution tax; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085751015

Cactus pear production structures and costs are different in the three countries: Mexico (939.77 €), Italy (4.055.1 €) and Spain (9453.77 €). Spain does not present a real productive sector but only isolated farms. Opuntia is an interesting opportunity for non-food production due to the amount of its bioactive compounds. Main components (μg g−1 dried weight) are: kaempferol (34), myrcetin (65), isorhamnetin and derivatives (590), luteolin (8.4), ferulic acid and derivatives (1,050), and catechin (50). Obtaining these compounds could be a way of increasing cactus pear production profitability and creating jobs and value in rural areas. Cactus pear cultivation is a successful tool to mitigate climate change in arid and semiarid regions considering adequate farm and cultivation practices and systems. This crop is often located in high rurality areas, cultivated by small and micro-farmers.

In this review, we discuss recent progress in climatic adaptation in plants. We evaluate whether climate change exerts novel selection and disrupts local adaptation, whether gene flow can facilitate adaptive responses to climate change, and whether adaptive phenotypic plasticity could sustain populations in the short term. Furthermore, we discuss how climate change influences species interactions. Through a more in-depth understanding of these eco-evolutionary dynamics, we will increase our capacity to predict the adaptive potential of plants under climate change. In addition, we review studies that dissect the genetic basis of plant adaptation to climate change. Finally, we highlight key research gaps, ranging from validating gene function to elucidating molecular mechanisms, expanding research systems from model species to other natural species, testing the fitness consequences of alleles in natural environments, and designing multifactorial studies that more closely reflect the complex and interactive effects of multiple climate change factors. By leveraging interdisciplinary tools (e.g., cutting-edge omics toolkits, novel ecological strategies, newly developed genome editing technology), researchers can more accurately predict the probability that species can persist through this rapid and intense period of environmental change, as well as cultivate crops to withstand climate change, and conserve biodiversity in natural systems. © 2020 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences","candidate genes; evolutionary potential; genomics; landscape genomics; selection",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089068151

Moreover, the transportation process and its energy consumption are non-negligible during the entire workshop production process. In practice, cutting tool degradation during operation is inevitable, which causes the actual processing time of work to be extended, so it is necessary to consider the degradation effects and imperfect maintenance. To reduce the total energy consumption in the manufacturing workshop with degradation effects and imperfect maintenance, this paper constructs a novel integrated optimization model including the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), forklift transportation and imperfect cutting tool maintenance. First, an imperfect cutting tool maintenance with degradation effect strategy is presented, which makes the actual processing time of each operation more closely approximate the real-world processing situation. Second, an integrated multi-objective optimization model is formulated to simultaneously minimize the makespan, total tardiness, total production cost and total energy consumption. Third, a hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with Pareto elite storage strategy (HMOEA/P) is proposed to address the model. More precisely, three improved operations are presented: hybrid dominance principle, local search algorithms and Pareto elite preservation strategy. The effectiveness and feasibility of the parameter setting, improved operations and the proposed algorithm are separately demonstrated by the comparative experiments.

The results showed that: (1) China's overall electricity demand will continue to increase in 2020, with southern and northern provinces showing stronger increases than other provinces. (2) The marginal abatement cost of each region was calculated, thus gaining an optimal three-stage form of IBCT. (3) The comparison indicated that the emission reduction efficiency of the IBCT was 23.1% higher than the FCT under the premise of equal emission reduction. The study suggests that IBCT is a more efficient type of carbon tax policy compared to FCT. Implementing IBCT can be conducive to achieving the dual goals of reducing cost burden and carbon emission in China's thermal power industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission reduction; Carbon tax; Data envelopment analysis; Support vector regression; Thermal power generation","Carbon; Climate change; Data envelopment analysis; Economic analysis; Emission control; Support vector regression; Taxation; Adverse effect; Carbon emissions; Electricity demands; Emission reduction; Global climate changes; Marginal abatement costs; Reducing costs; Support vector regression (SVR); Costs; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission control; pollution tax; pricing policy; regression analysis; thermal power; Article; controlled study; electricity; environmental policy; flat carbon tax pricing; government; growth rate; health care cost; increasing block carbon tax pricing; industry; kernel method; prediction; priority journal; process optimization; radial basis function; tax; thermal power industry; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085176575

Air pollution has become a major problem around the world and is increasingly an issue in Togo due to increased vehicular traffic. Gaseous pollutants are released by engines and are very harmful to human health and the environment. The fuels used on the major road in Togo, the N2, are adulterated with unknown contents and are of poor quality. Many of the vehicles come from neighboring countries, such as Benin, Ghana and Nigeria. Objectives. The present study aims to evaluate the pollution rate in Togo through the estimation of the concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particular matter (PM) on the international road, the National Road N2, in Lome, compared to the World Health Organization's (WHO) standard limit. Methods. The simulations of pollutant concentration were performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short Term Version 3 model, which is included in the United States Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (USEPA) AERMOD View software. The meteorological averages data were obtained from the local station near the National Road N2 in Togo in 2018. Hourly averages were calculated according to the European Monitoring Evaluation Programme/European Environmental Agency air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2016 and were processed using AERMET View and a terrain pre-processor, AERMAP. For the model, the sources of pollution were the vehicles traveling on the road segment. The source was a line volume with 20 m of width and 2 m of height. The estimation methodology covered exhaust emissions of NOx, SO2 and PM contained in the fuel. Results. The simulations provided average hourly, daily and annual concentrations of the different pollutants: 71.91 μg/m3, 42.41 μg/m3,11.23 μg/m3 for SO2; 16.78 μg/m3, 9.89 μg/ m3, 2.46 μg/m3 for NOx and below the detection limit, 0.62 μg/m3, 0.15 μg/m3 for PM, respectively. These results indicate that on the National Road N2 in Togo, the concentrations of SO2 were high compared to those of NOx and PM. The daily average concentration of SO2 was twice the permissible limits set by the WHO. Conclusions. Emissions obtained from the AERMOD for NOx and PM were less than the permissible limits set by the WHO, while the rate of SO2 was twice the permissible limit. The fuels used on this road were very rich in sulfur. The sulfur level in fuels must be monitored by stakeholders in Togo. Competing Interests.

Its main goal (as a first step) is to show the relevance of using a highly detailed spatial and temporal modeling tool of the Portuguese electricity system in order to be able to adequately capture climate variability in the planning of the system up to 2050. To do so, we consider seasonal and intraday hydro, wind and solar resources variability in a large TIMES energy system model, in the eTIMES_PT model. Existing hydro, wind and thermal powerplants are modelled individually, whereas new plants are modelled at municipality level. The importance of introducing climate variability is assessed by modeling six scenarios: a reference case and both “humid” and “dry” hydropower scenarios. Each of these is also modelled with CO2 emissions cap by 2050. Results show that hydropower electricity generation variations are within range of those referred in literature by other authors. However, in this work, we are able to capture higher variations within seasons and time of day. Also, the analysis enables to account for the combined variability of hydro, PV and wind resources. This variability will subsequently consider data from seasonal forecasts and climate projections. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change and adaptation; Climate variability; Climate/energy modeling; Renewable power; Spatial and temporal disaggregation","Hydroelectric power; Wind power; Climate projection; Climate variability; Electricity system; Energy system model; Hydropower electricity; Seasonal forecasts; Solar resources; Spatial and temporal modeling; Climatology; climate change; electricity generation; energy resource; hydroelectric power; photovoltaic system; wind power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086923371

Two ambient air quality monitoring (AQM) stations were utilized separately at six locations near major roadways (each location for 2 months) to monitor carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The study aimed to measure the concentration of near-road TRAP in a city hot spots and develop a validated dispersion model via performance measures. The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Line Source Model was implemented in which the pollutant emission factors were obtained through Comprehensive Modal Emission Model (CMEM) and COmputer Programme to calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT) model. Traffic data of all vehicle categories under normal driving conditions including average vehicle speed limits and local meteorological conditions were included in the modeling study. The analysis of monitoring data showed that hourly (00:00 to 23:00) concentrations of CO were within the US EPA limits, while NOx concentration was exceeded in most locations. Also, the measured pollutant levels were consistent with hourly peak and off-peak traffic volumes. The overall primary statistical performance measures showed that COPERT model was better than CMEM due to the high sensitivity of CMEM to the local meteorological factors. The best fractional bias (0.47 and 0.39), normalized mean square error (0.44 and 0.50), correlation coefficient (0.64 and 0.70), geometric mean bias (1.07 and 1.57), and geometric variance (2.00 and 2.32) were obtained for CO and NOx, respectively. However, the bootstrap 95% CI estimates over normalized mean square error, fractional bias, and correlation coefficient for COPERT and CMEM were found to be statistically significant from 0 in the case of combined model comparison across all the traffic locations for both CO and NOx. In overall, certain roads showed weak performance mainly due to the terrain features and the lack of reliable background concentrations, which need to be considered in the future study. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AERMOD; Air pollution; CMEM; COPERT IV; Emissions; Road traffic","air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); model validation; numerical model; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; traffic emission; Masqat [Oman]; Oman; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Oman; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Oman; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086001574

Among building materials, wood not only produces fewer emissions according to life-cycle assessment but can also store carbon. This study aims to estimate the carbon storage potential of new European buildings between 2020 and 2040. While studies on this issue exist, they mainly present rough estimations or are based on a small number of case studies. To ensure a reliable estimation, 50 different case buildings were selected and reviewed. The carbon storage per m2 of each case building was calculated and three types of wooden buildings were identified based on their carbon storage capacity. Finally, four European construction scenarios were generated based on the percentage of buildings constructed from wood and the type of wooden buildings. The annual captured CO2 varied between 1 and 55 Mt, which is equivalent to between 1% and 47% of CO2 emissions from the cement industry in Europe. This study finds that the carbon storage capacity of buildings is not significantly influenced by the type of building, the type of wood or the size of the building but rather by the number and the volume of wooden elements used in the structural and non-structural components of the building. It is recommended that policymakers aiming for carbon-neutral construction focus on the number of wooden elements in buildings rather than more general indicators, such as the amount of wood construction, or even detailed indirect indicators, such as building type, wood type or building size. A practical scenario is proposed for use by European decision-makers, and the role of wood in green building certification is discussed. © 2020 The Author(s).

The environmental parameters regulating microbe-organic matter interactions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in northern permafrost peatlands are however still largely unknown. The objective of this work is to understand controls on SOM degradation and its impact on porewater GHG concentrations across the Stordalen Mire, a thawing peat plateau in Northern Sweden. Here, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize SOM molecular composition in peat soil samples from the active layers of a Sphagnum-dominated bog and rich fen sites in the Mire. Microbe-organic matter interactions and porewater GHG concentrations across the thaw gradient were controlled by aboveground vegetation and soil pH. An increasingly high abundance of reduced organic compounds experiencing greater humification rates due to enhanced microbial activity were observed with increasing thaw, in parallel with higher CH4 and CO2 porewater concentrations. Bog SOM however contained more Sphagnum-derived phenolics, simple carbohydrates, and organic- acids. The low degradation of bog SOM by microbial communities, the enhanced SOM transformation by potentially abiotic mechanisms, and the accumulation of simple carbohydrates in the bog sites could be attributed in part to the low pH conditions of the system associated with Sphagnum mosses. We show that Gibbs free energy of C half reactions based on C oxidation state for OM can be used as a quantifiable measure for OM decomposability and quality to enhance current biogeochemical models to predict C decomposition rates. We found a direct association between OM chemical diversity and δ13C-CH4 in peat porewater; where higher substrate diversity was positively correlated with enriched δ13C-CH4 in fen sites. Oxidized sulfur-containing compounds, produced by Sphagnum, were further hypothesized to control GHG emissions by acting as electron acceptors for a sulfate-reducing electron transport chain, inhibiting methanogenesis in peat bogs. These results suggest that warming-induced permafrost thaw might increase organic matter lability, in subset of sites that become wetlands, and shift biogeochemical processes toward faster decomposition with an increasing proportion of carbon released as CH4. © Copyright © 2020 AminiTabrizi, Wilson, Fudyma, Hodgkins, Heyman, Rich, Saleska, Chanton and Tfaily.","bog; fen; mass spectrometry; peatlands; permafrost; soil organic matter; sphagnum","Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Carbohydrates; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Electron transport properties; Free energy; Gas emissions; Gibbs free energy; Greenhouse gases; Mass spectrometry; Peat; Permafrost; Sulfur compounds; Thawing; Wetlands; Biogeochemical process; Electron transport chain; Environmental parameter; High resolution mass spectrometry; Microbial decomposition; Molecular compositions; Porewater concentrations; Terrestrial ecosystems; Soil pollution; bog; concentration (composition); decomposition; emission inventory; fen; greenhouse gas; methane; peatland; permafrost; plateau; soil degradation; soil organic matter; thawing; warming; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092460459

Participation in such services induces changes in mobility behaviour as well as vehicle ownership patterns that could have positive environmental impacts. This study contributes to the understanding of the total mobility-related greenhouse gas emissions reduction related to business-to-consumer car-sharing participation. A comprehensive model which takes into account distances travelled annually by the major urban transport modes as well as their life-cycle emissions factors is proposed, and the before-and-after analysis is conducted for an average car-sharing member in three geographical cases (Netherlands, San Francisco, Calgary). In addition to non-operational emissions for all the transport modes involved, this approach considers the rebound effects associated with the modal shift effect (substituting driving distances with alternative modes) and the lifetime shift effect for the shared automobiles, phenomena which have been barely analysed in the previous studies. As a result, in contrast to the previous impact assessments in the field, a significantly more modest reduction of the annual total mobility-related life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions caused by car-sharing participation has been estimated, 3–18% for three geographical case studies investigated (versus up to 67% estimated previously). This suggests the significance of the newly considered effects and provides with the practical implications for improved assessments in the future. © 2020 The Authors","Car sharing; Carbon footprint; GHG emissions; LCA; Lifetime; Rebound effects","Artificial life; Automobiles; Automotive industry; Emission control; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Particulate emissions; Urban transportation; Business to Consumer; Comprehensive model; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Impact assessments; Life cycle emissions; Life cycle perspectives; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Sharing platforms; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084507704

Lifestyle and environmental factors, particularly endocrine-disrupting pollutants, have been suggested to play a role in breast cancer risk. Current epidemiological studies, although not fully consistent, suggest a positive association of breast cancer risk with exposure to several International Agency for Research on Cancer Group 1 air-pollutant carcinogens, such as particulate matter, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), dioxins, Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and cadmium. However, epidemiological studies remain scarce and inconsistent. It has been proposed that the menopausal status could modify the relationship between pollutants and breast cancer and that the association varies with hormone receptor status. Objective: The XENAIR project will investigate the association of breast cancer risk (overall and by hormone receptor status) with chronic exposure to selected air pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), BaP, dioxins, PCB-153, and cadmium. Methods: Our research is based on a case-control study nested within the French national E3N cohort of 5222 invasive breast cancer cases identified during follow-up from 1990 to 2011, and 5222 matched controls. A questionnaire was sent to all participants to collect their lifetime residential addresses and information on indoor pollution. We will assess these exposures using complementary models of land-use regression, atmospheric dispersion, and regional chemistry-transport (CHIMERE) models, via a Geographic Information System. Associations with breast cancer risk will be modeled using conditional logistic regression models. We will also study the impact of exposure on DNA methylation and interactions with genetic polymorphisms. Appropriate statistical methods, including Bayesian modeling, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis, will be used to assess the impact of multipollutant exposure. The fraction of breast cancer cases attributable to air pollution will be estimated. Results: The XENAIR project will contribute to current knowledge on the health effects of air pollution and identify and understand environmental modifiable risk factors related to breast cancer risk. Conclusions: The results will provide relevant evidence to governments and policy-makers to improve effective public health prevention strategies on air pollution. The XENAIR dataset can be used in future efforts to study the effects of exposure to air pollution associated with other chronic conditions. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

It assessed their attitude, behavioural motivation for mitigating and adapting to climate change in the two capital cities of South Asia: Islamabad in Pakistan and Dhaka in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the quantitative research technique based on responses of 800 close-ended questions embedded in a close-ended questionnaire, which were filled-out from randomly selected sample of respondents. The primary data was analysed and presented through tabulation. For binary dependent variables, the standardised logistic coefficients were projected for more reliable estimates. Findings: The findings reveal that the population of both capital cities have a low personal perception of climate change. Also, the dwellers of both cities have a low level of motivation to take mitigative and adaptive measures against climatic hazards. The results of the logistic regression model further indicate that the people who believe that climate change is a threat to their lives are more likely to adopt mitigative and adaptive strategies. This mostly applies to the people with a relatively higher income and education level. Research limitations/implications: This study implies to create awareness and sensitise the local community in both the capitals and beyond through information dissemination. Further, the availability of toolkits to handle emergencies remains imperative in registering attitudinal and behavioural changes to reduce the impacts of climate variability in poor localities. Originality/value: This research study analysed the link between climate change mitigation and energy conservation from the societal attributes of perception, motivation, attitude and behaviour, which remains essential for community-based mitigation against climatic hazards. © 2020, Shahzad Alvi and Umer Khayyam.","Adaptation; Attitudes; Behavior; Climate change; Mitigation; South Asia","adaptive management; attitudinal survey; behavioral response; climate change; mitigation; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; Bangladesh; Dhaka [Bangladesh]; Islamabad [Pakistan]; Pakistan; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086786487

Seasonal planning of the electricity system is currently mainly adressed using climatological approach to handle variability of consumption and production. Our study addresses the need for quantitative measures of the risk of supply-demand imbalance, exploring the use of sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasts which have hitherto not been exploited for this purpose. In this study, the risk of supply-demand imbalance is defined using exclusively the wind energy production and the consumption peak at 7 pm. To forecast the risks of supply-demand imbalance at monthly to seasonal time horizons, a statistical model is developed to reconstruct the joint probability of consumption and production. It is based on a the conditional probability of production and consumption with respect to indexes obtained from a linear regression of principal components of large-scale atmospheric predictors. By integrating the joint probability of consumption and production over different areas, we define two kind of risk measures: one quantifies the probablity of deviating from the climatological means, while the other, which is the value at risk at 95% confidence level (VaR95) of the difference between consumption and production, quantifies extreme risks of imbalance. In the first case, the reconstructed risk accurately reproduces the actual risk with over 0.80 correlation in time, and a hit rate around 70–80%. In the second case, we find a mean absolute error (MAE) between the reconstructed and real extreme risk of 2.5 to 2.8 GW, a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV-RMSE) of 3.8% to 4.2% of the mean actual VaR95 and a correlation of 0.69 and 0.66 for winter and fall, respectively. By applying our model to ensemble forecasts performed with a numerical weather prediction model, we show that forecasted risk measures up to 1 month horizon can outperform the climatology often used as the reference forecast (time correlation with actual risk ranging between 0.54 and 0.82). At seasonal time horizon (3 months), our forecasts seem to tend to the climatology. © 2020 by the authors.

In light of these concerns, this study explores the boundaries of governments' persuasion of citizens through branding and symbolic communications. Building on social psychology and marketing research, I hypothesize that citizens are less susceptible to persuasion by branding the more they perceive the policy issue as personally relevant. I test this expectation through a survey experiment, focused on air pollution policy in Israel, exploiting the natural variation in the perceived personal relevance between citizens residing in a polluted area in the country and others. The results indicate that even high levels of perceived personal relevance do not attenuate the effect of symbolic brand elements. This means that the boundaries of persuasion and manipulation through branding are wider than expected. © 2019 The Author.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance our knowledge about the effects of forest structure on albedo. Here, we present a global assessment of the links between forest structure and albedo at a 1-km spatial resolution using generalized additive models (GAMs). We used remotely sensed data to obtain variables representing forest structure, including forest density, leaf area index, and tree cover, during the peak growing season in 2005 with pure forest pixels that cover ~7% of the Earth's surface. Furthermore, we estimated black-sky albedo at a solar zenith angle of 38° using the most recent collection of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; version 6) at shortwave, near-infrared, and visible spectral regions. In addition, for the first time, we mapped the magnitude of the relationship between forest structure and albedo at each pixel with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. Our results suggested that forest structure may modulate albedo in most of the sub-biomes. The response of shortwave albedo was always positive to the leaf area index and negative to the tree cover (except for deciduous broadleaf forests in mediterranean and temperate regions), while the response to forest density varied across space in 2005. The spatial map affirmed that the links between forest structure and albedo vary over geographical locations. In sum, our study emphasized the importance of forest structure in the surface albedo regulation. This paper provides the first spatially explicit evidence of the magnitude of relationships between forest structure and albedo on a global scale. © 2020 The Authors","Albedo; Forest density; Forest structure; Leaf area index; Tree cover","Earth (planet); Image resolution; Infrared devices; Pixels; Radiometers; Solar radiation; Generalized additive model; Geographical locations; Land surface albedo; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Remotely sensed data; Solar zenith angle; Spatial resolution; Visible spectral regions; Forestry; albedo; forest cover; forest ecosystem; growing season; land surface; leaf area index; MODIS; pixel; quantitative analysis; spatial resolution; tree",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084675482

Even so, efforts to mitigate these issues in arid regions have been insufficient. Thus, in this paper, further research is discussed based on data obtained from various crop and climate models. Two DSSATcrop models (CMs) (CERESWheat and N-Wheat) were calibrated with two wheat cultivars (Gemiza9 and Misr1). A baseline simulation (1981-2010) was compared with different scenarios of simulations using three Global Climate Models (GCMs) for the 2030s, 2050s and 2080s. Probable impacts of climate change were assessed using the GCMs and CMs under the high emission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5). Results predicted decreased wheat grain yields by a mean of 8.7%, 11.4% and 13.2% in the 2030s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, relative to the baseline yield. Negative impacts of climatic change are probable, despite some uncertainties within the GCMs (i. e., 2.1%, 5.0% and 8.0%) and CMs (i.e., 2.2%, 6.0% and 9.2%). Changing the planting date with a scenario of plus or minus 5 or 10 days from the common practice was assessed as a potentially effective adaptation option, which may partially offset the negative impacts of climate change. Delaying the sowing date by 10 days (from 20 November to 30 November) proved the optimum scenario and decreased further reduction in wheat yields resulting from climate change to 5.2%, 6.8% and 8.5% in the 2030s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, compared with the 20 November scenario. The planting 5-days earlier scenario showed a decreased impact on climate change adaptation. However, the 10-days early planting scenario increased yield reduction under projected climate change. The cultivar Misr1 was more resistant to rising temperature than Gemiza9. Despite the negative impacts of projected climate change on wheat production, water use efficiency would slightly increase. The ensemble of multi-model estimated impacts and adaptation uncertainties of climate change can assist decision-makers in planning climate adaptation strategies. © 2020, Higher Education Press.","adaptation; climate change; DSSAT models; scenarios; water use efficiency","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; numerical model; scenario analysis; water use efficiency; wheat; Egypt; Nile Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083967414

Due to hot climate and reduced rainfall that characterize Sicily region, white grape varieties such as Grillo cultivar cultivated in this area are characterized by very low concentrations of malic and tartaric acids. Grillo cultivar is characterized by an intense production of raceme grapes with low pH and high content of tartaric and malic acids. These fruits possess the chemical properties useful to increase the amounts of acids in the final wines. With this in mind, the present research was carried out to test the ability of four Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (CS182, GR1, MSE13 and MSE41) to ferment a raceme must with a pH of 2.9 at two concentrations (14° and 16° Babo degree) of total sugars. The inoculation of the strains was performed after a preadaptation at pH 2.5. The chemical parameters and kinetics of the fermentations were monitored. The experimental sparkling base wines were characterized by a very high total acidity with 16–17 g/L of tartaric acid and 9–10 g/L of malic acids. On the other hand, ethanol was detected at low values in the range 9–10% (v/v). The base wine obtained with GR1differed in their high acidity values, whereas trials inoculated with CS182 showed more intense odors and exotic fruit. Experimental wines produced in this study represent an innovative strategy for “blending wines” to produce sparkling wines in dry Mediterranean climate. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","alcoholic fermentation; racemes; Saccharomyces; sparkling wines; yeasts","alcohol; malic acid; tartaric acid; acid; fragrance; malic acid derivative; tartaric acid; acidity; aroma; Article; chemical analysis; chemical parameters; chemical reaction kinetics; climate; controlled study; cultivar; fermentation; fungal strain; grape; nonhuman; odor; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sensory analysis; sparkling wine; taste; wine industry; bioreactor; chemistry; classification; fermentation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Vitis; wine; Acids; Bioreactors; Fermentation; Malates; Odorants; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Tartrates; Taste; Vitis; Wine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088247811

In thin films, processes such as charge conduction, light absorption, and emission are governed not only by the structure of the individual molecules but also by their supramolecular structures and intermolecular interactions to a large extent. Electronic circular dichroism, ECD, and its emission counterpart, circularly polarized luminescence, CPL, provide tools for studying aggregated states and the key properties to be sought for designing innovative devices. In this review, we shall present a comprehensive coverage of chiroptical properties measured on thin films of organic π-conjugated molecules. In the first part, we shall discuss some general concepts of ECD, CPL, and other chiroptical spectroscopies, with a focus on their applications to thin film samples. In the following, we will overview the existing literature on chiral π-conjugated systems whose thin films have been characterized by ECD and/or CPL, as well other chiroptical spectroscopies.

Understanding the factors enabling deep decarbonization of the passenger vehicle sector is essential for planning the required infrastructure investments and technology adoption policies. We examine the requirements for meeting carbon reduction targets of 80% and higher for passenger vehicle transport in the United States (US) by midcentury under uncertainty. We model the changes needed in vehicle electrification, electricity carbon intensity, and travel demand. Since growth in fleet penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) is constrained by fleet stock turnover, we estimate the EV penetration rates needed to meet climate targets. We find for a base case level of passenger vehicle travel, midcentury deep decarbonization of US passenger transport is conditional on reducing the electricity generation carbon intensity to close to zero along with electrification of about 67% or 84% of vehicle travel to meet decarbonization targets of 80% or 90%, respectively. Higher electricity generation carbon intensity and degraded EV fuel economy due to automation would require higher levels of fleet electrification and/or further constrain the total vehicle travel allowable. Transportation deep decarbonization not only depends on electricity decarbonization, but also has a total travel budget, representing a maximum total vehicle travel threshold that still enables meeting a midcentury climate target. This makes encouraging ride sharing, reducing total vehicle travel, and increasing fuel economy in both human-driven and future automated vehicles increasingly important to deep decarbonization. © 2020 The Author(s).

Of particular interest within light harvesting MOFs containing porphyrin chromophores is the extent to which the both environment of the porphyrin and the porphyrin conformation modulate the photophysical properties. With this in mind, a new MOF (RWLAA-1) has been synthesized based on zinc cations linked by zinc(ii) tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (ZnTPyP) and benzene tricarboxylate (H3BTC) linkers in which the porphyrin exhibits significant conformational distortions that have a profound effect on the photophysics of the material including bathochromic shifts in both the optical (Soret and visible bands) and emission bands, reduction in the energy separation between the Q(0,0) and Q(0,1) emission bands and shorter singlet and triplet state lifetimes. These effects are consistent with the porphyrin deformation resulting in changes in the porphyrin electronic structure and excited state conformational dynamics that alter the vibronic coupling between the excited states (S1 and T1) and the S0 ground state. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chromophores; Deformation; Electronic structure; Excited states; Ground state; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organic polymers; Organometallics; Photophysics; Zinc compounds; Bathochromic shift; Conformational dynamics; Energy separations; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Photophysical properties; Porphyrin chromophores; Singlet and triplet state; Vibronic coupling; Porphyrins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089922734

Employing theory of planned behavior (TPB) in an expanded model, this study collected data from 420 underprivileged households from 10 states in Malaysia using a survey questionnaire. Final analysis is performed using two methods, one being the well-established, conventional way of partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM); the other being a frontier technology of computing using artificial neural network (ANN), which is generated through a deep learning algorithm to achieve the maximum possible accuracy for each of the five scenarios aforementioned. The study found that perceived benefits (PB) and eco-literacy (EL) have a significant positive effect on the attitude towards environment (ATE) while normative belief (NB) and motivation (MO) have a significant positive effect on subjective norms (SUN). Perceived control (PC) has a significant positive effect on perceived behavioral control (PBC). ATE, SUN, and PBC have a significant positive effect on the intention towards community forestry (ITCF), whereas the ITCF has a significant positive effect on community forestry adoption behavior (CFAB). When formulating and enforcing carbon reduction and poverty elevating programs through community forestry, the Malaysian government should consider the perceptions of poor families and the prerogative from their special reference groups to enhance the perceived ability of the vulnerable groups for positive and effective pro-environmental behavior that can lead to sustainable forestry management. © 2020 by the authors.","Community forestry; Low-income; Malaysia; Theory of planned behavior","adoption behavior; algorithm; artificial neural network; attitudinal survey; carbon emission; community forestry; ecological modeling; forest management; government; household survey; perception; planning theory; poverty alleviation; psychology; public attitude; questionnaire survey; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091580891

A social cohesion index is constructed by summing subjective indicators of trust, mutual co-operation and confidence in collective action. Controlling for a large number of individual, household and community characteristics and village fixed effects, the regression results reveal a significant positive relationship between the social cohesion index and willingness to pay for polder improvement.

We used the new Planck PR3 maps to characterize Galactic dust emission at high latitudes as a foreground to the CMB polarization and use end-to-end simulations to compute uncertainties and assess the statistical significance of our measurements. We present Planck EE, BB, and TE power spectra of dust polarization at 353 GHz for a set of six nested high-Galactic-latitude sky regions covering from 24 to 71% of the sky. We present power-law fits to the angular power spectra, yielding evidence for statistically significant variations of the exponents over sky regions and a difference between the values for the EE and BB spectra, which for the largest sky region are αEE = -2.42 ± 0.02 and αBB = -2.54 ± 0.02, respectively. The spectra show that the TE correlation and E/B power asymmetry discovered by Planck extend to low multipoles that were not included in earlier Planck polarization papers due to residual data systematics. We also report evidence for a positive TB dust signal. Combining data from Planck and WMAP, we have determined the amplitudes and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of polarized foregrounds, including the correlation between dust and synchrotron polarized emission, for the six sky regions as a function of multipole. This quantifies the challenge of the component-separation procedure that is required for measuring the low-ℓ reionization CMB E-mode signal and detecting the reionization and recombination peaks of primordial CMB B modes. The SED of polarized dust emission is fit well by a single-temperature modified black-body emission law from 353 GHz to below 70 GHz. For a dust temperature of 19.6 K, the mean dust spectral index for dust polarization is βdP = 1.53±0.02. The difference between indices for polarization and total intensity is βdP-βdI = 0.05±0.03. By fitting multi-frequency cross-spectra between Planck data at 100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, we examine the correlation of the dust polarization maps across frequency. We find no evidence for a loss of correlation and provide lower limits to the correlation ratio that are tighter than values we derive from the correlation of the 217- and 353 GHz maps alone. If the Planck limit on decorrelation for the largest sky region applies to the smaller sky regions observed by sub-orbital experiments, then frequency decorrelation of dust polarization might not be a problem for CMB experiments aiming at a primordial B-mode detection limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r≃ 0.01 at the recombination peak. However, the Planck sensitivity precludes identifying how difficult the component-separation problem will be for more ambitious experiments targeting lower limits on r. © Planck Collaboration 2020.","Cosmic background radiation; Dust; Extinction; ISM: magnetic fields; ISM: structure; Polarization; Submillimeter: diffuse background","Cosmology; Polarization; Power spectrum; Spectroscopy; Uncertainty analysis; B-Mode polarization; Component separation; Cosmic microwave backgrounds; End-to-end simulation; Galactic latitude; Polarized emissions; Spectral energy distribution; Statistical significance; Dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092300272

Despite several studies, the interactions between carbon nanofibers and Portland cement hydration products are not fully understood, with significant implications for the mechanical response and the durability at the macroscopic lengthscale. Thus, the research objective is to investigate the influence of carbon nanofibers on the nanostructure and on the distribution of hydration products within Portland cement paste. Portland cement w/c = 0.44 specimens reinforced with 0.0 wt%, 0.1 wt%, and 0.5 wt% CNF by mass fraction of cement are cast using a novel synthesis procedure. A uniform dispersion of carbon nanofibers (CNF) via a multi-step approach: after pre-dispersing carbon nanofibers using ultrasonic energy, the carbon nanofibers are further dispersed using un-hydrated cement particles in high shear mixing and mechanical stirring steps. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy analysis shows that carbon nanofibers fill nanopores and connect calcium-silicate hydrates (C-S-H) grains. Grid nano-indentation testing shows that Carbon nanofibers influence the probability distribution function of the local packing density by inducing a shift towards higher values, η = 0.76-0.93. Statistical deconvolution analysis shows that carbon nanofibers result in an increase in the fraction of high-density C-S-H by 6.7% from plain cement to cement + 0.1 wt% CNF and by 10.7% from plain cement to cement + 0.5 wt% CNF. Moreover, CNF lead to an increase in the C-S-H gel porosity and a decrease in both the capillary porosity and the total porosity. Based on scratch testing, adding 0.1 wt% CNF yields a 4.5% increase in fracture toughness and adding 0.5 wt% CNF yields a 7.6% increase in fracture toughness. Finally, micromechanical modelling predicts an increase of respectively 5.97% and 21.78% in the average Young's modulus following CNF modification at 0.1 wt% CNF and 0.5 wt% CNF levels. © 2020 by the author.","Calcium silicate hydrates; Carbon nanofibers; Cement; Fracture toughness; Nanostructure; Pore structure","Calcium silicate; Cement industry; Distribution functions; Elastic moduli; Fracture mechanics; Fracture testing; Fracture toughness; Hydration; Nanostructures; Porosity; Portland cement; Reinforcement; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicates; Calcium silicate hydrate; Cementitious composites; High-resolution scanning electron microscopies; Micromechanical modelling; Multi-functional materials; Multi-step approaches; Portland cement paste; Statistical deconvolution; Carbon nanofibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090937717

The serious challenges of MIS include low water use efficiency and limited available water resources. The objective of this study is to analyze the current and future irrigation water resource availability for the improvement of future water management. A Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a public domain software supported by the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service in Bushland, TX, USA, was used to estimate the current and future water resources availability from the MIS's main irrigation water supply sources (River Thiba and River Nyamindi). CropWat, a computer program developed by the Land and Water Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Rome, Italy, was used to estimate irrigation water requirements from 2013-2016 and into the future (2020-2060 and 2061-2099). Future climatic data for total available flow and irrigation requirement estimations were downloaded from three General Circulation Models (GCMs). The data was bias corrected and down-scaled (with observed data) using a Climate Change Toolkit, a toolkit for climate change analysis developed by the Water Weather and Energy Ecosystem, Zurich, Switzerland. The results indicated that the highest irrigation water deficits were experienced in July and August based on the existing cropping pattern. Under a proposed future pattern, estimates show that MIS will experience water deficits mainly from June to October and from January to February. This study recommends that MIS management should put into strong consideration the simulated future estimates in irrigation water availability for the improvement of water management. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; SWAT; Water resources availability","Agricultural robots; Irrigation; Open source software; Soil moisture; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural Research Services; Food and agriculture organizations; General circulation model; Irrigation requirements; Irrigation water requirements; Soil water assessment tool; United states department of agricultures; Water resources availability; Climate change; cereal; climate change; irrigation system; resource availability; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; water management; water resource; water use; Bushland; Italy; Kenya; Kirinyaga; Lazio; Mwea; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; Texas; United States; Zurich",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090285535

City logistics represents a strategy of efficient freight transportation and material handling to fulfill customer and business demands. Within the frame of this paper, the authors describe an optimization model of a multi-echelon collection and distribution system, focusing on downtown areas and energy efficiency, sustainability, and emission reduction. After a systematic literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model of collection and distribution problems, including package delivery, municipal waste collection, home delivery services, and supply of supermarkets and offices. The object of the optimization model is twofold: firstly, to design the optimal structure of the multi-echelon collection and distribution system, including layout planning and the determination of required transportation resources, like e-cars, e-bikes, and the use of public transportation; and secondly, to optimize the operation strategy of the multi-echelon supply chain, including resource allocation and scheduling problems.

Concomitantly, this has caused conflict between renewable energy development and local communities over landscape changes. This study aims to clarify the factors of conflict and find a way of conflict management. A case study on Japan is used, where a solar rush occurred due to the feed-in tariff (FIT) system. We analyze the public reasons to worry about renewable energy and the spatial characteristics of its locations. A socio-spatial approach is used by first utilizing a qualitative survey based on questionnaires and interviews with the local governments to understand the awareness regarding the issues, and then utilizing a quantitative survey on the location changes to solar power by using GIS. The results suggest that there were links between local governments' concerns and the location of solar power concentration. These results show that conflicts over renewable energy are not unavoidable and may be managed by local governments that can act as intermediaries with sufficient knowledge of the local communities. © 2020 by the authors.","Conflict management; Landscape; Local community; Peri-urban agricultural area; Renewable energy; Solar rush",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090495101

ESs can be evaluated to analyze the ecological and environmental changes caused by LUCCs. This research aims to estimate variations in the ecosystem services value (ESV) due to LUCCs in Lahore of Pakistan, and to offer information and recommendations to policy-makers concerned with the economic improvement of metropolis areas. We first investigated the historical LUCCs from 1990 to 2019, and then simulated the future land use/cover in 2030 and 2050 based on the CA-Markov model under three scenarios, including business-as-usual (BAU), rapid economic growth (REG), and coordinated environmental sustainability (CES). Subsequently, we evaluated the ESV from 1990 to 2050 and evaluated the historical and potential future ESV changes induced by LUCCs during 1990–2019 and 2019–2050, respectively. The results showed that, land use/cover exhibited an increase in built-up land and decreases in vegetation, water body, and unused land both in the past and future. The net ESV decreased from 58.26 million USD in 1990 to 50.31 million USD in 2019. In 2050, the decrease in ESV is most rapid under the REG scenario (decrease ESV of 7.13 million USD and decrease percentage of 14.18%), followed by the BAU (decrease ESV of 5.61 million USD and decrease percentage of 11.15%) and CES (decrease ESV of 5.18 million USD and decrease percentage of 10.30%) scenarios. For each ecosystem service type, the ESV of waste treatment decreased by 18.37% from 1990 to 2019, followed by soil formation and conservation (17.52%), biodiversity and maintenance (13.23%), climate regulation (11.80%), food production (11.69%), hydrological regulation (11.11%), and aesthetic value (3.07%).

Such a model is essential, in particular, for designing climate control strategies for optimizing both the comfort level and the energy consumption. However, a building is a complex system characterized by a nonlinear thermal behavior, so the task to find such a reliable model is rather difficult. This paper aims at overcoming some of these difficulties by presenting a data driven approach based on a switched system identification to detect and model the thermal behavior of a building zone during normal usage. The proposed technique relies on a PieceWise AutoRegressive model with eXogeneous inputs (PWARX) consisting of a set of sub-models with each one of them describing a certain configuration/state of the dwelling, e.g. turning the heating ON/OFF or opening/closing windows, doors and shutters. The approach is data-driven, easy to implement and its computational time is inferior to creating a detailed model under a specialized software. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for providing a quick description of the thermal behavior of existing buildings for which it is possible to install sensors and perform measurements. Using the available measurements, the algorithm is able to detect various configurations as will be shown by two numerical examples. Such a collection of sub-models provides a better temperature estimate than using ARX models, so it will eventually allow to select better strategies for improving energy efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building thermal modeling; Hybrid model; PWARX; System identification","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Identification (control systems); Religious buildings; Auto regressive models; Building Thermal models; Control strategies; Data-driven approach; Hybrid model; Indoor environment; PWARX; Specialized software; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082847513

The variables (i.e. CO2 emissions, environmental related technological change, fossil fuel and renewable energy consumption, and economic output) are used to predict CO2 emissions. The results find that the emissions intensity will continue to rise in BICS region. However, the significant progress at environmental technology front can reduce the CO2 emissions intensity while achieving the economic growth targets. The results also find that the fossil fuels will remain the significant source of energy mix in BICS countries. The use of renewable energy is expected to increase during the projection period.

Despite being less established, the Northwestern region of China has strategic importance and the use of renewable energy can potentially promote sustainable development in this region. Considering this aspect, this study aims to investigate the impact of renewable energy on environmental pollution in five Northwestern provinces of China during 1995–2014. This study uses the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag bounds testing approach with the structural break unit root and other specifications tests. The results indicate that renewable energy positive shock has an adverse impact on the CO2 emissions of the Northwestern provinces of China. The effect of renewable energy use varies in five provinces, i.e. it is more significant in Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang than in Ningxia and Shaanxi. However, reduction in renewable energy consumption leads to higher level of CO2 emissions and this effect is more significant for Ningxia and Shaanxi in the long run. Furthermore, the positive shockwaves in nonrenewable energy, GDP and transportation are associated with environmental pollution in these provinces both in short run and long run. Nevertheless, the impact of negative shockwaves in nonrenewable energy consumption on environmental pollution is more significant than economic development for all provinces. Our findings suggest that: cutting down fossil fuels use can substantially improve environmental quality in these provinces; depending on the provincial geographies and government strategies, the intensity of positive impact of renewable energy towards CO2 emissions reduction differs among five provinces. Likewise, renewable energy development has abundant potential to increase the economic and ecological sustainability in the Northwestern provinces of China in the long run. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption; Environmental pollution; NARDL bounds testing; Northwestern China; Renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Renewable energy resources; Bounds testing approaches; Ecological sustainability; Environmental pollutions; Environmental quality; Renewable energy consumption; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy use; Use of renewable energies; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084334879

Woody biomass has a role in sustainable energy transitions, contributing to emissions reduction, economic development, and energy security as a dispatchable resource. This potential is recognized globally, but the woody biomass supply chain has faced technical and social challenges. Smart technologies are increasingly discussed in discourse on supply chain management, such as their potential to improve transparency and efficiency. Despite a variety of research related to woody biomass as well as smart technologies, little attention has been given to integrating the two perspectives. This study explores this intersection by highlighting smart technologies and mechanisms by which they may contribute to overcoming challenges in the woody biomass supply chain, exemplified by the case of Japan. Based on qualitative expert interviews, exploratory results suggest potential of smart technologies that would contribute to addressing both social and technical challenges of woody biomass in Japan. These challenges include transportation infrastructure, biomass quality management, business model integration (cascading), stakeholder relationship management, and local community revitalization and socioeconomic development. This contribution is based on various mechanisms such as improved transparency, information-sharing, accountability, automation, and value maximization. The results of this paper delineate a potential future development path that integrates smart technologies, woody biomass supply chains, and sustainability goals.

The drive towards agricultural transformation must be accompanied by gender inclusive productivity growth. Therefore, this study analyses the effects of climate variables and livelihood diversification on gendered productivity gaps among maize farmers in Northern Ghana. Data were collected from 619 farmers and were analysed using an endogenously corrected Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition model. Results suggest the presence of a significant productivity gap of 58.8% between male and female household heads, and of 44.8% between men household heads and female spouses. About 87% and 98%, respectively, of these productivity gaps were explained by the differences in resource endowment. While livelihood diversification significantly affected gendered productivity through both endowment and coefficient effects, climate variables significantly influenced gendered productivity gaps only through the coefficient component. These results suggest the potential for reducing gendered productivity gaps by providing equal diversification opportunities and by reducing women’s vulnerability to climate change. Among livelihood activities, agro-processing could be prioritized and promoted in the region. While farmers should adopt on-farm climate adaptation strategies, extension services should tailor the provision of climate information and promote climate adaptation strategies. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; gender; Ghana; livelihood diversification; Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition; productivity gap","adaptive management; agricultural diversification; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; livelihood; maize; prioritization; productivity; vulnerability; Ghana; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075244346

For agricultural applications, however, highly localized climate conditions can be critically important. This certainly applies to tropical highland regions, where dissected topography and convectively dominated precipitation processes can lead to strong variability in both mean climate conditions and year-to-year climate variability. This study examines recent climate variability and trends (1981–2016) on Choke Mountain, located in the western Ethiopian Highlands. Through analysis of precipitation and temperature records at monitored locations, we explore observed variability in climate patterns and trends across sites and seasons. The lens for our spatial analysis is the agroecosystem (AES), defined on the basis of prevailing climate and cropping systems, which currently serve as the foundation for climate adaptation planning in the region. We find that interannual temperature variability is greatest in the hottest, driest AES, and is most pronounced in the dry season. All AES warmed significantly in all seasons over the analysis period, but the magnitude of trend was greatest in high elevation AES. Precipitation variability was also large across AES, with largest interannual variability found in the dry season. This season is frequently excluded in climate analyses, but it is a critical harvest time and irrigation period. Trends in rainfall anomaly and precipitation concentration index are less clear, but there is a tendency towards drying and increasing irregularity of rainfall. Interestingly, we find little association between the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and temperature or precipitation variability at our study sites. This suggests that even though ENSO is a widely recognized driver of large-scale rainfall variability in the region, its impacts are highly spatially variable. This has implications for applying ENSO-based precipitation outlooks to agricultural management decisions. Farmer interviews reveal that local perceptions of climate variability and trends are generally consistent with the objective observations. © 2020","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate variability; Mann-Kendal test; Sens' slope; Trend analysis","adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; agricultural management; climate change; climate conditions; cropping practice; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; perception; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; spatial analysis; trend analysis; Choke Mountains; Ethiopia; Ethiopian Highlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085581274

In retrospect. This novel study explores the relationship between agro-economic performance, the Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Total natural rent, urbanization and environmental degradation vis-à-vis (Carbon dioxide emissions) in a carbon function. The empirical analysis used a panel data for the period 1980–2014 for the selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The Kao test uncovers a cointegration between carbon dioxide emissions, Real Gross domestic product, Total natural rent, agriculture and urbanization. The panel Pooled Mean Autoregressive distributed lag model (PMG-ARDL) posits a positive and significant connection between the gross domestic product and CO2 emissions in the long run. Our examination asserts that agricultural value-added reduces emissions in sub-Saharan Africa while urbanization and natural resource rent both increases CO2 emissions in the long run. In addition, the causality analysis reveals a bidirectional link between agriculture value-added and CO2 emissions. Essentially, policymakers in African nations must pay close attention to the issues of rural-urban drift as this leads to more emissions. © 2020 The Author(s)Environmental science; Economics; Agricultural value added; Urbanization; Total natural rent; Carbon emissions; Sub-Saharan African countries. © 2020 The Author(s)","Agricultural value added; Carbon emissions; Economics; Environmental science; Sub-Saharan African countries; Total natural rent; Urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090957132

The available database contains a total of 4156 urban trips originating from 100 distinct drivers, for who detailed driving behavior data exist. A k-means clustering algorithm is implemented to extract the driving profiles based on speed and acceleration data. The simulation results show that smooth driving leads to a statistically significant reduction in the emissions of the most important air pollutants. Moreover, limiting the variability of the acceleration to a narrower range, as it occurs in the eco profile, leads to an increase in the output of vehicles in comparison to the other profiles. © 2020 Tongji University and Tongji University Press","Clustering; Driving profiles; Emissions; Simulation; Traffic flow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086020116

Saving energy is not only the amount of energy that we save, but also reducing emissions of pollutants to the atmosphere, as well as reducing the consumption of energy resources that are used to produce energy. Reducing pollutant emissions and the use of energy resources can be achieved by increasing the use of renewable energy sources, but at present, this method of obtaining energy in the world is not representative. It should be noted that renewable energy devices throughout the life cycle generate environmental impact. Similar to this situation, the building's thermo-modernization, which is focused on reducing the pressure on the environment of the building's user, also has an impact on the environment throughout the building's life cycle. Determining this environmental impact and ecological or economic benefits or costs is the purpose of the following article. Thermo-modernization of the building, for the purposes of the article, is understood as thermal insulation of walls and replacement of the heat source for heating the building and preparation of hot utility water. The need to replace the heat source with a much more ecological one results in Poland from provincial legal regulations announced by virtue of a resolution. In the study, data from the Ecoinvent data library included in the SimaPro computer program was used for the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) analysis. As a result of thermo-modernization of the representative buildings, large ecological benefits were obtained, while economic costs remain at a high level. © 2020 by the authors.","Ecological and economic benefits; Heat source replacement; Life cycle assessment; Thermal energy; Thermal insulation; Thermo-modernization","Buildings; Climate change; Costs; Energy conservation; Laws and legislation; Life cycle; Modernization; Pollution; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Thermal insulation; Consumption of energy; Ecological and economic; Ecological benefits; Impact on the environment; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pollutant emission; Renewable energy devices; Use of renewable energies; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090745539

In a median low-income country, aggregate output is about 2 percent lower and investment is about 10 percent lower seven years after a 1 degree increase in average annual temperature. We also find that economic development, in general, helps to shield countries from temperature shocks, with hot regions in high-income countries on average sustaining less economic damage from rising temperatures than hot regions in low-income countries. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Climate policy; Environment and growth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086578600

Taking soils under native forests as an appropriate ecological reference, we studied changes in soil organic carbon stock along eight land-use types in the highlands of Ethiopia. The general objective of the study was to investigate the dynamics of SOC stock following chrono-sequence land-use/cover systems in the highlands of Ethiopia. The specific objectives were to: (1) analyze loss due to land degradation; (2) analyze gain due to land restoration; and (3) estimate partial balance of SOC stock for the highlands of Ethiopia. The study followed the principle of the Forest Transition Theory (FTT). Eleven sub-areas were considered from the highlands of Ethiopia. A total of 241 auger composite samples from the topsoil (0−20 cm depth) were collected during December 2017 to June 2018, and analyzed at CropNut soil lab in Nairobi. The study results revealed that there were statistically significant variations (P &lt; 0.05) across the land-use types with the mean stocks ranging from 31.4 Mg SOC ha−1 in soils of intensively grazed lands to 145.0 Mg SOC ha−1 in soils of guasa grasslands. Soils of natural/pristine vegetation and protected guasa grasslands contain the highest amount of SOC stock. Therefore, there should be more aggressive efforts towards an effective protection of these ecosystems. Soils under intensively used croplands and intensively grazed lands lost, respectively, 64.95% and 78.16%, SOC stocks originally accumulated in the top surface layers of the pristine forests. This points for the need to adopt locally feasible land management practices that lead to increased SOC stock and simultaneously reduced CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions from croplands and intensively grazed lands of the highlands of Ethiopia. Compared to stocks of SOC of intensively grazed lands (31.44 Mg SOC ha−1), the annual stock gains in soils of controlled grazing lands (4.60 Mg ha−1) were &gt; gains in soils of enclosures (3.17 Mg ha−1) &gt; gains in soils of afforestation (2.35 Mg SOC ha−1), which signifies that converting degraded lands to either controlled grazing lands, enclosures, or afforestation would be a promising practice for an enhanced carbon sequestration across the highlands of Ethiopia. This practice is in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. The estimated regional partial stock balance revealed that the loss and gain ratio was 35.1 in 1991, and it declined to 15.4 in 2001, 2.2 in 2011 and 1.8 in 2015. These decreasing ratios indicate the possibility of closing the gap between the losses and the gains in the near future, and eventually shifting to higher rates of gains than losses. It is also important to note that determined efforts towards the effective protection of natural forests and the creation of enclosures and reforestation areas by local communities for enhanced carbon sequestration will benefit them from payments of carbon emission reduction (CER) credits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Curve of SOC change; Drivers for effective reforestation; Forest transition theory; SOC stock gains; SOC stock partial balance; Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock losses","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; grassland; greenhouse gas; land cover; land management; land use change; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil-vegetation interaction; Sustainable Development Goal; topsoil; Ethiopia; Nairobi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084518642

Thus, assessing agricultural suitability and yield reduction under climate change is crucial for sustainable agricultural production. In this study, we used two sub-models of the agro-ecological decision support system MicroLEIS (Terraza and Cervatana) to evaluate the impacts of climate change on land capability and yield reduction or wheat and sunflower as major rainfed crops in different Mediterranean soil types (in Andalucia, Southern Spain). The Terraza sub-model provides an experimental prediction for the bioclimate deficiency and yield reduction, while the Cervatana sub-model predicts the general land use suitability for specific agricultural uses. Sixty-two districts in Southern Spain were modeled and mapped using soil data and the A1B climate scenario (balanced scenario) for three 30-year periods ending in 2040, 2070 and 2100, respectively. Our results showed that the majority of agricultural soils were suitable for wheat production, and less for sunflowers, especially under projected climate change scenarios. Extreme impacts of climate change were observed in the soil types Typic Xerofluvents and Calcic Haploxerepts, where the land capability was reduced from Good and Moderate classes to the Marginal class. This was especially observed in sunflower crops by 2100. Yield reduction of sunflower was much higher than the reduction for wheat, especially under the projected climate periods, where the results for 2100 showed the severest effect on crop yields with about 95% of the sunflower area showing yield reductions. This high variability of the evaluation results demonstrates the importance of using soil factors, climate and crop information in conjunction in decision-making regarding the formulation of site-specific soil use and management strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Decision support systems; GIS; Global warming; Land suitability","Agricultural robots; Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Land use; Reduction; Soils; Agricultural soils; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Land use suitability; Management strategies; Mediterranean region; Mediterranean soils; Sustainable agricultural; Climate change; agricultural development; agrometeorology; alternative agriculture; climate change; crop performance; decision support system; land use planning; Mediterranean soil; yield response; Andalucia; Spain; Andalucia; Helianthus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084939527

Many countries have decided to cultivate this tree in order to reduce air pollution and secure the increasing energy demand. In this paper, a hybrid approach, including geographical information system (GIS) and mathematical modeling is proposed to determine suitable locations for Paulownia cultivation. The feasibility and suitability maps for Paulownia cultivation have been derived based on three categories of criteria, including (1) Certain Non-Compensatory Criteria (CNCC) (2) Uncertain Compensatory Criteria (UCC), and (3) Certain Compensatory Criteria (CCC), and a four-stage algorithm is proposed. This algorithm sets out to (1) recognize Paulownia growth conditions (2) identify feasible regions considering CNCC (3) evaluate the efficiency of candidate locations by employing data envelopment analysis (DEA) with respect to UCC, and (4) display suitability map according to CCC. The high degree of fluctuation in weather conditions is an important factor that significantly influences the DEA results. Therefore, Z-number is adopted to represent the uncertainty of input data in DEA modeling. To validate the proposed approach, the obtained efficiencies from Z-number, fuzzy number, and crisp DEA models are compared to those obtained from the actual data of a five years period. The results indicate that about 160,000 km2 land area is suitable to cultivate Paulownia in Iran that shows great potential for renewable energy production in this country. On the other hand, the computational results demonstrate that applying Z-number decreases the error of the weather forecast by 8% so that land suitability assessment can be carried out more accurately. As a result, this reliable method can prevent agricultural productivity loss due to selecting inappropriate locations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Cultivation; Land suitability assessment; Paulownia; Z-number DEA","Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Data envelopment analysis; Fuzzy sets; Location; Productivity; Uncertainty analysis; Weather forecasting; Agricultural productivity; Biomass resources; Candidate locations; Computational results; Feasible regions; Growth conditions; Land suitability assessments; Renewable energies; Geographic information systems; alternative energy; angiosperm; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; crop plant; cultivation; data envelopment analysis; GIS; Iran; Paulownia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088892048

This study explores using waste-marble powder (WMP) as an economical and eco-friendly method for controlling the alkali-silica reaction (ASR). Reactive aggregates were used with WMP from the local marble industry (Pakistan) at various proportions ranging from 5% to 50% by cement mass. Strength activity index and thermal analysis tests were performed to examine the mechanical strength and hydration kinetics in mortar mixtures incorporating WMP. ASR expansion in mortar incorporating reactive aggregates decreased owing to WMP addition and was lower at 28 days than the limit of 0.20% for mixtures incorporating 30% or more WMP given in current standards. Whereas control specimens without WMP incurred surface microcracking due to ASR, specimens incorporating WMP remained intact. Scanning electron microscopy with energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy analysis showed reduction of ASR in specimens with WMP. Thus, it can be envisioned that using WMP as partial cement replacement creates an added-value application for an otherwise landfilled by-product and reduces harmful emissions from cement production, with the further advantage of mitigating ASR in concrete structures. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Alkali-silica reaction (ASR); Durability; Reactive aggregate; Sustainability; Waste-marble powder (WMP)","Aggregates; Cement industry; Cements; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Concrete industry; Environmental protection; Fly ash; Marble; Mixtures; Mortar; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Thermoanalysis; Waste incineration; X ray spectroscopy; Added-value applications; Alkali-silica reaction; Cement replacement; Hydration kinetics; Reactive aggregate; Renewable energies; Strength activity index; Waste marble powders; Concretes; alkalinity; cement (construction material); concrete; concrete structure; construction material; fly ash; hydration; mortar; reaction kinetics; silica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087961464

Agriculture is the third driver of Malaysia's economic growth. However, the phenomena of uncertain climate nowadays have caused agricultural activity such as paddy farming to be severely affected as the climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity. This study was conducted to identify the level of knowledge and awareness of the paddy farmers about climate change and its impact on the socio-economy in Pasir Mas, Kelantan. Besides that, the critical factors that influenced the awareness of the paddy farmers on the climate change impact also examined. A questionnaire was utilised as the primary research instrument, and the total number of respondents was 119. Descriptive and inferential analysis was adopted to analyse the primary data that was collected. The result shows that approximately 90% of the respondents have the knowledge and are aware of climate change and its impact on paddy plantation and production. This study also revealed that farming experience is the factor that influences the awareness of the paddy farmers about climate change. Besides that, the findings indicate that adaptation and mitigation measures are needed to avoid the future impact of climate change. Accordingly, the government as the policymaker and the local authority has the most crucial role in ensuring climate adaptation and mitigation at all levels of community. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Economics; Productivity; Agricultural activities; Agricultural productivity; Climate change impact; Gross domestic products; Mitigation measures; Research instruments; Socio-economic impacts; Uncertain climate; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092345714
