This is the third year in a row that a stable market for natural gas is observed. Although not yet at pre-recession strength, primary metals demand for natural gas is climbing and seems poised for continued growth. At the same time, overall industrial demand for natural gas is positioned to match or surpass pre-recession levels. NGSA also predicts that power generators will continue to switch to natural gas rather than coal due to low natural gas prices. A study from Purvin & Gertz Inc revealed that rising output from shale formations may reduce US imports of low-sulfur crude oil by 500,000 bpd within 5 yr as new pipelines carry the oil to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. Shale production should rise to ∼ 900,000 bpd by 2015, and to > 1.3 million bpd by 2020, displacing imports. Refiners also plan to increase the use of local crudes from oil shale formations. In addition, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a comprehensive look at the role of natural gas in reducing global carbon emission. It highlighted the emergence of new shale gas supplies creates opportunities for natural gas to replace less environmentally friendly fossil fuels, i.e., coal and oil, in generating electricity, heating homes, making chemical feedstocks, and fueling cars and trucks. It also recommended government policies and government-funded research that could lead to more natural gas use as a bridge to a lower-carbon future.",,,Business Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054794476

It is very likely caused by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities, and poses significant risks for a range of human and natural systems. And these emissions continue to increase, which will result in further change and greater risks. America's Climate Choices makes the case that the environmental, economic, and humanitarian risks posed by climate change indicate a pressing need for substantial action now to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare for adapting to its impacts. Although there is some uncertainty about future risk, acting now will reduce the risks posed by climate change and the pressure to make larger, more rapid, and potentially more expensive reductions later. Most actions taken to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts are common sense investments that will offer protection against natural climate variations and extreme events. In addition, crucial investment decisions made now about equipment and infrastructure can ""lock in"" commitments to greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. Finally, while it may be possible to scale back or reverse many responses to climate change, it is difficult or impossible to ""undo"" climate change, once manifested. Current efforts of local, state, and private-sector actors are important, but not likely to yield progress comparable to what could be achieved with the addition of strong federal policies that establish coherent national goals and incentives, and that promote strong U.S. engagement in international-level response efforts. The inherent complexities and uncertainties of climate change are best met by applying an iterative risk management framework and making efforts to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions; prepare for adapting to impacts; invest in scientific research, technology development, and information systems; and facilitate engagement between scientific and technical experts and the many types of stakeholders making America's climate choices. © 2011 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and displaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light curves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the time lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical formalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the problems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated errors, and seasonal gaps. We redetermine the lags for 87 emission lines in 31 quasars and reassess the BLR size-luminosity relationship using 60 Hβ lags. We confirm the general results from the traditional cross-correlation methods, with a few exceptions. Our method, however, also supports a broad range of extensions. In particular, it can simultaneously fit multiple lines and continuum light curves which improves the lag estimate for the lines and provides estimates of the error correlations between them. Determining these correlations is of particular importance for interpreting emission-line velocity-delay maps. We can also include parameters for luminosity-dependent lags or line responses. We use this to detect the scaling of the BLR size with continuum luminosity in NGC 5548. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society.

This class of compounds applied in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) materials has been studied by quantum chemistry. To reveal the relationship between the structures and properties of these electroluminescent materials, the ground- and excited-state geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) and CIS/6-31G(d) levels, respectively. The ionization potentials and electron affinities were computed. The mobilities of hole and electron in these compounds were studied computationally based on the Marcus electron transfer theory. The maximum absorption and emission wavelengths of these compounds were calculated using the time-dependent density functional theory method. The solvent effect on the absorption and emission wavelengths of these compounds was also considered by a polarizable continuum model. These results show that boron compounds which containing both the hydroxyquinoline/hydroxybenzoquinoline as ligand and O/S in position X follow the rule, that is, the emission shifts to longer wavelength as covalent nature of the boron-ligand bonding is increased. Meanwhile, the negative HOMO and IPs decrease but the negative LUMO and EAs increase by substitution of O with S in position X. It was deduced that both the hole- and electron-injection abilities are improved by substituting S in place of O in position X. After chemical modification in position R2 with electron-donating properties of NH2 or 1,4-diethynyl-2,5-dihexyloxybenzene, introduced 1,4-diethynyl-2,5-dihexyloxybenzene improves both the hole- and electron-transfer rate, which leads to better equilibrium property. It can be concluded that the better equilibrium property depends on the conjugated length of side chain in position R2. Moreover, exchanging the substituents R1 and R2 in BNO1a and BNO1'a can slightly change the hole-transfer rate by 0.04 eV. According to these calculations, series BNO and BNS can be applied as electron transport and hole transport materials at the same time. Specially, series BNO2 and BNS have better performance than Mes2B[p-4,4'-biphenyl-NPh(1-naphthyl)] (BNPB) in both the hole- and electron-injection ability. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","EA; Electronic structures; IP; Optical properties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954631555

With increasing exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate, the heat release rate decreases and moves towards top dead centre (TDC); the 50 per cent fuel mass fraction burned point and the start of combustion occur later. For BM blends, the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions decrease at each tested EGR level, compared with the NOx emissions for biodiesel. However, the reductions are limited. As the EGR rate increases, the NOx emissions decrease monotonically for all fuels at different engine loads. Generally, the smoke opacity of BM blends increases with increasing EGR rate and then decreases, which is the typical characteristic soot 'hump' of low-temperature combustion. Meanwhile, it is interesting that, with increasing methanol fraction in the blends, the soot hump moves towards the lower-EGR-rate region. Hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions increase with increasing EGR rate inevitably. However, it is noted that the use of the biodiesel-10 vol%methanol blend could reduce the HC emissions, compared with the use of biodiesel, or even diesel fuel. © Authors 2011.","Biodiesel; Diesel engine; Emissions; Low-temperature combustion; Methanol; NOx; Smoke","Direct injection diesel engines; Engine load; Exhaust gas recirculation rates; Fuel mass fraction; HC emissions; Heat release rates; Low-temperature combustion; Methanol fraction; Rate increase; Smoke opacity; Start of combustion; Top dead centres; Biodiesel; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Direct injection; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Methanol; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051883549

All sheep were defaunated by administration of sodium lauryl sulfate. After two weeks, half of the defaunated sheep were refaunated by inoculation with faunate rumen fluid. Both defaunated (DfN) and refaunated (RfN) sheep were divided into two groups, and assigned to treatments in a 2×2 factorial arrangement without (RfN, DfN) or with TS (3g/d) (RfTs, DfTs). After a feeding period of 3wk, CH4 production of individual sheep was measured using open circuit respiratory chambers and rumen fluid was sampled for analysis of rumen fermentation products and extraction of microbial DNA. Numbers of gene copies associated with rumen methanogens (mcrA gene), specific bacteria (16S rDNA gene) and rumen protozoa and fungi (18S rDNA gene) were measured using real time ploymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). The abundance of marker gene-copy number for the methanogens, protozoa, fungi, Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were expressed relative to the copy number of total rumen bacterial 16S rDNA. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was completed for protozoa to indicate the change in their diversity due to TS addition and defaunation. Declines in CH4 production as a result of addition of TS (2.1L/d, P&lt;0.01) were similar to defaunation (2.5L/d, P&lt;0.01). Compared to RfN, ammonia N concentrations were 12.9, 31.2 and 33.9% lower (P&lt;0.01), whereas microbial protein concentrations were 16.4, 29.2 and 36.0% higher (P&lt;0.01) in RfTs, DfN and DfTs, respectively. In contrast, the concentration of volatile fatty acids was similar among treatments although the molar proportion of propionate was higher (P&lt;0.01) in defaunated sheep. The abundance of fungi and R. flavefaciens marker genes relative to total bacterial 16S rDNA were decreased by defaunation, and abundance of F. succinogenes declined (P&lt;0.01) with either defaunation or addition of TS. The relative abundance of methanogen marker gene was reduced by defaunation (P&lt;0.05). Protozoal abundance in RfTs was lower than that of RfN (P&lt;0.05). The TS reduced (P&lt;0.05) protozoal diversity. Addition of TS reduced CH4 production mainly by inhibiting protozoa, increasing molar proportions of propionate and decreasing acetate/propionate ratio without adversely altering relative ruminal abundance of fungi and cellulolytic bacteria.

Yet it can be challenging to implement new policies and actions owing to a lack of information, funding and capacity at the local level - especially in developing countries such as China. Even though the Chinese government has set national energy and carbon intensity reduction targets, most local governments do not have sufficient knowledge regarding the necessary actions to achieve the targets, as well as the effectiveness and cost of policies; nor do they know how to design and implement a low carbon development plan. This article presents information for local governments on how to create an action plan to tackle climate change and increase energy efficiency. The research examines indicators that can be used to define low carbon development and to evaluate the effectiveness of the actions taken. The guidance provides a step-by-step description of how action plans can be established and essential elements that should be included - from preparing a GHG emission inventory to implementation of the plan.

The result shows that the annual value of pH is less than 5.6 in the past 14 years and the wet deposition has been getting more and more severe in Nanning. The ratio of SO4 2-/NO3 - has decreased. NO3 - has played an increasingly large role in acidity, though SO4 2- remains a key player. The sulphate, among wet deposition of major species, increases less significantly than the nitrate. The nitrate showed increasing contribution to the wet deposition, meanwhile, wet deposition of calcium declined dramatically, probably due to stringent abatement efforts of total suspended particulates. The acid deposition in Nanning is caused by not only local sulfur dioxide emissions, but also by long-range transportation. Since 1998, the sulfur dioxide emissions have been reduced, but the wet deposition has not getting better.","Acid rain; Deposition flux; Precipitation acidity; Wet deposition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052426845

This article presents a quantitative eco-efficiency (E/E) analysis on MSW management in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. A methodology for E/E analysis has been proposed, with an emphasis on the consistent integration of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). The environmental and economic impacts derived from LCA and LCC have been normalized and defined as a quantitative E/E indicator. The proposed method was applied in a case study of Tianjin, China. The study assessed the current MSW management system, as well as a set of alternative scenarios, to investigate trade-offs between economy and GHG emissions mitigation. Additionally, contribution analysis was conducted on both LCA and LCC to identify key issues driving environmental and economic impacts. The results show that the current Tianjin's MSW management system emits the highest GHG and costs the least, whereas the situation reverses in the integrated scenario. The key issues identified by the contribution analysis show no linear relationship between the global warming impact and the cost impact in MSW management system. The landfill gas utilization scenario is indicated as a potential optimum scenario by the proposed E/E analysis, given the characteristics of MSW, technology levels, and chosen methodologies. The E/E analysis provides an attractive direction towards sustainable waste management, though some questions with respect to uncertainty need to be discussed further. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Contribution analysis; Cost impact; Eco-efficiency; Environmental and economic impacts; GHG emission; Global warming impact; Key issues; Landfill gas; Life-cycle assessments; Life-cycle costing; Limited capacity; Linear relationships; Management systems; Sustainable waste management; Tianjin; Tianjin , China; Civil aviation; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Uncertainty analysis; Waste treatment; Municipal solid waste; economic impact; environmental impact; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; waste management; waste treatment; article; carbon footprint; case study; China; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; ecosystem; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; quantitative analysis; solid waste management; sustainable development; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954845021

Although a substantial amount of research has focused on carbon emissions inventory, limited studies have been conducted to estimate consumption-based emissions and their spatial distribution in relation to vegetation carbon sinks. In this article, we develop a new approach to model the spatially detailed consumption-based carbon emissions from the household energy and transportation sectors. Emissions were in turn integrated with vegetation carbon sequestration rates that were modeled through biophysical remote sensing techniques. This enables carbon balance analysis at detailed geographic locations. To illustrate our approach for carbon balance analysis, we present a case study in Florida. Results indicate that, in 2001, Florida was able to self-assimilate residential carbon emissions from energy and transportation fuel consumption. Estimates indicate that net carbon sources (i.e., household emissions exceeding vegetation carbon assimilation) are associated with urban and suburban densities and net sinks with exurban and rural densities. In sum, the research approach can be extended to household energy consumption and carbon assessment for other geographies at alternative scales. © 2011 by Association of American Geographers Initial submission, February 2010.","Carbon emissions inventory; GIS; Household energy consumption; Household transportation fuel consumption; Vegetation carbon sinks","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission inventory; emissions trading; environmental economics; fuel consumption; GIS; land use; remote sensing; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958740304

Russia proves the third largest energy consumption country in the world in recent years, while little research has shed light upon its energy consumption issue till now, especially its energy-growth nexus. Therefore, this paper empirically investigates the dynamic nexus of the two variables in Russia based on the state space model. The results indicate that, first of all, Russia's energy consumption is cointegrated with its economic growth in a time-varying way though they do not have static or average cointegration relationship. Hence it is unsuitable to merely portrait the nexus in an average manner. Second, ever since the year of 2000, Russia's energy efficiency has achieved much more promotion compared with that in previous decades, mainly due to the industrial structure adjustment and technology progress. Third, among BRIC countries, the consistency of Russia's energy consumption and economic growth appears the worst, which suggests the complexity of energy-growth nexus in Russia. Finally, there exists bi-directional causality between Russia's energy consumption and economic growth, though their quantitative proportional relation does not have solid foundation according to the cointegration theory. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic growth; Energy consumption; Russia","Bi-directional; Cointegration; Cointegration relationship; Economic development; Economic growths; Empirical evidence; Energy consumption; Industrial structures; Little research; Low-carbon; Proportional relation; Russia; State space model; Technology progress; Time varying; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; State space methods; Economic and social effects; cointegration analysis; economic growth; energy efficiency; energy use; modeling; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953309248

We compared species richness (S), plant diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, H'; Margalef index, R), and above- and below-ground ecosystem carbon (C) pools of six plant communities along a chronosequence of vegetation restoration, and we also examined evidence for a functional relationship between plant diversity and C storage. Our results showed that above-ground C increased significantly (over 52-fold), mainly due to the increase of C in aboveground living plants and surface litter. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased from the herb community type (dominated by Deyeuxia scabrescens, P1) to mixed forest type (dominated by Betula spp. and Abies faxoniana, P4), which constituted the main C pool of the system (63-89%), but decreased thereafter (communities P5-P6). The mean C stock in the whole ecosystem - trees, litter layer and mineral soil - ranged from 105 to 730MgCha-1 and was especially high in the spruce forest community type (dominated by Picea purpurea, P6). On the other hand, the relationships between C stocks (soil, aboveground) and mean annual temperature or altitude were generally weak (P&gt;0.05). Moreover, we did not detect a relationship between S and aboveground C storage, while we found a significant negative relationship between H', R and aboveground C storage. In addition, our experiment demonstrated that total root biomass and litter C/N ratio were significant functional traits influencing SOC, while S, R, and H' had little effect. Path analysis also revealed that litter C/N ratio predominantly regulated SOC through changes in the quantity of microorganisms and soil invertase enzyme activity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Chronosequence; Plant diversity; Relationship between C storage and diversity; Soil C stock; Subalpine coniferous forest","C/N ratio; Carbon stocks; Chronosequences; Coniferous forests; Environmental factors; Functional relationship; Functional traits; Litter layer; Mean annual temperatures; Mineral soils; Mixed forests; Natural regeneration; Path analysis; Plant communities; Plant diversity; Relationship between C storage and diversity; Root biomass; Soil organic carbon; Southwest China; Species richness; Spruce forest; Surface litter; Vegetation restoration; Ecosystems; Enzyme activity; Lakes; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Regression analysis; Soils; Plants (botany); carbon sequestration; chronosequence; coniferous forest; environmental factor; enzyme activity; mixed forest; phytomass; plant community; soil carbon; species diversity; species richness; subalpine environment; succession; China; Abies; Abies faxoniana; Betula; Deyeuxia; Picea; Picea purpurea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958073553

Understanding of the meteorological conditions for air pollution is essential to the understanding of the formation mechanism of air pollutants and the development of effective emission control strategies to reduce air pollution. In this paper, the Fifth Generation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)/Pennsylvania State University (PSU) Mesoscale Model (MM5) modeling system is applied to simulate meteorological fields during selected six 1-month periods in 2007/2008 over a triple-nested modeling domain covering East Asia, the eastern China, and Shandong Province at horizontal grid resolutions of 36-, 12-, and 4-km, respectively. MM5 generally reproduces well the observations in the eastern China but performs worse in the western China and northeastern China. Largest biases occur in 2-m temperatures (T2) and wind speed and wind direction at 10-m in haze months (i.e., winter) and daily mean precipitation (Precip) in non-haze months (i.e., summer), due to limitations of the model in simulating snow cover and convective precipitation. Meteorological predictions agree more closely with observations at urban sites than those at the coastal and mountain sites where the model performance deteriorates because of complex terrains, influences of urban heat island effect and land/sea breezes, and higher elevations. Model results at 12-km in Shandong Province show an overall better performance than those at 4- or 36-km while the results at 4-km show worst performance due to inaccurate land use and the model's incapability in simulating meteorological processes at a fine scale. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Meteorological model evaluation; MM5; Sensitivity to horizontal grid resolution","Air pollutants; China; Complex terrains; Control strategies; Convective precipitation; East Asia; Eastern China; Economic development; Energy consumption; Formation mechanism; Horizontal grid; Mean precipitation; Mesoscale model; Meteorological condition; Meteorological fields; Meteorological model evaluation; Meteorological prediction; MM5; Model evaluation; Model performance; Model results; Modeling systems; National center for atmospheric researches; Pollution problems; Rapid growth; Regional scale; Seasonal variation; Sensitivity to horizontal grid resolution; Shandong province; Snow covers; Urban heat island; Urban site; Western China; Wind directions; Wind speed; Air quality; Climatology; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Pollution; Sensitivity analysis; Snow; Air pollution control; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); sensitivity analysis; snow cover; accuracy; air pollution; article; China; evaluation; mesoscale modeling system generation 5; meteorological phenomena; model; performance; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; reproducibility; seasonal variation; simulation; snow cover; wind; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956044848

Firstly, the status and future trends have been reviewed, which focuses on the private vehicles development, energy demands of road transportation sector and biofuels. Furthermore, a comprehensive survey has been conducted for 374 private vehicle drivers (owners) in Nanjing. A questionnaire survey method is implemented to collect information including respondents' awareness, brief of biofuels, selection attitudes to biofuels and views on policies. Furthermore, the biofuels selection motives of respondents have been concluded into two main factors, ""purchasing pressures"" and ""product attraction"". Then the respondents were divided into three clusters and compared. The results indicate that 90% of the respondents need to know more about biofuels implementation, and the majority of the respondents emphasize the active significance of reducing GHG emissions to improve energy security and mitigate energy crisis. But 55.6% of the respondents think that biofuels technology is still not mature. It is found that the different perceptions of biofuels between 192 passenger vehicle drivers (PVD) and 182 freight vehicle drivers (FVD). The former focuses on fuel price and fuel performance, while the latter pays more attention to fuel availability. Besides, PVD concentrate on fuel-related attributes while FVD focus on policy-related factors. The survey results give rise to some deeply consideration about the various preferences and awareness on biofuels among different consumer groups. These findings in this study will help to understand the consumer's energy consumption behaviors and improve the further implementation for biofuels in Nanjing city. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

After analysis of the results, 88.5% of the interviewees know the word 'wetland'. TV and radio is the main tool for them to get information. More than two thirds of the respondents mainly learn the information on wetland conservation through TV and radio. There are still big gaps among different people in understanding wetland. Only 13.3% of the respondents give a completely right answer on question 'which areas are wetlands'. Most of the respondents cited lakes, marshes and rivers as wetlands, but more than half of them do not regard beaches, reservoirs, paddy fields and fish ponds as wetlands. Most of the people cited wetlands can provide such functions as water conservation, climate regulation, protecting wildlife, removing pollution, but know little about other functions such as flood control, provisioning of aquatic products, and soil retention, and much less about the cultural functions such as recreation, and inherited folk culture. Except for wastewater discharge, nearly half of the general public knows little about other threats of the wetland, while most of the people do not believe that artificial aquaculture will cause threats to the wetland areas.

The energy consumption in 2009 is reported to be 3.1 billion tons standard coal equivalent, 1/7 of the world total, 6.3% higher than in the year 2008, and its share of world CO2 emissions increased rapidly to 20.3% in 2006. These trends are most likely to continue with China's plan to accomplish its social and economy development goals. To address these problems and also respond to increasing world pressure for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the Chinese government plans and has legislated promotion of energy conservation, efficiency, renewable energy technologies and use, and reduction of energy-related environmental impacts to reduce energy intensity by 20% during the 2006-2010 period, and to reduce the CO2 emission/GDP ratio by 40-45% by 2020 relative to 2005. China is facing severe energy-related challenges that conflict resources shortages with the planned rapid economic development, energy use with the related environmental pollution, and new technology with the old production/consumption patterns. It is recognized that energy development must, however, follow a sustainable path to coordinate economy growth, social development, and environmental protection. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Energy; Energy strategy; Environmental impacts; Sustainable development","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; China; Chinese Government; Economic development; Economy growth; Energy; Energy development; Energy intensity; Energy situation; Energy strategy; Energy use; Environmental pollutions; Renewable energy technologies; Social development; Economic and social effects; carbon emission; economic analysis; economic development; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; legislative implementation; renewable resource; state role; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958123878

The corresponding temporal energy consumption and emission trends are valuable to investigate in order to fully understand the environmental benefits. The 24-h energy consumption and emission profile depends on different vehicle designs, driving, and charging scenarios. This study assesses the potential energy impact of PHEVs by considering different charging scenarios defined by different charging power levels, locations, and charging time. The region selected for the study is the South Coast Air Basin of California. Driving behaviors are derived from the National Household Travel Survey 2009 (NHTS 2009) and vehicle parameters are based on realistic assumptions consistent with projected vehicle deployments. Results show that the reduction in petroleum consumption is significant compared to standard gasoline vehicles and the ability to operate on electricity alone is crucial to cold start emission reduction. The benefit of higher power charging on petroleum consumption is small. Delayed and average charging are better than immediate charging for home, and non-home charging increases peak grid loads. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Contributions from eight different local NOx source types and eight different source regions to the 8-h average daytime O3 concentrations from 1100 to 1800 CST (referred to as AD O3 hereafter) are determined. Both diesel engines and highway gasoline vehicles account for 25 ppb of AD O3 in the urban Houston area. NOx from natural gas combustion produces 35 ppb of AD O3 in the industrial area of Houston. Contributions from industrial sources and coal combustion to AD O3 have comparatively less broad spatial distribution with maximum values of 14 ppb and 20 ppb, respectively. Although the local sources are the most important sources, upwind sources have non-negligible influences (20-50%) on AD O3 in the entire domain, with a maximum of 50 ppb in rural and coastal areas and 20 ppb in urban and industrial areas. To probe the origins of upwind sources contributions, NOx emissions in the entire eastern United States are divided into eight different regions and their contributions to O3 concentrations in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) and Beaumont-Port Arthur (BPA) areas are determined. Among the various NOx source regions resolved in this study, other Texas counties near the HGB and BPA areas and southeastern states are the most important non-local sources of O3. Under favorable transport conditions, emissions from neighbor states and northeastern states could also contribute to non-negligible O3 concentrations (7-15%) in the HGB and BPA areas. This indicates that in addition to reduce local emissions, regional NOx emission controls, especially from the neighbor counties and states, are also necessary to improve O3 air quality in Southeast Texas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Background ozone; CMAQ; Source apportionment; TexAQS 2000","Background ozone; CMAQ; Coastal area; Community multi-scale air qualities; Entire domain; Gasoline vehicle; Houston; Industrial area; Industrial sources; Local emissions; Local source; Maximum values; Natural gas combustion; Nonlocal source; Ozone concentration; Photochemical mechanism; Source apportionment; Source region; Source types; TexAQS 2000; Air quality; Coastal zones; Diesel engines; Industry; Ozone; Coal combustion; coal; gasoline; natural gas; nitric oxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric modeling; coastal zone; combustion; concentration (composition); diesel engine; emission control; nitric oxide; ozone; photochemistry; spatial distribution; traffic emission; urban area; air quality; article; combustion; community; concentration (parameters); diesel engine; highway; industrial area; priority journal; seashore; United States; urban area; Houston; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955464076

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative importance of the major air pollutants [particulate matter (PM), SO2, NO2] as predictors of daily cardiovascular/respiratory mortality. The time-series studied comprises years with lower level interventions to control air pollution (2003-2006) and years with high level interventions in preparation for and during the Olympics/Paralympics (2007-2008). Concentrations of PM10, SO2, and NO2, were measured daily during the study period. A generalized additive model was used to evaluate daily numbers of cardiovascular/ respiratory deaths in relation to each air pollutant, controlling for time trends and meteorological influences such as temperature and relative humidity. The results show that the daily cardiovascular/respiratory death rates were significantly associated with the concentration air pollutants, especially deaths related to cardiovascular disease. The current day effects of PM10 and NO2 were higher than that of single lags (distributed lags) and moving average lags for respiratory disease mortality. The largest RR of SO2 for respiratory disease mortality was in Lag02. For cardiovascular disease mortality, the largest RR was in Lag01 for PM10, and in current day (Lag0) for SO2 and NO2. NO2 was associated with the largest RRs for deaths from both cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Air pollutants; Cardiovascular disease; Environmental exposure; Mortality; Respiratory disease","nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air pollution indicator; air quality standard; ambient air; article; atmospheric pressure; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; China; concentration (parameters); controlled study; disease association; environmental temperature; health hazard; human; humidity; particulate matter; prediction; quantitative analysis; respiratory tract disease; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959831886

In this paper we use Shanxi province to illustrate how policies and measures are implemented in practice at a provincial level as a response to the National FYP issued by the central government. Local policies are described and their effects are analyzed. We compare reported energy saving achievements with our own estimates and conclude that the achievements in Shanxi probably have been substantial since the start of the 11th FYP period. The most important measures taken by provincial and local governments seem to be in the secondary sector, such as Top-200/Top-1000 program and phasing out outdated technologies. However, Shanxi has still a long way to go to achieve satisfactory energy use. Further improvement of energy intensity will require continuing efforts.

We extend this approach to assess the ecosystem impacts of resource use and climate change in marine ecosystems, by developing an Integrated Fisheries Risk Analysis Method for Ecosystems (IFRAME) framework. The IFRAME approach tracks climate change impacts on the flow of energy through the planktonic foodweb using NEMURO and projects the implications of these shifts in bottom-up forcing on the fisheries foodweb using Ecopath with Ecosim. Resource management scenarios are developed and incorporated into the projection framework by characterizing the action for changes in fishing mortality or availability of resources.

In this paper, we quantify these impacts in an observational ecologic case-crossover study of air pollution and mortality. The associations of daily concentrations of PM 10, O 3, and NO 2 with daily all-cause non-violent mortality were investigated using conditional logistic regression to estimate percent increase in the risk of dying for an increase of 10 g/m 3 in the previous day air pollutant concentrations (lag 1).

We used four approaches to assign exposure to air pollutants for each individual considered in the study: nearest background station; city average of all stations available; average of all stations in a macro-area covering three cities and average of all six cities in the study area (50 × 150 km 2). Odds ratios generally increased enlarging the spatial dimension of the exposure definition and were highest for six city-average exposure definition. The effect is especially evident for PM 10, and similar for NO 2, whereas for ozone, we did not find any change in the C-R estimates. Within a geographically homogeneous region, the spatial aggregation of monitoring station data leads to higher and more robust risk estimates for PM 10 and NO 2, even if monitor-to-monitor correlations showed a light decrease with distance. We suggest that the larger aggregation improves the representativity of the exposure estimates by decreasing exposure misclassification, which is more profound when using individual stations vs regional averages.",,"Emilia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959373122

From this perspective, stress can cause hypertension via set point changes, so offering an answer to an old question. Even though the local blood flow to tissues is influenced by circulating vasoactive hormones and also by local factors, there is yet significant sympathetic control. It is well established that the state of maturation of sympathetic innervation of blood vessels at birth varies across animal species and it takes place mostly during the postnatal period. During ontogeny, chemoreceptors are functional; they discharge when the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood are not normal.Methods: The model is a simple biological plausible adaptative neural network to simulate the development of the sympathetic nervous control. It is hypothesized that during ontogeny, from the RNS afferents to the NTS, the optimal level of each sympathetic efferent discharge is learned through the chemoreceptors' feedback. Its mean discharge leads to normal oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in each tissue. Thus, the sympathetic efferent discharge sets at the optimal level if, despite maximal drift, the local blood flow is compensated for by autoregulation. Such optimal level produces minimum chemoreceptor output, which must be maintained by the nervous system. Since blood flow is controlled by arterial blood pressure, the long-term mean level is stabilized to regulate oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. After development, the cardiopulmonary reflexes play an important role in controlling efferent sympathetic nerve activity to the kidneys and modulating sodium and water excretion.Results: Starting from fixed RNS afferents to the NTS and random synaptic weight values, the sympathetic efferents converged to the optimal values. When learning was completed, the output from the chemoreceptors became zero because the sympathetic efferents led to normal partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide.Conclusions: We introduce here a simple simulating computational theory to study, from a neurophysiologic point of view, the sympathetic development of cardiovascular regulation due to feedback signals sent off by cardiovascular receptors. The model simulates, too, how the NTS, as emergent property, acts as a comparator and how its rostral afferents behave as set point. © 2011 Zanutto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Animal species; Arterial blood; Arterial blood pressure; Autoregulations; Blood flow; Cardiovascular regulation; Computational theories; Emergent property; Error signal; Feedback signal; Neural network model; Neural structures; Optimal level; Optimal values; Setpoints; Sympathetic nerve activity; Synaptic weight; Blood; Blood pressure; Carbon dioxide; Comparators (optical); Computation theory; Global warming; Hemodynamics; Neural networks; Optimization; Oxygen; Sodium; Tissue; Blood vessels; Animalia; adrenergic system; animal; article; artificial neural network; biological model; blood pressure; cardiovascular system; chemoreceptor; computer simulation; feedback system; homeostasis; human; hypertension; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; solitary tract nucleus; Animals; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular System; Chemoreceptor Cells; Computer Simulation; Feedback, Physiological; Homeostasis; Humans; Hypertension; Models, Cardiovascular; Neural Networks (Computer); Solitary Nucleus; Sympathetic Nervous System",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959231703

We examined this question for service models for patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods We estimated carbon emissions associated with ambulance (patient) transport under a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) care model based in tertiary centres, compared with historical emissions under a thrombolysis model based in general hospitals. We used geographical information on 41 449 hospitalizations, and published UK government fuel to carbon emissions conversion factors. Results The average ambulance journey required for transporting a STEMI patient to its closest care point was 13.0 km under the thrombolysis model and 42.2 km under the pPCI model, producing 3.46 and 11.2 kg of CO2 emissions, respectively. Thus, introducing pPCI will more than triple ambulance journey associated carbon emissions (by a factor of 3.24). This ratio was robust to sensitivity analysis varying assumptions on conversion factor values; and the number of patients treated. Conclusions Introducing pPCI to manage STEMI patients Results in substantial carbon emissions increase. Environmental profiling of service modernization projects could motivate carbon control strategies, and care pathways design that will reduce patient transport need. Healthcare planners should consider the environmental legacy of quality improvement initiatives. © 2011 The Author.","angioplasty; carbon; dioxide; emissions; environmental; GIS; infarction; myocardial; patient; travel","carbon dioxide; article; carbon footprint; electrocardiography; fibrinolytic therapy; geography; health care delivery; health care policy; heart infarction; human; national health service; patient transport; statistics; transluminal coronary angioplasty; travel; United Kingdom; Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Electrocardiography; England; Geography; Health Policy; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; State Medicine; Thrombolytic Therapy; Transportation of Patients; Travel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957825215

Anaerobic digesters (ADs) break down organic wastes using bacteria that produce methane, which can be collected and combusted to generate electricity. ADs also reduce odors and pathogens that are common with manure storage and the digested manure can be used as a fertilizer. There are relatively few ADs in the U.S., mainly due to their high capital costs. We use the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to test the effects of a representative U.S. climate stabilization policy on the adoption of ADs which sell electricity and generate methane mitigation credits. Under such policy, ADs become competitive at producing electricity in 2025, when they receive methane reduction credits and electricity from fossil fuels becomes more expensive.

The key feature of proposed device is the utilization of short-period superlattice in the active region of LED heterostructure. In this superlattice the GaN barriers between quantum wells (QWs) are transparent for tunnelling, thus enabling carrier delocalization in growth direction. This, in turn, leads to the reduction of carrier concentration at given pumping comparing to the standard LED heterostructure, where, usually, only one QW contributes to light emission. The reduction of carrier concentration results in substantial suppression of third order non-radiative processes, such as Auger recombination, responsible for the efficiency droop at high pumping. As a result, the LED external efficiency at operating current 350 mA differs from its maximum value only by 7%. Also, fabricated LEDs demonstrate very good stability of spectral position of the emission line, the observed blue shift of electroluminescence being less than 1 nm at pumping up to 1000 mA. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The galaxy has well-developed spiral arms and the nebular emission line dynamics clearly indicate a rotationally supported disk with V rot/σ 4. The best-fit disk velocity field model yields a maximum rotation of Vrot sin i = 150 ± 15 km s-1, and a dynamical mass of Mdyn = (1.3 ± 0.2) × 10 10 cosec2(i) M⊙ (within 2.5kpc), where the inclination angle i = 45° ± 10°.

NCB from tropical and southern peatlands represents much smaller terms, mostly less than 10 TgC/yr. Northern peatlands represent about 90% of global total peatland C pool of 612 GtC and &amp;gt;90% of global peatland NCB. Our bottom-up global peatland synthesis indicates a decrease in rates of peatland area expansion and reduced CH4 emissions during the late Holocene, thus lending support for an anthropogenic source of late-Holocene CH4 rise. The C balance analysis of global peatland data indicates a cumulative net C uptake of 272 GtC in the early Holocene (11-7 ka), 151 GtC at 7-4 ka, and 116 GtC after 4 ka. The large cumulative fluxes and significant variations throughout the Holocene could greatly contribute to the observed atmospheric CO 2 and δ 13CO 2 patterns derived from Antarctic ice cores. Thus, global mass-balance calculations or climate-carbon cycle simulations have to consider these large net C uptake terms from global peatlands and their variations over the Holocene. © The Author(s) 2011.","Carbon cycle; Early anthropogenic hypothesis; Holocene; Long-term C fluxes; Net C balance (NCB); Peatlands","accumulation; carbon balance; carbon flux; carbon isotope; global perspective; Holocene; ice core; mass balance; methane; paleoatmosphere; paleoclimate; peatland; tropical region; Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954489356

In order to understand the roles of urban building system in the global and regional climate changes, we set up an integrated model to analyze the carbon emissions of urban building system during its life cycle in this paper, which is called LCCE Model. The further analysis is made to examine the sources of CO2 emissions and the life cycle characteristics of typical architectural structures as masonry-concrete and steel-concrete. We first identified four major sources of CO2 emissions during the whole life cycle of urban building system, which are industrial process emissions, energy consumption emissions, fugitive emissions and land footprint emissions. Given an assumption of a building life cycle of 50years, we took urban residential buildings as an example and calculated CO2 emissions in the main five phases of an overall life cycle of a residential building system, including constructive materials preparation, building construction and reformation, building operation, building demolition as well as wastes treatment and recycling. A comparison was made to examine the differences of CO2 emissions among buildings with two typical architectural structures as masonry-concrete and steel-concrete. The results show that the latter produces less CO2 emission than the former per unit area. Specifically, the amount of CO2 emission is 329.61t for masonry-concrete buildings and 315.79t for steel-concrete buildings per 100m2. Most emissions come from energy consumption and land footprint, accounting for 78-83% and 13-20% of the total emissions respectively. According to our LCCE model, there is a great potential of reducing carbon emissions in urban building system. The key to reduce carbon emissions during the life cycle of urban buildings is directed to building wastes recycling, improvement of consumption patterns of energy and materials, preferential use of buildings with a moderate floor area ratio and effective utilization of natural energy and ecologically friendly building materials according to the characteristics of local urban development. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Architectural structures; Carbon emissions; LCCE model; Life cycle; Material and energy flow analysis (MEFA); Urban building system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955162415

The occurrence of the first dislocation dipole, multiplication of dislocations, and evolution of subsurface stress field were examined in terms of contact load, dislocation source density, slip-plane distance and orientation angle, and indenter radius. In the presence of defects (dislocation sources), the critical load for dislocation initiation is less than that of a defect-free medium and depends on dislocation source density, slip-plane distance, and indenter radius. The critical indenter radius resulting in deformation under the theoretical material strength is determined from numerical results, and the role of dislocation obstacles is interpreted in terms of their spatial density.

Most of the groundwater-level fluctuations (>90%) are explained by climatic variation, particularly rainfall. The overall non-climate-related trend in groundwater level is downward and small but statistically significant (-0.04 to -0.066 m/yr), and is probably due to the widespread replacement of grazing land by wheat and canola cultivation, as these crops use more water than pasture. A large non-climate-related trend (-0.30 m/yr) for bores in an irrigation area is mainly related to groundwater extraction. The response time of the system is rapid (only 4.85 years on average), much faster than previously estimated. Rates of groundwater flow are much slower; groundwater ages are up to ~35,000 years. Response times effectively represent the time for the system to move to a new state of hydrologic equilibrium; this prediction of the time scale of the impacts of land-use change on groundwater resources will allow the development of better strategies for groundwater management. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Australia; Climate change; Groundwater dynamics; Land use; Spatio-temporal modeling","climate change; climate effect; groundwater flow; hydrology; land use change; modeling; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; water level; water management; Australia; Victoria [Australia]; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958197094

This has raised the issue of how to allocate the CO2 reduction target regionally to meet the national reduction target. To meet this objective, the following aspects may be taken into consideration: equity principles, 'common but differentiated responsibilities'; intensity reduction target fulfillment; and economic difference and reduction potential among provinces. This paper selects per capita GDP, accumulated fossil fuel related CO2 emissions and energy consumption per unit of industrial added value as indicators for emission reduction capacity, responsibility and potential, respectively. Based on these three indicators, a comprehensive index is developed and an intensity allocation model constructed. As decision makers may have different preferences when allocating the reduction burden, we allocate different weights to the indicators, analyzing the results using cluster analysis. The following aspects may also be considered together with the national regional development strategy to determine how to share the burden: the reduction potential of various regions; implementation potential of the plans; and promotion of a highly efficient low carbon economic development model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 intensity; Equity; Reduction target allocation","Added values; Allocation model; Carbon dioxide emissions; Chinese Government; CO2 intensity; Decision makers; Economic development; Emission reduction; Energy consumption; Equity; Gross domestic products; Intensity reduction; Low carbon; Per capita; Per unit; Reduction potential; Reduction target allocation; Reduction targets; Regional development strategies; Carbon dioxide; Cluster analysis; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Regional planning; Industrial emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decision making; economic development; emission control; fossil fuel; Gross Domestic Product; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953321990

Protected areas and biosphere reserves (BRs) in particular, focused as they are on the conservation of ecosystem services and on fostering sustainable regional development, play an important role in developing and implementing mitigation and adaptation measures and policies. This is officially recognized within the framework of the Madrid Action Plan for the BRs, adopted in 2008. It states that ""MAB and WNBR bring added value through the integrated approach which is generally absent elsewhere. The role of biosphere reserves is essential to rapidly seek and test solutions to the challenges of climate change as well as monitor the changes as part of a global network. For the Natural Sciences as well as other Programme Sectors of UNESCO, biosphere reserves can be areas for demonstrating adaptation measures for natural and human systems, assisting the development of resilience strategies and practices. Buffer zones and transition areas of biosphere reserves may also be used to test many mitigation tactics and strategies"".

In this study, artifacts in SO2 concentration measurements were investigated using two identical ion chromatography-based instruments (the Gas Particle Ion Chromatograph, GP-IC, Dionex Corporation) and two identical UV fluorescence-based SO2 analyzers (the TECO 43CTL, an industry standard). The SO2 concentration values measured with the GP-IC at roadside sites were compared with simultaneous side-by-side measurements made with the fluorescence analyzers. The SO2 concentration measured with the GP-IC had an ~30% negative calibration artifact. When the GP-ICs were calibrated using an improved procedure developed in the course of this study, only a ±5% difference from the TECO analyzers remained, except under high NO concentration conditions. The fluorescence analyzers exhibited a positive artifact under elevated NO concentration conditions. Sulfur oxidation ratios were calculated based on the GP-IC-measured SO2 and SO42- concentrations and used to help identify potential emission sources. The SO2 concentrations measured with the GP-IC were also compared to data obtained from a National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) speciation sampler equipped with a Na2CO3-coated denuder. Good correlation between SO2 data from the two methods was seen during five months of measurement, but the GP-IC SO2 data were ~30% lower than the NAPS data.

For comparison, the motion speed of Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints and the photospheric magnetic field strength are also used for the electric field calculation. This X10 flare event is selected due to its distinct two-phase HXR kernel motion, two arcade systems with different magnetic shear, and the high cadence and complete coverage of the TRACE 1600Å Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) magnetogram and RHESSI HXR observations. We pay particular attention to the electric field characteristics in different flare phases, as well as the temporal correlation with the HXR emission and its power-law spectral index and the photospheric magnetic field strength. We found that in the early impulsive phase, the reconnection electric field peaks just before the HXR emission peaks and the energy spectrum hardens. The result is consistent with the scenario that more particles are accelerated to higher energies by larger reconnection electric fields and then precipitate into the lower chromosphere to produce stronger HXR emissions. Such a particle acceleration mechanism plays its most significant role in the impulsive phase of this flare.

This method allows for estimating emission changes with a finer temporal resolution than previous studies and shows that the progression of the emission reduction corresponds roughly to the scheduled implementation of emission controls over Beijing. OMI column NO 2 reductions are approximately 45%, 33%, and 14% over urban Beijing, rural Beijing, and the Huabei Plain, respectively, while the corresponding anthropogenic NO x emission reductions are only 28%, 24%, and 6%, during the full emission control period (July 20-Sep 20, 2008). Meteorological changes from summer 2007 to 2008 are the main factor contributing to the column NO 2 decreases not accounted for by the emission reduction. The surface ozone changes due to NO x emission reduction are negligible using a standard VOC emission inventory. When using enhanced VOC (particularly aromatics) emissions derived from in situ observations, urban Beijing shifted O 3 production from the VOC-limited regime toward the NO x-limited regime resulting in a more substantial ozone decrease (up to 10 ppbv). © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemistry and transport models; Emission change; Emission reduction; In-situ observations; Inversion methods; Model simulation; Nitrogen dioxides; Olympic games; Ozone monitoring instruments; Surface ozone; Temporal resolution; VOC emissions; Computer simulation; Emission control; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Reduction; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; nitrate; nitrite; anthropogenic effect; Aura (satellite); diurnal variation; emission control; emission inventory; in situ measurement; nitrogen dioxide; Olympic Games; ozone; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; urban atmosphere; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; article; China; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; methodology; regional chemistry and transport model; chemistry; city; geography; human; human activities; pollutant; sport; time; Beijing [China]; China; China; Cities; Environmental Pollutants; Geography; Human Activities; Humans; Nitrates; Nitrites; Ozone; Sports; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960944390

In this study, a coupled simulation and fuzzy-rule-based method was proposed for health risk assessment of groundwater contamination, and applied to a petroleum contaminated site. Benzene concentrations under two remediation scenarios (i.e., natural attenuation and pump-and-treat remediation) at different time intervals (1, 10, 20, 30, and 60 years later) were examined. The obtained benzene concentrations were then used to quantify the health risks through the excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) model. The study results indicated that the proposed method was useful for assessing potential human health effects when the groundwater was used for drinking water purpose and could effectively identify variation of risk levels under different remediation scenarios. The study also found that the dissolved oxygen was the most thermodynamically favoured electron accepter used in the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. When implementing remediation actions, we can inject oxygen to subsurface to strengthen aerobic biodegradation process (i.e., air sparging).

The genetic relationship between uranium mineralization and hydrocarbons has been recognized by a number of previous studies, but it has not been well understood in terms of the hydrodynamics of basin fluid flow. We have demonstrated in a previous study that the preferential localization of Cretaceous uranium mineralization in the upper part of the Ordos Jurassic section may have been related to the interface between an upward flowing, reducing fluid and a downward flowing, oxidizing fluid. This interface may have been controlled by the interplay between fluid overpressure related to disequilibrium sediment compaction and which drove the upward flow, and topographic relief, which drove the downward flow. In this study, we carried out numerical modeling for the contribution of oil and gas generation to the development of fluid overpressure, in addition to sediment compaction and heating. Our results indicate that when hydrocarbon generation is taken into account, fluid overpressure during the Cretaceous was more than doubled in comparison with the simulation when hydrocarbon generation was not considered. Furthermore, fluid overpressure dissipation at the end of sedimentation slowed down relative to the no-hydrocarbon generation case. These results suggest that hydrocarbon generation may have played an important role in uranium mineralization, not only in providing reducing agents required for the mineralization, but also in contributing to the driving force to maintain the upward flow. © 2011, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

Limnological studies on Asian reservoirs have emphasized that climate and hydrology under the influences of monsoon are dominant factors regulating seasonal patterns of lake trophic status; yet, little is known of synchrony or asynchrony of trophic status in the single reservoir ecosystem. Based on monthly monitoring data of chlorophyll a, transparency, nutrients, and nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS) during 1-year period, the present study evaluated temporal coherence to test whether local-scale regulators disturb the seasonal dynamics of trophic state indices (TSI) in a giant dendritic reservoir, China (Three Gorges Reservoir, TGR). Reservoir-wide coherences for TSICHL, TSISD, and TSI TP showed dramatic variations over spatial scale, indicating temporal asynchrony of trophic status. Following the concept of TSI differences, algal productivity in the mainstream of TGR and Xiangxi Bay except the upstream of the bay were always limited by nonalgal turbidity (TSICHL-TSI SD &lt;0) rather than nitrogen and phosphorus (TSI CHL-TSITN &lt;0 and TSICHL-TSITP &lt;0). The coherence analysis for TSI differences showed that local processes of Xiangxi Bay were the main responsible for local asynchrony of nonalgal turbidity limitation levels. Regression analysis further proved that local temporal asynchrony for TSISD and nonalgal turbidity limitation levels were regulated by local dynamics of NVSS, rather than geographical distance. The implications of the present study are to emphasize that the results of trophic status obtained from a single environment (reservoir mainstream) cannot be extrapolated to other environments (tributary bay) in a way that would allow its use as a sentinel site. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Nonalgal turbidity limitation; Temporal coherence; Three Gorges Reservoir; Trophic state indices","Algal productivity; Asynchrony; Chlorophyll a; Climatic drivers; Coherence analysis; Dominant factor; Local dynamics; Non-volatile; Nonalgal turbidity limitation; Relative importance; Seasonal dynamics; Seasonal patterns; Spatial scale; Suspended solids; Temporal coherence; Three gorges reservoir; Trophic state; Trophic status; Xiangxi bays; Chlorophyll; Ecosystems; Lakes; Phosphorus; Regression analysis; Turbidity; Reservoirs (water); nitrogen; phosphorus; chlorophyll a; climate effect; hydrology; lake ecosystem; limnology; monsoon; nitrogen; phosphorus; regulatory framework; reservoir; turbidity; water quality; alga; article; eutrophication; geographic distribution; lake ecosystem; seasonal variation; stream (river); suspended particulate matter; trophic level; turbidity; water supply; China; Hubei; Three Gorges Reservoir; Xiangxi Bay; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959378071

In order to investigate the impacts of anthropogenically-induced seasonal vegetation cover changes on regional climate in China, harmonic analysis is applied to 1982-2000 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVVHRR)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series (ten day interval data). For two climatic divisions of South China, it is shown that the first harmonic term is in phase with air temperature, while the second and third harmonics are in phase with agricultural cultivation. The Penman-Monteith Equation and the Complementary Relationship Areal Evapotranspiration (CRAE) model suggest that monthly mean evapotranspiration is out of phase with temperature and precipitation in regions with significant second or third harmonics. Finally, seasonal vegetation cover changes associated with agricultural cultivation are identified: for cropped areas, the temperature and precipitation time series have a single maximum value, while the monthly evapotranspiration time series has a bimodal distribution. It is hypothesized that multi-cropping causes the land surface albedo to sharply increase during harvesting, thereby altering the energy distribution ratio and contributing to observed seasonal vegetation cover changes. © 2011 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","discrete Fourier transform; land surface cover; latent heat; multi-crop; NDVI; phenologies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959421649

Quantification and valuation of the benefits provided by urban plants allow direct comparison between plant species and help make more informed urban planning decisions. Based on fieldwork study and data processing, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, oxygen (O2) generation, transpiration cooling, sulfur dioxide (SO2) removal and dust interception are quantified and valuated among sixteen plant species frequently planted in an industrial area. Results showed that estimated benefits were significantly different between plant species. The plant species with relatively high leaf area index (LAI) value and photosynthetic rate were more effective at regulating the atmospheric carbon and oxygen content. Those with high LAI value and transpiration rate should be used to enhance transpiration cooling. Such plant species with rough leaf surfaces and dense pubescent leaves were found to efficiently capture dust and those with thick sclerophyllous leaves remove SO2. By integrating species-specific benefits into the process of urban design, urban planners and greening designers can select appropriate plant species to maximize specific ecosystem services for a given greening area, improving local air quality and human health correspondingly.","Dust interception; Transpiration cooling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052466753

Such models are now well-established as important tools for biological conservation. However, the lack of high-resolution data for future climate scenarios has seriously limited their application, particularly because of the scale gap between general circulation models (GCMs) and species distribution models (SDMs). A recently introduced change-factor downscaling technique provides a convenient way to build high-resolution datasets from GCM projections. Here, we present a high-resolution (10' × 10') global bioclimatic dataset (BioPlant) for plant species distribution. The 15 bioclimatic variables we select are considered those most eco-physiologically relevant. They can be easily calculated from climatic variables common to all GCM projections. In addition to the traditional classes of variables regarding temperature and precipitation, the BioPlant dataset emphasizes the interactions between temperature and precipitation, particularly within plant growing seasons. A preliminary visual analysis shows that variations among GCMs are more significant on a species range scale than on a global scale. Thus, the formerly advocated ensemble modeling method should be applied not only to different SDMs, but also to various GCMs. Statistic analysis suggests that divergent behavior among GCM variations for temperature class variables and classes of precipitation variables requires special attention. Our dataset may provide a common platform for ensemble modeling, and can serve as an example to develop higher-resolution regional datasets. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bioclimatic variable; Climate scenario; Dataset; Species distribution model","atmospheric general circulation model; bioclimatology; biodiversity; biological invasion; climate prediction; climate variation; data set; downscaling; ecological modeling; ecophysiology; ensemble forecasting; growing season; plant community; population distribution; precipitation (climatology); resolution; statistical analysis; temperature profile; visual analysis; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955912103

This paper presents the trade-offs between cost, service quality (represented by time window guarantees), and emissions of an urban pickup and delivery system under these changing pressures. A model, developed by the authors in ArcGIS, is used to evaluate these trade-offs for a specific case study involving a real fleet with specific operational characteristics. The problem is modeled as an emissions minimization vehicle routing problem with time windows. Analyses of different external policies and internal operational changes provide insight into the impact of these changes on cost, service quality, and emissions. Specific consideration of the influence of time windows, customer density, and vehicle choice are included.The results show a stable relationship between monetary cost and kilograms of CO2, with each kilogram of CO2 associated with a $3.50 increase in cost, illustrating the influence of fuel use on both cost and emissions. In addition, customer density and time window length are strongly correlated with monetary cost and kilograms of CO2 per order. The addition of 80 customers or extending the time window 100 minutes would save approximately $3.50 and 1 kilogram of CO2 per order. Lastly, the evaluation of four different fleets illustrates significant environmental and monetary gains can be achieved through the use of hybrid vehicles.The results demonstrate there is not a trade-off between CO2 emissions and cost, but that these two metrics trend together. This suggests the most effective way to encourage fleet operators to limit emissions is to increase the cost of fuel or CO2 production, as this is consistent with current incentives that exist to reduce cost, and therefore emissions. © 2011 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences.","Emissions; Urban delivery systems; Vehicle routing problem","Fleet operators; Fuel use; Monetary costs; Operational changes; Operational characteristics; Pickup and delivery; Service Quality; Time windows; Urban delivery; Vehicle choice; Vehicle routing problem; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Network routing; Quality of service; Routing algorithms; Sales; Vehicle routing; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051785518

The physical properties, liquid structure, and dynamics of the ionic liquid were computed as a function of extent of reaction with CO2. Translational and rotational dynamics showed little change upon reaction with CO2, in sharp contrast to traditional TSILs and consistent with experimental viscosity measurements. It is shown that this is due to the failure of a hydrogen-bond network to form upon reaction with CO2. The Henry's law constants for the physical solubility of CO2, N2, O 2, and H2O were computed for the unreacted TSIL and found to be comparable to values observed with other ionic liquids.

However, due to increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, it will become a region with one of the lowest global pH levels. In addition, Arctic waters will also increase in temperature as a result of global warming. These environmental changes can pose a significant threat for marine species, and in particular true Arctic species that are adapted to the historically cold and relatively stable abiotic conditions of the region. Consequently, we investigated some key physiological responses of brittlestar Ophiocten sericeum, a polar endemic which can dominate benthic infauna, to a temperature increase of 3.5°C (ambient, 5-8. 5°C) and CO2 induced reduction in pH of 0.6 units (pH 7.7) and 1 unit (pH 7.3) below ambient (pH 8.3). Metabolism was upregulated at low pH. Faster arm regeneration stimulated by increased temperature was counteracted by low pH; at pH 7.3 in the high-temperature treatment, the maintenance of calcium carbonate structures in undersaturated conditions resulted in reduction in the rate of arm regeneration, possibly due to accelerated the use of energy reserves. If so, this could result in an energy deficit at times of increased energetic costs associated with responding to the combined factors of high temperature and low pH. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Brittlestar; Ocean acidification; Ophiocten sericeum; pH; Physiology; Svalbard; Temperature","acidification; adaptation; bioenergetics; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; echinoderm; global warming; high temperature; metabolism; pH; physiological response; polar region; regrowth; temperature effect; Arctic Ocean; Ophiocten sericeum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957804939

The public is an important stakeholder in the national debate about whether or not the U.S. should include CCS as a significant part of its climate change strategy. Understanding how to effectively engage with the public about CCS has become important in recent years, as interest in the technology has intensified. We argue that engagement efforts should be focused on places where CCS will first be deployed, i.e., places with many ""energy veteran"" (EV) citizens. We also argue that, in addition to information on CCS, messages with emotional appeal may be necessary in order to engage the public. In this paper we take a citizen-guided social marketing approach toward understanding how to (positively or negatively) influence EV citizens' attitudes toward CCS. We develop open-ended interview protocols, and a ""CCS campaign activity"", for Wyoming residents from Gillette and Rock Springs. We conclude that our participants believed expert-informed CCS messages, embedded within an emotionally self-referent (ESR) framework that was relevant to Wyoming, to be more persuasive than the expert messages alone. The appeal to core values of Wyomingites played a significant role in the citizen-guided CCS messages. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon capture and sequestrations; Core values; Fossil fuel resources; Gillette; Interview protocols; Wyoming; Climate change; Fossil fuels; Marketing; carbon; carbon sequestration; climate change; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; marketing; renewable resource; resource use; stakeholder; article; carbon capture and sequestration; climate change; human; interview; social attitude; social change; social marketing; United States; veteran; Attitude; Carbon Sequestration; Emotions; Expert Testimony; Humans; Persuasive Communication; Social Marketing; Wyoming; United States; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051707538

Tissue-specific analysis of stable carbon isotope ratios in plant fossils can provide an independent perspective on this issue. Lignin, a fundamental biopolymer providing structural support in plant tissues and the second most abundant organic material in plants, is 13C depleted by several parts per thousand, averaging 4.1‰, relative to other plant constructional materials (e.g. cellulose). With this isotopic difference, the biochemical structural composition of ancient plants (and inferred stature) can be interrogated using microscale in situ isotope analysis between different tissues in fossils.We applied this technique to a well-preserved specimen of the Late Paleozoic seed plant Medullosa, an extinct genus with a variety of growth habits that includes several enigmatic yet abundant small-stemmed species widely found in calcium carbonate concretions (""coal balls"") in the Pennsylvanian coal beds of Iowa, USA. It remains unclear which of the medullosans were freestanding, and recent analysis of the medullosan vascular system has shown that this system provided little structural support to the whole plant. The leading hypothesis for small-stemmed medullosan specimens predicts that cortical tissues could have provided additional structural support, but only if they were lignified. The expected isotopic difference between lignified tissue and unlignified tissue is smaller than that expected from pure extracts, for the simple reason that even woody tissues maximally contain 40% lignin (by mass). This reduces the expected maximum difference between weakly and heavily lignified tissues by 60%, down to ~0.5‰-2‰. Analysis of the medullosan stem reveals a consistent difference in isotope ratios of 0.7‰-1.0‰ between lignified xylem and cortical tissues. This implies low abundances of lignin (between 0% and 11%) within the cortex. This inferred structural biochemistry supports hypotheses that the peripheral portions of these medullosan stems were not biomechanically reinforced to permit the plants to grow as freestanding, arborescent trees. A number of climbing or scandent medullosans have been identified in the fossil record, and this mode of growth has been suggested to be common within the group on the basis of observations from comparative biomechanics, hydraulics, and development.

However, both countries are dependent on coal for a large portion of their energy needs, which is projected to continue over the next several decades. They also have large amounts of coal resources, coal-dependent electricity production, and in China's case, extensive use of coal in the industrial sector, making any shift from coal socio-politically difficult. Both nations could use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to simultaneously decrease greenhouse gas emissions and continue the use of domestic coal resources; however, the socio-political context for CCS deployment differs substantially between the two countries and potentially makes large-scale CCS deployment challenging. Here, we examine and compare the political and institutional contexts shaping CCS policy and CCS deployment, both for initial pilot projects and for the creation of large-scale CCS technology deployment, and analyze how the socio-political context for CCS in China and the United States aligns with national climate, energy security, and economic priorities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; China; Sequestration; Technology innovation; United States","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coal; economic impact; economic planning; greenhouse gas; innovation; national economy; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956265333

Because Quaternary climate changes also often were abrupt, a critical research question is to distinguish between extrinsic versus intrinsic abrupt ecological changes, i.e. those externally driven by abruptly changing climates, versus those resulting from thresholds, tipping points, and other nonlinear responses of ecological systems to progressive climate change. Extrinsic and intrinsic abrupt ecological changes can be distinguished in part by compiling and analysing regional networks of palaeoecological records. Abrupt ecological changes driven by spatially coherent and abrupt climate changes should manifest as approximately synchronous ecological responses, both among different taxa at a site and among sites. However, the magnitude and direction of response may vary among sites and taxa. Ecological responses to the rapid climatic changes accompanying the last deglaciation offer good model systems for studying extrinsic abrupt change. When abrupt ecological changes are intrinsically driven, the timing and rate of ecological response to climate change will be strongly governed by local biotic and abiotic processes and by stochastic processes such as disturbance events or localized climatic extremes. Consequently, at a regional scale, one should observe 'temporal mosaics' of abrupt ecological change, in which the timing and rate of ecological change will vary among species within sites and among sites. These temporal mosaics are analogous to the spatial mosaics observed in ecological systems prone to threshold switches between alternate stable states. The early Holocene aridification of the North American mid-continent and the middle-Holocene aridification of North Africa may be good examples of temporal mosaics. Synthesis. Past instances of extrinsic and intrinsic abrupt change are of direct relevance to global-change ecologists. The former allow study of the capacity of ecological systems to quickly adjust to abrupt climate changes, while the latter offer opportunities to understand the ecological processes causing abrupt local responses to regional climate change, to test tools for predicting critical thresholds, and to develop climate-adaptation strategies. © 2011 The Authors.

Crucial to its role in both physiology and disease is its ability differentially to regulate several classes of ion channels, including examples from calcium-activated K + (BK Ca), voltage-activated K + (K v) and Ca 2+ channel (L-type) families, ligand-gated P2X receptors (P2X2 and P2X4), tandem P domain K + channels (TREK1) and the epithelial Na + channel (ENaC). The mechanisms by which CO regulates these ion channels are still unclear and remain somewhat controversial. However, available structure-function studies suggest that a limited range of amino acid residues confer CO sensitivity, either directly or indirectly, to particular ion channels and that cellular redox state appears to be important to the final integrated response. Whatever the molecular mechanism by which CO regulates ion channels, endogenous production of this gasotransmitter has physiologically important roles and is currently being explored as a potential therapeutic. © 2011 The Authors.

The locations of such areas are fixed, but the environment within them may change, especially with climate change. To illustrate how multiple climate factors may change in relation to protection status, we used Principal Components Analysis to construct a climate space for California based on eight climate variables assessed at an 800-m resolution. We used projections of future climate derived from a downscaled regional climate model in conjunction with the IPCC SRES A2 scenario to assess how the climate space might shift under future conditions and to identify the combinations of conditions that may no longer occur in the state (disappearing climates) or that will be new to the state (novel climates). Disappearing climates, which were generally toward cooler and/or wetter extremes of the climate space, represented only 0.5% of California's land area but occurred disproportionately more often in conservation areas that were fully protected. Novel climates (5.8% of California) also occurred disproportionately in fully protected areas; in most cases these climates were characterized by hotter and drier combinations with more seasonal precipitation. The disproportionate occurrence of both novel and disappearing future climates in currently protected areas may create challenges to conservation of the status quo, but such areas may also be "" hotspots of opportunity"" for responding to the extremes of climate change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","California; Climate change; Climate space; Conservation; Novel climates; Protected areas","climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; conservation status; environmental conditions; environmental factor; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; precipitation (climatology); principal component analysis; protected area; regional climate; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958083849

The growth of this industry has important implications for biodiversity, the effects of which depend largely on which biofuel feedstocks are being grown and the spatial extent and landscape pattern of land requirements for growing these feedstocks. Current biofuel production occurs largely on croplands that have long been in agricultural production. The additional land area required for future biofuels production can be met in part by reclaiming reserve or abandoned croplands and by extending cropping into lands formerly deemed marginal for agriculture. In the United States, many such marginal lands have been enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), providing important habitat for grassland species. The demand for corn ethanol has changed agricultural commodity economics dramatically, already contributing to loss of CRP lands as contracts expire and lands are returned to agricultural production. Nevertheless, there are ways in which biofuels can be developed to enhance their coexistence with biodiversity. Landscape heterogeneity can be improved by interspersion of land uses, which is easier around facilities with smaller or more varied feedstock demands. The development of biofuel feedstocks that yield high net energy returns with minimal carbon debts or that do not require additional land for production, such as residues and wastes, should be encouraged. Competing land uses, including both biofuel production and biodiversity protection, should be subjected to comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, so that incentives can be directed where they will do the most good. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Biodiversity; Biofuels; Conservation Reserve Program; Corn ethanol; Henslow's sparrow; Land use","alcohol; biofuel; agricultural land; agricultural production; biodiversity; biofuel; cost-benefit analysis; economic analysis; economic development; emission control; energy efficiency; ethanol; grassland; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; landscape; liquid; maize; price dynamics; rural economy; agriculture; article; biodiversity; environmental protection; human activities; maize; methodology; United States; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biofuels; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ethanol; Human Activities; United States; Zea mays; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958845132

The RAMI4PILPS suite of virtual experiments assesses the accuracy and consistency of the radiative transfer formulations that provide the magnitudes of absorbed, reflected, and transmitted shortwave radiative fluxes in LSSs. RAMI4PILPS evaluates models under perfectly controlled experimental conditions in order to eliminate uncertainties arising from an incomplete or erroneous knowledge of the structural, spectral and illumination related canopy characteristics typical for model comparison with in situ observations. More specifically, the shortwave radiation is separated into a visible and near-infrared spectral region, and the quality of the simulated radiative fluxes is evaluated by direct comparison with a 3-D Monte Carlo reference model identified during the third phase of the Radiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) exercise. The RAMI4PILPS setup thus allows to focus in particular on the numerical accuracy of shortwave radiative transfer formulations and to pinpoint to areas where future model improvements should concentrate.

The study site is Laguna La Gaiba (LLG), a large lake (95km2) hydrologically-linked to the Pantanal, an immense, seasonally-flooded basin and the world's largest tropical wetland (135,000km2). Lake-level changes at LLG are therefore reflective of regional precipitation. We infer past fluctuations in precipitation at this site through changes in: i) pollen-inferred extent of flood-tolerant forest; ii) relative abundance of terra firme humid tropical forest versus seasonally-dry tropical forest pollen types; and iii) proportions of deep- versus shallow-water diatoms. A probabilistic model, based on plant family and genus climatic optima, was used to generate quantitative estimates of past temperature from the fossil pollen data. Our temperature reconstruction demonstrates rising temperature (by 4°C) at 19.5kyr BP, synchronous with the onset of deglacial warming in the central Andes, strengthening the evidence that climatic warming in the SH tropics preceded deglacial warming in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) by at least 5kyr. We provide unequivocal evidence that the climate at LLG was markedly drier during the last glacial period (45.0-12.2kyr BP) than during the Holocene, contrasting with SH tropical Andean and Atlantic records that demonstrate a strengthening of the South American summer monsoon during the global Last Glacial Maximum (~21kyr BP), in tune with the ~20kyr precession orbital cycle. Holocene climate conditions occurred as early as 12.8-12.2kyr BP, when increased precipitation in the Pantanal catchment caused heightened flooding and rising lake levels in LLG. In contrast to this strong geographic variation in LGM precipitation across the continent, expansion of tropical dry forest between 10 and 3kyr BP at LLG strengthens the body of evidence for widespread early-mid Holocene drought across tropical South America. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Diatoms; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; Palaeoclimate; Pollen; Tropical South America","deglaciation; diatom; dry forest; forest ecosystem; fossil record; geographical variation; global warming; Holocene; hydrology; lacustrine deposit; Last Glacial Maximum; lowland environment; Northern Hemisphere; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; pollen; precipitation intensity; quantitative analysis; shallow water; Southern Hemisphere; temperature effect; South America; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960384618

Local actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change are essential for stabilization of the global climate and can also help to address other urban ecological problems such as pollution, decreasing biodiversity, etc. Companies are important urban actors in the development of low-carbon cities because they provide a multitude of goods and services to city populations and directly influence urban carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

While studies on corporate sustainability are numerous, there is little, if any, existing research that examines the role of companies in climate change adaptation and mitigation within specific urban areas.

Twenty-two amendments were applied to dairy manure then evaluated for odor reduction efficacy after storage at 20°C for 3 d and 30 d. Amendments represented differing primary modes of action including: microbial digestive, oxidizing, disinfecting, masking, and adsorbent. Each amendment was added to 2 kg dairy manure (1:1.7 urine:feces; 12% total solids) following recommended rates. In this preliminary screening, one sample (n=1) of each amendment was evaluated along with untreated manure (Control). Odor emission from each treated manure and Control was estimated twice by five or six qualified odor assessors (n=10 or 12) after each storage duration, using an international standard for triangular forced-choice olfactometry. Odor quality was defined using hedonic tone, Labeled Magnitude Scale and ASTM methods for supra-threshold odor intensity, and an odor character wheel for descriptors. For selected treatments, odor emissions were significantly reduced relative to Control at 30 d versus 3 d incubation (P<0.0001). However, no amendment was significantly effective for both incubation times. Likewise, for all amendments tested, aging the manure slurry for 30 d significantly reduced odor emission and odor intensity (P<0.0001). A proprietary microbial amendment (Alken Enz-Odor + Clear Flo: aerobic/ facultative microbes with growth factors), disinfectant (hydrogen peroxide), and masking agent (Hyssopus officinalis essential oil) provided significant short-term control of odor (P <0.06). However, after 30 d seven amendments significantly increased odor emission (P<0.02) while only two amendments offered a significant efficacy (P<0.0001): a proprietary microbial aerobic/facultative product (Bio-Regen) and a proprietary mix of chemicals (Greaseater), both with weekly re-application. Hedonic tone observations suggested an improvement to ""slightly to moderately unpleasant"" smell versus untreated manure for all amendments except clinoptilolite zeolite adsorbent. Hedonic tone improvement was correlated with reduced manure odor supra-threshold intensity.","Additives; Amendments; Dairy manure; Hedonic tone; Odor; Odor strength; United States of America",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858735534

In order to reach this goal, a new CHP law was enacted to improve the framework conditions for CHP generation. In this paper, we aim at identifying which CHP technologies are most likely to be installed in the near future to reach the CHP target stipulated by the German government. In our model, we apply Mean-Variance Portfolio (MVP) theory to consider return- and risk-related aspects of various CHP technologies. The analysis pays tribute to specific characteristics of CHP generation, such as promotion via guaranteed feed-in tariffs, additional revenues from heat sales, specific operational features, and specifics concerning the allocation of CO2 allowances. The investigation is based on four generic standard CHP technologies currently available on a commercial basis: large coal-fired CHP plants, combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT-CHP), engine-CHP and micro-turbine CHP. As selection criteria for the portfolio performance we take, independently from each other, the net present value (NPV) of investment in CHP and the expected annual portfolio return, and compare the results obtained from both approaches. Irrespective of the chosen selection criteria, the analysis shows that CCGT-CHP and engine-CHP are the most attractive CHP technologies from a return perspective. A diversification of the portfolio with other kinds of CHP technologies can contribute to stabilizing portfolio returns. In view of the results obtained we conclude for the further development of CHP generation in Germany that a large portion of additional new CHP capacity will probably be built in the industrial sector. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CHP technology; Combined heat and power; Germany; Portfolio optimization","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Financial data processing; Gas plants; Investments; Laws and legislation; Turbines; CHP plant; CHP technology; Climate protection; Combined cycle; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power generation; Feed-in tariff; Further development; German government; Germany; Individual technology; Industrial sector; Mean variance; Micro turbine; Net present value; New regulatory frameworks; Portfolio analysis; Portfolio optimization; Selection criteria; Technology; carbon dioxide; cogeneration; integrated approach; numerical model; power generation; risk factor; stabilization; state role; technological development; turbine; Germany; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961022197

Several parameters were measured simultaneously providing an overview of the CO2 system. Moored instruments were continuously recording partial pressure of CO2 in the surface water (pCO2w), currents, mixing, waves, salinity, temperature and O2. Measurements of total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) were taken from R/V Skagerak. These measurements were converted to pCO2w to support the continuous pCO2w data and also calculate the air-sea exchange of CO2. Additionally, the time derivatives of O2 and CT concentrations in the water were determined using incubations and a Productivity Autosampler (PA).

According to the central limit theorem, the decreasing of the sample data's standard deviation is beneficial to the precision and speed of parameter statistics. The convergence precision and speed of parameter statistics correspond to ""ghosting artifacts"" and ""convergence speed"". So in this study, we develop a new algorithm called the high-frequency Constant-Statistics Constraint (HFCS) algorithm. The core idea of HFCS is to reduce the input observation data's standard deviation. Two ways are used to achieve this reduction. The first way is frequency separation. The input data's low-space-frequency part is discarded, and HFCS only processes the input data's high-space-frequency part. This can effectively reduce the input data's standard deviation. The second way is to create a Dynamic Range Reduction (DRR) region. Only the high-space-frequency value in the DRR region can be used to update the NUC parameters. DRR region's range is much less than the high-space-frequency's, so it further decrease the input data's standard deviation. The processing results show that HFCS can own high convergence speed with very few ghosting artifacts. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Convergence speed; Dynamic range reduction; Ghosting artifacts; Scene-based nonuniformity correction","Central Limit Theorem; Convergence speed; Dynamic range reduction; Frequency separation; Ghosting artifacts; High frequency HF; Input datas; Nonuniformity Correction; Nonuniformity correction algorithm; Observation data; Sample data; Scene-based; Standard deviation; Algorithms; Convergence of numerical methods; Input output programs; Speed; Statistics; Data reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960058667

Yet, even for relatively wellconstrained industrial GHGs, global emissions based on 'top-down' methods that use atmospheric measurements often agree poorly with the reported bottom-up emissions. For emissions reduction legislation to be effective, it is essential that these discrepancies be resolved. Because emissions are regulated nationally or regionally, not globally, topdown estimates must also be determined at these scales. High-frequency atmospheric GHG measurements at well-chosen station locations record 'pollution events' above the background values that result from regional emissions. By combining such measurements with inverse methods and atmospheric transport and chemistry models, it is possible to map and quantify regional emissions. Even with the sparse current network of measurement stations and current inverse-modelling techniques, it is possible to rival the accuracies of regional 'bottom-up' emission estimates for some GHGs. But meeting the verification goals of emissions reduction legislation will require major increases in the density and types of atmospheric observations, as well as expanded inversemodelling capabilities. The cost of this effort would be minor when compared with current investments in carbon-equivalent trading, and would reduce the volatility of that market and increase investment in emissions reduction. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Climate legislation; Global warming; Greenhouse-gas emissions","Atmospheric measurement; Atmospheric observations; Atmospheric transport; Background value; Chemistry models; Climate legislation; Emissions reduction; Global emissions; Greenhouse-gas emissions; High frequency HF; Inverse methods; Station location; Topdown; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Industrial emissions; Inverse problems; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957613735

Longwan, a district of Wenzhou City in Southeast China, was selected as the study area. DMF emissions at the synthetic leather industrial zone were inventoried, during 2007, and an AMS/EPA regulatory model (AERMOD) was used to simulate DMF concentrations using 10 000 100 m×100 m grids for the 2006 period. In 2007, actual DMF concentrations were recorded at seven DMF monitoring stations, and were compared with simulated results for the same timeframe. Simulated DMF concentrations were predicted to be in the range of 0.012-2.31 mg/m3, which is similar to the range of the monitored dataset results. A large majority (93%) of relative errors (REs) between simulated and monitored concentrations ranged from 0.48% to 189.4%. While DMF emissions within factories did not exceed the regulated emission limit, simulations indicated that, in 2006, 20% of the daily average ambient DMF concentrations exceeded this limit.

Winegrape vines (Vitis vinifera L.) are traditionally grown in unique 'terroirs' of which climate is a critical component, the characteristics of wine being directly linked to the climate of the region. A changing climate, therefore, will likely affect the both the style and quality of wine produced at a given site. Furthermore, winegrapes have an expected productive life of more than thirty years so selection of planting material today already requires consideration of the future climate. Exploiting the genetic diversity of the Vitis species through substitution of better suited V. vinifera varieties and clones can be the first step to reducing the impacts of a warmer climate. Planting longer season varieties so that ripening is achieved at a desirable part of the season is fundamental practice to all grape-growing enterprises. Similarly rootstock selection to suit current and future environmental conditions can enhance resilience to a potential water restrained future. Breeding among the V. vinifera varieties, or outcrossing with other Vitis species can be undertaken to produce better adapted progeny, as in some regions and/or further into the future, selection from the existing varietal stock may not be adequate to fully avoid the negative impacts of climate change. This may be the case, for example, in attempting to source well suited vines for regions already considered to be warmer or hot. As well as using conventional breeding, genetic modification and marker assisted breeding can be employed to produce better adapted grapevines, these techniques being no doubt facilitated by the recently completed sequencing of the grapevine genome. No matter which strategy is used, adaptation of the vine to increased heat stress and drought stress will be the main focus for researchers and winegrape growers interested in avoiding the impacts of the projected warmer and drier climate. It remains to be seen how increasing CO2 will interact with these other climatic factors on grapevine physiology. More research is required on this topic for this crop. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc..","Adaptation; Breeding; Climate change; Genetic modification; Varieties; Wine grapes",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884681519

Our knowledge of how ocean uptake varies (regionally and temporally) and the processes that control it is currently observation-limited. Traditionally, and based on sparse observations and models at coarse resolution, ocean uptake has been thought to be relatively invariant. However, in the few places where we have enough observations to define the uptake over periods of many years or decades, it has been found to change substantially at basin scales, responding to indices of climate variability. We illustrate this for three well-studied regions: the equatorial Pacific, the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, and the North Atlantic. A lesson to take from this is that ocean uptake is sensitive to climate (regionally, but presumably also globally). This reinforces the expectation that, as global climate changes in the future owing to human influences, ocean uptake of CO2 will respond. To evaluate and give early warning of such carbon-climate feedbacks, it is important to track trends in both ocean and land sinks for CO2. Recent coordinated observational programmes have shown that, by organization of an observing network, the atmosphere-ocean flux of CO2 can, in principle, be accurately tracked at seasonal or better resolution, over at least the Northern Hemisphere oceans. This would provide a valuable constraint on both the ocean and (by difference) land vegetation sinks for atmospheric CO2. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Atmospheric oxygen; Carbon cycle; CO2; Greenhouse gases","Atmospheric CO; Atmospheric oxygen; Basin scale; Carbon cycle; Climate variability; CO2; Early warning; Equatorial Pacific; Global climate changes; Human influences; Indian ocean; Land vegetation; North Atlantic; Northern Hemispheres; Southern Ocean; Time-scales; Atmospheric chemistry; Climatology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Vegetation; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957609021

A flat CH4 flame doped with NH3 for fuel-N was formed over the honeycomb, and NOx formation characteristics were investigated. In addition, chemiluminescence of OH<sup/> distribution was measured, and CHEMKIN-PRO was used to investigate the detailed NOx reduction mechanism. In general, the NOx conversion ratio decreases with decreasing primary O2/CH4 ratio, whereas NH3 and HCN, which are easily converted to NOx in the presence of O2, increases rapidly. Therefore, a suitable primary O2/CH4 ratio exists in the staged combustion. Our experiments showed the primary O2/CH4 ratio, which gave the minimum fixed nitrogen compounds in O2/CO2 combustion, was lower than in air combustion. The NOx conversion ratio in O2/CO2 combustion was lower than in air combustion by 40% in suitable staged combustion. This could be explained by high CO2 concentrations in the O2/CO2 combustion. It was shown that abundant OH radicals were formed in O2/CO2 combustion through the CO2+H→CO+OH, experimentally and numerically. OH radicals produced H and O radicals through H2+OH→H+H2O and O2+H→OH+O, because a mass of hydrogen source exists in the CH4 flame. O and OH radicals formed in the fuel-rich region enhanced the oxidation of NH3 and HCN. NOx formed by the oxidation of NH3 and HCN was converted to N2 because the oxidation occurred in the fuel-rich region where the NOx reduction effect was high. In fact, the oxidation of NH3 and HCN in the fuel-rich region was preferable to remaining NH3 and HCN before secondary O2 injection in the staged combustion. A significant reduction in NOx emission could be achieved by staged combustion in O2/CO2 combustion. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.","Low nOx emission; O2/CO2 combustion; Staged combustion","Air combustion; Conversion ratio; Formation characteristics; Hydrogen sources; Low NOx emissions; O radicals; O2/CO2 combustion; OH radical; Reduction effects; Reduction mechanisms; Staged combustion; Combustion; Free radicals; Fuels; Nitrogen compounds; Oxidation; Reduction; Carbon dioxide; ammonia; carbon dioxide; fuel; hydroxyl radical; methane; nitrogen oxide; oxygen; ammonia formation; article; chemoluminescence; combustion; controlled study; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955903244

The results indicate a repeated motif of socially organized microbial cooperation occurring within microbial consortial macrostructures (pods). The pod structure directly enables the specific geochemical processes linked to the metabolic function of the consortial members. These microbially linked geochemical processes have important ramifications for bulk system geochemistry that were previously unknown. Results from two examples: (1) microbial metal interactions within AMD biofilms and (2) sulfur redox cycling by a novel consortia within mine waters, illustrate how the ecology of the pod consortia is linked to pod biogeochemical macrostructure as well as to the resulting geochemistry associated with pod metabolism. In both instances the pod structures enabled the associated consortia to carry out reactions not predicted by classic geochemical understanding of these systems. Investigation of AMD biofilm biogeochemical architecture capturing the micro-scale linkages amongst geochemical gradients, metal dynamics and depth resolved micro-organism community structure, illustrated a novel biomineralization process driven by biofilm associated pods controlling biofilm metal capture. Similarly, the groups' recent discovery of an environmental S redox cycling, pod-forming, consortium revealed ecologically driven S cycling with previously unknown implications for both AMD mitigation and AMD carbon flux modeling. These results highlight how microbes cooperatively orchestrate their geochemical environment, underscoring the need to consider syntrophic community activity in environmental processes and the requirement for integrated, high-resolution techniques spanning geochemistry, molecular microbiology and imaging to reveal the biogeochemistry involved. © 2011.",,"Biomineralization process; Bulk system; Carbon fluxes; Community structures; Depth-resolved; Environmental process; Geochemical investigations; Geochemical process; High-resolution techniques; Macrostructures; Metabolic function; Metal interactions; Micro-scales; Microbial co-operation; Mine waters; Redox cycling; Repeated motifs; Bacteria; Biofilms; Biogeochemistry; Biomineralization; Groundwater; Metabolism; Microbiology; Molecular biology; Sulfur; Visualization; Structural geology; bacterium; biofilm; biomineralization; carbon flux; geochemistry; geomicrobiology; laboratory method; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial ecology; redox conditions; visualization; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955944899

The analysis uses a general equilibrium model of the Indonesian economy characterised by explicit treatment of land use, disaggregated by industry and by region. The results of the analysis indicate that the subsidy cost of permanently reducing carbon emissions by 26per cent is a little over US$1 per metric tonne of carbon emissions abated.

In order to characterize the mineralogical source of the U and possible structural controls on its presence, a deep (214. m) well was cored adjacent to one of the enriched wells. The highest gamma-ray emissions in the recovered core occur in coarse biotite granite at a depth just below 52. m. A slickenlined fault plane at 48.6. m and narrow pegmatite layers at depths of 113, 203 and 207. m also yield high gamma-ray counts. Thin sections were made from the above materials and along several subvertical healed fractures. Uraninite and coffinite are the principal U-rich minerals in the core. Other U-bearing minerals include thorite and thorogummite, monazite, zircon and allanite. Primary uraninite occurs in the biotite granite and in pegmatite layers. Secondary coffinite is present as tiny (&lt;5 μm) crystals dispersed along fractures in the granite and pegmatites. Coffinite also occurs along the slickenlined fault plane, where it is associated with calcite and calcic zeolite and also replaces allanite. Coffinite lacks radiogenic Pb, hence is considerably younger than the uraninite. Dissolution of partially oxidized Ca-rich uraninite occurring in the surficial biotite granite (or secondary coffinite in fracture zones) is likely the main source for the current high levels of U in nearby area wells. The high-U well waters have a carbonate signature, consistent with pervasive calcite vein mineralization in the core. Aqueous speciation calculations suggest U transport as an uranyl (U6+) hydroxyl-carbonate complex. Later reduction resulted in secondary precipitation along fractures as a U4+ mineral (i.e., coffinite). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Allanite; Aqueous speciation; Biotite granite; Calcite veins; Carbonate complexes; Coffinite; Fault planes; Fracture zone; Gamma-ray emission; South Carolina; Structural control; Thin section; Well water; Calcite; Carbonate minerals; Dissolution; Fracture; Gamma rays; Mica; Minerals; Oxide minerals; Phosphate minerals; Silicate minerals; Structural dynamics; Uranium; Wells; Granite; allanite; biotite; carbonate; coffinite; concentration (composition); dissolution; fault plane; gamma ray radiation; granite; hydrochemistry; mineralization; mineralogy; pegmatite; precipitation (chemistry); structural control; uranium; vein (geology); well water; Simpsonville; South Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953699611

The pathway leading to this phenomenon is not yet clear. In this work, we investigated the role of BRCA1 in the apoptosis regulation in response to carbon ion irradiation. We utilized three different cancer cell lines with various states for BRCA1 and p53 to identify the relationship between endogenous BRCA1 and the apoptosis-related genes, and determine whether p53 function would affect the role of BRCA1 in apoptosis regulation. By Western blot analysis, we found that Bax expressions were not significantly changed after irradiation in all of three cell lines. However, Bcl-2 expression showed an up-regulation by endogenous BRCA1 regardless of p53 status. Moreover, the changes in Bcl-2 protein were due to the increase in the transcriptional levels of Bcl-2 mRNA, based on real-time PCR assay. At the same time, BRCA1-deficient cells showed a greater apoptosis susceptibility to irradiation when compared with BRCA1-proficient cells. The results suggest that BRCA1 might exert p53-independent regulative activities for Bcl-2, which seems account for the low apoptosis susceptibility in BRCA1-proficient carcinomas. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","apoptosis; Bax; Bcl-2; BRCA1; ionizing radiation; p53","Apoptosis; Bax; Bcl-2; BRCA1; p53; Cell culture; Computer simulation; Genes; Ionizing radiation; Irradiation; Polymerase chain reaction; Radiation shielding; Radioactivity; Cell death",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956189874

That of the coastal province of Fujian proposes to do so largely through the development of nuclear power, whilst the coal-rich province of Anhui proposes to do so through its energy consumption rate rising at a lower rate than that of the rise in GDP.

It has been debated whether using corn ethanol results in any energy and greenhouse gas benefits. This issue has been especially critical in the past several years, when indirect effects, such as indirect land use changes, associated with U.S. corn ethanol production are considered in evaluation. In the past three years, modeling of direct and indirect land use changes related to the production of corn ethanol has advanced significantly. Meanwhile, technology improvements in key stages of the ethanol life cycle (such as corn farming and ethanol production) have been made. With updated simulation results of direct and indirect land use changes and observed technology improvements in the past several years, we conducted a life-cycle analysis of ethanol and show that at present and in the near future, using corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emission by more than 20%, relative to those of petroleum gasoline. On the other hand, second-generation ethanol could achieve much higher reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In a broader sense, sound evaluation of U.S. biofuel policies should account for both unanticipated consequences and technology potentials. We maintain that the usefulness of such evaluations is to provide insight into how to prevent unanticipated consequences and how to promote efficient technologies with policy intervention. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy balance; Ethanol; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use change; Life-cycle analysis","Corn-ethanol; Efficient technology; Ethanol production; Indirect effects; Land use change; Life-cycle analysis; Policy intervention; Simulation result; Technology improvement; Transportation fuels; Cellulosic ethanol; Energy balance; Ethanol; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Technology; Gas emissions; biofuel; crop production; energy balance; ethanol; greenhouse gas; land use change; life cycle analysis; maize; technological development; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953274689

The CO2 emissions of UCH, having an average annual growth rate of 10.3%, accounted for 4.4% of China's total CO2 emissions in 2009. This paper analyzes the feasibility of replacing UCH with heat pump heating (HPH) in China's climatic suitable regions and evaluates the corresponding potential for energy saving and emission reduction. Current strategy of replacing coal-based UCH with natural gas-based UCH is expected to decrease CO2 emissions by 63.5%. However, the CO2 emissions of HPH are 55.4% less than those of natural gas-based UCH. Replacing coal-based UCH with HPH is capable of decreasing CO2 emissions by 83.7% and consequently decreases the CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 4.2% by 2020 compared with 2005 level. This contributes about 10.5% to China's 2020 CO2 emission reduction target. For controlling environmental pollution and protecting ecological environment better, China should adjust its strategy for CO2 emission reduction by shifting its attention from replacing coal-based UCH with natural gas-based UCH to popularizing HPH in climatic suitable regions. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Average annual growth rates; Ecological environments; Emission reduction; Energy saving; Environmental pollutions; Gross domestic products; Heat pumps; Inhalable particles; Per unit; Coal; Gas emissions; Heating; Natural gas; Pollution; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; coal; natural gas; sulfur oxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal; emission control; energy conservation; feasibility study; Gross Domestic Product; growth rate; heat island; heating; natural gas; pump; strategic approach; air pollution; article; China; climate; ecology; ecosystem; energy; environmental protection; exhaust gas; goal attainment; gross national product; heating; population growth; urban area; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Heating; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957822027

We propose that there is potential for substantial reductions in N 2O emissions through the addition of denitrification processes to existing nitrifying wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are designed to lower ammonia levels but currently do not reduce overall Nr. In addition to providing the benefit of reducing total nitrogen concentrations in the effluent, this kind of WWTP upgrade has been demonstrated to reduce energy consumption and fossil CO 2 emissions. We show that the creation of a greenhouse gas (GHG) crediting system for the wastewater sector could provide a potentially sizable economic incentive on the order of $10 million to $600 million per year in the U.S. for upgrading of nitrifying WWTPs that results in N 2O reductions, with an ancillary benefit of another $30-100 million per year from electricity savings. Even if biological nitrogen removal (BNR) treatment were mandated by existing and future water quality regulations, a GHG crediting system could still be created to promote BNR design and operation that drive N 2O emissions below a baseline to even lower levels. In this case GHG credits could offset around 0.5-70% of the operating and maintenance cost for the BNR. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Ancillary benefits; Biological nitrogen removal; Denitrification process; Design and operations; Economic incentive; Electricity saving; Maintenance cost; Nitrogen management; Pollution reduction; Quality regulation; Reactive nitrogen; Substantial reduction; Total nitrogen; Wastewater treatment plants; Carbon dioxide; Effluents; Energy utilization; Global warming; Maintenance; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water quality; Water treatment plants; Greenhouse gases; ammonia; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; reactive nitrogen species; water; baseline conditions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; denitrification; emission control; greenhouse gas; maintenance; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; waste management; waste treatment; wastewater; water quality; article; biological nitrogen removal; concentration (parameters); denitrification; economic aspect; energy consumption; fossil; greenhouse gas; nitrifyer; nitrous oxide emission; reduction; United States; waste component removal; waste water; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; water quality; Biodegradation, Environmental; Conservation of Energy Resources; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Chemical; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; United States; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Management; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960937215

However, emissions other than CO2 from PCs are estimated to decrease nearly 70% by 2020 compared to NI scenario mainly due to technological improvement linked to the vehicle emissions standards under a recent policy (RP) scenario. Fuel economy (FE) enhancement and the penetration of advanced propulsion/fuel systems could be co-benefit measures to control CO2 and pollutant emissions for the mid and long terms.

Thus, estimating forest carbon is becoming important to develop policies for mitigating climate change and trading carbon credits. However, a great challenge is how to quantify uncertainties in estimation of forest carbon. This study investigated uncertainties of mapping aboveground forest carbon due to location errors of sample plots for Lin-An County of China. National forest inventory plot data and Landsat TM images were combined using co-simulation algorithm. The findings show that randomly perturbing plot locations within 10 distance intervals statistically did not result in biased population mean predictions of aboveground forest carbon at a significant level of 0.05, but increased root mean square errors of the maps. The perturbations weakened spatial autocorrelation of aboveground forest carbon and its correlation with spectral variables. The perturbed distances of 800 m or less did not obviously change the spatial distribution of predicted values. However, when the perturbed distances were 1600 m or larger, the correlation coefficients of the predicted values from the perturbed locations with those from the true plot locations statistically did not significantly differ from zero at a level of 0.05 and the spatial distributions became random. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Aboveground forest carbon mapping; Forest inventory; Plot location error; Remote sensing; Simulation; Uncertainty analysis","Aboveground forest carbon mapping; Atmospheric concentration; Carbon credits; Co-simulation algorithms; Correlation coefficient; Distance intervals; Forest carbon sinks; Forest inventory; Landsat TM images; Location errors; National forest inventories; Plot location error; Remotely sensed data; Root mean square errors; Simulation; Spatial autocorrelations; Spectral variables; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Errors; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Spatial variables measurement; Uncertainty analysis; Forestry; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Errors; Forestry; Mapping; Remote Sensing; Simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958734875

In this study, four subtropical reservoirs and their related reaches, draining on karstic area in southwest of China, were investigated to understand their CO2 emission, with monthly sampling strategy from July 2007 to June 2008. pCO2 values in the surface water of these reservoirs ranged from 38 to 3300 μ atm, indicating that reservoir surface could be not only source but also sink to atmosphere CO2 in different seasons. In Hongfeng reservoir, the flux of CO2 from surface water varied from -9 to 70 mmol m-2 d-2 with an average of 15 mmol m-2 d-2, and in Baihua reservoir, it had a range from -8 to 77 mmol m-2 d-2 with an average of 24 mmol m-2 d-2. Hongyan reservoir had similar average flux of CO2 to Baihua reservoir. Xiuwen had the highest average flux of CO2 with a value of 47 mmol m-2 d-2 among the studied reservoirs. Downstream the dams discharged by hydropower generation from these reservoirs generally had quite high flux of CO2, with an average of 489 ± 297 mmol m-2 d-2, which is close to those from tropical rivers. This means that water releasing from these reservoirs would be an important way for CO2 emission into atmosphere. The results showed that dam construction has significant impacts on the river water chemistry, with abrupt changes in pCO2, DO, T, pH and SIc in surface water and their outlets. In addition, with the development of thermal gradient in warm seasons, water chemistry along the water column of reservoirs also showed seasonal variations, except in Xiuwen reservoir which only has daily storage capacity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cascade reservoirs; CO2 diffusion flux; Karstic area; Maotiao River; Subtropical region","Cascade reservoirs; CO2 diffusion flux; Karstic area; Maotiao River; Subtropical regions; Carbon dioxide; Dams; Global warming; Hydrochemistry; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Rivers; Tropics; Reservoirs (water); carbon dioxide; river water; surface water; air-water interaction; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; chemical composition; emission inventory; hydroelectric power plant; karst; reservoir; river system; river water; subtropical region; surface water; temperature gradient; water column; article; atmosphere; carbon footprint; China; hydropower; priority journal; river; seasonal variation; water sampling; water supply; China; Guizhou; Maotiao River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957707810

There is an urgent need to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cities if ambitious mitigation targets are to be met. Meanwhile, cities are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change unless adaptation plans can be put in place. The need to connect climate change adaptation and mitigation with broader assessment of sustainability is becoming increasingly recognised. This paper describes an urban integrated assessment facility developed by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, which simulates socio-economic change, climate impacts and greenhouse gas emissions over the course of the twenty first century at the city scale. The urban integrated assessment facility adopts a broad-scale systems approach to urban development and sustainability assessment. It incorporates a multi-sectoral model of the regional economy, hierarchical city-scale spatial interaction model and modules for assessment of climate impacts, adaptation options and greenhouse gas emissions. The paper demonstrates how the urban integrated assessment facility quantifies synergies and conflicts between adaptation to climate change and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in order to improve decision making and facilitate the development of portfolios of planning policies that together have a realistic prospect of achieving sustainable outcomes for cities.","Environment; Sustainability; Town and City planning","Climate models; Decision making; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Environment; Integrated assessment; Socio-economic change; Spatial interaction model; Sustainability assessment; Climate change; climate change; decision making; greenhouse gas; mitigation; regional economy; sustainability; urban area; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957938192

The yellow pine chipmunk (Tamias amoenus), which occupies semi-arid pine forests of western North America, engages in mutualistic relationships with its food plants by dispersing seeds. These chipmunks scatter hoard seeds during spring, summer, and early autumn in soil; unrecovered seeds germinate in the spring. The eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) of eastern North America occupies mesic deciduous forests. These chipmunks primarily larder hoard seeds and nuts. Seeds in burrow larders cannot establish seedlings, so these chipmunks have not been documented to be involved in mutualistic plant-animal interactions. The differences in behaviour and the roles that these 2 species play in their communities appear to be caused by differences in precipitation. Scattered caches are more secure from pilferers in the dry western environment because olfaction is moisture dependent. In the more mesic eastern forests, scattered caches are quickly pilfered, causing chipmunks to store most food in larders, which they defend. Climate (i.e., amount of precipitation) also influences many other aspects of the ecology of these species, including home range size, the size and role of the home burrow, mode of foraging, and diet.","Caching; coevolution; larder hoarding; mutualism; scatter hoarding; seed dispersal; seed predation","burrow; caching; climate effect; coevolution; deciduous forest; diet; foraging behavior; germination; mutualism; range size; rodent; seed dispersal; seed predation; North America; Animalia; Tamias amoenus; Tamias striatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960012098

Hence, global climate change is altering these environmental cues and will preclude, delay, or enhance regeneration from seeds, as already documented in some cases. Along with compromised seedling emergence and vigour, shifts in germination phenology will influence population dynamics, and thus, species composition and diversity of communities. Altered seed maturation (including consequences for dispersal) and seed mass will have ramifications on life history traits of plants. Predicted changes in temperature and precipitation, and thus in soil moisture, will affect many components of seed persistence in soil, e.g. seed longevity, dormancy release and germination, and soil pathogen activity. More/less equitable climate will alter geographic distribution for species, but restricted migratory capacity in some will greatly limit their response. Seed traits for weedy species could evolve relatively quickly to keep pace with climate change enhancing their negative environmental and economic impact. Thus, increased research in understudied ecosystems, on key issues related to seed ecology, and on evolution of seed traits in nonweedy species is needed to more fully comprehend and plan for plant responses to global warming. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Germination phenology; Global climate change; Recruitment; Seed dormancy; Seed germination; Seedling emergence; Soil seed bank","climate change; environmental cue; environmental effect; germination; life history trait; longevity; maturation; phenology; recruitment (population dynamics); regeneration; seed bank; seed dormancy; seedling emergence; vigor",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955075549

The domestic policy debate is characterized by a vibrant engagement involving government, business, labour and civil society. The policy option with greatest potential for reducing emissions is carbon pricing through a carbon tax or emissions' trading scheme. The welfare and development impacts need to be carefully considered. The broader debate considers economic efficiency, environmental effectiveness, welfare impacts, competitiveness impacts, design implications given market concentration, and complexity and transaction costs. This article examines the challenges of pricing carbon given considerations of political economy, such as high unemployment, poverty and lack of access to basic services. The article shows a preference emerging for a carbon tax. A carbon tax does not create equivalent certainty with respect to environmental outcomes, but the tax level can be adjusted to achieve desired emissions reductions. Where the policy priority is price stability a tax is advantageous, providing long-term policy signals to investors, as well as price transparency, fiscal revenue stability, economy-wide coverage of emissions and administrative efficiency. However, three implementation issues need clarity: limiting welfare impacts on poor households; the feasibility of a hybrid model; and integrating carbon pricing with the broader transition to a low-carbon economy. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Carbon tax; Climate change; Developing country; Economic instruments; Emissions trading; Environmental effectiveness; Mitigation; Policy debate; South Africa; Welfare","administration; carbon; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; economic instrument; emission control; emissions trading; environmental effect; environmental tax; market system; pricing policy; state role; South Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857771341

We have established a laboratory-based facility that has verified many of the details of our original theoretical description and agrees well with numerical simulations. The experiment has demonstrated that the horseshoe distribution does indeed produce cyclotron emission at a frequency just below the local cyclotron frequency, with polarization close to X-mode and propagating nearly perpendicularly to the beam motion. We discuss recent developments in the theory and simulation of the instability including addressing a radiation escape problem and the effect of competing instabilities, relating these to the laboratory, space, and astrophysical observations. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",,"Auroral kilometric radiations; Beam motion; Cyclotron emission; Cyclotron frequency; Cyclotron maser emissions; Energetic electron; Escape problem; Horseshoe distribution; Momentum distributions; Polar Regions; Magnetic fields; Planets; Stars; Cyclotrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958843102

In practice, hard budget constraints are present in any decision-making process and therefore available alternatives need to be hierarchised in a fast but still reliable manner. Moreover, realistic strategies require adequate information on the available control measures, taking also into account the area's special characteristics. The selection of the most applicable bundle of measures rests in achieving stakeholders' consensus, while taking into consideration mutually conflicting views and criteria. A preliminary qualitative comparison of alternative control measures would be most handy for decision-makers, forming the grounds for an in-depth analysis of the most promising ones. This paper presents an easy-to-follow multicriteria methodological approach in order to include and synthesise multi-disciplinary knowledge from various stakeholders so as to result into a priority list of abatement options, achieve consensus and secure the adoption of the resulting optimal solution. The approach relies on the active involvement of public authorities and local stakeholders in order to incorporate their environmental, economic and social preferences. The methodological scheme is implemented for the case of Thessaloniki, Greece, an area considered among the most polluted cities within Europe, especially with respect to airborne particles. Intense police control, natural gas penetration in buildings and metro construction equally result into the most ""promising"" alternatives in order to control air pollution in the GTA. The three optimal alternatives belong to different thematic areas, namely road transport, thermal heating and infrastructure. Thus, it is obvious that efforts should spread throughout all thematic areas. Natural gas penetration in industrial units, intense monitoring of environmental standards and regular maintenance of heavy oil burners are ranked as 4th, 5th and 6th optimal alternatives, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Control options; Decision-making; Experts; Multicriteria analysis","Airborne particle; Budget constraint; Control measures; Decision makers; Decision making process; Environmental standards; Experts; Gas penetration; In-buildings; In-depth analysis; Industrial units; Methodological approach; Metro construction; Multi-criteria; Multi-disciplinary; Multicriteria analysis; Optimal alternative; Optimal solutions; Priority list; Public authorities; Road transports; Social preference; Thermal heating; Thessaloniki , Greece; Urban air pollution; Air quality; Boats; Decision making; Natural gas; Optimization; Pollution; Quality control; Subways; Air pollution control; abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; decision making; heating; heavy oil; multicriteria analysis; road transport; stakeholder; transportation infrastructure; urban climate; air pollution control; air quality control; article; decision making; priority journal; social aspect; urban area; Central Macedonia; Greece; Thessaloniki [Central Macedonia]; Thessaloniki",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959493159

It is within this context that the recent decision by the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reject studies of climate change in its consideration of reoperation of the Yuba-Bear Drum-Spaulding hydroelectric facilities in northern California is shown to be poorly reasoned and risky. Given the rapidity of climate warming, and its anticipated impacts to natural and human communities, future long-term fixed licenses of hydropower operation will be ill prepared to adapt if science-based approaches to incorporating reasonable and foreseeable hydrologic changes into study plans are not included. The licensing of hydroelectricity generation can no longer be issued in isolation due to downstream contingencies such as domestic water use, irrigated agricultural production, ecosystem maintenance, and general socioeconomic well-being. At minimum, if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is to establish conditions of operation for 30-50years, licensees should be required to anticipate changing climatic and hydrologic conditions for a similar period of time. © 2011 American Water Resources Association.","Climate change; Environmental regulations; Hydropower; Relicensing; Water law; Water policy","Agricultural productions; California; Climate warming; Domestic water use; Ecosystem services; Energy supplies; Federal energy regulatory commissions; Global climate warming; Human communities; Hydroelectric facilities; Hydroelectricity generation; Hydrologic changes; Hydrologic conditions; Hydropower; Relicensing; Study plans; Water policy; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Environmental regulations; Hydroelectric power; Laws and legislation; Water management; Water supply; Climate change; agricultural production; climate change; ecosystem service; electricity generation; environmental policy; federal system; hydroelectric power; policy implementation; socioeconomic survey; vulnerability; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953225999

Relatively little is known about the control of isoprene emission at the molecular level. Using transgenic tobacco lines harbouring a poplar isoprene synthase gene, we examined control of isoprene emission. Isoprene synthase required chloroplastic localization for catalytic activity, and isoprene was produced via the methyl erythritol (MEP) pathway from recently assimilated carbon. Emission patterns in transgenic tobacco plants were remarkably similar to naturally emitting plants under a wide variety of conditions. Emissions correlated with photosynthetic rates in developing and mature leaves, and with the amount of isoprene synthase protein in mature leaves. Isoprene synthase protein levels did not change under short-term increase in heat/light, despite an increase in emissions under these conditions. A robust circadian pattern could be observed in emissions from long-day plants. The data support the idea that substrate supply and changes in enzyme kinetics (rather than changes in isoprene synthase levels or post-translational regulation of activity) are the primary controls on isoprene emission in mature transgenic tobacco leaves. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Chloroplast; Circadian rhythms; Isoprene synthase","1,3 butadiene derivative; carbon; carbon dioxide; cell extract; drug derivative; erythritol; fosfomycin; fosmidomycin; hemiterpene; isoprene; isoprene synthase; pentane; transferase; vegetable protein; biosphere; catalysis; chloroplast; circadian rhythm; enzyme activity; isoprene; photosynthesis; protein; reaction kinetics; tobacco; transgenic plant; article; biocatalysis; biological model; biosynthesis; chloroplast; circadian rhythm; drug effect; enzymology; genetics; growth, development and aging; isotope labeling; light; metabolism; photosynthesis; plant leaf; radiation exposure; temperature; tobacco; transgenic plant; Western blotting; Alkyl and Aryl Transferases; Biocatalysis; Blotting, Western; Butadienes; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Extracts; Chloroplasts; Circadian Rhythm; Erythritol; Fosfomycin; Hemiterpenes; Isotope Labeling; Light; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Biological; Pentanes; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Temperature; Tobacco; Nicotiana obtusifolia; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955742421

Here, we describe how species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to identify areas predicted as both suitable for rare native species and highly susceptible to invasion by alien species, at present and under future climate and land-use scenarios. To assess the condition and dynamics of such conflicts, we developed a combined predictive modelling (CPM) approach, which predicts species distributions by combining two SDMs fitted using subsets of predictors classified as acting at either regional or local scales. We illustrate the CPM approach for an alien invader and a rare species associated with similar habitats in northwest Portugal. Combined models predict a wider variety of potential species responses, providing more informative projections of species distributions and future dynamics than traditional, non-combined models. They also provide more informative insight regarding current and future rare-invasive conflict areas. For our studied species, conflict areas of highest conservation relevance are predicted to decrease over the next decade, supporting previous reports that some invasive species may contract their geographic range and impact due to climate change. More generally, our results highlight the more informative character of the combined approach to address practical issues in conservation and management programs, especially those aimed at mitigating the impact of invasive plants, land-use and climate changes in sensitive regions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alien invaders; Climate change; Combined predictive modelling; Land-use change; Rare species; Species distribution models","biodiversity; biological invasion; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; geographical region; invasive species; land use change; native species; rare species; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955004706

By 2015 the limit value must be adhered to in the Netherlands. Although the total road length for which exceedance is likely is expected to decrease over the coming years, exceedances may still occur by 2015. Future NO2 concentrations not only depend on economic growth, current and proposed policies, and on inevitable meteorological fluctuations, they also depend on the effectiveness of technical measures to reduce emissions. New emission measurements for heavy-duty vehicles in the Euro-V (and Euro-III) emission standard categories, carried out under typical Dutch driving conditions, have revealed that real-world NOx emissions from these trucks are significantly higher than was previously estimated based on the reduction steps in the Euro emission standards. Emission levels were higher, by about a factor of three, along city streets, and 10 to 40% higher along motorways. These higher emission levels resulted in higher estimated national NOx emissions, increasing from 250kt to 264kt, compared with the national emission ceiling of 260kt, to be adhered to by 2010.

This research focuses on the analysis of water and agricultural policies aimed at conserving groundwater resources and maintaining rural livelihoods in a basin in Spain's central arid region. Intensive groundwater mining for irrigation has caused overexploitation of the basin's large aquifer, the degradation of reputed wetlands and has given rise to notable social conflicts over the years. With the aim of tackling the multifaceted socio-ecological interactions of complex water systems, the methodology used in this study consists in a novel integration into a common platform of an economic optimization model and a hydrology model WEAP (Water Evaluation And Planning system). This robust tool is used to analyze the spatial and temporal effects of different water and agricultural policies under different climate scenarios. It permits the prediction of different climate and policy outcomes across farm types (water stress impacts and adaptation), at basin's level (aquifer recovery), and along the policies' implementation horizon (short and long run). Results show that the region's current quota-based water policies may contribute to reduce water consumption in the farms but will not be able to recover the aquifer and will inflict income losses to the rural communities. This situation would worsen in case of drought. Economies of scale and technology are evidenced as larger farms with cropping diversification and those equipped with modern irrigation will better adapt to water stress conditions. However, the long-term sustainability of the aquifer and the maintenance of rural livelihoods will be attained only if additional policy measures are put in place such as the control of illegal abstractions and the establishing of a water bank. Within the policy domain, the research contributes to the new sustainable development strategy of the EU by concluding that, in water-scarce regions, effective integration of water and agricultural policies is essential for achieving the water protection objectives of the EU policies. Therefore, the design and enforcement of well-balanced region-specific polices is a major task faced by policy makers for achieving successful water management that will ensure nature protection and human development at tolerable social costs. From a methodological perspective, this research initiative contributes to better address hydrological questions as well as economic and social issues in complex water and human systems. Its integrated vision provides a valuable illustration to inform water policy and management decisions within contexts of water-related conflicts worldwide. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Agricultural policies; Climate uncertainty; Economic model; Hydrology model; Integrated modeling; Water policies","agricultural policy; arid region; climate change; European Union; groundwater resource; human development index; hydrological modeling; irrigation; optimization; political conflict; sustainable development; water budget; water management; water planning; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956279787

In this study we use scaling laws based on solar system data to estimate the power and frequency of the auroral cyclotron emissions from interstellar planets (or sub-brown dwarfs). The emission can be powered either by motion of the planet through the interstellar plasma or by unipolar induction due to a moon. According to our results, in interstellar space the unipolar induction mechanism is potentially more effective than the motional emission mechanism. Typical emission power is around 10101012 W, but significantly stronger emissions are obtained in the most optimistic estimates. We have to conclude that detection of a rogue Jupiter would be very difficult, if not impossible with the radio telescopes available now or in the near future, but in very favorable conditions a much more massive and rapidly rotating (or otherwise strongly magnetized) gas giant with a large nearby moon could be detected up to ∼57 pc distance with the square kilometer array. There may be a few thousand large enough interstellar planets this close to the solar system. For reference, we point out that according to previous studies some known hot Jupiters are expected to emit up to 101410 16 W of cyclotron radiation, orders of magnitude more than the typical interstellar planets discussed here.

The objectives of this study were to gain insight into ecological hotspots of the cheese chain, and to judge the ecological impact of chain stages in the context of their economic value added. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to determine hotspots for global warming potential (GWP), land use and fossil energy use during production of Dutch, semi-hard cheese. To place ecological impact in an economic perspective, eco-efficiency of chain stages was determined, which was defined as the ratio of gross value added, and ecological impact. LCA and economic computations were based on empirical data from a specific Dutch cheese chain. Production of 1 kg cheese resulted in a GWP of 8.5kg CO2-eq., and required 6.8m2 land and 47.2MJ energy. Of all stages, on-farm milk production contributed most to GWP (65%), and to land use (58%), followed by cultivation of concentrate ingredients (12% to GWP and 24% to land use). Regarding energy use, cultivation of concentrate ingredients had the highest contribution (33%). The after farm gate stages cheese-making, storage, and packaging each contributed about 7%-13% to energy use and about 3%-4% to GWP, whereas retail had a marginal impact. To decrease the ecological impact of cheese production, reducing the impact of on-farm milk production (e.g., by using feed ingredients that reduce enteric methane emission in the cow), and reducing the impact of cultivation of concentrate ingredients (e.g., by using locally produced ingredients or by-products) would be most effective. Stages after farm gate can lower their impact by minimizing use of fossil energy and use of alternative energy resources. Minimizing losses of milk and cheese in stages after farm gate, furthermore, is an important improvement option to reduce the impact per kg cheese of the whole chain. Total gross value added of the whole chain was €5.94 per kg cheese. On-farm milk production added most economic value (34%), followed by retail (27%), cheese-making (17%), and packaging (17%). Total eco-efficiency of cheese was €0.78 per kg CO2-eq., €1.03 per m2 land, and €0.16 per MJ energy. Of all stages, cultivation of concentrate ingredients and storage had the lowest eco-efficiency for each impact, whereas retail had the highest. Combining ecological impact and eco-efficiency, shows that cultivation of concentrate ingredients is the most problematic stage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cheese production; Eco-efficiency; Ecological impact; Economic performance; Gross value added; Life cycle assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957999643

As the process from ischemia to infarction progresses, the ST-segment deviation is typically replaced by QRS abnormalities causing a falsely low estimated total MaR if determined by using ST segment-based methods. The purpose of this study was to investigate if consideration of the abnormalities in the QRS complex, in addition to those in the ST segment, provides a more accurate estimated total MaR during anterior AMI than by considering the ST segment alone. Methods: Twenty-five patients with acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) received technetium Tc 99m-sestamibi before percutaneous coronary intervention. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed within 2 hours after treatment and was used as a criterion standard for the estimated total MaR. The ECG recorded at admission in the hospital was used for the ECG estimated total MaR. This included an ST-segment estimated ischemic component of the total MaR (Aldrich score) and an estimated infarcted component of the total MaR in the acute phase of AMI by QRS abnormalities (Selvester score). These scores were added for the combined ECG score. Results: The ischemic component of the total MaR estimated by the Aldrich score alone had no statistically significant correlation with SPECT (r = 0.21, P = .32). The infarcted component of the total MaR estimated by the Selvester score showed a significant correlation with SPECT (r = 0.49, P = .01). Each score gave a significant underestimated total MaR measured by SPECT (P < .01). When the Aldrich and Selvester scores were combined, the correlation with SPECT was r = 0.47, P = .02. The combined score still underestimated the total MaR by SPECT (P < .01), though the difference was smaller in comparison to either method alone (P < .01). Conclusion: The ECG estimated total MaR was more accurate by taking both ST deviation and QRS abnormalities into account than by using either method alone. A new ECG method to determine the total MaR during acute coronary occlusion should consider both its ischemic and infarcted components. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,"methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; acute heart infarction; adult; Aldrich score; anterior myocardial infarction; article; clinical article; diagnostic accuracy; ECG abnormality; female; heart muscle injury; heart muscle ischemia; human; male; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; QRS complex; risk assessment; scoring system; Selvester score; single photon emission computer tomography; ST segment; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Radiopharmaceuticals; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955058997

These data series are obtained from the Dutch National Precipitation Chemistry Monitoring Network which consists of 11 monitoring stations which are homogeneously spread over the Netherlands. These long-term measurements allow for a trend analysis over this period, which are to a large extent not influenced by the year to year variations in meteorological circumstances. It is shown that the downward trend of ammonium, nitrate and sulfate wet deposition over the period 1992-2008 are statistically significant: the wet deposition in the Netherlands decreased in the period 1992-2008 by 37% for ammonium, 28% for nitrate and 59% for sulfate. A comparison between the measurements and emissions are made in order to check whether the emissions show similar downward trends. Subsequently a comparison is made between measured and calculated wet deposition fluxes. These calculation results were performed with the Operational Priority Substances (OPS-model). The trends in both the emissions and the calculated wet deposition fluxes show good agreement for all three measured components. It is therefore concluded that the downward trends of the wet deposition fluxes are a direct effect of the decrease of emissions. Finally, it is shown that the relative downward trend of the wet deposition fluxes of sulfate in the Netherlands shows a large-scale structure with a gradient running from east to west. A similar pattern is seen in the simulations performed with the OPS-model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Ammonium; Modeling; Monitoring network; Nitrate; Sulfate; Wet deposition","Ammonium; Modeling; Monitoring network; Sulfate; Wet deposition; Computer simulation; Deposition; Monitoring; Nitrates; Ammonium compounds; ammonia; nitrate; sulfate; ammonium; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; data set; emission inventory; monitoring system; nitrate; precipitation (chemistry); precipitation quality; regional climate; sulfate; temporal analysis; trend analysis; wet deposition; article; meteorological phenomena; Netherlands; priority journal; wet deposition; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957780720

During drought plants respond physiologically and structurally to prevent excessive water loss according to species-specific water use strategies. This has consequences for carbon uptake by photosynthesis and release by total ecosystem respiration. After a drought the disturbances in the reservoirs of moisture, organic matter and nutrients in the soil and carbohydrates in plants lead to longer-term effects in plant carbon cycling, and potentially mortality. Direct and carry-over effects, mortality and consequently species competition in response to drought are strongly related to the survival strategies of species. Here we review the state of the art of the understanding of the relation between soil moisture drought and the interactions with the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems. We argue that plant strategies must be given an adequate role in global vegetation models if the effects of drought on the carbon cycle are to be described in a way that justifies the interacting processes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycle; Climate change; Drought; Forest ecosystem; Stomatal conductance; Water use efficiency","carbohydrate; carbon cycle; climate change; developmental biology; disturbance; drought; ecological modeling; mortality; nutrient cycling; photosynthesis; respiration; soil moisture; soil organic matter; stomatal conductance; survival; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation structure; water use efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955639123

We aimed to document changes or stability of the tree line in a sub-Arctic model area at different temporal and spatial scales, and particularly to clarify the ambiguity that currently exists about tree line dynamics and their causes. Location The study was conducted in the Torneträsk area in northern Sweden where climate warmed by 2.5°C between 1913 and 2006. Mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) sets the alpine tree line. Methods We used repeat photography, dendrochronological analysis, field observations along elevational transects and historical documents to study tree line dynamics. Results Since 1912, only four out of eight tree line sites had advanced: on average the tree line had shifted 24m upslope (+0.2myear-1 assuming linear shifts). Maximum tree line advance was +145m (+1.5myear-1 in elevation and +2.7myear-1 in actual distance), whereas maximum retreat was 120m downslope. Counter-intuitively, tree line advance was most pronounced during the cooler late 1960s and 1970s. Tree establishment and tree line advance were significantly correlated with periods of low reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) population numbers. A decreased anthropozoogenic impact since the early 20th century was found to be the main factor shaping the current tree line ecotone and its dynamics. In addition, episodic disturbances by moth outbreaks and geomorphological processes resulted in descent and long-term stability of the tree line position, respectively. Main conclusions In contrast to what is generally stated in the literature, this study shows that in a period of climate warming, disturbance may not only determine when tree line advance will occur but if tree line advance will occur at all. In the case of non-climatic climax tree lines, such as those in our study area, both climate-driven model projections of future tree line positions and the use of the tree line position for bioclimatic monitoring should be used with caution. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate warming; Dendrochronology; Herbivory; Human impact; Mountain birch; Reindeer; Sub-Arctic; Sweden; Tree line dynamics","alpine environment; anthropogenic effect; arctic environment; climate change; deer; dendrochronology; dicotyledon; herbivory; subarctic region; treeline; Sweden; Betula pubescens; Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa; Lepidoptera; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551519659

Biomass currently supplies 14% of the world's energy needs. Biomass pyrolysis has a long history and substantial future potential-driven by increased interest in renewable energy. This article presents the state-of-the-art of biomass pyrolysis systems, which have been-or are expected to be-commercialized. Performance levels, technological status, market penetration of new technologies and the costs of modern forms of biomass energy are discussed. Advanced methods have been developed in the last two decades for the direct thermal conversion of biomass to liquid fuels, charcoals and various chemicals in higher yields than those obtained by traditional pyrolysis processes. The most important reactor configurations are fluidized beds, rotating cones, vacuum and ablative pyrolysis reactors. Fluidized beds and rotating cones are easier for scaling and possibly more cost effective. Slow pyrolysis is being used for the production of charcoal, which can also be gasified to obtain hydrogen-rich gas. The short residence time pyrolysis of biomass (flash pyrolysis), at moderate temperatures, is being used to obtain a high yield of liquid products (up to 70%wt), particularly interesting as energetic vectors. Bio-oil can substitute for fuel oil-or diesel fuel-in many static applications including boilers, furnaces, engines and turbines for electricity generation. While commercial biocrudes can easily substitute for heavy fuel oils, it is necessary to improve the quality in order to consider biocrudes as a replacement for light fuel oils. For transportation fuels, high severity chemical/catalytic processes are needed. An attractive future transportation fuel can be hydrogen, produced by steam reforming of the whole oil, or its carbohydrate-derived fraction. Pyrolysis gas-containing significant amount of carbon dioxide, along with methane-might be used as a fuel for industrial combustion. Presently, heat applications are most economically competitive, followed by combined heat and power applications; electric applications are generally not competitive. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bio-energy; Biofuels; Biomass; Pyrolysis","Bio oil; Bio-energy; Bio-mass energy; Biomass pyrolysis; Biomass To Liquid; Combined heat and power applications; Cost effective; Electric applications; Electricity generation; Energy needs; Flash pyrolysis; Global demand; Heavy Fuel-Oil; High yield; Higher yield; Hydrogen-rich gas; Industrial combustion; Light fuel oil; Liquid products; Market penetration; Medium term; Moderate temperature; Performance level; Pyrolysis process; Pyrolysis reactor; Reactor configuration; Renewable energies; Residence time; Rotating cones; Slow pyrolysis; Thermal conversion; Transportation fuels; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbohydrates; Carbon dioxide; Charcoal; Chemical reactors; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Electric generators; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuels; Fuel oils; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Liquids; Methane; Petroleum transportation; Rotation; Steam engineering; Steam reforming; Pyrolysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960351376

To understand the regulation behind these different phenotype properties, it is useful to know carbon flux patterns in the metabolic network which are generally calculated by metabolic flux analysis (MFA). However, rarely is biomass composition determined and carbon balance carefully measured in the same experiments which could possibly lead to distorted MFA results and questionable conclusions. Therefore, we carried out both detailed carbon balance and biomass composition analysis in the same experiments for more accurate quantitative analysis of metabolism and MFA.Results: We applied advanced continuous cultivation methods (A-stat and D-stat) to continuously monitor E. coli K-12 MG1655 flux and energy metabolism dynamic responses to change of μ and glucose-acetate co-utilisation. Surprisingly, a 36% reduction of ATP spilling was detected with increasing μ and carbon wasting to non-CO2by-products under constant biomass yield. The apparent discrepancy between constant biomass yield and decline of ATP spilling could be explained by the rise of carbon wasting from 3 to 11% in the carbon balance which was revealed by the discovered novel excretion profile of E. coli pyrimidine pathway intermediates carbamoyl-phosphate, dihydroorotate and orotate. We found that carbon wasting patterns are dependent not only on μ, but also on glucose-acetate co-utilisation capability. Accumulation of these compounds was coupled to the two-phase acetate accumulation profile. Acetate overflow was observed in parallel with the reduction of TCA cycle and glycolysis fluxes, and induction of pentose phosphate pathway.Conclusions: It can be concluded that acetate metabolism is one of the major regulating factors of central carbon metabolism. More importantly, our model calculations with actual biomass composition and detailed carbon balance analysis in steady state conditions with -omics data comparison demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive systems biology approach for more advanced understanding of metabolism and carbon re-routing mechanisms potentially leading to more successful metabolic engineering. © 2011 Valgepea et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli K12; adenosine triphosphate; carbon; article; biomass; culture technique; energy metabolism; Escherichia coli K 12; growth, development and aging; metabolism; metabolomics; Adenosine Triphosphate; Biomass; Carbon; Culture Techniques; Energy Metabolism; Escherichia coli K12; Metabolomics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959851454

Often cogeneration can be employed for both enhancing the plant profitability and increasing the overall energy yield. However, it is normally difficult to justify traditional cogeneration in tropical locations since there is little need for the heat produced. The main objective of this article is to investigate the opportunities and potentials for various types of absorption technologies driven by MSW power plants for providing both electricity and cooling. Results show that cogeneration coupling with thermally driven cooling is sustainably and economically attractive for both electricity and cooling production. The thermally driven cooling provides significant potential to replace electrically driven cooling: such systems are capable of providing cooling output and simultaneously increasing electricity yield (41%). The systems are also capable of reducing the fuel consumption per unit of cooling in comparison with conventional cooling technology: a reduction of more than 1MWfuel/MWcooling can be met in a small unit. MSW power plant coupled with thermally driven cooling can further reduce CO2 emissions per unit of cooling of around 60% as compared to conventional compression chiller and has short payback period (less than 5years). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Absorption chillers; Economic evaluation; Greenhouse gas reduction; MSW incineration; Thermally driven cooling; Tropical urban areas","Cooling; Cooling systems; Effluent treatment; Electricity; Energy conversion; Flue gases; Gas absorption; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Municipal solid waste; Power plants; Profitability; Refrigerators; Tropics; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Absorption chillers; Economic evaluations; Greenhouse gas reduction; MSW incineration; Thermally driven; Urban areas; Absorption cooling; absorption; cooling; greenhouse gas; heating; incineration; industrialization; municipal solid waste; power plant; profitability; sustainable development; urban area; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551533369

However previous work in this field is inconclusive, in terms of the mechanism that communicates snow anomalies to the monsoon summer, and even the region from which snow has the most impact. In this study we explore these issues in coupled and atmosphere-only versions of the Hadley Centre model. A 1050-year control integration of the HadCM3 coupled model, which well represents the seasonal cycle of snow cover over the Eurasian continent, is analysed and shows evidence for weakened monsoons being preceded by strong snow forcing (in the absence of ENSO) over either the Himalaya/Tibetan Plateau or north/west Eurasia regions. However, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of springtime interannual variability in snow depth shows the leading mode to have opposite signs between these two regions, suggesting that competing mechanisms may be possible. To determine the dominant region, ensemble integrations are carried out using HadAM3, the atmospheric component of HadCM3, and a variety of anomalous snow forcing initial conditions obtained from the control integration of the coupled model. Forcings are applied during spring in separate experiments over the Himalaya/Tibetan Plateau and north/west Eurasia regions, in conjunction with climatological SSTs in order to avoid the direct effects of ENSO. With the aid of idealized forcing conditions in sensitivity tests, we demonstrate that forcing from the Himalaya region is dominant in this model via a Blanford-type mechanism involving reduced surface sensible heat and longwave fluxes, reduced heating of the troposphere over the Tibetan Plateau and consequently a reduced meridional tropospheric temperature gradient which weakens the monsoon during early summer. Snow albedo is shown to be key to the mechanism, explaining around 50% of the perturbation in sensible heating over the Tibetan Plateau, and accounting for the majority of cooling through the troposphere. © 2010 Crown Copyright.","Eurasia; Himalaya; Indian monsoon; Seasonal forecast; Snow; Tibetan Plateau","atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric forcing; general circulation model; heat flux; monsoon; snow; teleconnection; troposphere; China; Eurasia; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954600414

Then, two typical driving cycles were developed for the first time for motorcycles and LDVs in Hanoi. Based on this database and the developed driving cycles for Hanoi, a sample of 12 representative test vehicles were selected to determine vehicle specific fuel consumption and emission factors (CO, HC, NOx and CO2). This set of emission factors were developed for the first time in Hanoi with due considerations of local driving characteristics. In particular, it was found that the emission factors derived from Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) driving cycles and adopted in some previous studies were generally overestimated. Eventually, emission inventories for motorcycles and LDVs were derived by combining the vehicle population data, the developed vehicle specific emission factors and vehicle kilometre travelled (VKT) information from the survey.

A supported metal catalyst (Ni/Al 2O3) reduced in a methane discharge is fully packed into the discharge region. The influence of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst packed into the gas gap on the electrical characteristics of the discharge is investigated. The introduction of the catalyst pellets leads to a transition in discharge behaviour from a typical filamentary microdischarge to a combination of spatially limited microdischarges and a predominant surface discharge on the catalyst surface. It is also found that the breakdown voltage of the CH4/CO2 discharge significantly decreases when the reduced catalyst is fully packed in the discharge area.

Binary mixtures with water, alcohols, glycols and hydrocarbons are investigated. Both phase equilibria (vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid) and densities are considered for the mixtures involved. Different approaches for modeling pure CO2 and mixtures are compared. CO2 is modeled as non self-associating fluid, or as self-associating component having two, three and four association sites. Moreover, when mixtures of CO2 with polar compounds (water, alcohols and glycols) are considered, the importance of cross-association is investigated. The cross-association is accounted for either via combining rules or using a cross-solvation energy obtained from experimental spectroscopic or calorimetric data or from ab initio calculations. In both cases two adjustable parameters are used when solvation is explicitly accounted for. The performance of CPA using the various modeling approaches for CO2 and its interactions is presented and discussed, comparatively to various recent published investigations. It is shown that overall very good correlation is obtained for binary mixtures of CO2 and water or alcohols when the solvation between CO2 and the polar compound is explicitly accounted for, whereas the model is less satisfactory when CO2 is treated as self-associating compound. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Acid gases; Association; CO2; CPA; Equations of state","Ab initio calculations; Acid gas; Adjustable parameters; Association; Association sites; CO2; Combining rules; CPA; Cross-association; Equation of state; Good correlations; Liquid-liquids; Modeling approach; Polar compounds; Self-associating fluids; Vapor-liquid; Behavioral research; Calculations; Calorimetry; Carbon dioxide; Equations of state of gases; Gas mixtures; Glycols; Hydrocarbons; Liquids; Phase equilibria; Solvation; Binary mixtures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957653127

The paper takes a multi-disciplinary and comparative approach of the legal and policy positions in three core European offshore wind energy markets and is motivated by a firm belief that the Supergrid is an ""achievable"" energy infrastructure project. Two central objectives of the Europe Union's energy policy are rooted in the Supergrid proposal. In the first instance, the Supergrid would enhance the expansion of renewable electricity generation in Europe, thus acting as an implementation tool for the European Union's climate change obligations. At the same time, the proposal would also contribute to the achievement of the union's triple energy policy goals: Emission reductions, energy security and technical competitiveness. In its second capacity, by developing an interconnected offshore grid network, the Supergrid would duplicate the congested European onshore grid and serve as a vast interconnector between energy markets. By enabling for the first time the genuine competitive trading of electricity across the union's borders, the proposal would considerably contribute to the achievement of the single European electricity market.",,"alternative energy; electricity generation; energy planning; energy policy; European Union; policy strategy; renewable resource; strategic approach; wind farm; wind power; Germany; Ireland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958130861

TE materials can be incorporated into power generation devices that are designed to convert waste heat into useful electrical energy. These TE materials can also be used in solid-state refrigeration devices for cooling applications. The conversion of waste heat into electrical energy will certainly play a role in our current challenge for alternative energy technologies to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This article provides an overview of the various TE phenomena and discusses some of the primary TE materials that are currently being investigated. Several of the key parameters and terminology are defined and discussed along with an overview of some of the current and emerging technologies.

A sub-scene of the predicted climate in the year 2100, under the B2a scenario of the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3), was extracted and calibrated with topographic variables. A machine learning algorithm based on the maximum entropy theory (Maxent) was employed to generate ecological niche models of 66 forest plant species from 22 families. The results of the study showed that altitude was a significant factor for calibrating all 19 bioclimatic variables. According to the global climate data, the temperature in Peninsular Thailand will increase from 26.6 °C in 2008 to 28.7 °C in 2100, while the annual precipitation will decrease from 2253 mm to 2075 mm during the same period. Currently, nine species have suitable distribution ranges in more than 15% of the region, 20 species have suitable ecological niches in less than 10% while the ecological niches of many Dipterocarpus species cover less than 1% of the region. The number of trees gaining or losing climatically suitable areas is quite similar. However, 10 species have a turnover rate greater than 30% of the current distribution range and the status of several species will in 2100 be listed as threatened. Species hotspots are mainly located in large, intact protected forest complexes. However, several landscape indices indicated that the integrity of species hotspots in 2100 will deteriorate significantly due to the predicted climate change. © 2011.","Climate change; Maxent; Peninsular Thailand; Plant species; Species distribution; Species vulnerability","algorithm; climate change; ecological impact; ecological modeling; landscape structure; niche; plant; range expansion; vulnerability; Thailand; Dipterocarpus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953044282

In bacteria, yeasts, and plants, 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) is converted to 4-carboxy-AIR (CAIR) by two enzymes: N5-carboxy-AIR (N 5-CAIR) synthetase (PurK) and N5-CAIR mutase (class I PurE). In animals, the conversion of AIR to CAIR requires a single enzyme, AIR carboxylase (class II PurE). The CAIR carboxylate derives from bicarbonate or CO2, respectively. Class I PurE is a promising antimicrobial target. Class I and class II PurEs are mechanistically related but bind different substrates. The spirochete dental pathogen Treponema denticola lacks a purK gene and contains a class II purE gene, the hallmarks of CO2-dependent CAIR synthesis. We demonstrate that T. denticola PurE (TdPurE) is AIR carboxylase, the first example of a prokaryotic class II PurE. Steady-state and pre-steady-state experiments show that TdPurE binds AIR andCO2 but notN5-CAIR. Crystal structures of TdPurE alone and in complex with AIR show a conformational change in the key active site His40 residue that is not observed for class I PurEs. A contact between the AIR phosphate and a differentially conserved residue (TdPurE Lys41) enforces different AIR conformations in each PurE class. As a consequence, the TdPurE 3 AIR complex contains a portal that appears to allow the CO2 substrate to enter the active site. In the human pathogen T. denticola, purine biosynthesis should depend on available CO2 levels. Because spirochetes lack carbonic anhydrase, the corresponding reduction in bicarbonate demand may confer a selective advantage. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Active site; Air shows; Antimicrobial targets; Class I; Class II; Conformational change; Conserved residues; Dental pathogens; Different substrates; Human pathogens; Ribonucleotides; Synthetases; Animals; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Carbonic anhydrase; Carboxylation; Genes; Substrates; Carbon dioxide; 5 aminoimidazole ribonucleotide; bacterial enzyme; carbon dioxide; carboxylase; histidine; protein PurE; ribonucleotide; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; article; conformational transition; controlled study; crystal structure; enzyme active site; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; prokaryote; steady state; Treponema denticola; Amino Acid Sequence; Carboxy-Lyases; Crystallization; Genes, Bacterial; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity; Treponema denticola; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Prokaryota; Spirochaetales; Treponema denticola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958140415

Here, we report the in vivo evaluation of three carbon-11-labelled non-sarcosine-type GlyT-1 inhibitors - [11C]SA1, [11C]SA2 and [11C]SA3 - as novel PET tracers for GlyT-1. Methods: The regional brain distributions of the three compounds in mice were studied at baseline and under receptor-blockade conditions with co-injection of carrier loading or pretreatment with an excess of selective GlyT-1 inhibitors (ALX-5407 and SSR504734). Metabolic stability was investigated by radio high-performance liquid chromatography. Dynamic PET scans in conscious monkeys were performed with/without selective GlyT-1 inhibitors. Results: The IC50 values of SA1, SA2 and SA3 were 9.0, 6400 and 39.7 nM, respectively. The regional brain uptakes of [11C]SA1 and [11C]SA3 in mice were heterogeneous and consistent with the known distribution of GlyT-1. [11C]SA2 showed low and homogeneous uptake in the brain. Most radioactivity in the brain was detected in unchanged form, although peripherally these compounds were degraded. Carrier loading decreased the uptake of [11C]SA1 in GlyT-1-rich regions. However, similar reductions were not observed with [11C]SA3. Pretreatment with ALX-5407 decreased the uptake of [11C]SA1 in GlyT-1-rich regions. In the monkey at baseline, regional brain uptake of [11C]SA1 was heterogeneous and consistent with the known GlyT-1 distribution. Pretreatment with selective GlyT-1 inhibitors significantly decreased the distribution volume ratio of [11C] SA1 in GlyT-1-rich regions. Conclusions: [11C]SA1 has the most suitable profile among the three carbon-11-labelled GlyT-1 inhibitors. Lead optimization of [11C]SA1 structure will be required to achieve in vivo selective GlyT-1 imaging. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","[11C]SA1; [11C]SA2; [11C]SA3; Glycine transporter 1; Positron emission tomography","2 chloro n [[ 1 methylpiperidin 2 yl][phenyl]methyl] 3 [trifluoromethyl]benzamide c 11; 2 chloro n [[1 methylpiperidin 2 yl][thiophen 3 yl]methyl] 3 [trifluoromethyl]benzamide c 11; 2 chloro n [[piperidine 2 yl][thiophen 3 yl]methyl] 3 [trifluoromethyl]benzamide; 2 chloro n [alpha (2 piperidinyl)benzyl] 3 trifluoromethylbenzamide; 2 chloro n [phenyl[piperidin s yl]methyl] 3 [trifluoromethyl]benzamide; benzamide derivative; glycine transporter 1; ligand; n [3 (4 fluorophenyl) 3 (4 phenylphenoxy)propyl]sarcosine; n [[1 methylpiperidin 2 yl][phenyl]methyl]thiophene 2 carboxamide c 11; n [phenyl[piperidine 2 yl]methyl]thiophene 2 carboxamide; non sarcosine based glycine transporter 1 inhibitor c 11; radiopharmaceutical agent; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; consciousness; controlled study; drug distribution; drug screening; drug stability; drug structure; drug uptake; Haplorhini; high performance liquid chromatography; IC 50; in vivo study; male; mouse; nonhuman; positron emission tomography; protein degradation; radioactivity; Amides; Animals; Carbon Radioisotopes; Consciousness; Glycine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Haplorhini; Ligands; Male; Mice; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiochemistry; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955477750

Here, we ""sum up"" the CCCP diffuse emission work by comparing the global morphology and spectrum of Carina's diffuse X-ray emission to other famous sites of massive star formation with pronounced diffuse X-ray emission: M17, NGC 3576, NGC 3603, and 30 Doradus. All spectral models require at least two diffuse thermal plasma components to achieve adequate spectral fits, a softer component with kT = 0.2-0.6 keV and a harder component with kT = 0.5-0.9 keV. In several cases these hot plasmas appear to be in a state of non-equilibrium ionization that may indicate recent and current strong shocks. A cavity north of the embedded giant H II region NGC 3576 is the only region studied here that exhibits hard diffuse X-ray emission; this emission appears to be nonthermal and is likely due to a recent cavity supernova, as evidenced by a previously-known pulsar and a newly-discovered pulsar wind nebula also seen in this cavity. All of these targets exhibit X-ray emission lines that are not well modeled by variable-abundance thermal plasmas and that might be attributed to charge exchange at the shock between the hot, tenuous, X-ray-emitting plasma and cold, dense molecular material; this is likely evidence for dust destruction at the many hot/cold interfaces that characterize massive star-forming regions. © 2011.

Consequently, numerous jurisdictions around the world have developed intervention plans that are employed during extreme heat events; beyond their emergency sections, these plans generally include preventive measures to be implemented each year. Over the last five years, local and regional information systems have been implemented in a few Canadian cities for surveillance purposes. However, until recently, no such systems existed at the provincial level. In the context of the Government of Quebec's 2006-2012 Action Plan on Climate Change, a real-time integrated system for the surveillance and monitoring of extreme heat events has been implemented on a provincial level. The system is a component of a broader approach that would also monitor the public health impacts of all types of extreme meteorological events.Results: After conducting a detailed needs analysis, the Quebec National Institute for Public Health developed and implemented an integrated web application leveraging open source software for the real-time Surveillance and Prevention of the impacts of Extreme Meteorological Events on public health, called the SUPREME system. Its first field use involved heat waves. This decision-support system is based on open source software and is composed of four modules: data acquisition and integration, risk analysis and alerts, cartographic application, and information dissemination - climate change and health portal. The system is available to health specialists through a secure web information portal and provides access to weather forecasts, historic and real-time indicators (including deaths and hospital admissions), alerts and various cartographic data used for conducting prevention activities and launching emergency measures.Conclusions: The SUPREME system was implemented and used during the summer of 2010. It served as an important decision-making tool during the July 2010 heat wave in the province of Quebec, Canada. Planned improvements for 2011 include the integration of data related to other risk factors for other extreme events to the system. The next steps will be to provide access to the application to other groups of specialists that are involved in the prevention, monitoring, or analysis of extreme meteorological events and their effects on community health and well-being. © 2011 Toutant et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"action plan; climate change; data acquisition; decision making; decision support system; extreme event; health impact; meteorology; public health; risk assessment; risk factor; software; World Wide Web; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; article; Canada; comparative study; computer program; disaster; health survey; human; Internet; medical informatics; methodology; public health; risk factor; statistics; weather; Disasters; Humans; Internet; Population Surveillance; Public Health; Public Health Informatics; Quebec; Risk Factors; Software; Statistics as Topic; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80955175452

Identifying the best forest management practices to sequester atmospheric carbon is a global priority in the framework of the climate change mitigation strategies. A new way of considering forest management is needed to conserve and enhance the carbon stocks in the forests, particularly the carbon stock of forest soils. Ecological, historical and socio-economic conditions as well as traditional forest management remain the crucial elements in establishment the best forest management option for a given landscape. Nevertheless, where ecological and socio-economic conditions are suitable, the so called ""forestry carbon"" should move towards the continuous cover forestry. This is a forest management option with minor impact on soil process and positive long-term effect on soil and forest carbon storage than the more frequent even-aged forest management. Where the conversion to continuous cover forestry is difficult to achieve because of social, economic, technical or ecological reasons, the elongation of rotation period of coppices and even-aged forests is a possible measure to increase forest carbon sequestration, but how much this management approach is realistic has to be assessed at regional scale by a full quantitative carbon analysis of the ""wood chain"" during the management cycle. Within the even-aged management option, thinning is a recommendable practise as it increases stand stability and therefore offers an important control mechanism for the maintenance of carbon storage in forest ecosystems. Finally the old-growth forests are relevant carbon sinks and their protection must be discussed if the increment of carbon sink capacity of terrestrial ecosystems will continue to be a crucial priority at global level. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Clear cutting; Forest management; Kyoto; NEE; Old-growth forest; SOC; Soil; Soil respiration; SOM; Thinning",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869507695

The impact of heatwaves is often felt strongest in towns and cities where populations are concentrated and where the climate is often unintentionally modified to produce an urban heat island effect; where urban areas can be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The purpose of this interdisciplinary study is to integrate remotely sensed urban heat island data alongside commercial social segmentation data via a spatial risk assessment methodology in order to highlight potential heat health risk areas and build the foundations for a climate change risk assessment. This paper uses the city of Birmingham, UK as a case study area.Results: When looking at vulnerable sections of the population, the analysis identifies a concentration of ""very high"" risk areas within the city centre, and a number of pockets of ""high risk"" areas scattered throughout the conurbation. Further analysis looks at household level data which yields a complicated picture with a considerable range of vulnerabilities at a neighbourhood scale.Conclusions: The results illustrate that a concentration of ""very high"" risk people live within the urban heat island, and this should be taken into account by urban planners and city centre environmental managers when considering climate change adaptation strategies or heatwave alert schemes. The methodology has been designed to be transparent and to make use of powerful and readily available datasets so that it can be easily replicated in other urban areas. © 2011 Tomlinson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Birmingham; Experian; GIS; Heat Risk; MODIS; Remote Sensing; Spatial Risk Assessment; UHI; Urban Heat Island","adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; GIS; hazard assessment; health risk; heat balance; heat island; interdisciplinary approach; MODIS; neighborhood; remote sensing; spatial analysis; strategic approach; urban area; vulnerability; Birmingham [Birmingham (DST)]; Birmingham [England]; England; United Kingdom; article; climate change; heat; heat stroke; human; methodology; risk assessment; United Kingdom; urban population; Climate Change; England; Heat Stroke; Hot Temperature; Humans; Risk Assessment; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958812539

This paper calls for greater integration of scattered trees into agricultural landscapes, hypothesizing that agroforestry practices effectively store carbon and deliver other important ecosystem services as well. Several agroforests from the Upper Lusatia area in eastern Germany have been selected for analysis. They cover relatively large areas of land (8.2%), even within this intensively used agricultural landscape, and their extent increased from 1964-2008 by 19.4%. Practices of conserving or promoting six agroforest classes are compared with a catalogue of essential properties for becoming effective 'carbon offset projects'. Criteria from mandatory and voluntary carbon markets for carbon sequestration are then applied (additionality, baselines, permanence, and carbon leakage). The study concludes that steps towards realization of 'carbon sequestration projects' should include collecting empirical evidence regarding the carbon sequestration potential of temperate agroforestry systems, developing localized demonstration projects, and upscaling these projects to participate in established carbon markets. © 2011 Landscape Research Group Ltd.","Carbon market; Ecosystem services; Multifunctional landscapes; Payments for ecosystem services (PES); Trees outside forests","agricultural land; agroforestry; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem service; forestry practice; landscape; nature conservation; Germany; Lusatia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960542643

The aim of the FEMG is to provide a better understanding of the factors affecting and ways of reducing fluoride evolution and emissions in smelters, and further, to provide smelters with an operational guide for reducing and managing fluoride emissions. Reduction in fluoride emission can be achieved by improvement of operational standards in the smelter. This includes operational, control and maintenance practices in the potroom, GTC, and other areas in the smelter that generate fluoride. Along with incorporated audit guidelines and training package, implementation of this guide can, in a short time, lead to significant reduction in fluoride emissions in aluminium smelters. © 2011 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.

Best practice services that yield high recycling rates, such as alternate weekly collections, are now largely mainstream in suitable areas. However, national recycling performance is short of what is needed; policy makers must look for innovative ways to meet challenging recycling targets. Increasingly, local authorities are using behaviour change interventions to encourage the public to recycle; these tend to be based on the premise that an individuals' behaviour is predetermined by their values. In practice, this has led to a host of initiatives that attempt to change individuals' behaviour without addressing situational barriers. In this paper, we argue that that a behaviour-centric approach has limited effectiveness. Using an analysis of the literature and studies that investigated recycling participation in the city of Portsmouth, we have identified three significant clusters that can facilitate effective recycling: infrastructure, service and behaviour (ISB). We present the ISB model - a tool that can be used by waste practitioners when planning interventions to maximise recycling to better understand the situation and context for behaviour. Analysis using the ISB model suggests that current best practice, ""business as usual"" interventions could realistically achieve a national recycling rate of 50%.

For the quantification of source-related mass, we considered two approaches based upon the FA results: 1) using single key tracers for sources identified by FA in a mass regression; and, 2) applying Absolute Principal Component Analysis (APCA). In each case, we followed a two-stage mass regression approach, in which secondary components were first apportioned among the identified sources, and then mass was apportioned to the sources and to other secondary mass not explained by the individual sources. The major U.S. PM2.5 source categories identified via FA (and their key tracers) were: Metals Industry (Pb, Zn); Crustal/Soil Particles (Ca, Si); Motor Vehicle Traffic (EC, NO2); Steel Industry (Fe, Mn); Coal Combustion (As, Se); Oil Combustion (V, Ni); Salt Particles (Na, Cl) and Biomass Burning (K). Nationwide spatial plots of the source-related PM2.5 impacts were confirmatory of the factor interpretations: ubiquitous sources, such as Traffic and Soil, were found to be spread across the nation, more unique sources (such as Steel and Metals Processing) being highest in select industrialized cities, Biomass Burning was highest in the U.S. Northwest, while Residual Oil combustion was highest in cities in the Northeastern U.S. and in cities with major seaports. The sum of these source contributions and the secondary PM2.5 components agreed well with the U.S. PM2.5 observed during the study period (mean = 14.3 μg m-3; R2 = 0.94). Apportionment regression analyses using single-element tracers for each source category gave results consistent with the APCA estimates. Comparisons of nearby sites indicated that the PM2.5 mass and the secondary aerosols were most homogenous spatially, while traffic PM2.5 and its tracer, EC, were among the most spatially representative of the source-related components. Comparison of apportionment results to a previous analysis of the 1979-1982 IP Network revealed similar and correlated major U.S. source category factors, albeit at lower levels than in the earlier period, suggesting a consistency in the U.S. spatial patterns of these source-related exposures over time, as well. These results indicate that applying source-apportionment methods to the nationwide CSN can be an informative avenue for identifying and quantifying source components for the subsequent estimation of source-specific health effects, potentially contributing to more efficient regulation of PM2.5. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Absolute Principal Component Analysis (APCA); Chemical Speciation Network (CSN); Fine particulate matter mass (PM2.5); Source apportionment","Absolute Principal Component Analysis (APCA); Biomass-burning; Chemical species; Composition data; Factor analysis; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter mass (PM2.5); Health effects; IP networks; Metals industries; Motor vehicle; Multivariate methods; Oil combustion; Primary emissions; Residual oil; Secondary aerosols; Secondary components; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Source identification; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatial patterns; Two stage; Air pollution control; Air quality; Chemical speciation; Chlorine; Coal combustion; Industry; Iron and steel plants; Lead; Manganese; Metal analysis; Organic carbon; Regression analysis; Steelmaking; Principal component analysis; arsenic; aspartic acid; calcium; chloride; iron; lead; manganese; nickel; nitrate; organic carbon; potassium; selenium; silicon; sodium; sulfate; vanadium; zinc; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; factor analysis; iron and steel industry; particulate matter; principal component analysis; spatial variation; speciation (chemistry); temporal variation; traffic emission; absolute principal component analysis; aerosol; air pollution; article; biomass; chemical composition; chemical speciation network; combustion; fine particulate matter; industrial area; iron and steel industry; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; principal component analysis; priority journal; source apportionment; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959515803

Buds of Populus balsamifera (balsam poplar) occurred with twigs of Picea glauca (white spruce) in the Presumpscot clay. Tree rings in Picea logs indicate that the trees all died during winter dormancy in the same year. Ring widths show patterns of variation indicating responses to environmental changes. Fossil mosses and insects represent a variety of species and wet to dry microsites. The late-glacial environment at the site was similar to that of today's Maine coast. Radiocarbon ages of 14 tree samples are 11,907±31 to 11,650±5014C yr BP. Wiggle matching of dated tree-ring segments to radiocarbon calibration data sets dates the landslide occurrence at ca. 13,520+95/±20calyr BP. Ages of shells juxtaposed with the logs are 12,850±6514C yr BP (Mytilus edulis) and 12,800±5514C yr BP (Balanus sp.), indicating a marine reservoir age of about 1000yr.

In part 1 of this study, their distribution in North and Baltic Sea water is reported, being of special interest because these seas are surrounded by highly industrialized countries with high population densities. Methods: A combination of solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used after optimisation to determine nine PFCs with chain lengths of C4 to C10 in water samples at ultra-trace levels. Results: The observed concentration distribution and gradients were explained by oceanographic mixing processes and currents. The big rivers were identified as major input sources. At the mouth of the river Elbe, concentrations of 9 ng/L were observed for perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and 8 ng/L for perfluorooctylsulfonate (PFOS); all other PFC concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 1.7 ng/L. At coastal stations, concentrations decreased to 3.8 ng/L (PFOA) and 1.8 ng/L (PFOS), dropping to 0.13 and 0.09 ng/L, respectively, towards the open sea. Along the Dutch coast, high perfluorobutylsulfonate concentrations (3.9 ng/L) were observed as regional characteristics. In the Baltic Sea, fairly even PFC distributions with low gradients were observed. Again, PFOA and PFOS were the major compounds (up to 1.1 and 0.9 ng/L). Conclusion: The results underline the necessity to include PFCs in marine monitoring programs. Water was found to be a good matrix for monitoring environmental levels, sources, and transport pathways of PFCs. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Baltic Sea; North Sea; Perfluorinated compounds; PFC; PFOA; PFOS; Sea water","alkanesulfonic acid; decanoic acid derivative; fluorocarbon; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; sea water; carbon; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; identification method; industrialization; liquid chromatography; marine pollution; mass spectrometry; matrix; mobility; oceanography; organic acid; population density; solubilization; article; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic States; chemistry; environmental monitoring; methodology; sea; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Baltic States; Decanoic Acids; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; North Sea; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Elbe River; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961167388

These zones are categorized in to five; Tehran, Rasht, Bandar Abbas, Ardebil and Yazd, based on weather conditions. Later on using an economic model, both annual energy savings and percentage of system profitability in each zone are calculated as well as reduction in annual emissions. It should be mentioned that, for economic calculations, gas and electricity price are determined using a sensitivity analysis. This analysis indicated that profitability of Micro CHP systems are sensitive to energy prices, as well as hours needed for heating room in each climate zones.The analysis results show that Ardebil with 38 million RLS (with electricity buyback) annual energy saving is recognized as the best option for installing Micro CHP.

It takes up recent trends in global energy demand and production and analyses to which extent this affects chances for achieving climate protection targets. The main target is to reduce global CO2 emissions to 3.7 Gt/a in 2050, thus limiting global average temperature increase to below 2°C and preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. A ten-region energy system model is used for simulating global energy supply strategies. A review of sector and region specific energy efficiency measures resulted in the specification of a global energy demand scenario incorporating strong energy efficiency measures. The corresponding supply scenario has been developed in an iterative process in close cooperation with stakeholders and regional counterparts from academia, NGOs and the renewable energy industry. The Energy [R]evolution scenario shows that renewable energy can provide more than 80% of the world's energy needs by 2050. Developing countries can virtually stabilise their CO2 emissions by 2025 and reduce afterwards, whilst at the same time increasing energy consumption due to economic growth. OECD countries will be able to reduce their emissions by up to 90% by 2050. However, without a comprehensive energy efficiency implementation strategy across all sectors, the renewable energy development alone will not be enough to make these drastic emissions cuts. © 2010 The Author(s).","CO2 reduction; Efficiency standard; Energy efficiency; Global demand projection; Global energy scenario; Renewable energy","CO2 reduction; Efficiency standard; Global demand; Global energy; Renewable energies; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Economics; Energy utilization; Renewable energy resources; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; demand analysis; economic growth; energy efficiency; energy resource; global economy; implementation process; OECD; renewable resource; stakeholder",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957597828

These regulators appear to form a complicated network mediating coordinated expression of a number of metabolic genes for efficient utilization of carbon and energy sources in response to changing environmental conditions. The C. glutamicum regulatory system of carbon metabolism is markely different from well-studied model systems of other bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.

Growing use of fossil fuel and climate change are increasing O3 concentrations to levels that threaten food supply. Historically, farmers have successfully adapted agricultural practices to cope with changing environments. However, high O3 concentrations are a new threat to food production and possibilities for adaptation are not well understood. We simulate the impact of ozone damage on four key crops (wheat, maize, rice and soybean) on a global scale and assess the effectiveness of adaptation of agricultural practices to minimize ozone damage. As O3 concentrations have a strong seasonal and regional pattern, the adaptation options assessed refer to shifting crop calendars through changing sowing dates, applying irrigation and using crop varieties with different growth cycles. Results show that China, India and the United States are currently by far the most affected countries, bearing more than half of all global losses and threatened areas. Irrigation largely affects ozone exposure but local impacts depend on the seasonality of emissions and climate. Shifting crop calendars can reduce regional O3 damage for specific crop-location combinations (e.g. up to 25% for rain-fed soybean in India) but has little implication at the global level. Considering the limited benefits of adaptation, mitigation of O3 precursors remains the main option to secure regional and global food production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","AEZ; Air quality; Climate adaptation; Food security; Mitigation; Ozone pollution","AEZ; Climate adaptation; Food security; Mitigation; Ozone pollution; Air quality; Crops; Food supply; Fossil fuels; Irrigation; Ozone; Pollution; Climate change; fossil fuel; ozone; agricultural practice; air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; food production; food security; food supply; fossil fuel; ozone; phytotoxicity; adaptation; agricultural parameters; article; climate change; crop management; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; food industry; harvest; India; irrigation (agriculture); maize; priority journal; rice; seasonal variation; simulation; sowing; soybean; surface property; wheat; China; India; United States; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953295169

The activated carbon samples were obtained by a physico-chemical method using steam activation. After activation the samples were treated with urea aqueous solution and heated from 400°C up to 800°C in nitrogen atmosphere. The IR and Raman spectra were measured after heating. Especially, in the high temperature region over 600°C, the intensity of the band corresponding to the C-H aromatic bond decreased. At least, two types of hydroxyl groups (phenol and alcohol groups) were obtained in carbon samples. The peak of phenol and/or alcohol O-H groups was reduced with treatment temperature. The catalytic activity of the initial and modified activated carbon samples were analyzed by the chemiluminescence technique.

In the Adjara solid waste management project, even though the need for reductions in GHG emissions is acknowledged, it is not one of the key factors for selecting the most appropriate treatment method. This study addresses the benefit of various solid waste treatment methods that could be used in the Adjara project in terms of reducing GHG emissions. Seven different options for solid waste treatment are examined: open dumping as the baseline case, four options for landfill technology (no provision of landfill gas capture, landfill gas capture with open flare system, with enclosed flare system and with electricity generation), composting and anaerobic digestion with electricity production. CDM methodologies were used to quantify the amount of reductions for the scenarios. The study concludes sanitary landfill with capture and burning of landfill gas by an enclosed flare system could satisfy the requirements, including GHG reduction potential. The findings were tested for uncertainty and sensitivity by varying the data on composition and amount of waste and were found to be robust. © 2011 The Author(s).","carbon credit; Clean development mechanism; Georgia; greenhouse gas; landfill; waste management","Carbon credits; Clean Development Mechanism; Economic incentive; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Flare systems; Georgia; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Key factors; Landfill gas; Reduction potential; Sanitary landfill; Treatment methods; Anaerobic digestion; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Solid wastes; Waste disposal; Gas emissions; anoxic conditions; clean development mechanism; climate change; economic analysis; electricity generation; emission control; greenhouse gas; landfill; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; waste treatment; weight; anaerobic digestion; article; carbon footprint; composting; dumping; Georgia (republic); landfill; priority journal; solid waste management; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Georgia (Republic); Greenhouse Effect; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052386262

Most, if not all, of these toxic effects are regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The AHR is a ligand activated transcription factor that has been shown to interact with numerous proteins capable of influencing the receptor's function. The ability of secondary proteins to alter AHR-mediated transcriptional events, a necessary step for toxicity, led us to determine whether additional interacting proteins could be identified. To this end, we have employed tandem affinity purification (TAP) of the AHR in Hepa1c1c7 cells. TAP of the AHR, followed by mass spectrometry (MS) identified ATP5α1, a subunit of the ATP synthase complex, as a strong AHR interactor in the absence of ligand. The interaction was lost upon exposure to TCDD. The association was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in multiple cell lines. In addition, cell fractionation experiments showed that a fraction of the AHR is found in the mitochondria. To ascribe a potential functional role to the AHR:ATP5α1 interaction, TCDD was shown to induce a hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane in an AHR-dependent and transcription-independent manner. These results suggest that a fraction of the total cellular AHR pool is localized to the mitochondria and contributes to the organelle's homeostasis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ATP synthase; ATP5a; Dioxin; Mitochondria","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; adenosine triphosphate; adenosine triphosphate 5 alpha 1; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cell fractionation; collisionally activated dissociation; comparative study; controlled study; embryo; gel electrophoresis; gene amplification; hepatoma cell; immunoprecipitation; mass spectrometry; mouse; nonhuman; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein purification; real time polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; ATP Synthetase Complexes; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Homeostasis; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxidative Phosphorylation Coupling Factors; Protein Binding; Protein Subunits; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960039241

The present study investigates the potential responses of terrestrial ecosystem hydrological cycles and plant water stress across China to elevated CO2 and climate change in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries using the calibrated and validated Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM) and eight climate change scenarios. The spatiotemporal change patterns of estimated evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, runoff, and plant water stress due to climate change and elevated CO2 are plotted singly and in combination. Positive future trends in ET, soil moisture, and runoff-although differing greatly among regions-are projected. Resultant plant water stress over China's terrestrial ecosystem generally could be eased substantially through the twenty-first century under the climate scenarios driven by emission scenarios that consider economic concerns. By contrast, under the climate scenarios driven by emission scenarios that consider environmental concerns, plant water stress could be eased until 2060, then begin to fluctuate until 2100. The net impact of physiological and structural vegetation responses to elevatedCO2 could result in an increasing trend in runoff in southern and northeastern China, and a decreasing trend in runoff in northern and northwestern China in the twentieth century. It is projected to reduce ET by 1.5 × 109 to 6.5 × 109 m3 yr-1 on average, and increase runoff by 1.0 × 109 to 5.4 × 109 m3 yr-1 during 2001-2100 across China's terrestrial ecosystems, although the spatial change pattern could be quite diverse. These findings, in partial contradiction to previous results, present an improved understanding of transient responses of China's terrestrial ecosystem hydrological cycles and plant water stress to climate change and elevated CO2 in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Hydrologic cycle; Runoff; Soil moisture","calibration; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem response; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; plant water relations; soil moisture; terrestrial ecosystem; twentieth century; twenty first century; vegetation dynamics; water stress; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959643434

The objective of this paper is to investigate the mechanism of CO2 miscible flooding in the Caoshe Oil Filed, which is the first fault-block sand oil reservoir to perform CO2 miscible flooding in China. A laboratory study including PVT tests, CO2 injection Swelling test and slim tube test were conducted. Based on the experiment results, a simulation study using an equation-of-state (EOS) compositional model including one-dimension and two-dimension profiles of injector-production well group were performed to evaluate the miscible mechanism of the CO2 flood pilot project in Caoshe oil field. The slim-tube simulation study was presented to examine the change of property of fluid including composition, viscosity, and density of oil phase and vapor phase and interfacial tension between oil and gas along the grids during the CO2 injecting process. Also, the effect of gas amount and injected pressure on the fluid property was evaluated. The two dimensional profile model was presented to examine the change of CO2 content dissolved in formation oil and oil viscosity of the miscible bank along the distance from the injector to producer. The laboratory tests and the simulation studies showed that: • the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of CO2 flooding in Caoshe oil field is 30 MPa; • The mole content of CO2 in oil phase can be reached 70 percent at present formation pressure (32 MPa); • CO2 can extract the intermediate hydrocarbon component of crude oil, even heavy hydrocarbon component, such as C19 +; • within a range of 100 m around the injector, CO2 and clued oil have achieved miscible, but the miscible bank is small due to the gas injection amount is small.

From 1982 to 2004, net primary productivity (NPP) increased for the young forest, and did not change significantly for the old-growth forest. The increase in NPP of the young forest resulted from recruitment of some dominant tree species characteristic of the subtropical mature forest in the region and an increase in tree density; decline of NPP of the old-growth forest was caused by increased mortality of the dominant trees. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon; Mortality; Net ecosystem production; Net primary productivity; Recruitment","biomass allocation; carbon sequestration; mortality; net ecosystem production; net primary production; old-growth forest; recruitment (population dynamics); soil carbon; subtropical region; tropical forest; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960340079

After oxidation pre-treatment, the oxidation state of the supported Pt was monitored by in situ Pt L3-edge XANES spectra while the temperature in the reaction mixture was ramped up and the catalytic reaction was followed by measuring the concentrations of C3H6 or C3H8, NO and O2. The operando experimental results were analyzed in terms of the catalytic reaction start-up temperature (20% HC conversion temperature) and the 50% Pt reduction temperature. A V-shape correlation was found between these two temperatures showing that an appropriate Pt reduction temperature should exist to lower the catalytic reaction start-up temperature. This result suggests that the creation of active metallic Pt sites together with the self-poisoning effect of adsorbed carbonaceous species on metallic Pt should determine the catalytic reaction start-up behavior of supported Pt catalysts. Besides the suitable Pt reduction temperature, the oxygen reactivity in the support oxide is also important for lowering the catalytic start-up temperature. The control of the Pt-support interactions to provide suitable Pt reducibility and also oxygen reactivity in oxide support are both important to achieve a lower catalytic reaction start-up temperature. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Automotive catalyst; NO reduction; Operando spectroscopy; Pt; Support effect","Automotive catalysts; NO reduction; Operando spectroscopy; Pt; Support effect; Absorption; Absorption spectroscopy; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalyst poisoning; Catalytic oxidation; Hydrocarbons; Lanthanum oxides; Oxidation; Oxygen; Platinum; Positive ions; Reduction; X ray absorption; Zirconium alloys; Catalyst supports",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957557229

The large dataset (226 collected sites) is used to highlight the processes controlling the distribution of dissolved chemicals in groundwaters; and, more importantly, to develop a general model (based on reaction-path modelling, and using the EQ3/6 code) of rock-water reactions in a carbonate environment. The investigated groundwater samples have conductivity between 31.7 and 8220 μS/cm; their total dissolved solids (TDS) content is higher near the coast area, where the seawater contribution becomes important. Calcium and HCO3- excess concentrations in groundwaters, with respect to the meteoric water-seawater mixing line, suggest that water-rock interactions in carbonate aquifers play a major role on water chemistry. Using the dataset, reaction-path modelling is used to simulate the evolution of groundwaters upon interaction with carbonate rocks. Model simulations are performed in time mode, taking into account the mineralogical composition of Madonie carbonate rocks, and the different dissolution rates of each dissolving mineral. The model results of reaction path calculations are in fair agreement with analytical data for natural waters, demonstrating the likelihood of model assumptions, and supporting further the relevance of carbonate dissolution in determining the chemistry of fluids in the investigated area. The developed model is useful for low-temperature weathering of carbonate mineral in general, and is thus likely to apply in a variety of geological contexts. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Analytical data; Carbonate aquifer; Carbonate rock; Data sets; Developed model; Dissolution rates; Dissolved chemicals; General model; Groundwater process; Hydrogeochemical; Low temperatures; Mineralogical compositions; Mixing lines; Model assumptions; Model results; Model simulation; Natural waters; Reaction path calculation; Total dissolved solids; Water chemistry; Water rock interactions; Aquifers; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Catchments; Chemical analysis; Computer simulation; Dissolution; Groundwater resources; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Rocks; Seawater; Silicate minerals; Weathering; Calcium carbonate; carbonate; catchment; data set; dissolved load; groundwater flow; groundwater-seawater interaction; hydrogeochemistry; low temperature; numerical model; seawater; water-rock interaction; Italy; Madonie Mountains; Palermo [Sicily]; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956257382

We provide a preliminary, village-level, climate-related vulnerability assessment of the rural communities in Sikkim, India. We found that climate change impacts have resulted in a reduction in the temporal spread of rainfall and an increase in the intensity with a marked decline in winter rain. We show that the subtropical villages (less than 1000 m), especially in the drought-prone zones are more vulnerable due to an increased outbreak of pests, diseases and weeds. Spring water sources are drying up and preservation of seeds during the warm winter is becoming risky. A high variation was found in the sensitivity and adaptive capacity due to the diverse developmental profile of the villages. Hence while climate change adaptation-related developmental interventions need to have a diverse sectoral profile, they must geographically target areas with specific interventions. We expect that this study will provide a scientific basis for designing climate change adaptation policy and programmes.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Rural communities; Vulnerability assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961161649

The worst fossil fuel in this regard is coal, which is the largest CO2-emitting fossil fuel in terms of weight. Although decreasing the use of coal is difficult because of its increasing demand in worldwide, there is still a possibility of effectively reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by substituting biomass, even for a subset of coal. One way to reduce the use of coal is to implement co-firing of biomass with coal at coal thermal power stations. In this study, the business impact of GHG reduction from semi-carbonized fuel produced by co-firing woody biomass with coal in thermal power plants is evaluated from the perspective of life cycles, using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The case study area is the central region of Wakayama prefecture, Japan. In this study, a new business is considered whose operations would co-fire the woody biomass with coal. A life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis and a life cycle impact assessment are conducted to evaluate the GHG emissions, taking into account processes such as cutting timber, manufacturing semi-carbonized fuel, and co-firing with coal. LCI data was collected and calculated on the basis of the feasibility study and literature survey. The spatial distribution of the woody biomass was ascertained using a geographic information system, and the location of several facilities and a road transportation network were determined. Results showed that an annual reduction in GHG emissions of approximately 46,700 tonnes in the case study area is possible if the business is executed. The environmental impact taking into account climate change, acidification and land use was also reduced. As the result, this business is in fact advantageous to reduce GHG emissions as well as the environmental impact. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change adds an additional source of problematisation to the functioning of traditional nation-states structures, not only at the international level but also with regard to their relations with sub-national agencies. This paper tests this hypothesis by analysing the emergence of climate strategies and capacities in region of Catalonia, north-east Spain, through the use of a novel integrated assessment tool called the 'climate learning ladder' that looks at four main dimensions: (1) how perceptions on climate change have evolved in this region since the beginning of the 1990s, (2) what type of incentives or systems of sanctions have triggered climate action, (3) what specific options are available or have been developed, and (4) what new institutional arrangements have been put in place during this time. Results indicate that although in Catalonia distinctive climate appraising processes have been tried, new measures have been implemented and new institutions have been created, not much of a distinctive progress regarding Integrated Climate Governance (ICG) has been achieved. Furthermore, this research shows that so far the main incentives which triggered climate action and innovation have been largely exogenous to the region. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Catalonia; Climate learning ladder; Integrated Climate Governance (ICG)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958049448

Recent concerns about the impact of fossil fuels on climate change have resulted in the increasing promotion of biofuels as an alternative to oil. While worries exist with regard to the environmental impact of biofuel production in ecologically sensitive areas, it has been argued that with an effective regulatory framework to promote sustainable production, biofuels could provide a mechanism to provide energy security in an environmentally positive way.1 The interest of the European Union (EU) in the promotion of biofuels production is a relatively recent phenomenon and it is now the world's largest producer of biodiesel and the fourth largest producer of bioethanol. At its most basic level, the promotion of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels is part of a wider EU effort to support the use of renewable energy. The promotion of renewable energy is traceable to a number of goals, a central one of which is ensuring security of energy supply.2 Other policy goals supported by the promotion of renewable energies include reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with climate change, decreasing dependence upon imported oil, the promotion of technological development as well as regional and rural development and employment.3 © Copyright 2011 British Institute of International and Comparative Law.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82555165542

The 3 million ha of oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands play a critical role in California's water supply system, providing runoffprimarily from winter rainfall events and hosting two-thirds of the state's drinking water reservoirs. Thus, understanding water storage and streamflow regulation by soils in these watersheds is essential for water resource planning under future climate change scenarios. The primary objectives of this research were to identify the drivers of soil moisture dynamics and the hydrologic budget at the catchment scale and their relationships with streamflow generation. A 33-ha headwater catchment in the Sierra Nevada foothills of northern California was instrumented to monitor climate, subsurface lateral flow, streamflow, and soil moisture within 100 pedons distributed throughout the catchment. A catchment-scale water balance was used to examine factors regulating spatial and temporal soil water distribution within the catchment. Relationships between soil, topographic, and vegetation characteristics and soil water content at each pedon were analyzed using a linear mixedeffects model with four fixed effects: Vegetation type or cover, presence or absence of a claypan, compound topographic index, and solar radiation. Streamflow was limited to periods when lower soil horizons were at or near saturation. Following saturation, each rainfall event generated subsurface lateral flow above the clay-rich argillic horizon, resulting in sharp hydrograph responses with little base flow between rainfall events. For the two water years examined, 9.6 and 11.5% of rainfall left the catchment as streamflow. Vegetation (tree vs. grassland), presence or absence of a claypan, aspect, and compound topographic index (index of wetness) were all significantly correlated to soil moisture status and thus streamflow generation at various times throughout the year. Findings indicated that watershed-scale hydrologic models based solely on surface topography will not fully explain dynamic temporal and spatial variability in hydrologic flow paths and streamflow generation in these oak woodland catchments. In particular, watershed-scale knowledge of soil stratigraphy (e.g., claypan distribution) was important for understanding catchment hydrology, especially the occurrence of subsurface lateral flow dynamics002E. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Baseflows; California; Catchment hydrology; Catchment scale; Claypan; Fixed effects; Future climate; Headwater catchment; Hydrographs; Hydrologic budgets; Hydrologic flow; Hydrologic models; Lateral Flow; Linear mixed-effects model; Primary objective; Quercus spp; Rainfall event; Sierra Nevada; Soil horizon; Soil moisture dynamics; Soil moisture status; Soil stratigraphy; Soil water content; Soil water dynamics; Soil-water distribution; Temporal and spatial variability; Topographic index; Vegetation type; Water availability; Water balance; Water resource planning; Water storage; Water year; Winter rainfall; Climate change; Forestry; Geologic models; Landforms; Mathematical models; Moisture determination; Potable water; Radiation effects; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Soil moisture; Stratigraphy; Stream flow; Sun; Surface topography; Vegetation; Water content; Water resources; Water supply; Water supply systems; Watersheds; Catchments; catchment; climate change; climate prediction; deciduous forest; drinking water; flow pattern; hydrograph; Mediterranean environment; rainfall; saturation; soil horizon; soil moisture; soil water; solar radiation; stratigraphy; streamflow; topographic effect; water availability; water budget; water content; water flow; water planning; water resource; water storage; water supply; woodland; Drinking Water; Forestry; Mathematical Models; Moisture; Moisture Content; Plants; Radiation Effects; Rain; Reservoirs; Runoff; Soil; Stream Flow; Water Resources; Water Sheds; Water Supply; California; United States; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860413084

We developed a theoretical framework to investigate subjective and objective constraints on cognitive, affective, and behavioural engagement with the Great Barrier Reef climate change issue. A survey of 1623 Australian residents revealed high levels of cognitive and affective engagement with the Great Barrier Reef climate change issue, but that behavioural engagement was limited by objective constraints that intervene between individuals' desire to become engaged (affective engagement) and their ability to take relevant actions. Individuals were constrained from increasing their engagement with the Great Barrier Reef climate change issue primarily by lack of knowledge about actions they can take, lack of time, and having other priorities. Individuals' age, gender, education level, income, and place of residence influenced the probability that they would experience these and other specific constraints on engagement. We suggest that future Great Barrier Reef engagement strategies must endeavour to identify specific behaviour that individuals can undertake to help reduce the impact of climate change on the reef, and find ways to help people overcome the constraints they face on engagement in those activities. The theoretical framework we developed should be useful for investigating constraints on engagement with other environmental issues, but further empirical and conceptual work is necessary. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Community engagement; Constraints; Great barrier reef","anthropogenic effect; barrier reef; behavioral response; climate change; community response; conceptual framework; ecosystem resilience; empirical analysis; environmental issue; environmental legislation; environmental policy; mitigation; probability; stakeholder; theoretical study; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960030668

Similar to other CO2 separation technologies, CO2 desorption from the MEA/macroporous TiO2 sorbent is the most energy-intensive step in the overall CO2 separation process. The presence of water during the CO2 desorption process leads to a significant increase in energy consumption. Therefore, CO2 desorption in the absence of water is an important method to reduce energy consumption of CO2 separation using MEA/macroporous TiO2, which is determined by several major factors, including desorption kinetics. However, the study on CO2 desorption kinetics of supported MEA is lacking. This research was designed to make progress in this area. The CO2 desorption kinetic model of the MEA/macroporous TiO2 sorbent is experimentally derived with the data collected within the water-free desorption environment and theoretically proven by the pseudo-steady-state theory. The Avrami-Erofeyev mechanism controls the CO2 desorption process, which is first-order with respect to RNH 3+RNHCOO-, RNH3+, or RNHCOO-. The activation energy of the CO2 desorption process is 80.79 kJ/mol. The kinetic characteristics of the CO2 desorption are much superior to those associated with aqueous MEA-based CO 2 separation. The energy savings because of the use of MEA/macroporous TiO2 for CO2 separation not only results from avoiding the use of water, with its high specific heat capacity and high vaporization enthalpy, but also from the favorable desorption kinetics of the MEA/macroporous TiO2-based CO2 separation. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Desorption kinetics; Desorption process; First-order; Kinetic characteristics; Low energies; Major factors; Mechanism control; Monoethanolamine; Presence of water; Pseudo steady state; Separation process; Separation technologies; TiO; Vaporization enthalpies; Activation energy; Desorption; Energy utilization; Kinetics; Specific heat; Titanium dioxide; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960617670

MAGIC predicted that stream acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) values were above 20 μeq/L in all modeled watersheds in 1860. Hindcast simulations suggested that the median historical acidification of the modeled streams was a loss of about 25 μeq/L of ANC between 1860 and 2005. Although the model projected substantial changes in soil and stream chemistry since pre-industrial times, simulated future changes in response to emission controls were small. Results suggested that modeled watersheds would not change to a large degree with respect to stream ANC or soil % base saturation over the next century in response to a rather large decrease in atmospheric S deposition. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the relatively small simulated future changes in stream and soil chemistry depended on the extent to which S emissions are reduced. This projection of minimal recovery in response to large future S emissions reductions is important for designing appropriate management strategies for acid-impacted water and soil resources.

We compared soil carbon dioxide efflux, methane uptake, soil temperature, soil water content, soil O horizon mass, fine root mass, and microbial biomass between a burned site and an unburned site that had similar stand conditions to the burned site before the fire. Compared to the unburned site, soil carbon dioxide efflux was 40% lower and methane uptake was 49% higher at the burned site over the 427-day measurement period. Soil O horizon mass, microbial biomass, fine root mass, and surface soil water content were lower at the burned site than the unburned site, but soil temperature was higher. A regression model showed soil carbon dioxide efflux was more sensitive to changes in soil temperature at the burned site than the unburned site. The relative importance of methane uptake to carbon dioxide efflux was higher at the burned site than the unburned site, but methane uptake compensated for only 1.5% of the warming potential of soil carbon dioxide efflux at the burned site. Our results suggest there was less carbon available at the burned site for respiration by plants and microbes, and the loss of the soil O horizon increased methane uptake in soil at the burned site. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon; Methane uptake; Microbial biomass; Pinus ponderosa; Soil CO2 efflux; Wildfire","biomass; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; coniferous forest; forest soil; methane; microbial activity; nutrient uptake; soil carbon; soil horizon; soil water; water content; wildfire; United States; Pinus ponderosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957793810

In this process, beside the valuable product ethylene, unwanted by-products like CO2 are produced. Hence, the gas stream has to be refined further. The process is not applied in the industry yet, because of high separation costs. This article focuses particular on the CO2 purification of the OCM product stream. Therefore a case study was done for a design task of 90% CO2 capture from 25vol% in the OCM product gas with an operation pressure of 32×105Pa. Within the article is shown, how to resolve the lack of high separation cost for the purification and the development of an integrated, energy efficient CO2 capture process for the OCM refinery is described. Therefore a state of the art chemical absorption process using monoethanolamine (MEA) was developed and optimized for the base case. Therefore Aspen Plus® with the build-in rate based model for the mass transfer with an electrolyte NRTL - approach and chemical equilibrium reactions for the water-MEA-CO2 system as well as kinetic reactions based on the MEA-REA package was applied. In order to improve the energetic process performance, gas permeation with dense membranes was studied as process alternative. For this purpose a membrane unit was developed in Aspen Custom Modeler® (ACM). The solution-diffusion model with the free-volume-theory for gas permeation including Joule-Thomson effect as well as concentration polarization (Stünkel et al., 2009) was applied successfully. Furthermore several selective materials for a composite membrane with experimentally determined parameters were studied by this model and it was found, that a matrimide membrane provides the best selectivity performance for the OCM CO2 capture. Based on this material a membrane module was installed to form a hybrid separation process in combination with the amine based absorption process. The comparison of the state of the art process with the novel hybrid separation process shows an energy saving of more than 40% for the OCM CO2 capture. In the experimental study the stand alone performance of each unit, as well as the performance of the hybrid process were studied and the results are presented in this article. © 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Absorption; Carbon dioxide capture; Hybrid process; Membrane; Oxidative coupling of methane","Absorption process; ASPEN PLUS; Carbon dioxide capture; Chemical absorption; Chemical equilibriums; Concentration polarization; Dense membrane; Design tasks; Electrolyte-NRTL; Energetic process; Energy efficient; Experimental studies; Gas permeation; Gas streams; Hybrid process; Hybrid separation process; Joule-Thomson effect; Kinetic reactions; Membrane module; Monoethanolamine; Oil based; Operation pressure; Oxidative coupling of methane; Product gas; Product streams; Rate based model; Solution-diffusion model; Stand -alone; State of the art; Absorption; Carbon dioxide; Ethylene; Methane; Permeation; Petroleum refining; Purification; Refining; Thermoelectricity; Gas permeable membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958732903

Analyses show that drought events of varying severity are frequent in this region, although there is no specific pattern. There is a distinct need for an objective assessment of the impact of drought on strategic field crops, to solve the dilemma whether irrigation is required or not. For this reason, and based on available field data, the FAO AquaCrop water driven model was selected to simulate yield and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) for three major field crops (maize, sunflower, and sugar beet), under two scenarios: (1) natural water supply and adequate supply of nutrients, and (2) supplementary irrigation and adequate supply of nutrients. The experiments presented here were conducted between 2000 and 2007 in northern Serbia, where chernozem soil is prevalent. Data of 2003 cropping seasons were used for local calibration, whereas the remaining years for validation. Results were such that local calibration resulted in very minor changes of AquaCrop coefficients (e.g., maize basal crop coefficient, sunflower harvest index, etc.). Simulated maize yield levels exhibited the greatest departure from measured data under irrigation conditions (-3.6 and 3.3% during an extremely dry and an extremely wet year, respectively). Simulated sunflower yield levels varied by less than 10% in 8 out of 10 comparisons. The most extreme variation was noted during the extremely wet year. The difference between simulated and measured values in the case of sugar beet was from -10.2 to 12.2%. Large differences were noted only in two or three cases, under extreme climatic conditions. Statistical indicators - root mean square error (RMSE) and index of agreement (d) - for all three crops suggested that the model can be used to highly reliably assess yield and IWUE. This conclusion was derived based on low values of RMSE and high values of d (in the case of maize and sugar beet 0.999 for both yield and IWUE, and in the case of sunflower 0.999 for yield and 0.884 for IWUE). It is noteworthy that under wet conditions, the model suggested that sunflower and sugar beet do not require irrigation, as confirmed by experimental research. These data are significant because they show that the AquaCrop model can be used in impartial decision-making and in the selection of crops to be given irrigation priority in areas where water resources are limited. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","AquaCrop; Maize; Model; Simulations; Sugar beet; Sunflower","AquaCrop; Climatic conditions; Crop coefficient; Cropping seasons; Experimental research; Field crops; Field data; Harvest index; Index of agreements; Irrigation water use efficiency; Maize; Maize yield; Measured data; Natural waters; Objective assessment; Rainfed; Remaining years; Root mean square errors; Simulations; Statistical indicators; Sunflower; Wet conditions; Calibration; Computer simulation; Crops; Decision making; Drought; Irrigation; Nutrients; Rating; Soils; Sugar beets; Water resources; Water supply; Sugars; assessment method; calibration; climate conditions; data set; decision making; drought; error analysis; experimental study; growing season; herb; irrigation; maize; numerical model; rainfed agriculture; sugar beet; water use efficiency; Serbia; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Helianthus; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960564648

Nitrogen (N) fertilizers as well as soil moisture regime affect the activity of these organisms, but the mechanisms involved are not well understood to date. In particular, virtually nothing is known about the spatial distribution of soil methanotrophs within soil structure and how this regulates CH4 fluxes at the ecosystem scale. We studied the spatial distribution of CH4 assimilation and its response to a factorial drought × N fertilizer treatment in a 3-year experiment replicated in two grasslands differing in management intensity. Intact soil cores were labelled with 14CH4 and methanotrophic activity mapped at a resolution of ∼100μm using an autoradiographic technique. Under drought, the main zone of CH4 assimilation shifted down the soil profile. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and cattle urine reduced CH4 assimilation in the top soil, but only when applied under drought, presumably because NH4+ from fertilizers was not removed by plant uptake and nitrification under these conditions. Ecosystem-level CH4 fluxes measured in the field did show no or only very small inhibitory effects, suggesting that deeper soil layers fully compensated for the reduction in top soil CH4 assimilation. Our results indicate that the ecosystem-level CH4 sink cannot be inferred from measurements of soil samples that do not reflect the spatial organization of soils (e.g. stratification of organisms, processes, and mechanisms). The autoradiographic technique we have developed is suited to study methanotrophic activity in a relevant spatial context and does not rely on the genetic identity of the soil bacterial communities involved, thus ideally complementing DNA-based approaches. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","14C labelling; Atmospheric methane; Carbon isotopes; Climate change; Grazing effects; Scaling; Soil aggregate structure; Soil micro-organisms","bacterium; carbon isotope; climate change; drought; fertilization (reproduction); nitrification; nitrogen; soil aggregate; soil microorganism; soil structure; spatial distribution; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960022881

The authors compare and contrast design elements of three specific offset projects: afforestation/reforestation, manure management, and landfill gas capture. The technical review for each offset project is concluded with a look at the potential applicability for that project in Florida in the context of the protocols evaluated. Design/methodology/approach – Offset projects that may be employed in Florida are first broken up into comparable design elements specific to the selected offset project type. Focusing on the design elements, a discussion of the similarities and differences among the protocols for each offset project is presented. Each section begins with general findings then moves on to assessments of the detailed design elements. Finally, the project's general applicability to Florida is considered, highlighting specific strengths of particular protocols from the analysis of the design elements. Findings – Protocols tend to vary from highly specific requirements to a more general set of recommendations. Interestingly, no one program's set of protocols is the most opportunistic for Florida, but rather various protocols may have distinctive strengths depending on the project type. Originality/value – Many comparative studies of offset protocols evaluate protocols in the context of program-level policies. This study uniquely values the technical details in the protocols and does not consider policy or program-level issues. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Air pollution; Global warming; Protocols; United States of America","afforestation; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; environmental protection; global warming; greenhouse gas; landfill; manure; pollution policy; reforestation; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864546105

During this time, a diverse international network of professionals focused on the advancement of CCS technology has emerged. Within this international CCS community, a shared perception of the value of advancing CCS technology is generally assumed, and this community has been influential in lobbying for increased support for the development of CCS in many countries and at the international level. The phenomenon of an apparently shared perspective within a specific community relates to Haas' (1992a) description of the evolution of an epistemic community, or a knowledge-based network of recognized experts who ""not only hold in common a set of principled and causal beliefs but also have shared notions of validity and a shared policy enterprise"" Understanding the extent to which a given community can be characterized as an epistemic community can provide insights about the effectiveness of its policy intervention, its association with the broader public, and the success of communicating the messages that it wants to convey. The goal of this research is to begin to explore the nature of the CCS community; to provide a preliminary characterization of the community, and to consider whether and in what ways the community might be considered to be an epistemic community or a compilation of multiple different epistemic communities. This characterization suggests that although the CCS community may be influencing decision-makers and successfully garnering political support for advancing CCS technology, a potential disconnect with the concerns of a broader public is deserving of more attention and social science research. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS); Climate mitigation; Climate policy; Epistemic communities; Public perception; Risk perceptions","advanced technology; carbon sequestration; climate change; decision making; environmental policy; risk perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956268958

In the deserts of southern California, nitrogen additions have increased invasive annual plant abundance. Similar findings from other ecosystems have led to a general acceptance that invasive plants, especially annual grasses, are nitrophilous. Consequently, reductions of soil nitrogen via carbon amendments have been conducted by many researchers in a variety of ecosystems in order to disproportionately lower invasive species abundance, but with mixed success. Recent studies suggest that resource-use traits may predict the efficacy of such resource manipulations; however, this theory remains largely untested. We report findings from a carbon amendment experiment that utilized two levels of sucrose additions that were aimed at achieving soil carbon to nitrogen ratios of 50:1 and 100:1 in labile sources. Carbon amendments were applied once each year, for three years, corresponding with the first large precipitation event of each wet season. Plant functional traits measured on the three invasive and 11 native herbaceous species that were most common at the study site showed that exotic and native species did not differ in traits associated with nitrogen use. In fact, plant abundance measures such as density, cover, and biomass showed that carbon amendments were capable of decreasing both native and invasive species. We found that early-germinating species were the most impacted by decreased soil nitrogen resulting from amendments. Because invasive annuals typically germinate earlier and exhibit a rapid phenology compared to most natives, these species are expected to be more competitive than native annuals yet more susceptible to early-season carbon amendments. However, desert annual communities can exhibit high interannual variability in species composition and abundance. Therefore, the relative abundance of native and invasive species at the time of application is critical to the success of carbon amendments at our study site. For land management purposes, carbon amendments remain relatively impractical and may only be useful at small scales or in conjunction with other invasive species removal techniques. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bromus madritensis; California (USA); Competition; Erodium cicutarium; Functional traits; Invasive plants; Mojave desert; Nitrophilous; Phenology; Postfire; Restoration; Schismus barbatus","carbon; nitrogen; abundance; annual variation; carbon; community composition; competition (ecology); desert; experimental study; germination; grass; habitat restoration; herb; invasive species; land management; limiting factor; native species; nitrogen; nutrient availability; phenology; precipitation intensity; resource use; restoration ecology; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; article; chemistry; introduced species; metabolism; plant; plant leaf; season; soil; time; Carbon; Introduced Species; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Plants; Seasons; Soil; Time Factors; California; Mojave Desert; United States; Bromus madritensis; Erodium cicutarium; Poaceae; Schismus barbatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958861346

The extension of data series shows clearly that the changes in terrestrial temperatures are related to sources different from solar activity after ~1985. Based on analyses of data series for the years 1850-1985 it is demonstrated that, apart from an interval of positive deviation followed by a similar negative excursion in Earth's temperatures between ~1923 and 1965, there is a strong correlation between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures delayed by 3 years, which complies with basic causality principles. A regression analysis between solar activity represented by the cycle-average sunspot number, SSNA, and global temperature anomalies, ΔTA, averaged over the same interval lengths, but delayed by 3 years, provides the relation ΔTA~0.009 (±0.002) SSNA. Since the largest ever observed SSNA is ~90 (in 1954-1965), the solar activity-related changes in global temperatures could amount to no more than ±0.4°C over the past ~400 years where the sunspots have been recorded. It is demonstrated that the small amplitudes of cyclic variations in the average global temperatures over the ~11 year solar cycle excludes many of the various driver processes suggested in published and frequently quoted solar activity-climate relations. It is suggested that the in-cycle variations and also the longer term variations in global temperatures over the examined 135 years are mainly caused by corresponding changes in the total solar irradiance level representing the energy output from the core, but further modulated by varying energy transmission properties in the active outer regions of the Sun. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate; Global temperatures; Solar cycle length; Solar variability; Sunspots","Climate; Global temperatures; Solar cycle length; Solar variability; Sunspots; Regression analysis; Solar radiation; Solar energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961028122

The objective of this paper is to propose a method for assessing their impact on the mitigation of landfill greenhouse gas emissions using a new dedicated model (IMAGE-Landfill) that takes into account the different steps of landfill management history as well as the incremental methane production from the different cells. In particular, different collection and oxidation efficiencies are considered depending on the landfill operation, on its life step and on the chosen cap cover system. Two different theoretical single cell case studies and one real-scale landfill were used to calibrate the IMAGE-Landfill model. The results highlight that, depending on the selected cap cover lining system, the potential greenhouse gas emissions may be divided by a factor 2.5-7, even if no energy is recovered from the collected methane. This model is a useful tool for landfill operators to model methane production, but also to select the most appropriate cover type for each step of the landfill lifetime.

Negishi weighting is a key ethical assumption in climate-economics models, but it is virtually unknown to most model users. Negishi weights freeze the current distribution of income between world regions; without this constraint, IAMs that maximize global welfare would recommend an equalization of income across regions as part of their policy advice. With Negishi weights in place, these models instead recommend a course of action that would be optimal only in a world in which global income redistribution cannot and will not take place. This article describes the Negishi procedure and its origin in theoretical and applied welfare economics, and discusses the policy implications of the presentation and use of Negishi-weighted model results, as well as some alternatives to Negishi weighting in climate-economics models. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Course of action; Current distribution; Global climates; Global welfare; Integrated assessment models; Model results; Policy implications; Welfare economics; Economics; Philosophical aspects; Public policy; Climate models; decision making; environmental policy; global climate; global economy; income distribution; integrated approach; numerical model; policy implementation; theoretical study; welfare economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960965848

LID strategies can restore ecosystem functions and reduce runoff loadings to municipal water pollution control facilities (WPCF). This research examines the avoided energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of select LID strategies using life cycle assessment (LCA) and a stochastic urban watershed model. We estimate annual energy savings and avoided GHG emissions of 7.3 GJ and 0.4 metric tons, respectively, for a LID strategy implemented in a neighborhood in New York City. Annual savings are small compared to the energy and GHG intensity of the LID materials, resulting in slow environmental payback times. This preliminary analysis suggests that if implemented throughout an urban watershed, LID strategies may have important energy cost savings to WPCF, and can make progress towards reducing their carbon footprint. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To do so, the WRF-ARW/HERMES/CMAQ modelling system is applied at very high resolution (1 km x 1 km and 1 hour). The analysis is done by projecting the emissions of a base-case scenario defined for 2004 to three different future scenarios for 2015, each one representing a different set of traffic mobility management measures. Such measures integrate re-distribution of the current urban road network into ""super- square blocks"" as well as redirecting the traffic. The study is made more consistent by considering specific projections per sector of emission, mainly focusing on the vehicular fleet (introduction of technological improvements and the use of alternative fuels). The results of comparing the base-case versus the future scenarios indicate that the mobility management measures, technological improvements, use of alternative fuels and projection of emissions from different sectors will help to reduce the mean concentrations of atmospheric pollutants in downtown Barcelona, and also in the outskirts and in the metropolitan area. © Author(s) 2011.","Air quality management; Air quality modelling; Emission scenarios; Technological improvements; Urban air quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857769828

The trials were located on Dark Gray Luvisols (Typic Cryoboralf) near Beaverlodge, Alberta (2004-2007) and Star City, Saskatchewan (2004-2006), in the north western Canadian Prairies. The treatments comprised of combinations of two tillage systems (conventional and no tillage), the two forms of urea (applied at commercial rates, 50-60 kg N ha-1), and time of application (side-banded in spring or fall). Tillage had little effect on the measured soil variables. Available N at the anthesis growth stage was higher with spring- than fall-banded N in three of four site-years, and with PCU than urea in two site-years. At seeding, nitrate in the soil layers to 60-cm depth, especially the top 15 cm, was mostly higher for fall- than spring-banded treatments but differed less between the forms of urea. Fall application, therefore, has greater potential for gaseous N and leaching losses early in the growing season when crops have low N requirements, and hence is not advisable. Nitrous oxide emission from spring to fall was higher with the fertilized treatments in three of five site-years and not different between fertilized and unfertilized treatments in the other site-years. At Beaverlodge, N2O loss was low in 2 years and showed few significant treatment effects. At Star City, N2O loss was 1.5- to 1.7-fold higher from urea than PCU treatments, and up to 1.5-fold lower from spring than fall application. It is concluded that although PCU can increase available N during the growth period and reduce N2O loss in some years compared with urea, the time of N application had a consistently greater effect than the type of urea in enhancing crop N recovery and reducing N loss to the environment. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Available N; Gray Luvisols; Nitrate accumulation; Nitrous oxide emission; Polymer-coated urea; Tillage system","assessment method; bioaccumulation; fertilizer application; field method; growing season; leaching; Luvisol; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient loss; optimization; polymer; prairie; soil depth; soil emission; tillage; urea; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956344717

In particular, surface floating cyanobacteria, which are expected to be favored from future environmental conditions and can form large surface mats, can increase light absorption and the surface albedo and decrease momentum input from the atmosphere by wind. In this work we study the effect of a changing phytoplankton community composition to one dominated by buoyant cyanobacteria on the physical oceanic properties. We use the water column model General Ocean Turbulence Model and set up an idealized biological model taking into account the phytoplankton species' characteristics as well as the effects of biology on physics. The model results show that an increase of buoyant cyanobacteria leads to substantial changes in the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer. The results furthermore indicate that the effects due to altered absorption and biologically induced reduction of the wind drag are larger than contrary effects due to changes in the surface albedo. Overall, our model results suggest that the development of cyanobacterial surface blooms and their feedbacks on light absorption and wind drag need to be taken into account in ocean models used for climate scenarios in order to capture changes in the dynamics of the upper ocean.

The paper focuses on three sites of overlap that include: (1) event likelihood: hazards, risks and uncertainty; (2) impact parameters: exposure, vulnerability, and equity; and (3) societal responses: adaptive capacity and resilience. Focusing on cities in both developing and developed countries, the authors assert that that the convergence and interplay between the two fields has already had impacts on both areas of study.

We investigated to what degree the organic carbon (OC) being deposited onto the bottom of Lake Kinneret (Israel) is buried in the sediment at four different sites with varying degrees of oxygenation and varying supply of allochthonous particles from the River Jordan. For estimation of the OC burial efficiency (OC BE), i. e., the ratio between buried and deposited OC, we calculated OC burial from dated sediment cores, and calculated OC deposition using three different approaches. Calculation of OC deposition from sediment trap-derived mass deposition rates multiplied with the OC content of surface sediment yielded OC BE values that were at odds with published values for sediments dominated by autochthonous OC sources. Calculation via sediment trap data on organic matter flux collected within the Lake Kinneret monitoring program, as well as calculation of OC deposition as the sum of OC burial plus OC mineralization, returned fairly congruent estimates of OC BE (range 10-41%), but only if the sediment trap data were corrected for the proportion of resuspended particles in the traps. Differences in OC BE between sites were small, indicating that OC source (common to all sites) was a more important regulator of OC BE in Lake Kinneret than oxygen exposure or mineral particles characteristics. © 2011 Springer Basel AG.","Carbon sequestration; Lake sediment; Mineral particle characteristics; Organic matter mineralization; Oxygen exposure; Sediment resuspension","autochthon; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; deposition; lacustrine deposit; mineralization; organic carbon; organic matter; oxygenation; resuspension; sediment core; sediment trap; surficial sediment; Israel; Northern District; Sea of Galilee",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960598610

Biofuel and energy crop solutions are country-specific and grass biomethane has strong potential in countries with temperate climates and a high proportion of grassland, such as Ireland. For a grass biomethane industry to develop in a country, suitable regions (i.e. those with the highest potential) must be identified. In this paper, factors specifically related to the assessment of the potential of a grass biogas/biomethane industry are identified and analysed. The potential for grass biogas and grass biomethane is determined on a county-by-county basis using multi-criteria decision analysis. Values are assigned to each county and ratings and weightings applied to determine the overall county potential. The potential for grass biomethane with co-digestion of slaughter waste (belly grass) is also determined. The county with the highest potential (Limerick) is analysed in detail and is shown to have ready potential for production of gaseous biofuel to meet either 50% of the vehicle fleet or 130% of the domestic natural gas demand, through 25 facilities at a scale of ca. 30ktyr-1 of feedstock.

Global climate change is expected to increase both the frequency and the intensity of climate extremes and there is an urgent need to understand their ecological consequences. Major challenges for advancing our understanding of the ecological consequences of climate extremes include setting a climatic baseline to facilitate the statistical determination of when climate conditions are extreme, having sufficient knowledge of ecological systems so that extreme ecological responses can be identified, and finally, being able to attribute a climate extreme as the driver of an extreme ecological response, defined as an extreme climatic event (ECE). The papers in this issue represent a cross-section of the emerging field of climate extremes research, including an examination of the palaeo-ecological record to assess patterns and drivers of extreme ecological responses in the late Quaternary, experiments in grasslands assessing a range of ecological responses and the role of ecotypic variation in determining responses to climate extremes, and the quantification of the ecological consequences of a recent ECE in the desert Southwest of the USA. Synthesis. The papers in this Special Feature suggest that although the occurrence of ECEs may be common in palaeo-ecological and observational studies, studies in which climate extremes have been experimentally imposed often do not result in ecological responses outside the bounds of normal variability of a system. Thus, ECEs occur much less frequently than their potential drivers and even less frequently than observational studies suggest. Future research is needed to identify the types and time-scales of climate extremes that result in ECEs, the potential for interactions among different types of climate changes and extremes, and the role of genetic, species and trait diversity in determining ecological responses and their evolutionary consequences. These research priorities require the development of alternative research approaches to impose realistic climate extremes on a broad range of organisms and ecosystems. © 2011 The Author.

Many ecological studies examining the impacts of what are deemed climate extremes, such as heat waves and severe drought, do not provide a definition of extremity, either from a statistical context based on the long-term climatic record or from the perspective of the response of the system - are the effects extreme (unusual or profound) in comparison to normal variability? A synthetic definition of an extreme climatic event (ECE) is proposed that includes 'extremeness' in both the driver and the response: an ECE is as an episode or occurrence in which a statistically rare or unusual climatic period alters ecosystem structure and/or function well outside the bounds of what is considered typical or normal variability. This definition is accompanied by a mechanistic framework based on the concept that extreme response thresholds associated with significant community change and altered ecosystem function must be crossed in order for an ECE to occur. Synthesis. A definition and mechanistic framework for ECEs is used to identify priorities for future research that will enable ecologists to more fully assess the ecological consequences of climate extremes for ecosystem structure and function today and in a future world where their frequency and intensity are expected to increase. © 2011 The Author.

This paper considers the current feasibility of using an ecosystem services approach to appraise the benefits of alternative scenarios for controlling agricultural ammonia emissions in the UK. The effect of ammonia emission reductions on ecosystem service delivery was assessed using an impact pathway approach. A 'weakest link' analysis identified that economic valuation of impacts on many key ecosystem services was constrained by inadequate dose-response relationships to predict physical changes in service flows and/or by an inability to produce economic valuations of the predicted physical changes. For effects on biodiversity, both the timescale of response and poorly defined relationships between changes in species composition and ecosystem service delivery are significant barriers. However, it was possible to produce indicative values for the marginal impact of ammonia abatement measures on climate regulation; the values obtained were comparable in magnitude to those for human health impacts. The ecosystem service approach thus offers the potential to provide a holistic appraisal of the effects of emission reductions, and could therefore make a valuable contribution to future air quality management. However, improvements in data collection and quantification methods are needed before a full ecosystem services-based evaluation of costs and benefits becomes possible for ammonia and for other major air pollutants.

This paper presents the development and validation of an ANN model of a CO2 capture plant. An evaluation of the concept is made of the usefulness of the ANN model as well as a discussion of its feasibility for further integration into a conventional heat and mass balance programme. It is shown that the trained ANN model can reproduce the results of a rigorous process simulator in fraction of the simulation time. A multilayer feed-forward form of Artificial Neural Network was used to capture and model the non-linear relationship between inputs and outputs of the CO2 capture process. The data used for training and validation of the ANN were obtained using the process simulator CO2SIM. The ANN model was trained by performing fully automatic batch simulations using CO2SIM over the entire range of actual operation for an amine based absorption plant. The trained model was then used for finding the optimum operation for the example plant with respect to lowest possible specific steam duty and maximum CO2 capture rate. Two different algorithms have been used and compared for the training of the ANN and a sensitivity analysis was carried out to find the minimum number of input parameters needed while maintaining sufficient accuracy of the model.

These volatile cues can attract the natural enemies of the attacking herbivores and protect the plant from further damage. Synthetic HIPV application to various crops has also been shown to attract natural enemies. In the present study, nectar plant rewards were combined with HIPVs in an 'attract and reward' approach. This combination might attract natural enemies into treated crops and provide them with food and shelter to maximise their survival and residency leading to increased parasitism and lower pest abundance. Trap catches of predators and scelionid parasitoids in treated grapevines were increased by methyl salicylate (MeSA) and methyl anthranilate (MeA) for 1 day and up to 5 days, respectively. The number of herbivorous thrips was also increased for up to 3 days post-treatment. Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) reward increased catches of eulophid parasitoids and thrips over the 28-day experiment. These results suggest that 'attract' and 'reward' can separately enhance local abundance of natural enemies but further work is required to fully realise the potential for synergistic effects. © 2011 The Authors.

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by some species are ozone precursors. Modifying future tree planting to favor lower-emitting species can reduce these emissions and aid air management districts in meeting federally mandated emissions reductions for these compounds. Changes in BVOC emissions are calculated as the result of transitioning to a lower-emitting species mix in future planting. A simplified method for calculating the emissions reduction and a Tree BVOC index based on the calculated reduction is described. An example illustrates the use of the index as a tool for implementation and monitoring of a tree program designed to reduce BVOC emissions as a control measure being developed as part of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Sacramento Federal Nonattainment Area.","Air pollution; Biogenic carbon compounds; Urban trees","Air management; Biogenic carbon compounds; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Control measures; Emissions reduction; Non-attainment; Ozone precursors; Simplified method; State Implementation Plans; Tree plantings; Urban trees; Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Emission control; Ozone; Reforestation; Volatile organic compounds; Plant extracts; biogenic volatile organic compound; ozone; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental planning; implementation process; ozone; pollution monitoring; tree planting; urban planning; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; air quality; article; environmental monitoring; mathematical analysis; planting density; tree; United States; urban area; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biological Products; Cities; Forestry; Government Programs; Trees; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958793920

While the use of a number of native turfgrass species as alternatives to non-natives has been previously examined, only a few are presently commercially available, and many species have been perceived as failing to perform to the level required by industry and consumers. Furthermore, the use of polycultures of native turfgrasses has not been extensively investigated, but could offer an alternative to the conventional lawn. We hypothesize that because native short grass species would be expected to be well-adapted to climate and soil conditions in areas with infrequent and erratic rainfall, their performance in terms of drought resistance, resilience to disturbance, and efficient resource use, will exceed that of a non-native species. Moreover, ecological theory predicts that a polyculture of coexisting native species may exhibit additional performance benefits. One native (Bouteloua dactyloides) and one commonly-used, non-native monoculture (Cynodon dactylon) and two native polyculture assemblages (two and seven species including B. dactyloides, Bouteloua gracilis, Bouteloua rigidiseta, Hilaria belangeri, Erioneuron pilosum, Bouteloua hirsuta, Sporobolus vaginiflorus) were compared for leaf density and weed resistance under two irrigation regimens, traffic regimes and mowing intensities. The native turfgrass and turfgrass assemblages generally had 30% higher leaf densities in the early growing season, and up to 50% lower weed density than the non-native monoculture. There was no difference among species tested in response to traffic or irrigation regimens, suggesting that all assemblages could be subjected to both higher traffic frequencies and reduced water inputs. Even though native species can have slower growth rates compared to the non-native species they maintained a higher or equivalent leaf density than the non-native turfgrass. This is a potentially important finding because of the large impact that mowing has on the total carbon footprint of turfgrass, and the corresponding reduction in that carbon footprint that could be realized through a reduced mowing frequency and corresponding reduction in life-cycle cost. This study suggests that regionally adapted native grass species are worth investigating as mono- and polycultures for performance advantages and lower resource inputs, and consequently may be suitable alternatives to conventional non-native turfgrasses in many applications. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological approach; Lawn; Polyculture; Sustainability; Turfgrass","Ecological approach; Lawn; Polyculture; Sustainability; Turfgrass; Environmental impact; Irrigation; Ocean structures; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Cost reduction; ecological approach; ecological footprint; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; environmental impact; grass; growing season; growth rate; habitat restoration; home garden; invasive species; landscape change; life cycle; monoculture; mowing; native species; sustainability; water use; Bouteloua; Bouteloua gracilis; Bouteloua hirsuta; Bouteloua rigidiseta; Cynodon dactylon; Erioneuron pilosum; Hilaria belangeri; Poaceae; Sporobolus vaginiflorus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957986311

All the three ""Es"" are pursued simultaneously with some slight differences in emphasizing the mutual importance of these, in particular the cost factors. The legislation of the EU (e. g., ETS-Emission Trading Scheme, directives) increasingly guides the member states' energy policies. However, energy policy directions are still made domestically, for example, on the support on renewable energy technologies. In this work, we look into distributed generation (DG), since it has been grown considerable in the past few years and can be used to partially fulfill renewable energy targets. The policy makers have to make decisions about regulation directives, more specifically they have to change the current regulation in order to incentive the increase in DG. However, these decisions have not only economic impacts but also technical impacts that must be accounted for. In this regard, a decision aid tool would help the policy makers in estimating producer economic impacts, as well as power network technical impacts, of various possible regulation directives. Here, we propose an interactive decision aid tool that models the aforementioned impacts and thus, can be used by policy makers to experiment with different regulation directives before deciding on the ones to set. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Decision support systems; Distributed generation; Power losses; Renewable energy; Simulation; Voltage profile",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953028067

The EU 2020 policy targets for renewable energy sources and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction are among the main drivers. The aim of this analysis is to map current European national wood pellet demand and supplies, to provide a comprehensive overview of major market types and prices, and to discuss the future outlook in light of raw material supply. Approximately 650 pellet plants produced more than 10 million tonnes of pellets in 2009 in Europe. Total European consumption was about 9.8 million tonnes, of which some 9.2 million tonnes is within the EU-27, representing a modest 0.2% of Gross Energy Consumption (75 EJ level in 2008). The prices of most pellet types are increasing. While most markets of non-industrial pellets are largely self-sufficient, industrial pellet markets depend on the import of wood pellets from outside the EU-27. Industrial pellet markets are relatively mature, compared to non-industrial ones, because of their advanced storage facilities and long-term price-setting. However, industrial pellet markets are unstable, depending mainly on the establishment or the abolishment of public support schemes. Following our scenarios, additional 2020 demand for woody biomass varies from 105 million tonnes, based on market forecasts for pellets in the energy sector and a reference growth of the forest sector, to 305 million tonnes, based on maximum demand in energy and transport sectors and a rapid growth of the forest sector. Additional supply of woody biomass may vary from 45 million tonnes from increased harvest levels to 400 million tonnes after the recovery of slash via altered forest management, the recovery of waste wood via recycling, and the establishment of woody energy plantations in the future. Any short-term shortages within the EU-27 may be bridged via imports from nearby regions such as north west Russia or overseas. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","EU-27; Forest sector; International trade; NREAP 2020; Renewable Energy Directive; Wood pellet","EU-27; Forest sectors; NREAP 2020; Renewable energies; Wood pellet; Ecology; Emission control; Energy conversion; Energy harvesting; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industry; International trade; Pelletizing; Waste management; Wood; Ore pellets; Ecology; Energy; Foreign Trade; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Harvesting; Pelleting; Pellets; Regulations; Renewable Resources; Waste Management; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955892782

With the country being a major recipient of official development assistance, Mozambique's development strongly depends on donor investments. Against this background, we aim to encourage the mainstreaming of climate adaptation into development assistance. An analysis of donor investments at a sub-national level showed that a significant proportion of development assistance was invested in climate-sensitive sectors in regions highly exposed to extreme weather conditions. Major damage caused by weather extremes motivates a stronger integration of climate policies into development assistance. Although Mozambique has a supportive legislative environment and climate awareness among donors was found to be high, the limited institutional capacity restricted mainstreaming initiatives. Given major barriers at the national level, bilateral and multilateral donors are able to play a key role in fostering mainstreaming in Mozambique. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Climate adaptation; Climate-sensitive investments; Mozambique; Official development assistance; Sub-national","adaptation; analysis; article; climate change; government regulation; human; law; Mozambique; policy; priority journal; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955744052

Our previous studies revealed that certain hydrocarbons (short-chain n-alkanes [C6-C10] and monoaromatics [toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene]) in residual naphtha entrained in the tailings are biodegraded to CH4 by a consortium of microorganisms. Here we show that higher molecular weight n-alkanes (C14, C16, and C18) are also degraded under methanogenic conditions in oil sands tailings, albeit after a lengthy lag (∼180 d) before the onset of methanogenesis. Gas chromatographic analyses showed that the longer-chain n-alkanes each added at ∼400 mg L-1 were completely degraded by the resident microorganisms within ∼440 d at ∼20 °C. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of clone libraries implied that the predominant pathway of longer-chain n-alkane metabolism in tailings is through syntrophic oxidation of n-alkanes coupled with CO2 reduction to CH4.

Here, we quantify climate based on the climate facets relevant to tourism (thermal, physical, aesthetical), and apply the results to the Climate-Tourism-Information-Scheme (CTIS). This paper presents bioclimatic and tourism climatological conditions in the Hunter Region-one of Australia's most popular tourist destinations. In the Hunter Region, generally, temperatures below 15°C occur from April through October, temperatures less than 25°C are expected throughout the whole year, while humidity sits around 50%. As expected, large differences between air temperature and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) were clearly identified. The widest differences were seen in summer time rather than in the winter period. In addition, cold stress was observed less than 10% of the time in winter while around 40-60% of heat stress was observed in summer time. This correlates with the highest numbers of international visitors, who usually seek a warmer weather, at the beginning of summer time (November and December) and also to the number of domestic visitors, who tend to seek cooler places for recreation and leisure, in late summer (January-March). It was concluded that thermal bioclimate assessment such as PET and CTIS can be applied in the Hunter region, and that local governments and the tourism industry should take an integrated approach to providing more relevant weather and climate information for both domestic and international tourists in the near future. © 2010 ISB.","Australia; Climate-Tourism-Information-Scheme; Physiologically equivalent temperature; Thermal comfort; Tourism climatology","article; Australia; climate; history; human; season; temperature; travel; Climate; History, 21st Century; Humans; New South Wales; Seasons; Temperature; Travel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960103696

Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that in bare IBr- prompt dissociation forms exclusively I∗ + Br-. Compared to earlier dissociation studies of IBr- excited to the A′ (2Π1/2) state, the signal rise is delayed by 200 ± 20 fs. In the case of IBr-(CO2), the product distribution shows the existence of a second major (∼40%) dissociation pathway, Br∗ + I-. In contrast to the primary product channel, the signal rise associated with this pathway shows only a 50 ± 20 fs delay. The altered product branching ratio indicates that the presence of one solvent-like CO2 molecule dramatically affects the electronic structure of the dissociating IBr-. We explore the origins of this phenomenon with classical trajectories, quantum wave packet studies, and MR-SO-CISD calculations of the six lowest-energy electronic states of IBr- and 36 lowest-energy states of IBr. We find that the CO2 molecule provides sufficient solvation energy to bring the initially excited state close in energy to a lower-lying state.

Atmospheric methane is increasing, can linger in the atmosphere for ~9 to 15 years, and is more than 20 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. • Carbon losses associated with grazing systems could be reduced through proactive management to conserve vegetation cover/soil carbon storage and integration of climate fluctuations in livestock production systems. • Human-related activities are a clear contributor to climate change, and changes are happening on time scales much shorter than natural climate changes. • Humans may not perceive that average temperatures are warmer in 2100, but they will notice when coastal cities are facing sea level rise, days exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit increase, food prices fluctuate because of changing crop yields or livestock productivity, or diseases appear in new latitudes because of a more favorable climate. • The apparent controversy over climate change is rooted in a campaign by special interests to create reasonable doubt (e.g., tobacco industry and smoking) or basic lack of understanding of simple climate, science, and statistical principles. • Climate change will also affect livestock production and practices. • Sustainable pathways exist to reduce atmospheric carbon loading. © 2011 Shepherd.","Carbon; Carbon cycle; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Methane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025137346

The LacI/GalR family regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) is a global regulator of the Group A Streptococcus (GAS) transcriptome and contributes to GAS virulence in diverse infection sites. Herein, we studied the role of the maltose repressor (MalR), another LacI/GalR family member, in GAS global gene expression and virulence. MalR inactivation reduced GAS colonization of the mouse oropharynx but did not detrimentally affect invasive infection. The MalR transcriptome was limited to only 25 genes, and a highly conserved MalR DNA-binding sequence was identified. Variation of the MalR binding sequence significantly reduced MalR binding in vitro. In contrast, CcpA bound to the same DNA sequences as MalR but tolerated variation in the promoter sequences with minimal change in binding affinity. Inactivation of pulA, a MalR regulated gene which encodes a cell surface carbohydrate binding protein, significantly reduced GAS human epithelial cell adhesion and mouse oropharyngeal colonization but did not affect GAS invasive disease.

Using a decomposition analysis, results indicate that even though significant reductions in energy intensity have been achieved in Colombia, Mexico and in a lesser extent in Brazil and Argentina, the reduction of CO2 emissions in these countries has not been significant due to an increased dependence on fossil fuels in their energy mix. Although the Latin American region has an important experience in the promotion of EE programs and renewable sources, the energy agenda of the examined countries focused mostly on the energy reforms during the analyzed period.

This paper builds on previous data center energy modeling efforts by characterizing local climate and mechanical equipment differences among data centers and then evaluating their consequences for building energy use. Cities in the United States with significant data center activity are identified. Representative climate conditions for these cities are applied to data center energy models for several different prototypical space types. Results indicate that widespread, effective economizer use in data centers could reduce energy demand for data centers by about 20-25%, equivalent to an energy efficiency resource in the US of ~13-17 billion kWh per year. Almost half of the potential savings would result from better airflow management and proper control sequences. The total energy savings potential of economizers, although substantial, is constrained by their limited potential for use in server closets and server rooms, which together are estimated to account for about 30% of all data center energy demand. Incorporating economizer use into the mechanical systems of larger data centers would increase the variation in energy efficiency among geographic regions, indicating that as data center buildings become more energy efficient, their locations will have an increasing effect on overall energy demand. Differences among regions become even more important when accounting for greenhouse-gas emissions. Future data center development could consider site location, along with efficiency measures, to limit the environmental impact attributable to this increasingly prominent economic sector. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate-change mitigation; Economizers; Energy efficiency; HVAC design; Indoor environmental quality; IT","Air flow management; Building energy; Climate condition; Control sequences; Current data; Data center operations; Data centers; Economic sectors; Efficiency measure; Electricity demands; Electricity use; Energy demands; Energy efficient; Energy model; Energy modeling; Energy use; Geographic regions; Greenhouse-gas emissions; HVAC designs; Increasing effect; Indoor environmental quality; IT; Local climate; Mechanical equipment; Mechanical systems; Site location; Total energy; Climate change; Climate models; Economizers; Energy management; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouses; Satellite communication systems; Structural design; Energy efficiency; building; climate conditions; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; strategic approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651415889

We found that as the average exposure to fine particulate matter over the lifetime of an infant increased, so did costs for the child's health care. If the United States were to reduce levels of fine particulate matter to 7 percent below the current annual standard, the nation could save $15 million annually in reduced health care costs from hospitalizations of children with bronchiolitis living in urban areas.

The carbon sequestration enhancement options in the model include sustainable forest harvesting, biomass co-firing during power generation, extending life of wood products and integrating biomass energy in carbon capture and storage. A case study carried out using this model in West Virginia indicated that there is potential to increase carbon sequestration by up to 4% when stated management options are implemented.

DESIGN/SETTING: A prospective cohort collaborative study to improve quality of care and safety culture by implementing and evaluating patient safety interventions in intensive care units predominantly in the state of Michigan. INTERVENTIONS: The comprehensive unit-based safety program was the first intervention implemented by every intensive care unit participating in the collaborative. It is specifically designed to improve the various elements of a unit's safety culture, such as teamwork and safety climate. We administered the validated Safety Attitudes Questionnaire at baseline (2004) and after 2 yrs of exposure to the safety program (2006) to assess improvement. The safety climate domain on the survey includes seven items. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Post-safety climate scores for intensive care units. To interpret results, a score of <60% was in the ""needs improvement"" zone and a ≥10-point discrepancy in pre-post scores was needed to describe a difference. Hospital bed size, teaching status, and faith-based status were included in our analyses. Seventy-one intensive care units returned surveys in 2004 and 2006 with 71% and 73% response rates, respectively. Overall mean safety climate scores significantly improved from 42.5% (2004) to 52.2% (2006), t =-6.21, p <.001, with scores higher in faith-based intensive care units and smaller-bed-size hospitals. In 2004, 87% of intensive care units were in the ""needs improvement"" range and in 2006, 47% were in this range or did not score ≥10 points or higher. Five of seven safety climate items significantly improved from 2004 to 2006. CONCLUSIONS: A patient safety program designed to improve teamwork and culture was associated with significant improvements in overall mean safety climate scores in a large cohort of 71 intensive care units. Research linking improved climate scores and clinical outcomes is a critical next step.

LW was regularly distributed across the study reach an average 70 LW pieces km-1. Some LW clustering was evident at islands and meander bends. Spawners built 85% of redds within one average channel width (31m) of LW. Spawners utilized LW within a 10m radius 36% of the time in the upper 3km rehabilitated reach, and 44% of the time in the lower 4.7km marginal habitat reach.

We link economic, geographical and environmental models by using spatially explicit common units of analysis and use remote sensing crop cover maps and digitized soils data as inputs. Land use changes are predicted via economic analysis of crop rotation choice and tillage under alternative crop prices, and the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model is used to predict corresponding environmental impacts. The study focuses on Iowa, which is the leading biofuels hotspot in the U.S. due to intensive corn production and the high concentration of ethanol plants that comprise 28% of total U.S. production. We consider the impact of the biofuels industry both on current cropland and on land in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a land set-aside program. We find that substantial shifts in rotations favoring continuous corn rotations are likely if high corn prices are sustained. This is consistent with larger scale analyses which show a shift of the current soybean production out of the Corn Belt. We find that sediment losses increase substantially on the intensive margin, while nitrogen losses increase less. Returning CRP land into production has a vastly disproportionate environmental impact, as non-cropped land shows much higher negative marginal environmental effects when brought back to row crop production. This illustrates the importance of differentiating between the intensive and extensive margin when assessing the expansion of biofuel production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Corn-soybean rotation; Economic analysis; Energy crop production; Environmental Impact; Land set-aside; Land use change","Biofuel production; Conservation reserve program; Corn production; Corn-soybean rotations; Crop rotation; Energy crop production; Environmental consequences; Environmental effects; Environmental model; Environmental policy integrated climate models; Ethanol plants; High concentration; Hot spot; Land set-aside; Land use change; Land use impact; Nitrogen loss; On currents; Row crop; Scale analysis; Sediment loss; Soybean production; Spatially explicit; Anoxic sediments; Biofuels; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Economic analysis; Environmental protection; Ethanol; Forestry; Geologic models; Land use; Remote sensing; Rotation; Environmental impact; biofuel; cover crop; crop production; economic analysis; environmental effect; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; land use change; maize; remote sensing; Iowa; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956350212

In 2007/2008, Ku-ring-gai Council considered the various methods and selected two for review to inform Council's own adaptation plan. The models reviewed were the Australian Greenhouse Office model and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) model. These models were promoted as suitable for local government decision-making. The review found both models can identify key risks, and prioritise risks according to their magnitude. However, the capacity of these models to analyse effective and efficient adaptation appears limited, as they address only the first part of a very complex planning scenario. To plan effective risk-management options, a model needs to be able to evaluate the effect an option may have on reducing risk and highlight where an option may result in unintended consequences. In addition, the model must identify trade-offs or impacts, inform whether a response will increase resilience or reduce vulnerability across financial, social and environmental sectors, and satisfy due diligence in regard to the ecologically sustainable development principles. Both models have useful qualities and provide a basis on which to commence adaptation planning. However, the ICLEI model appears to be a superior guide to adaptation planning.

A carrot-and-stick approach was adopted for managing air quality in Christchurch, where strict intervention measures were introduced together with a residential heater replacement programme to encourage householders to change to cleaner forms of heating. A similar approach was only recently implemented for Timaru. This paper presents the results of a partial accountability analysis, where the impact of these measures on the target source, PM10 emissions, and PM10 concentrations are quantified. A statistical model was developed to estimate trends in the concentrations, which were tested for significance after accounting for meteorological effects, and to estimate the probability of meeting air quality targets. Results for Christchurch and Timaru are compared to illustrate the impacts of differing levels of intervention on air quality. In Christchurch, approximately 34,000 (76%) open fires and old solid fuel burners were replaced with cleaner heating technology from 2002 to 2009, and total open fires and solid fuel burner numbers decreased by 45%. Over the same time period, estimated PM10 emissions reduced by 71% and PM10 concentrations by 52% (maxima), 36% (winter mean), 26% (winter median) and 41% (meteorology-adjusted winter means). In Timaru, just 3000 (50%) open fires and old solid fuel burners were replaced from 2001 to 2008, with total open fire and solid fuel burner numbers reduced by 24%. PM10 emissions declined by 32%, with low reductions in the PM10 concentrations (maxima decreased by 7%, winter means by 11% and winter medians by 3%). These findings, supported by the results of the meteorology corrected trend analysis for Christchurch, strongly indicate that the combination of stringent intervention measures and financial incentives has led to substantial air quality improvements in the city. The lesser impact of more lenient rules and the late introduction of an incentives programme are obvious on air quality in Timaru. Trends established for the two cities were extrapolated under various scenarios to determine the likelihood of meeting air quality targets. In Christchurch the probability of compliance is low and is essentially impossible for Timaru if recent trends continue. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Change-out program; Incentives; Residential heating; Trend analysis","Accountability; Change-out program; Incentives; Residential heating; Trend analysis; Air cleaners; Air quality; Fires; Forestry; Fuel burners; Fuels; Meteorology; Probability; Heating; accountability; air quality; coal; compliance; concentration (composition); emission control; estimation method; heating; household energy; incentive; meteorology; numerical model; particulate matter; residential location; trend analysis; wood; air quality; air quality control; article; concentration (parameters); financial management; fire; heating; meteorology; New Zealand; priority journal; Air Quality; Burners; Coal; Forest Fires; Heating; Incentives; Meteorology; New Zealand; Probability; Wood; New Zealand; Daucus carota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955476449

As a consequence, the cement industry worldwide is facing growing challenges in conserving material and energy resources, as well as reducing its CO2 emissions. According to the International Energy Agency, the main levers for cement producers are the increase in energy efficiency and the use of alternative materials, be it as fuel or raw materials. Accordingly, the use of alternative fuels has already increased significantly in recent years, but potential for further increases still exists. In cement, the reduction of the clinker factor remains a key priority: tremendous progress has already been made. Nevertheless, appropriate materials are limited in their regional availability.

The amount of carbon (C) that is respired leaves the soil as CO2 (soil respiration) and causes one of the greatest fluxes in the global carbon cycle. How soil microbial communities will respond to global warming, however, is not well understood. To elucidate the effect of warming on the microbial community we analyzed soil from the soil warming experiment Achenkirch, Austria. Soil of a mature spruce forest was warmed by 4 °C during snow-free seasons since 2004. Repeated soil sampling from control and warmed plots took place from 2008 until 2010. We monitored microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N). Microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of ribosomal RNA genes. Microbial metabolic activity was estimated by soil respiration to biomass ratios and RNA to DNA ratios. Soil warming did not affect microbial biomass, nor did warming affect the abundances of most microbial groups. Warming significantly enhanced microbial metabolic activity in terms of soil respiration per amount of microbial biomass C. Microbial stress biomarkers were elevated in warmed plots. In summary, the 4 °C increase in soil temperature during the snow-free season had no influence on microbial community composition and biomass but strongly increased microbial metabolic activity and hence reduced carbon use efficiency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Microbial biomass; Microbial community structure; PLFA; RRNA genes; Soil warming","Microbial biomass; Microbial community structure; PLFA; RRna genes; Soil warming; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Fatty acids; Forestry; Genes; Global warming; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Phospholipids; Physiology; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Snow; Soils; biomarker; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; community structure; coniferous forest; decomposition; fatty acid; forest soil; global warming; microbial activity; microbial community; mountain region; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; phospholipid; polymerase chain reaction; real time; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; soil respiration; soil temperature; temperate environment; warming; Bacteria; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Enzymes; Experimentation; Fatty Acids; Forestry; Genes; Lipids; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Mountains; Nucleic Acids; Physiology; Snow; Soil; Austria; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955964088

Selected existing model approaches were modified to meet the specific conditions in Austria so as to ensure optimal model results. This substantially improved the model performance in terms of deviation between calculated and measured nitrogen and phosphorus loads in rivers. Using the modified approaches total nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to surface waters in Austria for the reference period 2001-2006 we calculated. Nitrogen and phosphorus loads were calculated with consideration of in-stream retention processes in water bodies. Extending the model approaches, the calculated loads were converted into 90% percentiles of the NO3-N and PO4-P concentrations and compared to type-specific reference conditions for the good ecological status as laid down in the Austrian Qualitätszielverordnung Ökologie Oberflächengewässer (Directive on Ecological Surface water Quality Objectives). Comparison with the results of the risk analyses of the Austrian Nationaler Gewässerbewirtschaftungsplan (National River Basin Management Plan), NGP 2009 (BMLFUW 2009a) showed a good agreement for those water bodies, which are at risk not to meet the good ecological status due to elevated nutrient loads. Scenario calculations have shown that the reduction of diffuse emissions from agricultural sector should be a prime target for seeking to protect local water bodies. Increased requirements for point sources might only improve the situation in individual cases, if at all. Nutrient transport to the seas can be reduced by further restrictions for emissions from point sources (besides taking measures in agricultural sector) by about 10% for nitrogen and by about 15% for phosphorus loads. The modeling of nutrient emissions and loads in Austria were also used by serving as a basis for calculating nutrient emissions, in-stream loads and concentrations in surface waters for the scenarios of the Gesunde Ernährung und Nachhaltigkeit - GERN (Healthy Nutrition and Sustainability) project. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"agricultural emission; emission inventory; empirical analysis; nitrogen; nutrient availability; phosphorus; point source; risk assessment; river pollution; stream; surface water; water quality; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960610179

(2011) report that average fine particulate light absorbing carbon (LAC) concentrations in California decreased by about 50% from 0.46 μg m-3 in 1989 to 0.24 μg m-3 in 2008. They attribute most of the LAC decline in California to reductions in the state's diesel emissions. These findings are encouraging, but in this comment we call attention to a significant methodological issue that can arise in any long-term trends analysis using IMPROVE data. In the Bahadur et al. analysis, LAC data from eighteen remote monitoring sites were aggregated with data from three urban sites that only operated for 1-8 years. The large absolute decrease of 0.22 μg m-3 they reported in the statewide California average was largely driven by one urban site, South Lake Tahoe (Tahoe), which was dropped from the network in mid-1997. LAC concentrations at Tahoe were an order of magnitude higher than those at nearby Bliss State Park indicative of large local source contributions. The exclusion of the three locally influenced urban sites substantially reduces the magnitude of the decreasing LAC trends shown in Bahadur et al., though this does not necessarily invalidate the paper's conclusion that LAC is broadly decreasing and diesel emission controls are likely to be responsible for part of this decrease. Control of emissions from wood-burning stoves may also have contributed to decreases in LAC and other particulate compounds; like diesel emission controls, this too is an important regulatory success. © 2011.","Light absorbing carbon; Long-term trends","black carbon; light absorbing carbon; unclassified drug; air pollution; air pollution control; exhaust gas; note; particulate matter; priority journal; United States; urban area",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959499732

To meet future targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, capture and storage of CO2 is required. Carbon capture and storage technologies that are currently the focus of research centres and industry include: pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture, and oxy-fuel combustion. This review deals with the oxy-fuel coal combustion process, primarily focusing on pulverised coal (PC) combustion, and its related research and development topics. In addition, research results related to oxy-fuel combustion in a circulating fluidised bed (CFB) will be briefly dealt with. During oxy-fuel combustion, a combination of oxygen, with a purity of more than 95vol.%, and recycled flue gas (RFG) referred to as oxidant is used for combusting the fuel producing a gas consisting of mainly CO2 and water vapour, which after purification and compression, is ready for storage. The high oxygen demand is supplied by a cryogenic air separation process, which is the only commercially available mature technology. The separation of oxygen from air as well as the purification and liquefaction of the CO2-enriched flue gas consumes significant auxiliary power. Therefore, the overall net efficiency is expected to be decreased by 8-12% points, corresponding to a 21-35% increase in fuel consumption. Alternatively, ion transport membranes (ITMs) are proposed for oxygen separation, which might be more energy efficient. However, since ITMs are far away from becoming a mature technology, it is widely expected that cryogenic air separation will be the selected technology in the near future. Oxygen combustion is associated with higher temperatures compared with conventional air combustion. Both fuel properties as well as limitations of steam and metal temperatures of the various heat exchanger sections of the boiler require a moderation of the temperatures in the combustion zone and in the heat-transfer sections. This moderation in temperature is accomplished by means of recycled flue gas. The interdependencies between the fuel properties, the amount and temperature of the recycled flue gas, and the resulting oxygen concentration in the combustion atmosphere are reviewed. The different gas atmosphere resulting from oxy-fuel combustion gives rise to various questions related to firing, in particular, with respect to the combustion mechanism, pollutant reduction, the risk of corrosion, and the properties of the fly ash or its resulting deposits. In this review, detailed nitrogen and sulphur chemistry was investigated in a laboratory-scale facility under oxy-fuel combustion conditions. Oxidant staging succeeded in reducing NO formation with effectiveness comparable to that typically observed in conventional air combustion. With regard to sulphur, a considerable increase in the SO2 concentration was measured, as expected. However, the H2S concentration in the combustion atmosphere in the near-flame zone increased as well. Further results were obtained in a pilot-scale test facility, whereby acid dew points were measured and deposition probes were exposed to the combustion environment. Slagging, fouling and corrosion issues have so far been addressed via short-term exposure and require further investigation. Modelling of PC combustion processes by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become state-of-the-art for conventional air combustion. Nevertheless, the application of these models for oxy-fuel combustion conditions needs adaptation since the combustion chemistry and radiative heat transfer is altered due to the different combustion gas atmosphere. CFB technology can be considered mature for conventional air combustion. In addition to its inherent advantages like good environmental performance and fuel flexibility, it offers the possibility of additional heat exchanger arrangements in the solid recirculation system, i.e. the ability to control combustion temperatures despite relatively low flue gas recycle ratios even when combusting in the presence of high oxygen concentrations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture; CO2; Combustion; Emissions; Oxy-fuel","Acid dew; Air combustion; Auxiliary power; Carbon capture; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide emissions; CFB technology; Circulating fluidised bed; Combustion chemistry; Combustion gas; Combustion mechanism; Combustion pro-cess; Combustion temperatures; Combustion zones; Cryogenic air separation; Energy efficient; Environmental concerns; Environmental performance; Fuel flexibility; Fuel properties; Gas atmosphere; Higher temperatures; Ion transport membranes; Laboratory scale; Metal temperature; NO formation; Oxy-fuels; Oxyfuel combustion; Oxygen combustion; Oxygen concentrations; Oxygen separation; Pilot scale test; Post-combustion; Pulverised coals; Radiative heat transfer; Recirculation systems; Recycle ratios; Research and development; Research centres; Research results; Short-term exposure; Sulphur chemistry; Water vapour; Air; Air cleaners; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric temperature; Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal research; Computational fluid dynamics; Corrosion; Cryogenics; Emission control; Energy resources; Environmental management; Flue gases; Flues; Fluidization; Fluidized beds; Fly ash; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel purification; Gas fuel storage; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat exchangers; Oxidants; Oxygen; Purification; Recycling; Reformulated gasoline; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Technology; Coal combustion; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coal; combustion; concentration (composition); corrosion; emission control; fouling; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; heat transfer; liquefaction; membrane; nitrogen; oxygen; sulfur; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961208515

The calculated C14 cluster decay half-life times are found to be in nice agreement with experimental data only for the case of higher-multipole deformations (β2-β4) and θc orientations of cold elongated configurations. In other words, compared to our earlier study of clusters heavier than C14, where the inclusion of β2 alone, with ""optimum"" orientations, was found to be enough to give the best comparison with data, here for C14 cluster decay the inclusion of higher-multipole deformations (up to hexadecapole), together with θc orientations, is found to be essential on the basis of the PCM.

From the viewpoint of the central infrastructure, the effluent threshold value of urban wastewater treatment plants could be lowered further by advanced use of denitrification and membrane filtration, and storm water overflows of wastewater and contaminated rainwater from sewers could be treated in retention soil filters. In addition, small-scale wastewater treatment plants, infiltration and reducing or unsealing impervious surfaces could be used as decentralized elements of wastewater or storm water treatment. It can be shown that if the most advanced measures were applied in all wastewater-relevant areas, up to 60% of the phosphorus and 37% of the nitrogen emissions could be avoided. Alongside central wastewater treatment plants, small-scale treatment plants prove to be the most effective and cost-efficient option.

Results of rainwater chemical composition were compared with those obtained at the same site between 1986 and 1989. In both collection periods rainwater was predominantly (≈ 80%) associated to oceanic air masses. The rainwater concentration of H+ was in the same range as twenty years ago. A clear decrease of non sea salt sulphate (NSS-SO42-) was observed in 2008-2009 relatively to 1986-1989, not only in samples with origin in central and northern Europe, but also in samples from Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean. This decrease indicates that SO2 emissions were reduced, which may be due to a lower content of sulphur in oil by-products. A decrease was also observed in NH4+ concentration in 2008-2009. On the contrary an increase of NO3- concentration was observed for samples of all origins in 2008-2009 relatively to 1986-1989, which was particularly high (more than 3 fold) for samples with origin in Atlantic Ocean, suggesting the incorporation of this ion by rainout at the sampling site. The contribution of local sources is indeed suggested by the moderate negative correlation of NH4+, NO3- and NSS-SO42- with rainwater volume. The high increase of NO3- concentration can be attributed to the increase of local vehicular and industrial emissions in the sampling area. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Acidity; Factor analysis; Ion composition; Rainwater; Seasonal variation; Trajectory analysis","Factor analysis; Ion composition; Rainwater; Seasonal variation; Trajectory analysis; Chlorine; Concentration (process); Industrial emissions; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Chemical analysis; ammonia; chlorine; nitrate; rain; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; acidity; air mass; chemical composition; industrial emission; rainwater; sea salt; air pollution; article; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); conductance; Europe; geographic distribution; pH; Portugal; priority journal; water analysis; water sampling; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Chlorides; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nitrates; Portugal; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Rain; Spain; Sulfates; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Atlantic Ocean; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959759370

In the past two decades, one of the most significant impediments to the implementation of comprehensive PHC has been neoliberal economic policies and their imposition globally. This article questions what will be required for PHC to flourish. PHC incorporates five key principles: equitable provision of services, comprehensive care, intersectoral action, community involvement and appropriate technology. This article considers intersectoral action and comprehensiveness and their potential to be implemented in the current global environment. It highlights the constraints to intersectoral action through a case study of nutrition in the context of globalisation of the food chain. It also explores the challenges to implementing a comprehensive approach to health that are posed by neoliberal health sector reforms and donor practices. The paper concludes that even well-designed health systems based on PHC have little influence over the broader economic forces that shape their operation and their ability to improve health. Reforming these economic forces will require greater regulation of the national and global economic environment to emphasise people's health rather than private profit, and action to address climate change. Revitalisation of PHC and progress towards health equity are unlikely without strong regulation of the market. The further development and strengthening of social movements for health will be key to successful advocacy action.",,"advocacy; climate change; economic policy; economic system; food chain; global economy; globalization; health care; hospital sector; implementation process; market system; nutrition; sustainability; welfare reform; article; economics; financial management; health; health care policy; human; international cooperation; primary health care; Financing, Government; Health Care Reform; Humans; Internationality; Primary Health Care; World Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960224672

The spatial complexities underlying our relationship to climate and the geographical disparities in human demographic change have, however, precluded the development of global indices of the predicted regional impacts of climate change on humans. Humans will be most negatively affected by climate change in regions where populations are strongly dependent on climate and favourable climatic conditions decline. Here we use the relationship between the distribution of human population density and climate as a basis to develop the first global index of predicted impacts of climate change on human populations. Location Global. Methods We use spatially explicit models of the present relationship between human population density and climate along with forecasted climate change to predict climate vulnerabilities over the coming decades. We then globally represent regional disparities in human population dynamics estimated with our ecological niche model and with a demographic forecast and contrast these disparities with CO2 emissions data to quantitatively evaluate the notion of moral hazard in climate change policies. Results Strongly negative impacts of climate change are predicted in Central America, central South America, the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and much of Africa. Importantly, the regions of greatest vulnerability are generally distant from the high-latitude regions where the magnitude of climate change will be greatest. Furthermore, populations contributing the most to greenhouse gas emissions on a per capita basis are unlikely to experience the worst impacts of climate change, satisfying the conditions for a moral hazard in climate change policies. Main conclusions Regionalized analysis of relationships between distribution of human population density and climate provides a novel framework for developing global indices of human vulnerability to climate change. The predicted consequences of climate change on human populations are correlated with the factors causing climate change at the regional level, providing quantitative support for many qualitative statements found in international climate change assessments. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Climate vulnerability; Demography; Ecological niche model; Geographically weighted regression; Human populations; Moral hazard","carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; correlation; demographic trend; global perspective; population density; population dynamics; prediction; qualitative analysis; spatial variation; temporal variation; vulnerability; Africa; Arabian Peninsula; Central America; South America; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958120414

One limitation of IT delivery is that drugs are rapidly lost from the middle ear by a number of processes, so that prolonged delivery of drug is technically difficult. In the present study, the delivery characteristics of a poloxamer hydrogel formulation containing dexamethasone (dex) were evaluated. The gel is liquid at room temperature, allowing IT injection, but transitions to a gel at body temperature, providing a prolonged residence time in the middle ear. A 50-μl volume of control or dex-containing gel (dex-gel) was injected through the tympanic membrane of guinea pigs. Cochlear function was assessed with cochlear action potential and acoustic emission thresholds measured immediately, 6 or 24 h after IT gel injection. After 6-or 24-hour treatment with dex-gel, perilymph drug gradients along the cochlea were assessed by taking samples sequentially from the apex, and endolymph was sampled from the basal turn. Control gel injections caused small changes in sound field calibrations and functional measures for low-frequency stimuli, consistent with an induced conductive loss. Within 24 h, responses returned to normal. Twenty-four hours after dex-gel injection, low-frequency changes remained as the dex-gel was retained better in the middle ear, but there was no indication of high-frequency loss. While perilymph sample data showed that dex gradients were substantially lower than after single injections of dex solution, quantitative analysis of this result suggests that some dex may have entered the perilymph through the thin bone in the apical region of the cochlea. Endolymph levels of dex remained lower than those in the perilymph. This study confirms that a poloxamer hydrogel-based dex formulation provides an effective method for a prolonged delivery, providing a more uniform distribution of drug in the inner ear.

This work reports the effects of CO2 capture from a combustion flue gas and its use in a newly-patented, two-phase anaerobic digestion (TPAD) process, to improve energy recovery and to reduce CO2 emissions. A TPAD process, fed with urban wastewater sludge, was successfully established and maintained for several months at pilot scale. The TPAD process with injection of CO2 exhibits efficient biomass degradation (58% VSS reduction), increased VFA production during the acidogenic phase (leading to VFA concentration of 8.4g/L) and high biomethane production (0.350Sm3/kgSSV; 0.363Sm3/m3react·d). Moreover, CO2 intake in the acid phase has a positive impact on the overall GHG balance associated to biomethane production, and suggests an improved solution for both emission reduction and biomass conversion into biomethane. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogas; Biomethanation; Biomethane production; CO2 capture; Two-phase anaerobic digestion","Acidogenic; Bio-methanation; Biomass conversion; Biomethane; Biomethane production; CO2 capture; Combustion flue gas; Cost-effective technology; Emission reduction; Energy recovery; Methane production; Organic wastes; Pilot scale; Reduction targets; Two phase anaerobic digestion; Urban wastewater; Biomass degradations; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Bioconversion; Biogas; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Flue gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Sewage; Volatile fatty acids; Waste incineration; Wastewater; Anaerobic digestion; Emission control; Anaerobic digestion; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; methane; anoxic conditions; biogas; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; cleaner production; emission control; greenhouse gas; methane; sludge; technological development; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; article; biomass; degradation; energy recovery; greenhouse effect; organic waste; priority journal; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Carbon Dioxide; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Organic Chemicals; Pilot Projects; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955476711

The three Brassica species most widely used for oilseed production are Brassica napus, B. rapa and B. juncea. A fourth species, B. carinata is also used for oilseed production in Ethiopia and several other species are utilized to a smaller degree commercially. With the advent of climate change, these crops are facing more variable climates, including higher temperatures, increased drought stress, higher CO2 levels and increased salinity in some regions. Any consideration of the impact of climate change on oilseed Brassica production must consider not only seed yield, but also oil content, oil quality, meal protein content and glucosinolate content. In addition, the impacts of climate change on occurrence, severity and management of critical disease and insect disorders must also be considered. The effects of increased temperatures and moisture stress are predominantly negative, reducing yield and quality. The two factors often occur together, further reducing the quality of the crop. Relatively little is known, however, about the effects of increased CO2 on yield and quality of oilseed Brassica crops. There is some indication that increased CO2 levels may partially reverse the effects of high temperature and drought. An understanding of the combined impacts from increased temperatures, moisture stress and increased CO2 levels is crucial for the development of strategic breeding programs in response to climate change. Oilseed Brassica breeders have a number of breeding options available to them to develop cultivars better adapted to current and predicted climate change conditions. Utilization of variability within existing species is likely to provide continued incremental ins in yield regardless of climate change. However, if major advances in crop productivity are to be made under these circumstances, other options will be required. These include incorporation of key genes from other cultivated Brassica genomes and also from weedy cruciferous relatives providing sexual barriers can be overcome. Resynthesis of the allopolyploid species using a diverse range of germplasm from both diploid parents offers potential access to a range of new germplasm. However, this will require access to relevant germplasm collections from around the world. The use of GM technology to access major genes from wild relatives, or even from completely different species, offers major potential benefits to oilseed Brassica breeders. Changing species will offer significant benefits to growers in some regions, especially in areas where oilseed crops are already challenged by current climatic conditions. For example, canola quality B. juncea is better adapted than B. napus to the increasing temperatures and increasing moisture stress expected in coming decades. In the drier regions and where rainfall becomes less predictable, B. juncea will likely gradually replace B. napus as the preferred crop. The increasing availability of genomic information on genes (and associated markers) linked to key plant traits will also help to accelerate progress in oilseed Brassica breeding programs for better adapted cultivars. Breeding for disease resistance will remain an important component of most breeding programs. This is especially so for blackleg disease where severity is expected to increase and at least some host resistances fail as a consequence of predicted increased temperatures consequent from climate change. The available resistances to diseases will need to be managed carefully to maximize their longevity. Overall, it is evident that oilseed Brassica breeders will need to utilize a range of different methodologies and approaches to develop cultivars successfully adapted to changing climatic conditions. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc..","Blackleg; Brassica carinata; Brassica juncea; Brassica napus; Brassica rapa; Canola Leptosphaeria maculans; Climate change; High CO2; High temperature; Moisture stress; Oilseed rape",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886509649

We describe and then apply to Acre a method for estimating carbon stocks by land cover type. We then compare the results of our simple method, which is based on vegetation mapping and ground-based samples, with other more technically demanding methods based on remote sensing. We estimated total biomass carbon stocks by multiplying the measured above-ground biomass of trees&gt;10cm DBH in each of 18 forest types and published estimates for non-forest areas, as determined by measurement of 44 plots throughout the state (ranging from 1 to 10ha each), by land-cover area estimated using a geographical information system. State-wide, we estimated average above-ground biomass in forested areas to be 246±90Mgha-1; dense forest showed highest (322±20Mgha-1) and oligotrophic dwarf forest (campinarana) the lowest biomass (20±30Mgha-1). The two most widespread forest types in Acre, open canopy forests dominated by either palms and bamboo (for which ground-based data are scant), support an estimated 246±44 and 224±50Mgha-1 of above-ground biomass, respectively. We calculate the total above-ground biomass of the 163,000km2 State of Acre to be 3.6±0.8Pg (non-forest biomass included).

Herein, we report the effects of cement industry emissions (O3, SO2 and NO2) in air, as pollutants, at Riyadh City on Datura innoxia Mill. plant. Morphological characters including plant height, leaves area and number, fresh and dry weight of shoot and root systems of D. innoxia showed a significant reduction from their normal control plants as a response to exposure to pollutant emissions. Chlorophyll and carotenoid contents recorded reductions in values compared to control plant, and the lowest values of chlorophyll A, B, total chlorophyll, carotenoids and total pigments were 0.431, 0.169, 0.60, 0.343 and 0.943mg/g respectively at a distance of 1-5m from the cement factory in fruiting stage. These changes in values may be attributed to a probable deceleration of the biosynthetic process rather than degradation of pigments. Further D. innoxia showed a significant (P&lt;0.01) reduction in non-reducing and total sugars, protein and total lipid contents compared with the control plant. The root system recorded the lowest values of reducing sugars (0.350mg/gf. wt.), non-reducing sugars (0.116mg/gf. wt.), total sugars (0.466mg/gf. wt.), protein content (0.931mg/g f. wt.) and total lipids content (0.669mg/g f. wt.) in fruiting stage at a distance of 1-5m from the cement factory. The peroxidase activity of shoot and root systems of the studied plant was also significantly higher than those of control plant. Thus a highest value of (29.616 units/gf. wt.) peroxidase activity was recorded in vegetative stage of shoot system at a distance 1-5m from the cement factory.

However, it is anticipated that these sources of energy will deplete within the next 40-50 years. Moreover, the expected environmental damages such as the global warming, acid rain and urban smog due to the production of emissions from these sources have tempted the world to try to reduce carbon emissions by 80% and shift towards utilizing a variety of renewable energy resources (RES) which are less environmentally harmful such as solar, wind, biomass etc. in a sustainable way. Biomass is one of the earliest sources of energy with very specific properties. In this review, several aspects which are associated with burning biomass in boilers have been investigated such as composition of biomass, estimating the higher heating value of biomass, comparison between biomass and other fuels, combustion of biomass, co-firing of biomass and coal, impacts of biomass, economic and social analysis of biomass, transportation of biomass, densification of biomass, problems of biomass and future of biomass. It has been found that utilizing biomass in boilers offers many economical, social and environmental benefits such as financial net saving, conservation of fossil fuel resources, job opportunities creation and CO 2 and NOx emissions reduction. However, care should be taken to other environmental impacts of biomass such as land and water resources, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity and deforestation. Fouling, marketing, low heating value, storage and collections and handling are all associated problems when burning biomass in boilers. The future of biomass in boilers depends upon the development of the markets for fossil fuels and on policy decisions regarding the biomass market. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Several approaches have been used to deal with this problem: coarsening the spatial resolution of emissions; adding spatial correlations to the covariance matrices; adding constraints on the spatial derivatives into the functional being minimized; and multiplying the emission error covariance matrix by weighting factors. Intercomparison of methods for a carbon monoxide inversion over a city shows that even though all methods diminish the colocalization problem and produce similar general patterns, detailed information can greatly change according to the method used ranging from smooth, isotropic and short range modifications to not so smooth, non-isotropic and long range modifications. Poisson (non-Gaussian) and Gaussian assumptions both show these patterns, but for the Poisson case the emissions are naturally restricted to be positive and changes are given by means of multiplicative correction factors, producing results closer to the true nature of emission errors. Finally, we propose and test a new two-step, two-scale, fully Bayesian approach that deals with the colocalization problem and can be implemented for any prior density distribution. ©2011 The Authors Tellus B ©2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",,"atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; correlation; emission inventory; error correction; Gaussian method; inverse analysis; numerical model; observational method; Poisson ratio; spatial resolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959682614

Thus, continued global warming and climate change will affect lakes' thermal properties, dynamics, and ecosystem. The impact of climate change on Lake Tahoe (in the states of California and Nevada in the United States) is investigated here, as a case study of climate change effects on the physical processes occurring within a lake. In the Tahoe basin, air temperature data show upward trends and streamflow trends indicate earlier snowmelt. Precipitation in the basin is shifting from snow to rain, and the frequency of intense rainfall events is increasing. In-lake water temperature records of the past 38 years (1970-2007) show that Lake Tahoe is warming at an average rate of 0.013°C/year. The future trends of weather variables, such as air temperature, precipitation, longwave radiation, downward shortwave radiation, and wind speed are estimated from predictions of three General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the period 2001-2100. Future trends of weather variables of each GCM are found to be different to those of the other GCMs. A series of simulation years into the future (2000-2040) is established using streamflows and associated loadings, and meteorologic data sets for the period 1994-2004. Future simulation years and trends of weather variables are selected so that: (1) future simulated warming trend would be consistent with the observed warming trend (0.013°C/year); and (2) future mixing pattern frequency would closely match with the historical mixing pattern frequency. Results of 40-year simulations show that the lake continues to become warmer and more stable, and mixing is reduced. Continued warming in the Tahoe has important implications for efforts towards managing biodiversity and maintaining clarity of the lake. © 2010 The Author(s).","Climate change; General circulation model; Lake clarity model; Lake mixing dynamics; Water quality","Air temperature; Average rate; California; Data sets; Future trends; General circulation model; Internal heating; Lake clarity model; Lake sand reservoirs; Lake Tahoe; Lake water temperature; Long-wave radiation; Physical process; Rainfall event; Short-wave radiation; Snowmelt; Thermal properties; Upward trend; Wind speed; Atmospheric temperature; Biodiversity; Global warming; Lakes; Mixing; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Thermodynamic properties; Water pollution; Water quality; Climate models; climate change; environmental impact; general circulation model; lake water; mixing; reservoir; thermodynamic property; water quality; water temperature; Lake Tahoe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952993951

Sometimes data are not collected due to equipment failure or during equipment calibration. In this paper, we predict daily air pollutant concentrations (PM10 and SO2) from the Yenibosna and Umraniye air pollution measurement stations in Istanbul for times at which pollution data was not recorded. We predicted these pollutant concentrations using the CNN model with meteorological parameters, estimating missing daily pollutant concentrations for two data sets from 2002 to 2003. These data sets had 50 and 20% of data missing. The results of the CNN model predictions are compared with the results of a multivariate linear regression (LR). Results show that the correlation between predicted and observed data was higher for all pollutants using the CNN model (0.54-0.87). The CNN model predicted SO2 concentrations better than PM10 concentrations. Another interesting result is that winter concentrations of all pollutants were predicted better than summer concentrations. Experiments showed that accurate predictions of missing air pollutant concentrations are possible using the new approach contained in the CNN model. We therefore proposed a new approach to model air-pollution monitoring problem using CNN. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Cellular Neural Network (CNN); Meteorology; Missing data; Particulate matter (PM); Sulfur dioxide (SO2)","Accurate prediction; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollutants; Air pollution measurements; CNN models; Data missing; Data sets; Equipment failures; Istanbul; Meteorological parameters; Missing data; Multivariate linear regressions; Observed data; Particulate matter (PM); Pollutant concentration; Urban centers; Air quality; Cellular neural networks; Forecasting; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Wireless networks; Pollution; air quality; artificial neural network; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); data set; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; prediction; regression analysis; sulfur dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957929492

Oxygen mobility and reactivity of the active phase were characterized by oxygen isotope heteroexchange, temperature-programmed O2 desorption and CH4 reduction, isothermal pulse reduction by methane with wide variation of CH4 concentrations and TAP pulse studies. Experimental data point towards a selective oxidation of methane into syngas via a direct route with oxygen-assisted methane activation. This mechanistic feature is related to the strong Pt-support interaction stabilizing highly dispersed oxidic Pt species less active in CH4 and syngas combustion than metallic Pt clusters. Support activates O2 molecules and supplies active oxygen species to Pt sites. A high rate of oxygen diffusion on the surface and in the bulk of the support and Pt-support oxygen spillover stabilizes Pt in a well dispersed partially oxidized state while preventing coking at high concentrations of CH4 in the feed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Under the face of this huge challenge, the most viable way forward is to process infrastructure-compatible intermediate, such as bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, into biofuels. New facilities may integrate multiple distributed pyrolysis units producing bio-oil from locally available biomass and centralized biofuel production platforms, such as methanol or Fischer-Tropsch liquid synthesis utilizing syngas derived from gasification of bio-oil. An alternative to bio-oil gasification is hydrotreating and hydrocracking (upgrading) of bio-oil into stable oil with reduced oxygen content. The stable oil can then be coprocessed into targeted transportation fuel mix within refinery in exchange of refinery hydrogen to the upgrader. This Article focuses on the evaluation of economic and environmental sustainability of industrial scale biofuel production systems from bio-oils. An overview of bio-oil gasification-based system evaluation is presented, while comprehensive process reaction modeling (with 40 overall bio-oil hydrocracking and hydrotreating reaction steps), simulation, integration, and value analysis frameworks are illustrated for bio-oil upgrading and refinery coprocessing systems. The environmental analysis shows that the former technologies are able to meet the minimum greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target of 60%, to be eligible for the European Union (EU) Directive's 2020 target of 10% renewable energy in transport, while at least 20% renewable energy mix from an upgrader is required for meeting the EUGHGemission reduction target. Increases in the price of biodiesel and hydrogen make coprocessing of stable oils from bio-oil upgrader using refinery facilities economically more favorable than final biofuel blending from refineries and create win-win economic scenarios between the bio-oil upgrader and the refinery. The range of the cost of production (COP) of stable oil (328MWor 0.424 t/t bio-oil), steam (49.5MWor 0.926 t/t bio-oil), and off-gas or fuel gas (72.3MWor 0.142 t/t bio-oil) from a bio-oil (LHV of 23.3 MJ/kg) upgrader process is evaluated on the basis of individual product energy values and global warming potential (GWP) impacts. The minimum and the maximum annualized capital charges predicted by the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis correspond to 25 operating years and 10% IRR, and 10 operating years and 20% IRR, respectively. On the basis of this DCF strategy and 1200 $/t of hydrogen and 540 $/t of biodiesel market prices, the selling prices of 259.32 $/t, 34.85 $/t, and 174.27 $/t of the stable oil, steam, and fuel gas, respectively, from the upgrader to the refinery were obtained to create win-win marginal incentive for the upgrader and refinery systems, individually. If stable oil from a bio-oil upgrader can be launched as a product potentially to be used in refinery hydrocracker (at a competitive price of 490 $/t), for the production of renewable diesel, upgrader can be operated independently, such as purchase hydrogen from vendors at competitive price, with comparative marginal incentives. The bio-oil upgraders, either stand-alone or integrated, were designed to meet desired product specifications, diesel with specific gravity 0.825 and cetane number 57 and stable oil with API 30.1 and cetane number 28.7, for coprocessing through the refinery hydrocracker, respectively. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Assesment; Bio oil; Bio-oils; Biofuel production; Competitive prices; Coprocessing; Cost of productions; Discounted cash flow; Energy value; Environmental analysis; Environmental sustainability; European union; Fast pyrolysis; Fischer Tropsch; Fuel gas; Global warming potential; Hydrotreating; Industrial scale; Lignocellulosic biomass; Market price; Oxygen content; Product specifications; Reaction steps; Reduction targets; Refinery systems; Renewable energies; Selling prices; Syn-gas; System evaluation; Transportation fuels; Win-win; Biodiesel; Blending; Costs; Drilling platforms; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fuels; Gasification; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocracking; Hydrogen; Integration; Methanol; Petroleum transportation; Production platforms; Pyrolysis; Refining; Sustainable development; Synthesis gas; Well stimulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959991942

In order to assess energy savings and carbon reductions from the initiative before implementation, baseline energy monitoring was carried out at 45 sample sites using a power analyzer equipped with a data logger. A regression model to predict annual energy consumption was developed with the numbers of each type of lamp head for each junction as independent variables. The model parameters were then used to estimate baseline emissions for a single trial site where LEDs have been installed and for which energy monitoring was carried out. The estimated baseline energy consumption for this site and the monitored energy consumption after the LEDs have been installed were used to estimate the actual energy savings that can be expected from GCC's initiative. Annual energy savings from this analysis were estimated to range from 64.2 to 74.1 percent (95% Confidence Intervals). The cost savings resulting from the LED initiative were found to payback the investment over a period of about six years. This paper presents a low cost approach and method by which the energy and cost savings of a large scale replacement initiative can be estimated with a single pilot replacement installation of a traffic signal.

Here we present a ""benchmark"" map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for REDD assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49%, 25%, and 26%of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from ±6% to ±53%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national (>1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. ±5% and ca. ±1%, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.","Carbon cycling; Error propagation; Forest biomass; Forest height; Microwave and optical imaging","carbon; aboveground biomass; accuracy; Africa south of the Sahara; allometry; article; arts and illustration; belowground biomass; benchmark map; biomass; carbon storage; geographic distribution; landscape; mathematical model; priority journal; South and Central America; Southeast Asia; tropical rain forest; uncertainty; Africa South of the Sahara; Asia, Southeastern; Biomass; Carbon; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Geography; Latin America; Models, Biological; Trees; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959363987

In this study, the accumulation, speciation and concentrations of Se were examined in waters as well as sediments in a system of the evaporation ponds. A significant decrease in the total dissolved Se concentration in Cell 1 in which drainage water with higher Se concentration was pumped from Inlet Channels indicated that the immobilization of Se was active in the Cell 1 and resulted in the higher Se concentration in sediments compared to the terminal cell such as Cell 9. The percentage of reduced Se species such as selenite [Se(IV)] and org-Se of total Se in drainage waters was also found increased in Cell 1 compared to Inlet Channels. The total dissolved Se concentrations in water along flow paths from Cell 1 were relatively constant except for terminal cells such as Cells 9 and 10, which showed higher total dissolved Se concentrations due to evapoconcentration. The percentage of reduced Se forms of total Se was inversely proportional to the percentage of Se(VI) depending on the redox condition of evaporation ponds along the flow paths. Sequential extractions of Se species in sediments indicated that organic associated Se and elemental Se were prevalent forms in sediments in the ponds system. The higher concentrations of elemental Se and organic associated Se in sediments in Cell 1 indicated that the immobilization of Se was active in the sediments compared to Cell 9, while the percentage of both fractions of total Se in sediments in Cells 1 and 9 was relatively constant. The organic materials from algae might provide carbon sources for Se reduction and Se sink in sediments in its elemental and organic associated forms. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Evaporation basins; Sediment; Selenium; Sequential extraction; Speciation","California; California , USA; Carbon source; Drainage water; Flow path; Inlet channels; Organic materials; Potential hazards; Redox condition; San Joaquin Valley; Sequential extraction; Sink-in; Speciation; Anoxic sediments; Cells; Cytology; Dissolution; Evaporation; Lakes; Phase transitions; Positive ions; Sedimentology; Selenium; Selenium compounds; Wastewater disposal; Cell immobilization; accumulation; concentration (composition); drainage water; evaporation; immobilization; pond; sediment chemistry; selenium; speciation (chemistry); California; San Joaquin Valley; United States; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960627777

By studying three sets of actors, the science community, the media and the political community, the author reveals how climate change knowledge and politics is stabilized and destabilized in Norway. The article provides an analysis of the opposing forces that appear to mould climate change policy in Norway. The article suggests that policy follows up on the recommendations of the research community only to a small extent, even though it believes its conclusions. By reference to the literature on co-production, the article demonstrates that the climate science so far has not managed to stabilize the climate policy because (1) mass media contributes to maintaining several (and often opposing) climate discourses, (2) the dialogue between science and policy does not function well, (3) there is a lack of institutions where climate policy meets climate science, (4) the identity of 'climate politician' does not exist among decision-makers and (5) the representations of climate knowledge have an unclear relationship with the representations of the climate policy scientific controversy created by the media, which destabilize the climate change knowledge. Based on these findings, the author argues that it is fruitful to study sustainable development within a co-productionist framework, as the development and behaviours of individuals, institutions and organizations on which sustainable development is dependent is often 'co-produced' by different actors. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.","Climate change; Co-construction; Environmental policy; Media","climate change; environmental policy; mass media; policy strategy; state role; strategic approach; sustainable development; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957540739

However, field studies on the combined impacts of natural herbivory, competition and soil fertility on root fungal symbionts are rare. We asked how mammalian herbivory, fertilization, liming and plant-plant competition affect the root colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi of the dicot herb, Solidago virgaurea. The 2-year full-factorial experiment was conducted in two contrasting habitats: non-acidic and acidic mountain tundra. We found that herbivory increased arbuscular colonization (i. e. the site of resource exchange) at fertile non-acidic sites, where vegetation was rich in species having AMF symbionts, whereas at infertile acidic sites, where plants having AMF symbiont are scarce, the response was the opposite. Herbivory of the host plant negatively affected DSE hyphal and sclerotial colonization in unfertilized plots, possibly due to reduced carbon flow from the host plant while there was no effect of herbivory in fertilized plots. DSE colonization was highest in unfertilized exclosures where soil nutrient concentrations were also lowest. Liming had a negative effect on DSE hyphal colonization, and its effect also interacted with herbivory and the habitat. Biomass removal of the neighboring plants did not affect the root colonization percent of either arbuscules or DSE. Our results show that the impacts of aboveground mammalian herbivory, soil nutrient availability and specific habitat conditions on belowground root fungal symbionts are highly dependent on each other. Arbuscule response to herbivory appeared to be regulated by specific habitat conditions possibly caused by differences in the AMF availability in the soil while DSE response was associated with availability of host-derived carbon. Our result of the relationship between herbivory and soil nutrients suggests an important role of DSE in ecosystem processes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Carbon limitation; Dark septate endophytes; Grazing; Soil fertility","arbuscular mycorrhiza; endophyte; fungus; grazing; herb; herbivory; host plant; interspecific competition; nutrient availability; nutrient limitation; root colonization; soil fertility; soil nutrient; tundra; animal; article; chemistry; feeding behavior; Finland; food chain; fungus; growth, development and aging; mammal; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; plant root; soil; Solidago; symbiosis; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Finland; Food Chain; Fungi; Mammals; Mycorrhizae; Plant Roots; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Solidago; Symbiosis; Arbuscular; Dicotyledoneae; Fungi; Mammalia; Solidago; Solidago virgaurea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958744395

This is accounted for largely by the mesoclimatic variety in these areas, along with the co-occurrence of a small area of Eurosiberian, Boreal and Mediterranean species, and those of Tertiary Subtropical origin. Throughout the twenty-first century, we are likely to witness a climate change-related modification of the biogeographic scenario in these mountains, and there is therefore a need for accurate climate regionalisations to serve as a reference of the abundance and distribution of species and communities, particularly those of a relictic nature. This paper presents an objective mapping method focussing on climate regions in a mountain range. The procedure was tested in the Cordillera Central Mountains of the Iberian Peninsula, in the western Mediterranean, one of the ranges occupying the largest area of the Mediterranean Basin. This regionalisation is based upon multivariate analyses and upon detailed cartography employing 27 climatic variables. We used spatial interpolation of data based on geographic information. We detected high climatic diversity in the mountain range studied. We identified 13 climatic regions, all of which form a varying mosaic throughout the annual temperature and rainfall cycle. This heterogeneity results from two geographically opposed gradients. The first one is the Mediterranean-Euro-Siberian variation of the mountain range. The second gradient involves the degree of oceanicity, which is negatively related to distance from the Atlantic Ocean. The existing correlation between the climatic regions detected and the flora existing therein enables the results to be situated within the projected trends of global warming, and their biogeographic and ecological consequences to be analysed. © 2010 ISB.","Climate; Cordillera Central Mountains of the Iberian Peninsula; Geographic factors; Global warming; Mediterranean flora; Multivariate regression with climatic data","altitude; article; classification; climate; climate change; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; multivariate analysis; plant; regression analysis; Southern Europe; statistics; Altitude; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Mediterranean Region; Multivariate Analysis; Plants; Regression Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955006121

Gravimetric and sieve analyses revealed a strong influence of inorganic carbon on corrosion product buildup. Surface area analyses indicated that magnetite, together with cryptocrystalline corrosion products, increase the surface area more than chukanovite. A heterogeneous morphology was found in corrosion products formed in deionized water by scanning electron microscopy. Corrosion products formed in the presence of inorganic carbon revealed a homogeneous and almost completely covering layer. Transects were analyzed with backscatter electron detection. Electron microscopic investigations on the cross sections of gravel and cast iron granules indicated that corrosion products only occur on reactive surfaces.

From the 1950s to the 1980s, land use laws promoted middle-class sprawl by reserving extensive tracts of land for the construction of moderately priced, single-family homes on lots of less than one acre. More recently, suburbs have adopted land use controls that promote upper class sprawl by reserving large areas for the construction of small numbers of expensive homes on spacious lots. This regulatory shift can be explained in several ways: a homevoter hypothesis that derives the new controls from the economic interests of suburban homeowners and a regional spillover hypothesis that attributes the adoption of new controls to desires by planning commissioners, consultants, and nongovernmental organizations to do as other communities are doing. We assess these explanations through a case study of changing land use controls in the suburban New Jersey Highlands west of New York City. Between 1975 and 2002 the region saw large increases in preserved open space, a doubling of the required minimum lot area for houses, increases in the real price of housing, declines in the number of newly constructed homes, and a shift in residential real estate development toward the urban core. Multivariate analyses of the changes in land use controls support the regional spillover hypothesis. The implications of this dynamic for conservation policies, environmental injustices, and greenhouse gas emissions are briefly explored. © 2011 by Association of American Geographers.","Down zoning; Land use controls; Open space; Sprawl","conservation management; greenhouse gas; land use change; multivariate analysis; nongovernmental organization; open space; residential development; suburban area; zoning system; New Jersey; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956207699

This directly affects biotic and abiotic processes, including plant physiology, reproduction, phenology, soil evaporation and nutrient cycling, which themselves affect understory facilitation, productivity and diversity, and land surface-atmosphere fluxes of energy, carbon and water. Although important, assessing extreme-event solar radiation responses regionally following die-off is complex compared with characterizing patch-scale inputs. Estimating regional-scale changes requires integration of broad-scale downward-looking shading patterns due to canopy and topography with fine-scale upward-looking canopy details (e.g. live vs. dead trees, height, diameter, spatial pattern and foliar diffusivity). We quantified increases in near-ground solar radiation following overstorey loss of piñon pine cover in response to a recent extreme drought event (2002-2003). We evaluated 211km2 in south-western USA seasonally and annually using high-spatial resolution satellite imagery, hemispherical ground photography, GIS (Geographic Information System)-based solar radiation modelling tools, in situ meteorological data and tree measurements. Overstorey loss due to die-off produced increases in near-ground solar radiation regionally each season - up to 28Wm-2, an increase of 9.1%, in summer - while simultaneously decreasing spatial variation. Annually the increase was c. 17Wm-2. Larger increases occurred where initial canopy cover was greater or at higher elevations, by as much as c. 80Wm-2 (a 40% increase). Synthesis. Our results are notable in that they quantify increases regionally in near-ground solar radiation in response to a climate extreme triggering widespread tree die-off. The substantial increases quantified are expected to have primary direct effects on processes such as plant physiology, reproduction, phenology, soil evaporation and nutrient cycling, and secondary effects on understory facilitation, productivity and diversity, and land surface-atmosphere fluxes of energy, carbon and water. Consequently, extreme event-induced changes in near-ground solar radiation need to be considered by both ecologists and physical scientists in assessing global change impacts. More generally, our results highlight an important but sometimes overlooked aspect of plant ecology - that plants not only respond to their physical environment and other plants, but also directly modify their physical environment from individual plant to regional scales. © 2011 The Authors.

The models are driven by CO2 emissions from historical data and the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 high-emission scenario. A linear feedback analysis successfully separates the regional future (2010-2100) oceanic CO2 uptake into a CO2-induced component, due to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and a climate-induced component, due to global warming. The models capture the observationbased magnitude and distribution of anthropogenic CO2 uptake. The distributions of the climate-induced component are broadly consistent between the models, with reduced CO2 uptake in the subpolar Southern Ocean and the equatorial regions, owing to decreased CO2 solubility; and reduced CO2 uptake in the midlatitudes, owing to decreased CO2 solubility and increased vertical stratification. The magnitude of the climate-induced component is sensitive to local warming in the southern extratropics, to large freshwater fluxes in the extratropical North Atlantic Ocean, and to small changes in the CO2 solubility in the equatorial regions. In key anthropogenic CO2 uptake regions, the climate-induced component offsets the CO2-induced component at a constant proportion up until the end of this century. This amounts to approximately 50% in the northern extratropics and 25% in the southern extratropics and equatorial regions. Consequently, the detection of climate change impacts on anthropogenic CO2 uptake may be difficult without monitoring additional tracers, such as oxygen. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Feedback; Ocean models; Regional effects","Atmospheric CO; Carbon uptake; Climate change impact; Cycle model; Equatorial regions; Extratropical; Extratropics; Freshwater fluxes; Historical data; Induced component; Linear feedback; Midlatitudes; Multi-model; North Atlantic Ocean; Ocean model; Regional effects; Regional impacts; Southern Ocean; Special report on emissions scenarios; Vertical stratification; Climate models; Computer simulation; Global warming; Oceanography; Solubility; Carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; ensemble forecasting; global warming; numerical model; oxygen; solubility; tracer; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958125713

On average, the lowest concentrations occur within rainfall and they have declined over time probably in response to reductions in global emissions. There is a corresponding reduction within the streams except for forested systems where concentrations up to doubled following clear-fell. Within the streams there are both annual cycling and diurnal cycling of As. The annual cycling gives maxima during the summer months and this probably reflects the importance of groundwater inputs and mineralisation/desorption from the surface soil layers. Correspondingly, the diurnal cycling occurs during the summer months at low flow periods with As concentrations highest in the afternoon/evening. For the urban/industrial basins of northern England with historically a much higher As deposition, land contamination and effluent discharges, comparative data indicate As concentrations around three fold higher: strong seasonal patterns are observed for the same reasons as with the uplands. Across the sites, the As concentrations are over an order of magnitude lower than that of environmental concern. Nonetheless, the results clearly show the effects of declining emissions on rainfall deposition and some indication of areas of historic contamination. Arsenic is mainly present in the &lt;0.45 fraction, but cross-flow filtration indicates that approx. 43% is in the colloidal phase at the clean water sites, and 16% in the colloidal phase at the contaminated sites.

On an old municipal solid waste landfill in north-western Germany soil gas concentrations (10, 40, 90cm depth), topsoil methane oxidation capacity and soil properties were surveyed at 40 locations along a 16m grid. As soil properties determine gas flow patterns it was hypothesized that the variability in soil gas composition and the subsequent methanotrophic activity would correspond to the variability of soil properties. Methanotrophic activity was found to be subject to high spatial variability, with values ranging between 0.17 and 9.80gCH4m-2h-1. Considering the current gas production rate of 0.03gCH4m-2h-1, the oxidation capacity at all sampled locations clearly exceeded the flux to the cover, and can be regarded as an effective instrument for mitigating methane fluxes. The methane concentration in the cover showed a high spatial heterogeneity with values between 0.01 and 0.32vol.% (10cm depth), 22.52vol.% (40cm), and 36.85vol.% (90cm). The exposure to methane raised the oxidation capacity, suggested by a statistical correlation to an increase in methane concentration at 90cm depth. Methane oxidation capacity was further affected by the methanotroph bacteria pH optimum and nutrient availability, and increased with decreasing pH towards neutrality, and increased with soluble ion concentration). Soil methane and carbon dioxide concentration increased with lower flow resistance of the cover, as represented by the soil properties of a reduced bulk density, increase in air capacity and in relative ground level. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Air capacity; AS-soils; Bulk density; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Design criterion; Flow resistance; Gas flow patterns; Gas migration; Gas productions; Germany; Ground level; Ion concentrations; Landfill covers; Landfill methane; Methane concentrations; Methane fluxes; Methane oxidation; Methanotrophs; Microbial oxidation; Municipal solid waste landfills; Nutrient availability; Oxidation capacity; PH optima; Soil gas concentration; Soil property; Soil-gas composition; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial variability; Statistical correlation; Carbon dioxide; Concentration (process); Gases; Land fill; Methanation; Municipal solid waste; Oxidation; Soils; Waste disposal; Methane; carbon dioxide; methane; flow pattern; gas flow; landfill; methane; methanotrophy; municipal solid waste; nutrient availability; oxidation; soil gas; soil property; spatial variation; article; bulk density; gas analysis; gas flow; Germany; landfill; methanotrophic bacterium; municipal solid waste; nutrient availability; oxidation; pH; priority journal; soil moisture; soil property; soil temperature; spatial soil variability; Air Pollutants; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952695033

At the Research Institute for the Built Environment of Tomorrow, RiBuilT, the definition of a sustainable society has been summarised as the ‘Concept of O’: O for a circular approach of resource management, and 0 (zero) for 0-impacts of our activities; 0-energy, 0-materials, 0-water, 0-landuse and 0-air (pollution). In order to apply this approach to existing urban environments, the Urban Harvestplus approach was developed. This paper will analyse the first test results of the actual implementation of this approach on the Dutch district of Kerkrade West. The pilot on Kerkrade West shows that even when the production of resources is maximised and the demand for them will be drastically reduced, it will still be hard to achieve the 0-impact state. We need new and more innovative solutions to actually make it happen. However, the Urban Harvestplus approach proved to be a straight forward approach in getting closer to the zero-impact situation. It also clarified the interaction between resources and made clear that resource cycles should never be considered on their own, but always in relation to each other to avoid sub-optimisation. Many questions and areas are left for further research, but we believe Urban Harvest-plus represents a strong basis to depart from. © 2011 SUSB Press.

It is shown by exact time dependent simulations that involve explicitly LSJ-split excited states that the radiation emission in fluctuating plasma can be larger than in the corresponding stationary limits. For regular fluctuations like the sawtooth activity, also the startup phase of sawtooth activity can lead to higher emission compared to the time dependent regular phase. It is demonstrated that the sawtooth crash can be almost exactly followed by resonance line emission like H-like Lyman-alpha and He-like Helium-alpha of, e.g., argon impurity ions, whereas the effective charge state distribution lags seriously behind. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959707282

CRRLs were extensively detected from the inner Galaxy (longitudes &lt;20°). We report here, for the first time, the association of low-frequency CRRLs with Hi self-absorbing clouds in the inner Galaxy and that the CRRLs from the innermost ~10° of the Galaxy arise in the Riegel-Crutcher (R-C) cloud. The R-C cloud is amongst the most well known of Hi self-absorbing (HISA) regions located at a distance of about 125pc in the Galactic Centre direction. Taking the R-C cloud as an example, we demonstrate that the physical properties of the HISA can be constrained by combining multifrequency CRRLs and Hi observations. The derived physical properties of the HISA cloud are used to determine the cooling and heating rates. The dominant cooling process is emission of the Cii 158 μm line whereas the dominant heating process in the cloud interior is photoelectric emission. Constraints on the far-ultraviolet flux (G0 ~ 4-7) falling on the R-C cloud are obtained by assuming thermal balance between the dominant heating and cooling processes. The H2 formation rate per unit volume in the cloud interior is ~10-10-10-12s-1cm-3, which far exceeds the H2 dissociation rate per unit volume. We conclude that the self-absorbing cold Hi gas in the R-C cloud may be in the process of converting to the molecular form. The cold Hi gas observed as HISA features is ubiquitous in the inner Galaxy and forms an important part of the interstellar medium. Our analysis shows that combining CRRLs and Hi data can give important insights into the nature of this cold gas. We also estimate the integration times required to image the CRRL-forming region with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Pathfinders.

However, there are significant implementation obstacles to accessing the world's forest carbon sequestration potential. The timing of regional participation and eligibility of sequestration activities are issues. The existing forest carbon supply estimates have made optimistic assumptions about immediate, comprehensive, and global access. They have also assumed no interactions between activities and regions, and over time. We use a global forest and land use model to evaluate these assumptions with more realistic forest carbon policy pathways. We find that an afforestation only policy is fundamentally flawed, accelerated deforestation may be unavoidable, and a delayed comprehensive program could reduce, but not eliminate, near-term accelerated deforestation and eventually produce sequestration equivalent to idealized policies - but with a different sequestration mix than previously estimated by others and thereby different forests. We also find that afforestation and avoided deforestation increase the cost of one another. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054905039

In theory, climate-related decision support identifies the need to move beyond the linear dissemination of information from experts to decision-makers. Interviews with researchers and federal program managers, however, show that in practice there are still wide gaps between the development of climate science and its application. Lessons learned in two example cases of decision support experiments are discussed to highlight some of the on-going challenges in applying climate science, e. g. defining decision support, involving decision-makers, and determining effectiveness. The published literature also shows these reoccurring challenges but emphasizes more collaboration between science and decision-makers as this improves the relevance, compatibility, and accessibility of climate science information and can increase users' receptiveness. This article proposes that the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) can help the development of decision support resources, in one way, by coordinating an Internet-based practitioners' network.

This overview paper draws on the papers in this issue (as well as a wider array of literature) to provide an analytical review of the carbon and climate relevance of urbanization and of some of the interactions between urbanization and global environmental change. The authors' insights are used to inform a more general set of reflections on the nature of urban and environmental change, and the linkages between the two. Three over-arching themes are identified: the centrality of vulnerability and resilience as concepts shaping urban responses to climate change; the growing recognition of the role of specific governance mechanisms and systems at different scales in shaping the design and implementation of responses; and the particularities, cross-cutting issues and connections between cities from different regions (e.g., Europe, East Africa) in addressing this challenge. Notwithstanding the rapidly growing volume of information on this area of research, the challenge will be to develop frameworks to understand and effectively respond to the complex interactions between urban development, the carbon cycle and the climate system, and to turn the hazards resulting from human pressures on the environment into sources of opportunities and innovations aimed at building more resilient and sustainable cities. © 2011.",,"anthropogenic effect; carbon cycle; carbon emission; climate change; global change; governance approach; greenhouse gas; hazard assessment; innovation; literature review; sustainability; urban area; urban design; urban development; urbanization; vulnerability; East Africa; Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955613212

Andean TMCFs sit immediately below highly flammable, high-altitude grasslands (Puna/Páramo) that suffer from recurrent anthropogenic fire. This treeline is a zone of climatic tension where substantial future warming is likely to force upward tree migrations, while increased fire presence and fire impacts are likely to force it downwards. TMCFs contain large carbon stocks in their peat soils and their loss through fire is a currently unaccounted for regional source of CO2. This study, conducted in the southern Peruvian Andes (&gt;2800m), documents differences in live tree biomass, fine root biomass, fallen and standing dead wood, and soil organic carbon in 4 paired-sample plots (burned versus control) following the severe ground fires that occurred during the 2005 Andean drought. Peat soils contributed the most to biomass burning emissions, with lower values corresponding to an 89% mean stock difference compared to the controls (mean±SE) (54.1±22.3 vs. 5.8±5.3MgCha-1). Contrastingly, carbon stocks from live standing trees differed by a non-significant 37% lower value in the burned plots compared to the controls, largely compensated by vigorous resprouting (45.5±17.4 vs. 69.2±13.4MgCha-1). Both standing dead trees and fallen dead wood were significantly higher in the burned plots with a three-fold difference from the controls: dead Trees 45.2±9.4 vs. 16.4±4.4MgCha-1, and ca. a 2 fold difference for the fallen dead wood: 11.2±5 vs. 6.7±3.2MgCha-1 for the burned plots versus their controls. A preliminary estimate of the regional contribution of biomass burning emissions from Andean TMCFs for the period 2000-2008, resulted in mean carbon emission rates of 1.3TgCyr-1 (max-min: 1.8-0.8TgCyr-1). This value is in the same order of magnitude than South American annual fire emissions (300TgCyr-1) suggesting the need for further research on Andean forest fires. On-going projects on the region are working on the promotion of landowner participation in TMCFs conservation through REDD+ mechanism. The heart of the proposed initiative is reforestation of degraded lands with green fire breaks enriched with economically valuable Andean plant species. The cultivation of these species may contribute to reduce deforestation pressure on the Amazonian cloud forest by providing an alternative income to local communities, at the same time that they prevent the spread of fire into Manu National Park and adjacent community-held forests, protecting forest and reducing CO2 emissions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Andes; Biomass burning emissions; Montane cloud forests; Peat soil; REDD+; Resprouting","Andes; Biomass burning emissions; Montane cloud forests; Peat soil; REDD+; Resprouting; Biomass; Deforestation; Organic carbon; Parks; Peat; Reforestation; Revegetation; Soils; Fires; altitude; anthropogenic effect; biomass burning; carbon emission; cloud; cultivation; deforestation; drought; economic analysis; fire behavior; grassland; magnitude; migration; montane forest; peat soil; rare species; reforestation; resprouting; soil organic matter; Biomass; Carbon; Deforestation; Emission; Forest Fires; Peat; Plants; Reforestation; Soil; Sprouts; Tropical Atmospheres; Andes; Manu National Park; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955014309

The country has adopted a mandatory renewable energy target (MRET) to ensure that 20% of electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020. In order to support the MRET, a market scheme of tradable Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) has been implemented since 2001. Generators using biomass from eligible sources are able to contribute to GHG emission reduction through the substitution of coal for electricity production and are eligible to create and trade RECs. This paper quantifies the potential biomass resources available for energy generation from forestry and agriculture in the Green Triangle, one of the most promising Australian Regions for biomass production. We analyse the cost of electricity generation using direct firing of biomass, and estimate the required REC prices to make it competitive with coal fired electricity generation. Major findings suggest that more than 2.6 million tonnes of biomass are produced every year within 200 km of the regional hub of Mount Gambier and biomass fired electricity is viable using feedstock with a plant gate cost of 46 Australian Dollars (AUD) per tonne under the current REC price of 34 AUD per MWh.

For instance, in 2009 concrete production was superior to 10 billion tons. Cement plays an important role in terms of economic and social relevance since it is fundamental to build and improve infrastructure. On the other hand, this industry is also a heavy polluter. Cement production releases 5-6% of all carbon dioxide generated by human activities, accounting for about 4% of global warming. It can release huge amounts of persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins and heavy metals and particles. Energy consumption is also considerable. Cement production use approximately 0.6% of all energy produced in the United States. On the other hand, the chemistry underlying cement production and its applications can be very helpful to overcome these environmental issues. In terms of manufacture, there are many alternative materials that can be used to minimize carbon dioxide production and reduce energy consumption, such as calcium sulfoaluminates and β-Ca2SiO4-rich cements. Using residues from other industrial sectors can also improve the sustainability of cement industry. Under adequate conditions, waste materials such as tyres, oils, municipal solid waste and solvents can be used as supplementary fuel in cement plants. Concrete can be used for encapsulation of waste materials such as tyres, plastics and glasses. In this review, we discuss some aspects of the cement industry associated with environmental science. Other issues such as economic aspects, the chemistry of cement manufacture and its properties are also presented. Special attention is given to the role that cement chemistry can play in terms of sustainability. The most relevant aspects are outlined, such as the use of alternative materials, new possibilities and also the recycling of materials. It is also argued that an important aspect is the role of research and development necessary to improve cement sustainability. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon dioxide; Cement; Green chemistry; Pollutants; Sustainability",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957821872

However, burning firewood in the domestic heaters that are currently available in Australia produces methane and black carbon particles that increase global warming. The aim of this study was to estimate the amount of global warming from wood heating in Australia and evaluate ways in which this might be reduced. Methane from the average wood heater in Brisbane, Perth or Sydney is estimated to cause at least as much global warming as gas central heating an entire house with floor area of 160 m2. In the colder climates of Canberra and Melbourne, a wood heater in the living area plus supplementary heating in other rooms is also estimated to cause more global warming than gas, or reverse cycle air-conditioning. Australia's annual contribution to global warming would be reduced by at least 8.7 million tonnes of CO2- equivalent (the same as removing about 21% of Australian passenger cars from the roads, or generating electricity from 5.8 million household 1 kW rooftop photovoltaic systems) if the 4.5 to 5 million tonnes of firewood currently burned in domestic wood heaters were instead used to replace coal in power stations and domestic wood heaters replaced by gas or reverse cycle air-conditioning.

This ""New World dis(Order)"" is characterized by insecurity of the United States in the face of economic and political decline vis-à-vis China; fragmentation of the Group of 77 developing nations negotiating bloc; and weakening of the European Union, which was cut out entirely from the group negotiating the Copenhagen Accord. In addition to old alignments of developing countries based on solidarity, negotiating blocs have fractured along lines of responsibility for climate change, capability to address it, and national vulnerability to climate risks. This paper assesses whether, over the past two decades, negotiations have come closer to meeting basic criteria of international climate justice, and chronicles how environmental negotiations have come to reflect a different and shifting balance of power. Drawing insights from Giovanni Arrighi and Beverly Silver's analyses of US hegemonic decline and the rise of China, the article argues that the roots of the worst stubbornness by the US in recent climate talks lie in growing insecurity about its ability to provide jobs for its workers in a future where all sorts of work is moving to China and India. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate policy; Copenhagen; Equity; Globalization; International development; International relations; Justice; Negotiations","climate change; conference proceeding; developing world; economic impact; environmental degradation; environmental justice; environmental policy; equity; European Union; future prospect; globalization; hegemony; Kyoto Protocol; negotiation process; new world order; political instability; vulnerability; China; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960056582

Arthur Okun made plain the fundamental conflict between efficiency and equity that arises in the pursuit of policy goals (Okun, 1974). Although Okun was speaking about government tax and spending policy, the potential conflict between efficiency and equity is also manifest at the nexus of two of the most far-reaching changes in the environmental policy arena: the adoption of market-like tools for pollution control and the quest for environmental justice. The article assesses this potential tradeoff by determining whether the pursuit of efficiency through the Clean Air Act Amendment's (CAA) sulfur dioxide allowance trading program (ATP) inadvertently transfers pollution into poor and minority communities. Methods. I employ Probit, Tobit, and GLS models using data for all SO2 trading activity between January 1995 and March 2009 to estimate whether allowance trading concentrates SO2 emissions in poor communities and communities of color. When using these models, I control for sample selectivity and for possible bias stemming from the modifiable areal unit problem. Results. The ATP does not concentrate sulfur dioxide emissions in black or Hispanic communities. To the contrary, communities with high percentages of black and Hispanic residents experience fewer imports of sulfur dioxide. Allowance trading does transfer SO2 emissions into poorly educated communities. Conclusions. There is no inherent tradeoff between efficiency and equity when using market-based instruments for pollution control. Policymakers, however, might make an effort to design and implement future emissions trading programs in a manner that reduces the monitoring costs of tracking emissions trading. By reducing monitoring costs, policymakers may prevent the concentration of emissions in poorly educated communities while preserving the efficiency benefits of these instruments. © 2011 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955535626

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of plant-microorganisms associations on petroleum hydrocarbons fate in salt marshes of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal). Sediments un-colonized and colonized (rhizosediments) by different plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata and Spartina patens) were sampled in four sites of the lower and middle estuary for hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms (HD), total cell counts (TCC) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) assessment. In general, TPHs, HD and TCC were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rhizosediments than in un-colonized sediments. Also recorded were differences on the abundance of hydrocarbon degraders among the rhizosediment of the different plants collected at the same site (J. maritimus < P. australis < T. striata), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between J. maritimus and T. striata. Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found. Our data clearly suggest that salt marsh plants can influence the microbial community, by fostering the development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in its rhizosphere, an effect observed for all plants. This effect, combined with the plant capability to retain hydrocarbons around the roots, points out that salt marsh plant-microorganisms associations may actively contribute to hydrocarbon removal and degradation in estuarine environments. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bioremediation; Estuary; Hydrocarbons; Lima River estuary; Rhizosphere; Salt marsh","Cell count; Hydrocarbon degradation; Hydrocarbon degraders; Hydrocarbon removal; Lima River estuary; Microbial communities; Microbial populations; Organic matter content; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Phragmites australis; Portugal; Rhizosphere; Salt marsh; Salt marshes; Statistically significant difference; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Anoxic sediments; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Degradation; Ecology; Estuaries; Microorganisms; Petroleum chemistry; Population statistics; Salt removal; Sedimentology; Soils; Wetlands; Hydrocarbons; 4',6 diamidino 2 phenylindole; hydrocarbon; indole derivative; inorganic salt; petroleum; abundance; biodegradation; bioremediation; cleanup; correlation; estuarine environment; grass; hydrocarbon; microbial community; rhizosphere; saltmarsh; sampling; article; bacterial count; bacterium; bioremediation; metabolism; microbial consortium; microbiology; plant; plant root; pollution; Portugal; rhizosphere; river; sediment; wetland; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Colony Count, Microbial; Environmental Pollution; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons; Indoles; Microbial Consortia; Petroleum; Plant Roots; Plants; Portugal; Rhizosphere; Rivers; Salts; Wetlands; Limia Estuary; Portugal; Viana do Castelo [Portugal]; Juncus maritimus; Phragmites australis; Spartina patens; Triglochin striata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957959296

Preparation conditions frequently involve high-temperature treatments of precursors (up to 1400 °C), which result in increased particle size and aggregation, and lead to oxidation of Ce(iii) to Ce(iv). We report here a process that we term protected annealing, that allows the thermal treatment of preformed precursor particles at temperatures up to 1000 °C while preserving their small size and state of dispersion. In a first step, pristine nanoparticles are prepared by a glycothermal reaction, leading to a mixture of YAG and boehmite crystalline phases. The preformed nanoparticles are then dispersed in a porous silica. Annealing of the composite material at 1000 °C is followed by dissolution of the amorphous silica by hydrofluoric acid to recover the annealed particles as a colloidal dispersion. This simple process allows completion of YAG crystallization while preserving their small size. The redox state of Ce ions can be controlled through the annealing atmosphere. The obtained particles of YAG:Ce (60 ± 10 nm in size) can be dispersed as nearly transparent aqueous suspensions, with a luminescence quantum yield of 60%. Transparent YAG:Ce nanoparticle-based films of micron thickness can be deposited on glass substrates using aerosol spraying. Films formed from particles prepared by the protected annealing strategy display significantly improved photostability over particles that have not been subject to such annealing. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aerosol spraying; Amorphous silica; Annealing atmospheres; Aqueous suspensions; Biological labels; Bulk samples; Colloidal dispersion; Crystalline phasis; Glass substrates; High-temperature treatment; Luminescence quantum yields; Photo-stability; Porous silica; Precursor particles; Preparation conditions; Redox state; Simultaneous control; Size and size distributions; Small size; Thermal treatment; White LED; YAG; Aerosols; Annealing; Dissolution; Film preparation; Hydrofluoric acid; Light; Light emitting diodes; Metallic glass; Nanoparticles; Optical properties; Quantum yield; Silica; Substrates; Suspensions (fluids); Agglomeration; nanoparticle; article; artificial membrane; chemistry; hardness; heat; luminescence; materials testing; methodology; particle size; surface property; ultrastructure; Hardness; Hot Temperature; Luminescent Measurements; Materials Testing; Membranes, Artificial; Nanoparticles; Particle Size; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956102486

The objective of this paper is to use a process-based vegetation model to evaluate the relationship between modelled and observed global patterns of plant diversity and the geographic distribution of biomes. Location The global terrestrial biosphere. Methods We implemented and tested a novel vegetation model aimed at identifying strategies that enable plants to grow and reproduce within particular climatic conditions across the globe. Our model simulates plant survival according to the fundamental ecophysiological processes of water uptake, photosynthesis, reproduction and phenology. We evaluated the survival of an ensemble of 10,000 plant growth strategies across the range of global climatic conditions. For the simulated regional plant assemblages we quantified functional richness, functional diversity and functional identity. Results A strong relationship was found (correlation coefficient of 0.75) between the modelled and the observed plant diversity. Our approach demonstrates that plant functional dissimilarity increases and then saturates with increasing plant diversity. Six of the major Earth biomes were reproduced by clustering grid cells according to their functional identity (mean functional traits of a regional plant assemblage). These biome clusters were in fair agreement with two other global vegetation schemes: a satellite image classification and a biogeography model (kappa statistics around 0.4). Main conclusions Our model reproduces the observed global patterns of plant diversity and vegetation physiognomy from the number and identity of simulated plant growth strategies. These plant growth strategies emerge from the first principles of climatic constraints and plant functional trade-offs. Our study makes important contributions to furthering the understanding of how climate affects patterns of plant diversity and vegetation physiognomy from a process-based rather than a phenomenological perspective. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biogeography; Climate-biodiversity relationship; Functional diversity; Functional identity; Functional richness; PFT; Plant functional traits; Tolerance hypothesis; Vegetation model","biodiversity; biogeography; biome; biosphere; climate effect; ecological modeling; ecophysiology; functional role; geographical distribution; global perspective; image classification; plant community; satellite imagery; species diversity; species richness; survival; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958102869

We quantified the relative contributions to PM2.5 from both secondhand smoke and infiltrating outdoor sources in US casinos. We measured real-time PM2.5, particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PPAH), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (as an index of ventilation rate) inside and outside 8 casinos in Reno, Nevada. We combined these data with data from previous studies, yielding a total of 66 US casinos with smoking in California, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, developing PM2.5 frequency distributions, with 3 nonsmoking casinos for comparison. Geometric means for PM2.5 were 53.8γg/m3 (range 18.5-205γg/m3) inside smoking casinos, 4.3γg/m3 (range 0.26-29.7γg/m3) outside those casinos, and 3.1γg/m3 (range 0.6-9γg/m3) inside 3 nonsmoking casinos. In a subset of 21 Reno and Las Vegas smoking casinos, PM2.5 in gaming areas averaged 45.2γg/m3 (95% CI, 37.7-52.7γg/m3); adjacent nonsmoking casino restaurants averaged 27.2γg/m3 (95% CI, 17.5-36.9γg/m3), while PM2.5 outside the casinos averaged 3.9γg/m3 (95% CI, 2.5-5.3γg/m3). For a subset of 10 Nevada and Pennsylvania smoking casinos, incremental (indoor-outdoor) PM2.5 was correlated with incremental PPAH (R2=0.79), with ventilation rate-adjusted smoker density (R2=0.73), and with smoker density (R2=0.60), but not with ventilation rates (R2=0.15). PPAH levels in 8 smoking casinos in 3 states averaged 4 times outdoors. The nonsmoking casinos' PM2.5 (n=3) did not differ from outdoor levels, nor did their PPAH (n=2). Incremental PM2.5 from secondhand smoke in approximately half the smoking casinos exceeded a level known to produce cardiovascular morbidity in nonsmokers after less than 2h of exposure, posing acute health risks to patrons and workers. Casino ventilation and air cleaning practices failed to control secondhand smoke PM2.5. Drifting PM2.5 from secondhand smoke contaminated unseparated nonsmoking areas. Smoke-free casinos reduced PM2.5 to the same low levels found outdoors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Casino; Environmental tobacco smoke; Indoor air pollution; PAH; Particulate matter; PM2.5; Real-time monitoring; Secondhand smoke; Smoking activity","carbon dioxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; tobacco smoke; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; cardiovascular disease; gambling; health risk; indoor air; PAH; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; real time; smoke; smoking; tobacco; ventilation; air conditioning; air pollution; article; cardiovascular risk; correlation analysis; environmental exposure; health hazard; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; passive smoking; priority journal; risk assessment; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; United States; Ventilation; California; Delaware; Nevada; New Jersey; Reno; United States; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955108710

The total carbon capture potential of soils in cities may be as high as 7 Mt/year within the UK using biochar and accumulated carbonate minerals, which is equivalent in significance to other forms of geoengineering. Furthermore, soil and vegetation management practices may be implemented to accumulate plant-derived organic carbon in urban soils.

The purposes of this study are: (1) to evaluate how the afforestation and reforestation programs established in Fujian Province influence carbon storage in forest ecosystems; (2) to assess the influence of tree species, forest age and ownership changes on vegetation carbon storage; and (3) to explore strategies for increasing vegetation carbon potentials. Data from seven Chinese Forest Resource Inventories and 5,059 separate sample plots collected between 1978 and 2008 were used to estimate vegetation carbon storage in the whole province. In addition, uncertainty analysis was conducted to provide the range of our estimations. Total forest vegetation carbon storage increased from 136. 51 in 1978 to 229. 31 Tg C in 2008, and the forest area increased from 855. 27 × 104 to 1,148. 66 × 104 ha, showing that the Fujian forests have a net vegetation carbon increase of 96. 72 Tg C with an annual increase of 4. 84 Tg C over the study period. Carbon storage varied with dominant forest species, forest age and forest ownership, suggesting that increases in vegetation carbon potentials can be achieved through selection of forest species and management of age structures. Implementation of afforestation and reforestation programs in Fujian Province over the past three decades has made a significant contribution to forest carbon storage. Vegetation carbon storage can be further increased by increasing the proportion of mature, broadleaved and state-owned forests. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon potential; Forest carbon storage; Forest resource inventory; Fujian Province; Reforestation","afforestation; age structure; biogeochemical cycle; broad-leaved forest; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; dominance; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; forest resource; ownership; reforestation; uncertainty analysis; China; Fujian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960560962

And also, the both of tantalaziridine-hydride were found to be able to react with CO2 to give bimetallic methlene diolates. In this paper, the mechanism of the tautomerism had been investigated theoretically by DFT. The results reveal that this reaction is accomplished by two steps via tridentateligand intermediate. This kind of intermediate can be considered as the activating reagent to activate the CH bond.

To investigate the validity of this claim, ambient measurements of PM2.5 and ozone were made in two rural locations in southern Australia between 2006 and 2008. In order to distinguish PM2.5 associated with smoke from other sources of particulate pollution, PM2.5 samples were analysed for specific smoke tracers, levoglucosan, non sea-salt potassium (nssK+) and oxalate. Monitoring was also undertaken in four homes to determine the extent to which ambient pollutants from prescribed burning penetrate indoors into houses. Monitoring clearly showed that, on occasions, air quality in rural areas is significantly affected by smoke from biomass combustion with PM2.5 showing the greatest impact. Concentrations of PM2.5 increased significantly above background levels at both sites during periods of wildfire and prescribed fire leading to exceedences of the 24-h PM2.5 Air National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM) Advisory standard. The 1-h and 4-h ozone NEPM standards were exceeded only during protracted forest wildfires. The impact of prescribed burning on the indoor air quality of residences depended on the duration of the smoke event and the ventilation rate of the houses. During short-duration events indoor air quality was determined by household activities. During events that persisted for several days, indoor air quality was determined by external conditions coupled with management of household ventilation rate. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Levoglucosan; Ozone; PM2.5; Prescribed burns; Wildfires","Ambient measurement; Australia; Background level; Biomass combustion; Biomass-burning; Environment protection; External conditions; Forest wildfires; Household activities; Indoor air quality; Levoglucosan; Particulate pollution; Prescribed burn; Prescribed burning; Prescribed fires; Rural community; Rural locations; Sea salts; Stubble burning; Ventilation rate; Wildfires; Biomass; Combustion; Fire protection; Fires; Indoor air pollution; Monitoring; Ozone; Pollution; Rural areas; Smoke; Ventilation; Air quality; levoglucosan; oxalic acid; ozone; potassium; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; environmental protection; indoor air; ozone; pollution monitoring; prescribed burning; rural population; smoke; stubble; ventilation; wildfire; air conditioning; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; Australia; biomass; combustion; concentration (parameters); correlation analysis; fire; gravimetry; house dust; particulate matter; photochemistry; priority journal; rural area; smoke; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959518032

Merely 45% of the consumed crops are produced domestically. Hence, the additional cultivation of rape for producing methyl ester is assumed to substitute crops used for food production. Consequently, Switzerland has to face the decision either to use the arable land for food production and import fuels or to produce fuel from rape and import the displaced food. Using Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA), the environmental consequences have been assessed if rape for energetic utilization substitutes rape used as edible oil or barley used as animal fodder. The study shows, that displacing food production by RME production in Switzerland can reduce total GHG emissions, when GHG-intense soy meal from Brazil is substituted by rape and sunflower meal, which is a co-product of the vegetable oil production. On the other hand, an increased production of vegetable oils increases various other environmental factors, because agricultural production of edible oil is associated with higher environmental impacts than the production and use of fossil fuels. In summary, the environmental impacts of an increased RME production in Switzerland rather depend on the environmental scores of the marginal replacement products on the world market, than on local production factors. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuels; Brassica napus; Consequential LCA; Energy crops; Indirect land use change","Agricultural productions; Animal fodder; Arable land; Brassica napus; Consequential LCA; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Edible oil; Energy crops; Environmental consequences; Environmental factors; Food production; GHG emission; Indirect land use change; Local production; Methyl esters; Soy meal; Sunflower meal; Switzerland; World market; Crops; Cultivation; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Land use; Life cycle; Lubricating oils; Rating; Vegetable oils; Environmental impact; agricultural production; arable land; barley; biofuel; cultivation; energy crop; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; fodder; food production; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; land use change; life cycle analysis; vegetable oil; Brazil; Switzerland; Animalia; Brassica napus; Helianthus; Hordeum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956347719

The aim of this study was to assess and map the carbon stocks in above (ABG), below-ground (BLG) biomass and soil organic carbon contained in the 30centimeter top-layer (SOC) in coppices of eucalyptus plantations in the central highlands of Madagascar in an area of 1590ha. Relationships between C stock and various biophysical (stool or shoot stockings and ages, circumferences) and spatial (elevation, slope, and soil type) factors that may affect C storage within each pool were investigated. Three different modeling techniques were tested and compared for various factor sets: (i) simple linear regression (SLM), (ii) multiple linear (MLM) models and, (iii) boosted regression tree (BRT) models. Weights of the factors in the respective model were analyzed for the three pool-specific models that produced the highest accuracy measurement. A regional spatial prediction of carbon stocks was performed using spatial layers derived from a digital elevation model, remote sensing imagery and expert knowledge. Results showed that BRT had the best predictive capacity for C stocks compared with the linear regression models. Elevation and slope were found to be the most relevant predictors for modeling C stock in each pool, and mainly for the SOC. A factor representing circumferences of stools and their stocking (stools.ha-1) largely influenced BLG. Shoot circumference at breast height and shoot age were the best factors for ABG fitting. Accuracy assessment carried out using coefficient of determination (R2) and ratio of standard deviation to prediction error (RPD) showed satisfactory results, with 0.74 and 1.95 for AGB, 0.85 and 2.59 for BLG, and 0.61 and 1.6 for SOC respectively. Application of the best fitted models with spatial explanatory factors allowed to map and estimate C contained within each pool: 32andplusmn;13Gg C for ABG, 67andplusmn;15Gg C for BLG and, 139andplusmn;36Gg C for SOC (1Gg=109g). A total of 238andplusmn;40Gg C was obtained for the entire study area by combining the three C maps. Despite their relatively low predictive quality, models and C maps produced herein provided relevant reference values of C storage under plantation ecosystems in Madagascar. This study contributed to the reducing of uncertainty related to C monitoring and baseline definition in managed terrestrial ecosystem. andcopy; 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Above-and below-ground biomass; Boosted regression tree; Eucalyptus robusta; Short rotation forestry; Soil organic carbon; Spatial variability","Boosted regression tree; Eucalyptus robusta; Ground biomass; Short rotation forestry; Soil organic carbon; Spatial variability; Biomass; Ecosystems; Forestry; Global warming; Lakes; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Rotation; Soils; Timber; Organic carbon; aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; carbon sequestration; dicotyledon; regression analysis; soil carbon; soil depth; soil organic matter; terrestrial ecosystem; upland region; Biomass; Ecology; Eucalyptus Robusta; Forestry; Lakes; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; Rotation; Madagascar; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus robusta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955475466

Accountability research, aimed at evaluating the effects of air quality regulation on health outcome, is increasingly viewed as an essential component of responsible government intervention. In this paper, we focused on assessing the impact of air quality regulations on ambient levels of air pollution. We considered two groups of counties: the first group (A) includes counties that in 1991 were designated as in attainment or unclassifiable with respect to the 1987 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and maintained their status through 2006; the second group (Ā), includes counties that in 1991 were designated as nonattainment and were subsequently redesignated as in attainment. We hypothesized that if air pollution control programs adopted to meet the NAAQS are effective in reducing air pollution levels, counties in group Ā will experience a sharper decrease in PM10 levels than counties in group A. To provide evidence to support this hypothesis, Bayesian hierarchical models were developed for estimating 1) the yearly percentage change in ambient PM10 levels for 100 counties and the entire USA during the period 1987-2007 and 2) the change in PM10 ambient levels in counties in group Ā compared with counties in group A. We found statistically significant evidence of variability across counties in trends of PM10 concentrations. We also found strong evidence that counties transitioning from nonattainment to attainment status during the period 1987-2007 experienced a sharper decline in PM10 when compared with counties that were always in attainment. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Accountability; Bayesian methods; Environmental epidemiology; Hierarchical models; National Ambient Air Quality Standards; Particulate matter","accountability; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; concentration (composition); epidemiology; governance approach; health impact; hypothesis testing; numerical model; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution exposure; public health; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955826229

However, the predictions for the direction and magnitude of these changes hinge critically on the assessment methods used. Many climate change impact analyses, including those focused on wind energy, use individual climate models and/or statistical downscaling methods rooted in historical observations. Such studies may individually suggest an unrealistically high level of scientific certainty due to the absence of competing projections (over the same region, time period, etc). A new public data archive, the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), allows for a more comprehensive perspective on regional climate change impacts, here applied to three wind farm sites in California. We employ NARCCAP regional climate model data to estimate changes in SWS expected to occur in the mid-21st century at three wind farm regions: Altamont Pass, San Gorgonio Pass, and Tehachapi Pass. We examined trends in SWS magnitude and frequency using three different global/regional model pairs, focused on model evaluation, seasonal cycle, and long-term trends. Our results, while specific to California, highlight the opportunities and limitations in NARCCAP and other publicly available meteorological data sets for energy analysis, and the importance of using multiple models for climate change impact assessment. Although spatial patterns in current wind conditions agree fairly well among models and with NARR (North American Regional Reanalysis) data, results vary widely at our three sites of interest. This poor performance and model disagreement may be explained by complex topography, limited model resolution, and differences in model physics. Spatial trends and site-specific estimates of annual average changes (1980-2000 versus 2051-71) also differed widely across models. All models predicted changes of < 2% at each site, but the direction of the change varies. However, decreases of < 2% in resources at Altamont Pass are agreed upon by each NARCCAP model used. This lack of model agreement suggests uncertainty in future changes, and a potentially high degree of risk for future investors in wind-generated electricity. More broadly, our study highlights the need for multiple calculation approaches to help distinguish between robust and method-dependent results. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.","California; climate change; NARCCAP; wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960327960

In this study, we evaluated the impacts of A. longifolia invasion on community structure, light climate, plant diversity and regeneration in pine forests and open stabilized dunes in northern and southern Portugal. Having the growth form of a small tree or shrub, between 1 and 8 m tall, A. longifolia tended to dominate the middle stratum of forests and to share dominance in the upper stratum of open dunes. The presence of A. longifolia was associated with a decreased canopy cover in the lower stratum of all studied habitats, and at some sites with a significantly increased leaf area index and reduced light intensity in the understory. Species number and diversity were reduced in some habitats by up to 50% in invaded compared to non-invaded areas. Furthermore, in forest habitats, A. longifolia seedlings were facilitated by proximity to an adult A. longifolia while the establishment and growth of native seedlings was negatively impacted. The replacement of drought tolerant native species by the water spending invader, A. longifolia, may have serious implications for ecosystem functioning, especially during the prolonged drought periods predicted to occur in Portugal in the future. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acacia; Community structure; Mediterranean dune ecosystem; Plant diversity; Plant invasion","biological invasion; community structure; coniferous forest; dicotyledon; drought resistance; dune; ecosystem function; light effect; Mediterranean environment; regeneration; seedling; species diversity; vegetation structure; Portugal; Acacia; Acacia longifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955004708

The first is the classical net emission coefficient largely used in arc modelling. The second one is based on a very simplified spectral description with only seven intervals assuming a grey body condition within each interval and using the Planck and the Rosseland averaging for deducing the mean absorption coefficient (MAC). At high temperature the use of the Rosseland averaging is not satisfactory. The other two approximated methods (net emission and the Planck averaging) are acceptable but the radiative flux is in general not very accurate. The radiative transfer calculation can be improved following three ways: a better knowledge of the basic processes and in particular of the absorption coefficients for diatomic and polyatomic molecules, the use of different definitions of MACs (Planck averaging at high temperature and mean natural value at low temperature) and a careful choice of the spectral intervals. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Absorption coefficients; Exact calculations; Grey body; High temperature; Local thermodynamic equilibrium; Low temperatures; Mean absorption; Net emission coefficients; Polyatomic molecules; Radiative fluxes; Radiative transfer calculations; Temperature profiles; Temperature values; Thermal plasma; Absorption; Radiative transfer; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955450015

In this respect, there is a growing need to integrate renewable (or green) energy sources in the grid. However, the intermittency of these energy sources requires that demand must also be made more responsive to changes in supply, and a number of smart grid technologies are being developed, such as highcapacity batteries and smart meters for the home, to enable consumers to be more responsive to conditions on the grid in real time. Traditional solutions based on these technologies, however, tend to ignore the fact that individual consumers will behave in such a way that best satisfies their own preferences to use or store energy (as opposed to that of the supplier or the grid operator). Hence, in practice, it is unclear how these solutions will cope with large numbers of consumers using their devices in this way. Against this background, in this article, we develop novel control mechanisms based on the use of autonomous agents to better incorporate consumer preferences in managing demand. These agents, residing on consumers' smart meters, can both communicate with the grid and optimize their owner's energy consumption to satisfy their preferences. More specifically, we provide a novel control mechanism that models and controls a system comprising of a green energy supplier operating within the grid and a number of individual homes (each possibly owning a storage device). This control mechanism is based on the concept of homeostasis whereby control signals are sent to individual components of a system, based on their continuous feedback, in order to change their state so that the system may reach a stable equilibrium. Thus, we define a new carbon-based pricing mechanism for this green energy supplier that takes advantage of carbon-intensity signals available on the Internet in order to provide real-time pricing. The pricing scheme is designed in such a way that it can be readily implemented using existing communication technologies and is easily understandable by consumers. Building upon this, we develop new control signals that the supplier can use to incentivize agents to shift demand (using their storage device) to times when green energy is available. Moreover, we show how these signals can be adapted according to changes in supply and to various degrees of penetration of storage in the system.We empirically evaluate our system and show that, when all homes are equipped with storage devices, the supplier can significantly reduce its reliance on other carbon-emitting power sources to cater for its own shortfalls. By so doing, the supplier reduces the carbon emission of the system by up to 25% while the consumer reduces its costs by up to 14.5%. Finally, we demonstrate that our homeostatic control mechanism is not sensitive to small prediction errors and the supplier is incentivized to accurately predict its green production to minimize costs. © 2011 ACM.","Agentbased control; Agents; Computational sustainability; Electricity; Multiagent systems","Adverse effect; Agent based; Agent-based control; Carbon emissions; Carbon-based; Communication technologies; Computational sustainability; Consumer preferences; Control mechanism; Control signal; Electricity grids; Energy source; Global energy; Green energy; Green energy suppliers; Green production; Grid operators; High-capacity; Homeostatic control; Individual components; Intermittency; Non-renewable energy; Power sources; Prediction errors; Pricing mechanism; Pricing scheme; Real time; Real time pricing; Smart grid; Smart meters; Stable equilibrium; Alternative fuels; Autonomous agents; Climate change; Climate control; Costs; Energy utilization; Grid computing; Multi agent systems; State feedback; Virtual storage; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960812405

Reliable and cost-effective systems to measure near-surface black carbon (BC) mass concentrations (hereafter denoted as [BC]) globally are necessary to validate air pollution and climate models and to evaluate the effectiveness of BC mitigation actions. Toward this goal we describe a new wireless, low-cost, ultra low-power, BC cellphone based monitoring system (BC_CBM). BC_CBM integrates a Miniaturized Aerosol filter Sampler (MAS) with a cellphone for filter image collection, transmission and image analysis for determining [BC] in real time. The BC aerosols in the air accumulate on the MAS quartz filter, resulting in a coloration of the filter. A photograph of the filter is captured by the cellphone camera and transmitted by the cellphone to the analytics component of BC_CBM. The analytics component compares the image with a calibrated reference scale (also included in the photograph) to estimate [BC]. We demonstrate with field data collected from vastly differing environments, ranging from southern California to rural regions in the Indo-Gangetic plains of Northern India, that the total BC deposited on the filter is directly and uniquely related to the reflectance of the filter in the red wavelength, irrespective of its source or how the particles were deposited. [BC] varied from 0.1 to 1μgm-3 in Southern California and from 10 to 200μgm-3 in rural India in our field studies. In spite of the 3 orders of magnitude variation in [BC], the BC_CBM system was able to determine the [BC] well within the experimental error of two independent reference instruments for both indoor air and outdoor ambient air.Accurate, global-scale measurements of [BC] in urban and remote rural locations, enabled by the wireless, low-cost, ultra low-power operation of BC_CBM, will make it possible to better capture the large spatial and temporal variations in [BC], informing climate science, health, and policy. © 2011.","Black carbon monitoring; Cellphone sensing; Soot sensor","Aerosol filters; Black carbon; Black carbon aerosol; Black carbon monitoring; Cell phone; Cell phone camera; Climate science; Experimental errors; Field data; Field studies; Filter images; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Indoor air; Large-scale monitoring; Low Power; Low-power operation; Mass concentration; Monitoring system; Near-surface; Orders of magnitude; Quartz filters; Real time; Reference instruments; Regional climate changes; Rural locations; Rural regions; Southern California; Spatial and temporal variation; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Climate change; Climate models; Fog; Monitoring; Photography; Quartz; Rural areas; Soot; Telephone; Telephone sets; Air filters; black carbon; aerosol; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; climate modeling; data set; filter; image analysis; indoor air; mass transfer; mobile communication; model validation; photograph; pollution monitoring; real time; rural area; sensor; temporal variation; ambient air; article; calibration; cellphone based monitoring system; concentration (parameters); controlled study; electronics; filter; image analysis; image processing; India; miniature aerosol filter sampler; mobile phone; photography; pollution monitoring; priority journal; telecommunication; United States; California; Gangetic Plain; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953833887

Data analysis reveals that nearly 58% of the geographical area potentially represent the solar hotspots in the country with more than 5 kWh/m2/day of annual average Global insolation. A techno-economic analysis of the solar power technologies and a prospective minimal utilization of the land available within these solar hotspots demonstrate their immense power generation as well as emission reduction potential. The study evaluates the progress made in solar power generation in the country especially with the inception of an ambitious National Solar Mission (NSM) also termed as 'Solar India'.

One dimensional gas dynamics was described by the flow and heat transfer in the components of the engine model. The engine model is simulated with variable engine speed and equivalence ratio (φ). Engine speed varied from 2000 to 5000 rpm with increment of 1000 rpm, while equivalence ratio changed from stoichiometric to lean limit. The effects of equivalence ratio and engine speed on heat transfer characteristics for the intake port are presented in this paper. The baseline engine model is verified with existing previous published results. Comparison between hydrogen and methane fuel was made. The obtained results show that the engine speed has the same effect on the heat transfer coefficient for hydrogen and methane fuel, while equivalence ratio has effect on heat transfer coefficient in case of hydrogen fuel only. Rate of increase in heat transfer coefficient comparison with stoichiometric case for hydrogen fuel are: 4% for (φ = 0.6) and 8% for (φ = 0.2). While negligible effect was found in case of methane fuel with change of equivalence ratio. But methane is given greater values about 11% for all engine speed values compare with hydrogen fuel under stoichiometric condition.

The purpose of this study is to examine long-term wind speed variability using seasonal and annual wind speed data at 32 Iranian synoptic stations from 1960 to 2005 to assess if wind power is a plausible source of renewable energy for Iran. Least-square regression methods and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to determine the trends and decadal changes in wind speed. Esfehan province was selected for assessment of the impacts on wind power potential owing to its progressive and forward thinking in exploration of renewable energy. Wind power potential was estimated by fitting a hybrid of the Weibull distribution to the 3 hourly wind data. This assessment revealed a declining trend in annual wind speeds in the central part of Iran and an increasing trend near the Iranian borders during the study period. The patterns on seasonal and annual scales were generally similar. The results indicated a similar pattern of wind power variation for stations in Esfehan province, except Ardestan. The monthly wind power potential from November to January and from February to May may be representative of the low and high periods of wind energy, respectively. Consequently, despite the existence of wind speed variability and general declining trends across Esfehan province, wind energy may be explored further over the coming years by employing modern wind turbines that require lower start-up speeds. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Esfehan; Iran; Variability; Weibull; Wind energy","Fossil fuels; Least squares approximations; Regression analysis; Speed; Weibull distribution; Wind; Wind power; Esfehan; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Iran; Kruskal-Wallis tests; Least square regression method; Variability; Weibull; Wind power variations; Climate change; alternative energy; climate change; fossil fuel; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; long-term change; regression analysis; wind power; wind velocity; Esfahan [Iran]; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956303048

The main aims of the study were to demonstrate how a cumulative risk assessment for a middle-sized European city can be performed and to identify the bottlenecks in terms of data availability and knowledge gaps. The assessment focused on five air pollutants (i.e., PM10, benzene, toluene, nonane and naphthalene) and six food pesticides (i.e., acetamiprid, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, imidacloprid and permethrin). Exposure predictions showed that PM10, benzene and naphthalene exposure frequently exceeded the standards, and that the indoor environment contributed more than the outdoor environment. Effect predictions showed that mixture and interaction effects were generally limited. However, model calculations indicated potential synergistic effects between naphthalene and benzene and between chlorpyrifos, diazinon and toluene. PM10 dominated the health impact expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). We conclude that measures to reduce the health impact of environmental pollution should focus on the improvement of indoor air quality and the reduction of PM10 emissions. Cumulative risk assessment can be improved by (1) the development of person-oriented exposure models that can simulate the cumulative exposure history of individuals, (2) a better mechanistic understanding of the effects of cumulative stressors, and (3) the development of instruments to prioritize stressors for inclusion in cumulative risk assessments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","DALY; Effect assessment; Exposure assessment; Hazard index; Multiple stress; Risk assessment","Air quality; Benzene; Chemical contamination; Environmental impact; Indoor air pollution; Naphthalene; Pollution; Toluene; Urban planning; DALY; Effect assessments; Exposure assessment; Hazard indices; Multiple stress; Risk assessment; acetamiprid; benzene; carbendazim; chlorpyrifos; dimpylate; imidacloprid; naphthalene; nonane; permethrin; pesticide; toluene; unclassified drug; air quality; atmospheric pollution; chemical pollutant; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; risk assessment; adult; aged; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; chemical interaction; child; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental impact; Europe; exhaust gas; health hazard; human; infant; particulate matter; preschool child; priority journal; risk assessment; urban area; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955575777

The evolving reality of climate change policy development, in the U.S. and abroad, relies heavily on sub-national initiative. This article reviews the American climate policy odyssey, examining distinct periods in which respective intergovernmental roles have shifted. It devotes particular attention to the substantial expansion of state involvement between 1998 and 2007 and the more recent experience in which high state and federal engagement has produced a period of contested federalism. It concludes by exploring the growing likelihood that this arena will continue to be dominated in coming years by either state policy or some blending of state and federal authority. © TheAuthor 2011.

Potential atmospheric emissions of fumigants from field treatment, however, have drawn intensive environmental and human health concerns; increasingly stringent regulations on fumigant use have spurred research on low-emission application techniques. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of a new low-permeability film, commonly known as totally impermeable film (TIF), on fumigant emissions and on fumigant distribution in soil. A 50/50 mixture of 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and chloropicrin (CP) was shank-applied at 314 kg ha -1 in two location-separate field plots (0.4 ha each) in Ventura County, California, in fall 2009. One plot was surface-covered with standard polyethylene (PE) film, and the other was covered with TIF immediately after fumigant application. Data collection included emissions, soilgas phase concentration profile, air concentration under the film, and soil residuals of the applied fumigants. Peak emission flux of 1,3-D and CP from the TIF field was substantially lower than from the PE field. Total through-film emission loss was 2% for 1,3-D and &lt;1% for CP from the TIF field during a 6-d film covering period, compared with 43% for 1,3-D and 12% for CP from the PE field. However, on film-cutting, greater retention of 1,3-D in the TIF field resulted in a much higher emission surge compared with the PE field, while CP emissions were fairly low in both fields. Higher concentrations and a more uniform distribution in the soil profile for 1,3-D and CP were observed under the TIF compared with the PE film, suggesting that the TIF may allow growers to achieve satisfactory pest control with lower fumigant rates. Th e surging 1,3-D emissions after film-cutting could result in high exposure risks to workers and by standers and must be addressed with additional mitigation measures. © 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"1 ,3-Dichloropropene; Air concentrations; Atmospheric emission; California; Data collection; Field evaluation; Field plot; Field treatments; Fumigant emission; High exposures; Human health concerns; Low permeability; Mitigation measures; PE films; Peak emissions; Pest management practices; Phase concentration; Preplant soil fumigation; Soil gas; Soil profiles; Strawberry production; Stringent regulations; Uniform distribution; Fumigation; Health risks; Insect control; Occupational risks; Pesticides; Protective coatings; Soils; Soil pollution; 1,3 dichloropropene; chloropicrin; fumigant; polyethylene; propylene; unclassified drug; air sampling; article; chemical pest control; concentration (parameters); environmental exposure; film; gas; soil fumigation; soil pollution; totally impermeable fi lm; United States; vapor; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Allyl Compounds; California; Fragaria; Fumigation; Gases; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Pesticides; Plastics; Soil Pollutants; Fragaria vesca californica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960708991

This paper discusses two analytical approaches to this challenge used to inform funding decisions related to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) applied energy R&D portfolio. The two approaches are distinguished by the constraints under which they were conducted: the need to provide an end-to-end portfolio analysis as input to internal DOE budgeting processes, but with limited time and subject to institutional constraints regarding important issues such as expert judgment. Because of these constraints, neither approach should be viewed as an attempt to push forward the state of the art in portfolio analysis in the abstract. Instead, they are an attempt to use more stylized, heuristic methods that can provide first-order insights in the DOE institutional context. Both approaches make use of advanced technology scenarios implemented in an integrated assessment modeling framework and then apply expert judgment regarding the likelihood of achieving associated R&D and commercialization goals. The approaches differ in the granularity of the scenarios used and in the definition of the benefits of technological advance: in one approach the benefits are defined as the cumulative emission reduction attributable to a particular technology; in the other approach benefits are defined as the cumulative cost reduction. In both approaches a return on investment (ROI) criterion is established based on benefits divided by federal R&D investment. The ROI is then used to build a first-order approximation of an optimal applied energy R&D investment portfolio. Although these methodologies have been used to inform an actual budget request, the results reflect only one input among many used in budget formulation. The results are therefore not representative of an official U.S. government or DOE funding recommendation but should instead be considered illustrative of the way in which methodologies such as these could be applied. © 2010.","Climate change; Energy technology; Portfolio analysis; R&D","Advanced technology; Analytical approach; Budget requests; Budgeting process; Climate change mitigation; Cumulative cost; Emission reduction; Energy technologies; Expert judgment; First-order; First-order approximations; Institutional constraints; Integrated assessment; Investment portfolio; Modeling frameworks; Policy makers; Portfolio analysis; Public funds; Return on investments; State of the art; Technological advances; U.S. Department of Energy; Budget control; Cost reduction; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Profitability; Technology; Investments; assessment method; carbon emission; climate change; energy planning; energy policy; greenhouse gas; heuristics; investment; numerical model; policy making; research and development; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956318981

Despite their scarcity, carbonates along with organic matter provide significant paleoenvironmental information about lake systems. This study focuses on the carbonates in Lake Chungará, their morphologies, distribution and origin deduced from the isotopic markers. These markers reflected changes in the water and the biomass between the onset of the Holocene and around 9.6cal kyr BP. These changes are marked by general increases in TOC, TN, and TN-δ15NAIR, and by fluctuating values of TOC-δ13CVPDB in its sediments and are probably related to major shifts in the lake surface/volume associated with rises in lake level. An increase in salinity around 10cal kyr BP is thought to be linked to a short dry period, giving rise to the onset of carbonate production. The mid-Holocene arid period between 7.3 and 3.5calka BP, with a maximum of aridity around 6.0cal kyr BP, was deduced from δ18OVPDB values in the endogenic carbonates. These results match the reconstructions in Lake Titicaca based on benthic diatoms and paleoshore levels.Offshore sediments mainly consist of a diatomaceous ooze, laminated in the lower half (Unit 1), and banded-massive with tephra layers in the upper half of the sequence (Unit 2). TOC-δ13CVPDB and the C/N ratio confirm that phytoplankton was the main source of organic matter in these sediments. Shallower sediments (units 3 to 5) developed in platform and littoral settings, providing evidence of subaqueous macrophytes and, to a lesser extent, land plants. Carbonate content ranges between 0.1 and 6wt.% in offshore settings (30 to 40m water depth) and reaches the maximum values in the lower part of Unit 2. Carbonate minerals (low magnesium calcite and minor amounts of high magnesium calcite and aragonite) are scarce and are arranged in mm-thick layers, commonly forming cm-thick levels or bioclasts. Carbonate layers are made up of euhedral-to-subhedral spindle-shaped calcite crystals and, to a lesser extent, aragonite needles, all in the μm range. Aragonite spheroids coexist in littoral sediments with other carbonate shapes and charophyte remains, where carbonate reaches locally up to 20wt.%. CO2 photosynthetic depletions related to seasonal phytoplankton blooms were responsible for the high frequency deposition of mm-thick carbonate layers.The average values for δ13CVPDB in lake water, plankton and sediments of Lake Chungará (as organic matter or as carbonate) are around 15‰ higher than commonly reported values in other lakes. This 13C enrichment is attributed to carbon assimilation from a DIC affected by methanogenesis, in which HCO3- is the dominant species. The δ13CVPDB and δ18OVPDB variations and their covariation in endogenic carbonates suggest that lake water volume and lake level increased along the Holocene. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Andean Altiplano; Carbonate precipitation; DIC speciation; Holocene record; Methanogenesis; Paleoenvironmental changes","aridity; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; carbonate; functional morphology; genetic marker; Holocene; isotopic analysis; lacustrine deposit; macrophyte; magnesium; methanogenesis; mineral; organic matter; oxygen isotope; paleoenvironment; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; precipitation (chemistry); reconstruction; sediment chemistry; sedimentation; volume; Arica and Parinacota; Chile; Chungara Lake; algae; Bacillariophyta; Charales; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960420655

Simultaneously, the road-space has been narrowed by about a third. A survey of 1000 users of the tramway shows that the tramway hardly generated any shift from private cars towards public transit mode. However, it did generate important intra-mode transfers: from bus and subway towards tramway, and from Maréchaux boulevards towards the Périphérique (the Paris ring road) for cars. The various benefits and costs of these changes are evaluated. The welfare gains made by public transport users are more than compensated by the time losses of the motorists, and in particular, by the additional cost of road congestion on the Périphérique. The same conclusion applies with regard to CO2 emissions: the reductions caused by the replacement of buses and the elimination of a few cars trips are less important than the increased pollution caused by the lengthening of the automobile trips and increased congestion on the ring road. Even if one ignores the initial investment of 350M€, the social impact of the project, as measured by its net present value is negative. This is especially true for suburbanites. The inhabitants (and electors) of Paris pocket the main part of the benefits while supporting a fraction of the costs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 emissions; Costs-benefits analysis; Road congestion; Tramway","bus transport; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; public transport; railway transport; traffic congestion; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955745063

This process provides a novel way to search for Galactic dark matter with gamma rays. We argue that for a generic weakly interacting massive particle, barring effects such as co-annihilation or a velocity-dependent cross section, the gamma-ray emission from cosmic-ray scattering off of dark matter is typically smaller than that from dark matter pair-annihilation. However, if dark matter particles cannot pair-annihilate, as is the case for example in asymmetric dark matter scenarios, cosmic-ray scattering with final state photon emission provides a unique window to detect a signal from dark matter with gamma rays. We estimate the expected flux level and its spectral features for a generic supersymmetric setup, and we also discuss dipolar and luminous dark matter.

In this study the basic resource for most climate change impact investigations worldwide, the CMIP3 multi-model dataset, is analyzed with respect to performance under present climate, climate change, uncertainty, and the major sources of uncertainty over Europe. Eight near surface and upper air parameters are considered over two domains centered over central Europe for the mid and end of the 21th century. The performance analysis of the GCMs showed that it is crucial to regard upper air parameters in model rating and that evaluating just near surface parameters can lead to overoptimistic assessment of model performance. Regarding climate change, air temperature, geopotential height, and specific humidity are consistently projected to increase by all CMIP3 simulations. Eastward wind is projected to increase by most simulations, while for pressure, precipitation, and northward wind, the sign of change is inconsistent between the simulations and varies with season. The dominating source of uncertainty is the model uncertainty which roughly contributes between 50 % and 85 % to total uncertainty. Internal variability of the climate system accounts for 10 % to 20 % (in 30-year averages), while emission scenario uncertainty is nearly negligible until 2050 and becomes important only for temperature, specific humidity, and geopotential height at the end of the 21th century (up to 35 %). Uncertainties are generally larger on the smaller of the two domains, but the relative contributions of the uncertainty components as well as the annual cycle of the climate change are similar in both domains. The results indicate that studies focusing on downscaling, regional climate change, and regional climate change impacts should be based on a carefully selected set of GCMs in order to avoid undersampling uncertainty.

The studies contrasted various thinning intensities (red pine) or selection cuttings, shelterwoods, and diameter-limit cuttings (northern hardwoods) to unmanaged controls of similar ages, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate long-term management impacts on carbon pools in two major North American forest types. Management resulted in total ecosystem carbon pools of 130-137Mgha-1 in thinned red pine and 96-177Mgha-1 in managed northern hardwoods compared to 195Mgha-1 in unmanaged red pine and 224Mgha-1 in unmanaged northern hardwoods. Managed stands had smaller tree and deadwood pools than unmanaged stands in both ecosystems, but management had limited impacts on understory, forest floor, and soil carbon pools. Total carbon storage and storage in individual pools varied little across thinning intensities in red pine. In northern hardwoods, selection cuttings stored more carbon than the diameter-limit treatment, and selection cuttings generally had larger tree carbon pools than the shelterwood or diameter-limit treatments. The proportion of total ecosystem carbon stored in mineral soil tended to increase with increasing treatment intensity in both ecosystems, while the proportion of total ecosystem carbon stored in the tree layer typically decreased with increasing treatment intensity. When carbon storage in harvested wood products was added to total ecosystem carbon, selection cuttings and unmanaged stands stored similar levels of carbon in northern hardwoods, but carbon storage in unmanaged stands was higher than that of thinned stands for red pine even after adding harvested wood product carbon to total ecosystem carbon. Our results indicate long-term management decreased on-site carbon storage in red pine and northern hardwood ecosystems, but thinning intensity had little impact on carbon storage in red pine while increasing management intensity greatly reduced carbon storage in northern hardwoods. These findings suggest thinning to produce different stand structures would have limited impacts on carbon storage in red pine, but selection cuttings likely offer the best carbon management options in northern hardwoods. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon storage; Long-term studies; Northern hardwoods; Red pine; Silviculture","Carbon storage; Long-term studies; Northern hardwoods; Red pine; Silviculture; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Lakes; Management; Plant extracts; Wood products; Forestry; carbon sequestration; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; diameter; forest ecosystem; forest floor; forest management; management practice; silviculture; soil carbon; thinning; understory; Carbon; Ecosystems; Extractives; Forestry; Hardwoods; Lakes; Plants; Storage; Wood Products; Great Lakes [North America]; Pinus resinosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958076323

EJ analyses address the hypothesis that environmental disamenities are experienced disproportionately by poor and/or minority subgroups. Such analyses typically use communities as the unit of analysis. While community-based approaches make sense when considering where polluting sources locate, they are less appropriate for national air quality rules affecting many sources and pollutants that can travel thousands of miles. We compare exposures and health risks of EJ-identified individuals rather than communities to analyze EPA's Heavy Duty Diesel (HDD) rule as an example national air quality rule. Air pollutant exposures are estimated within grid cells by air quality models; all individuals in the same grid cell are assigned the same exposure. Using an inequality index, we find that inequality within racial/ethnic subgroups far outweighs inequality between them. We find, moreover, that the HDD rule leaves between-subgroup inequality essentially unchanged. Changes in health risks depend also on subgroups' baseline incidence rates, which differ across subgroups. Thus, health risk reductions may not follow the same pattern as reductions in exposure. These results are likely representative of other national air quality rules as well. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Air quality regulation; Distributional analysis; Environmental justice; Health benefits","diesel fuel; African American; air pollutant; air quality; ambient air; American Indian; article; Asian American; Caucasian; concentration (parameters); distributional benefit analysis; environmental exposure; environmental justice; ethnic difference; geostatistical analysis; health hazard; Hispanic; incidence; legal aspect; mortality; pollutant concentration; population distribution; risk reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959842542

The model also tracks C equivalent (CE) emissions from fertilizer, fuel, and agricultural chemical use. Using Arkansas as an example, a model that maximizes crop returns to producers in conjunction with C offset payments allowed estimation of probable changes in county-level cropping patterns and income as a result of varying C prices. While income ramifications of a C-offset climate change policy are positive, significant uncertainty about resultant greenhouse gas (GHG) effects are demonstrated.

Diet composition and lipid supplementation are known to influence the extent of methane (CH4) production in ruminants. However, the impact of diet composition on rumen methanogens is poorly understood. This study examined CH4 production and methanogen community abundance, diversity and metabolic activity in the rumen of fattening bulls fed a fibrous diet (F; n=10) or a starch rich diet supplemented with extruded linseed (SL; n=10). Net CH4 emissions from bulls fed SL were lower than emissions from bulls fed F. Methanogenic Archaea were studied using culture independent methods targeting the functional mcrA gene. Methanogen abundance was similar in the two groups of bulls, but protozoa numbers were 65% lower in the F group. The SL diet decreased methanogen diversity and metabolic activity, which were evaluated by PCR-DGGE and reverse transcriptase qPCR, respectively. In contrast, no changes occurred in bacterial numbers and diversity between diets. Data indicate that reduction in net CH4 production with the SL diet was associated with changes in rumen microbiota, particularly methanogen activity. Characterization of the activity and structure of the whole rumen microbiota should provide a better prediction of methanogenesis.This paper is part of the special issue entitled: Greenhouse Gases in Animal Agriculture - Finding a Balance between Food and Emissions, Guest Edited by T.A.

Previous studies of idealized, large-scale deforestation found that albedo cooling dominates over CO 2 warming in boreal regions, indicating that boreal reforestation is not an effective mitigation tool. Here we show the importance of past land use decisions in influencing the mitigation potential of reforestation on these lands. In our simulations, CO2 warming dominates over albedo cooling because past land use decisions resulted in the use of the most productive land with larger carbon stocks and less snow than on average. As a result past land use decisions extended CO2 dominance to most agriculturally important regions in the world, suggesting that in most places reversion of past land cover change could contribute to climate change mitigation. While the relative magnitude of CO2 and albedo effects remains uncertain, the historical land use pattern is found to be biased towards stronger CO2 and weaker albedo effects as compared to idealized large-scale deforestation.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the extant literature as the foundation to develop a conceptual model of the decisions pertaining to climate change regulation that face business executives today. Findings: This paper suggests four major categories of issues that must be addressed in any climate change regulatory scheme. These include: ""scope"" - will carbon emission management systems be global or regional; ""who pays"" - will the consumer or will the supply chain be responsible for the cost of their emissions; ""market or compliance-based mechanisms"" - will the CO<DN>2</DN> emissions system be market-based or a compliance-based regulatory system; and ""criteria"" - how can credence of the remedy be established - what is necessary for a business initiative to qualify for as a creditable carbon offset? Research limitations/implications: This paper offers a framework that categories the fundamental decisions that must be made in any climate change regulation. This framework may be useful in advancing research into any of the four categories of decisions and their implications on commerce and the environment. This paper is designed to be managerially useful and in that way does limit its ability to specifically advance many dimensions of research. Practical implications: The paper offers executives for a simple model of the decisions that must be made to craft an effective climate change regulatory scheme. In addition, it suggests how these decisions may create exploitable economic opportunities for innovative and proactive firms.

Increased CO2 also may alter element levels in biomass from multi-species vegetation by changing plant species abundances. We measured concentrations of ten elements in aboveground tissues of three C4 grasses that had been exposed for 2-3 growing seasons to a continuous gradient in CO2 from 250 to 500 μmol mol-1. The grasses, Bouteloua curtipendula, Schizachyrium scoparium, and Sorghastrum nutans, are competitive dominants in assemblages of tallgrass prairie vegetation growing on each of three soil types along a field CO2 gradient in central Texas, USA. Our objective was to determine whether CO2 influences element concentrations in grass mixtures by changing concentrations in individual species or shifting species abundances. Increased CO2 had little effect on element concentrations in grasses compared to differences observed among grass species and soils. Increasing CO2 from the pre-Industrial to elevated levels reduced the phosphorus concentration in grasses grown on a clay and sandy loam soil. Concentrations of most other elements did not respond to CO2 treatment. Cover of the mid-grass Bouteloua declined at higher CO2 levels as cover of the taller grass Sorghastrum increased. Concentrations of several elements were lower in Bouteloua than Sorghastrum; hence, this exchange of species at higher CO2 increased element concentrations in grass assemblages. Potential consequences include an improvement in the nutritional quality of plants for herbivores. Results highlight the underappreciated impact that CO2 enrichment may have on ecosystem functioning by changing plant composition. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.(Outside the USA).","Bouteloua curtipendula; C4 grasses; Soil type; Sorghastrum nutans; Subambient CO2 concentration; Tallgrass prairie","aboveground biomass; abundance; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); ecosystem function; grass; growing season; growth rate; herbivore; nutrient uptake; nutritive value; phosphorus; prairie; soil type; Texas; United States; Bouteloua; Bouteloua curtipendula; Poaceae; Schizachyrium scoparium; Sorghastrum; Sorghastrum nutans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956127894

Unlike many countries, which approach the development of policies for geologic storage (GS) of carbon dioxide (CO2) with nearly a blank slate, the U.S. already has a mature policy regime devoted to the injection of CO2 into deep geologic formations. However, the existing governance of CO2 injection is designed to manage enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and policy changes would be needed to manage the risks and benefits of CO2 injection for the purpose of avoiding GHG emissions. We review GS policy developments at both the U.S. federal and state levels, including original research on state GS policy development. By applying advocacy coalition framework theory, we identify two competing coalitions defined by their beliefs about the primary purpose of CO2 injection: energy supply or greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. The established energy coalition is the beneficiary of the current policy regime. Their vision of GS policy is protective: to minimize harm to fossil energy industries if climate policy were to be enacted. In contrast, the newly formed climate coalition seeks to change existing GS policy to support their proactive vision: to maximize GHG reductions using CCS when climate policy is enacted. We explore where and at what scale legislation emerges and examine which institutions gain prominence as drivers of policy change. Through a detailed textual analysis of the content of state GS legislation, we find that the energy coalition has had greater success than the climate coalition in shaping state laws to align with its policy preferences. It has enshrined its view of the purpose of CO2 injection in state legislation, delegated authority for GS to state agencies aligned with the existing policy regime, and protected the EOR status quo, while creating new opportunities for EOR operators to profit from the storage of CO2 The climate coalition's objective of proactively putting GS policy in place has been furthered, and important progress has been made on commonly held concerns, such as the resolution of property rights issues, but the net result is policy change that does not significantly revise the existing policy regime. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Advocacy coalition framework; CCS; EOR; Geologic storage; State policy","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; development strategy; enhanced oil recovery; environmental legislation; environmental policy; fossil fuel; governance approach; greenhouse gas; policy reform; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956273724

Taking a logical and didactic approach, the author introduces the reader to the underlying concepts and principles of the thermal, lighting, and acoustic determinants of building design in four integrated sections. The first section explores the thermal building environment and the principles of thermal comfort, translating these principles into conceptual building design solutions. The author examines the heat flow characteristics of the building envelope and explains steady state design methods that form the basis of most building codes. He discusses the sun as a natural heat source and describes the principles of active and passive solar building design solutions. The second section introduces the scientific principles of light, color, and vision, stressing the importance of daylight in building design, presenting the Daylight Factor design concept and methodology, and discussing glare conditions and their avoidance. It also addresses artificial lighting, delving into the prominent role that electricity plays in the production of light by artificial means and comparing the efficacy and characteristics of the various commercially available light sources in terms of the energy to light conversion ratio, life span, available intensity range, color rendition properties, and cost. The third section deals with the various aspects of sound that impact the design of the built environment, discussing the nature of sound as a physical force that sets any medium through which it travels into vibration and laying the foundations for the treatment of sound as an important means of communication as well as a disruptive disturbance. The final section discusses the foundational concepts of ecological design as a basis for addressing sustainability issues in building design solutions. These issues include the embedded energy of construction materials, waste management, preservation of freshwater and management of graywater, adoption of passive solar principles, energy saving measures applicable to mechanical building services, and the end-of-lifecycle deconstruction and recycling of building materials and components. • Covers the fundamental building science topics of heat, energy, light and sound • Takes a logical and didactic approach, tracing the historical roots of building science • Includes summaries of new technologies in solar energy and photovoltaic systems • Features a section on the principles of sustainable architecture • Website with answers to MC questions testing students' learning. © 2011 John Wiley Ltd.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882178231

To this end, the authors used time series for the period 1965- 2007 over which a set of tests were realized: a test to verify the presence of a unit root in the series, cointegration test and causality test. Thus, the Augmented Dickey Fuller test was used to see whether or not the series are stationary, Engle-Granger method to study cointegration (indicating the relationships formed on long term) and Granger test to determine short run relationships and their direction. The results tell us that there is not even a bidirectional relationship between real GDP and energy consumption by fuel in per capita toe values, but that there are one-way causal relationships. Between economic growth and consumption of energy from hydropower, there is a relation established only on long run; this result influences in choosing other renewable energy sources too for consumption, if they can sustain economic growth and the overall energy consumption needs. In the same time, renewable energy may contribute together with sustainable transport to sustainable urban planning. For cities to become along with poles of growth, urban ecosystems, it is necessary to reduce the effects of climate changes. One way to rethink the urban structure and planning is to take into account renewables for these areas hungry for energy.","Cointegration; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Granger causality; Urban development","climate effect; economic growth; energy use; Granger causality test; Gross Domestic Product; hydroelectric power; renewable resource; sustainable development; time series; urban area; urban development; urban ecosystem; urban planning; Romania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857695035

We have investigated the absorption and metabolism of these secoiridoids in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Both 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA were relatively stable under gastric conditions, only undergoing limited hydrolysis. Both secoiridoids were transferred across a human cellular model of the small intestine (Caco-2 cells). However, no glucuronide conjugation was observed for either secoiridoid during transfer, although some hydroxytyrosol and homovanillic alcohol were formed. As Caco-2 cells are known to express only limited metabolic activity, we also investigated the absorption and metabolism of secoiridoids in isolated, perfused segments of the jejunum and ileum. Here, both secoiridoids underwent extensive metabolism, most notably a two-electron reduction and glucuronidation during the transfer across both the ileum and jejunum. Unlike Caco-2 cells, the intact small-intestinal segments contain NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductases, which reduce the aldehyde carbonyl group of 3,4-DHPEA-EA and one of the two aldeydic carbonyl groups present on 3,4-DHPEA-EDA. These reduced forms are then glucuronidated and represent the major in vivo small-intestinal metabolites of the secoiridoids. In agreement with the cell studies, perfusion of the jejunum and ileum also yielded hydroxytyrosol and homovanillic alcohol and their respective glucuronides. We suggest that the reduced and glucuronidated forms represent novel physiological metabolites of the secoiridoids that should be pursued in vivo and investigated for their biological activity. © 2011 The Authors.","3,4- Dihydroxyphenylethanol-elenolic acid; 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylethanol-elenolic acid dialdehyde; Metabolism; Olive oil","3,4 dihydroxyphenylethanolelenolic acid; 3,4 dihydroxyphenylethanolelenolic acid dialdehyde; aldehyde ketone reductase; glucuronide; homovanillic acid; hydroxytyrosol; olive oil; oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; secoiridoid; unclassified drug; article; biological activity; cell strain CACO 2; controlled study; enzyme activity; glucuronidation; human; human cell; ileum; jejunum; metabolism; metabolite; pH; protein analysis; protein localization; small intestine absorption; Animals; Biological Transport; Caco-2 Cells; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Intestinal Absorption; Intestine, Small; Models, Biological; Molecular Structure; Phenols; Plant Oils; Pyrans; Rats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958773340

To maximize the effectiveness of the stove dissemination process, promoters should choose target populations that are both likely to adopt the new technology and to influence the opinions of other potential adopters within a social group. In the current study a longitudinal analysis of adoption patterns and intensity of use of a Patsari improved biomass cookstove was conducted in 259 randomly selected households of a community intervention study in rural communities of Michoacan, Mexico. Health promoters classified households into one of several stove user groups during a series of monthly follow up interviews after Patsari installation, based on physical traces of use and household self-reporting by questionnaire. Multinomial logistic regression was used develop a model of household and community characteristics associated with early adoption of the Patsari, leading to the development of bi-level model for targeting improved stove dissemination efforts. Factors including community of residence, number of adults in household, suffering from irritated eyes, using wood scraps for fuel, and cooking with certain types of traditional fogons were associated with early adoption of Patsari cookstoves. Maximum saturation of the Patsari in the study population was reached four months after installation; after this point, stove use decreased until eight months but remained relatively steady with 55% of the sample using the Patsari regularly from month eight onwards. Results highlight the importance of utilizing effective targeting strategies to maximize NGO resources and increase the robustness of the diffusion process, resulting in more stoves in actual use. Additionally, results point to the importance of evaluating the success of an improved stove program in terms of stove use over time, rather than the total number of stoves disseminated. © 2011 International Energy Initiative.","Developing countries; Indoor air pollution; Stove dissemination programs; Technology adoption","Air pollution; Biomass; Developing countries; Indoor air pollution; Pollution; Surveys; Diffusion process; Health co-benefits; Indoor air pollutants; Intervention studies; Longitudinal analysis; Michoacan , Mexico; Multinomial logistic regression; Technology adoption; Stoves; atmospheric pollution; biomass; cooking appliance; developing world; energy use; household energy; indoor air; rural area; technology adoption; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957441775

The carbon cycle disruptions are probably accompanied by changes in the stock of oxidants and connect to glaciations via changes in the atmospheric greenhouse gas content. Two of the glaciations reach low latitudes and may have been Snowball events with near-global ice cover. This review deals primarily with the Cryogenian portion of the Neoproterozoic, during which these glaciations occurred. The initiation and deglaciation of Snowball states are discussed in light of a suite of general circulation model simulations designed to facilitate intercomparison between different models. Snow cover and the nature of the frozen surface emerge as key factors governing initiation and deglaciation. The most comprehensive model discussed confirms the possibility of initiating a Snowball event with a plausible reduction of CO2. Deglaciation requires a combination of elevated CO2 and tropical dust accumulation, aided by some cloud warming. The cause of Neoproterozoic biogeochemical turbulence, and its precise connection with Snowball glaciations, remains obscure. Copyright © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

These trees, now fully grown, play an important role in abating air pollution in the NLC town ship which is home to 128,133 people. This frst study quantifes the cleansing action of these evergreens by employing a tailor-made atmospheric dispersion model which accounts for unique regional factors- the year round high solar insolation, high temperatures and the convective nature of the atmospheric boundary layer. We model the dispersion of SO 2 emitted from multiple elevated stacks (typical source strengths are 300 g/s) and its deposition onto the evergreen canopy. Deposition is quantifed in terms of the universal deposition velocity parameterization via inferential-resistance modelling of the transport pathways. Result indicate that considerable amount of pollution in deposited on to the canopy year round. In addition active cleansing of the atmosphere takes place over regions not directly in the path of SO 2 emissions but nevertheless affected by residual pollution.

Contingent problems are well known, increasingly well documented, and recalcitrant: freshwater and coastal marine eutrophication, groundwater pollution, soil organic matter loss, and a warming atmosphere. The conversion of marginal lands not now farmed to annual grain production, including the repatriation of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and other conservation set-aside lands, will further exacerbate the biogeochemical imbalance of these landscapes, as could pressure to further simplify crop rotations. The expected emergence of biorefinery and combustion facilities that accept cellulosic materials offers an alternative outcome: agricultural landscapes that accumulate soil carbon, that conserve nitrogen and phosphorus, and that emit relatively small amounts of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere. Fields in these landscapes are planted to perennial crops that require less fertilizer, that retain sediments and nutrients that could otherwise be transported to groundwater and streams, and that accumulate carbon in both soil organic matter and roots. If mixed-species assemblages, they additionally provide biodiversity services. Biogeochemical responses of these systems fall chiefly into two areas: carbon neutrality and water and nutrient conservation. Fluxes must be measured and understood in proposed cropping systems sufficient to inform models that will predict biogeochemical behavior at field, landscape, and regional scales. Because tradeoffs are inherent to these systems, a systems approach is imperative, and because potential biofuel cropping systems and their environmental contexts are complex and cannot be exhaustively tested, modeling will be instructive. Modeling alternative biofuel cropping systems converted from different starting points, for example, suggests that converting CRP to corn ethanol production under conventional tillage results in substantially increased net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that can be only partly mitigated with no-till management. Alternatively, conversion of existing cropland or prairie to switchgrass production results in a net GHG sink. Outcomes and policy must be informed by science that adequately quantifies the true biogeochemical costs and advantages of alternative systems. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Cellulosic biomass; Climate mitigation; Climate stabilization; Ecosystem modeling; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; Soil carbon; Water quality","biofuel; carbon; nitrogen; water; agricultural land; bioaccumulation; biodiversity; bioenergy; biofuel; biogeochemistry; biological uptake; carbon; crop production; crop rotation; ecosystem modeling; eutrophication; fertilizer application; food production; global warming; greenhouse gas; groundwater pollution; landscape; marine environment; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; soil carbon; soil organic matter; stabilization; water quality; agriculture; article; carbon cycle; chemistry; climate change; ecosystem; geographic and geological phenomena; methodology; nitrogen cycle; standard; theoretical model; water supply; Agriculture; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Geological Phenomena; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Water; Water Supply; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958778320

While research has primarily focused on agricultural water use, industrial water use has recently become more prominent. Because most industries employ relatively low amounts of water, our study focuses on electricity production, which is involved in almost all economic activities and has a considerable share of the global water consumption. Materials and methods: Water consumption data for different power production technologies was calculated from literature. Due to the global importance of hydropower and the high variability of its specific water consumption, a climate-dependent estimation scheme for water consumption in hydroelectric generation was derived. Applying national power production mixes, we analyzed water consumption and related environmental damage of the average power production for all countries. For the European and North American countries, we further modeled electricity trade to assess the electricity market mix and the power-consumption related environmental damages. Using the Eco-indicator 99 single-score and compatible freshwater consumption damage assessments, the contribution of water consumption to the total environmental impact was quantified. Results and discussion: Water consumption dominates the environmental damage of hydropower, but is generally negligible for fossil thermal, nuclear, and alternative power production. However, as the impact of water consumption has high regional variation, it can be relevant for many power technologies in water-scarce areas. The variability among country production mixes is substantial, both from a water consumption and overall environmental impact perspective. The difference between electricity production and market mixes is negligible for most countries, especially for big countries such as the USA. In Europe, where intensive international electricity trade exists, the difference is more significant. When contrasted with the relatively high uncertainties in water consumption figures particularly for hydropower, the additional error from using production mixes instead of market mixes is rather small. Conclusions: Power production is one of the major global water consumers and involved in life cycles of almost any human activity. Covering the water-consumption-related environmental damage of power generation closes one important gap in life cycle assessment and also improves data availability for the emerging field of water footprints. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Dams; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle impact assessment; Power production; Regionalization; Water consumption","fresh water; article; electricity; energy yield; environmental impact; geographic distribution; hydropower; life cycle assessment; market; priority journal; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960570841

From 1990 to 2008 CO2 emissions in developed countries (defined as countries with emission-reduction commitments in the Kyoto Protocol, Annex B) have stabilized, but emissions in developing countries (non-Annex B) have doubled. Some studies suggest that the stabilization of emissions in developed countries was partially because of growing imports from developing countries. To quantify the growth in emission transfers via international trade, we developed a trade-linked global database for CO2 emissions covering 113 countries and 57 economic sectors from 1990 to 2008. We find that the emissions from the production of traded goods and services have increased from 4.3 Gt CO2 in 1990 (20% of global emissions) to 7.8 Gt CO2 in 2008 (26%). Most developed countries have increased their consumption-based emissions faster than their territorial emissions, and non-energy-intensive manufacturing had a key role in the emission transfers. The net emission transfers via international trade from developing to developed countries increased from 0.4 Gt CO2 in 1990 to 1.6 Gt CO2 in 2008, which exceeds the Kyoto Protocol emission reductions. Our results indicate that international trade is a significant factor in explaining the change in emissions in many countries, from both a production and consumption perspective. We suggest that countries monitor emission transfers via international trade, in addition to territorial emissions, to ensure progress toward stabilization of global greenhouse gas emissions.","Carbon footprint; Carbon leakage; Emission inventory; Emissions embodied in trade; Input-output analysis","carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; article; carbon footprint; developed country; gas flaring; greenhouse gas; priority journal; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Commerce; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Greenhouse Effect; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957755408

The history of Amazon plant diversifi cation must be understood in a broader context of migration of lineages from other continents during the Neogene and earlier periods. The history of major migration events, as revealed by recent molecular systematics research, is reviewed here. These studies demonstrate the role of land bridge migration and oceanic dispersal in forming contemporary Amazon plant diversity. Many of the diversifi cation histories coincide geographically and in timing with the uplift period of the Andean orogeny and, in some cases, with Pleistocene climatic changes. Although the Pleistocene history of Amazon vegetation is poorly understood, population genetics approaches may help to elucidate the occurrence of population contractions and expansions and their relation to putative moist forest refuges during glacial periods. The overlay of ecological traits, such as soil or habitat preference, onto phylogenies highlights the role of habitat specialization in plant diversifi cation across the Amazon drainage basin. This review suggests that collaboration between molecular systematists, ecologists, geologists and palaeobotanists will advance future research on the driving factors of Amazon plant diversifi cation. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","'phylogenetic niche conservatism' concept; Amazon plant diversification in context of migration of lineages; Andean dry forest speciation and high-elevation taxa; Biogeographical hypotheses and Neogene Amazon history; Diversification of Amazonian flora and key geological and environmental events; Gondwana and boreotropical origins of Amazonian flora; Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) - nuclear region sequenced across diverse plant lineages; Molecular perspective on Neogene plant diversification in Amazon drainage basin; Pleistocene refugia, effecting population genetic structure of tree species; Sweepstakes dispersal - DNA sequence phylogeography and molecular clock methods",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886104010

Typically, the mean over all model simulations is considered as the optimal prediction, with the underlying assumption that different models provide statistically independent information evenly distributed around the true state. However, there is reason to believe that this is not the best assumption. Coupled models are of comparable complexity and are constructed in similar ways. Some models share parts of the same code and some models are even developed at the same center. Therefore, the limitations of these models tend to be fairly similar, contributing to the well-known problem of common model biases and possibly to an unrealistically small spread in the outcomes of model predictions. This study attempts to quantify the extent of this problem by asking how many models there effectively are and howto best determine this number.Quantifying the effective number ofmodels is achieved by evaluating 24 state-of-the-art models and their ability to simulate broad aspects of twentieth-century climate. Using two different approaches, the amount of unique information in the ensemble is calculated and the effective ensemble size is found to be much smaller than the actual number of models. As more models are included in an ensemble, the amount of new information diminishes in proportion. Furthermore, this reduction is found to go beyond the problem of ""same center"" models and systemic similarities are seen to exist across all models. The results suggest that current methodologies for the interpretation of multimodel ensembles may lead to overly confident climate predictions. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climate models; Ensembles; Model evaluation/performance","Climate prediction; Common models; Coupled models; Ensembles; Future climate; Model evaluation/performance; Model prediction; Model simulation; Multi-model ensemble; Climate change; Computer simulation; Forecasting; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; computer simulation; ensemble forecasting; numerical model; performance assessment; twentieth century",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955369900

Traditional pixel-based analysis of remotely sensed data results in inaccurate identification of some crops due to pixel heterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop pattern variability. These problems can be overcome using object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques, which incorporate new spectral, textural and hierarchical features after segmentation of imagery. We combined OBIA and decision tree (DT) algorithms to develop a methodology, named Object-based Crop Identification and Mapping (OCIM), for a multi-seasonal assessment of a large number of crop types and field status.In our approach, we explored several vegetation indices (VIs) and textural features derived from visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER satellite scenes collected during three distinct growing-season periods (mid-spring, early-summer and late-summer). OCIM was developed for 13 major crops cultivated in the agricultural area of Yolo County in California, USA. The model design was built in four different scenarios (combinations of three or two periods) by using two independent training and validation datasets and the best DTs resulted in an error rate of 9% for the three-period model and between 12 and 16% for the two-period models. Next, the selected DT was used for the thematic classification of the entire cropland area and mapping was then evaluated applying the confusion matrix method to the independent testing dataset that reported 79% overall accuracy. OCIM detected intra-class variations in most crops attributed to variability from local crop calendars, tree-orchard structures and land management operations. Spectral variables (based on VIs) contributed around 90% to the models, although textural variables were necessary to discriminate between most of the permanent crop-fields (orchards, vineyard, alfalfa and meadow). Features extracted from late-summer imagery contributed around 60% in classification model development, whereas mid-spring and early-summer imagery contributed around 30 and 10%, respectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to identify the main groups of crops based on the presence and vigor of green vegetation within the fields, contributing around 50% to the models. In addition, other VIs based on SWIR bands were also crucial to crop identification because of their potential to detect field properties like moisture, vegetation vigor, non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil. The OCIM method was built using interpretable rules based on physical properties of the crops studied and it was successful for object-based feature selection and crop identification. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Agriculture; ASTER; Decision tree; Field-scale; OBIA; Spectral and textural features","Agricultural areas; ASTER; Bare soils; California , USA; Classification models; Confusion matrices; Crop identification; Crop phenology; Data sets; Ecological studies; Error rate; Feature selection; Field-scale; Hierarchical features; Interpretable rules; Intra-class variation; Land managements; Main group; Mixed pixel; Model design; Near Infrared; Non-photosynthetic vegetation; Normalized difference vegetation index; OBIA; Object based; Object based image analysis; Pattern variability; Pixel heterogeneity; Policy development; Remotely sensed data; Short wave infrared; Soil management practices; Spectral similarity; Spectral variables; Textural feature; Thematic classification; Vegetation index; Agronomy; Classification (of information); Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Image segmentation; Infrared radiation; Orchards; Pixels; Rating; Remote sensing; Statistical tests; Vegetation; agroecology; ASTER; greenhouse gas; growing season; management practice; NDVI; phenology; policy development; remote sensing; satellite data; Medicago sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953182966

Through stellar absorption studies we find that the LLCC is between 11.3 pc and 24.3 pc away, making it the closest known cold neutral medium cloud and well within the boundaries of the local cavity. Observations of the cloud in the 21 cm H I line reveal that the LLCC is very cold, with temperatures ranging from 15 K to 30 K, and is best fit with a model composed of two colliding components. The cloud has associated 100 μm thermal dust emission, pointing to a somewhat low dust-to-gas ratio of 48 ×10-22 MJy sr-1 cm 2. We find that the LLCC is too far away to be generated by the collision among the nearby complex of local interstellar clouds but that the small relative velocities indicate that the LLCC is somehow related to these clouds. We use the LLCC to conduct a shadowing experiment in 1/4 keV X-rays, allowing us to differentiate between different possible origins for the observed soft X-ray background (SXRB). We find that a local hot bubble model alone cannot account for the low-latitude SXRB, but that isotropic emission from solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) does reproduce our data. In a combined local hot bubble and SWCX scenario, we rule out emission from a local hot bubble with an 1/4 keV emissivity greater than 1.1 Snowdens pc-1 at 3σ, four times lower than previous estimates.

However, the effect of the system location on engine performance is a key aspect that should be studied. In the present work a numerical study has been carried out with the objective to analyze the effect on the engine performance of an innovative DPF placement upstream of the turbine. This study has been performed by means of the gas dynamic simulation of a two-stage turbocharged heavy duty Diesel engine, which has been previously modeled from experimental data obtained under steady state conditions. The original DPF has been divided into two monoliths for the case of the pre-turbo DPF configuration. Three cylinders discharge in each of these monoliths and after the filtration the flow is driven towards the high-pressure turbine and the EGR system. The engine response is compared with a pre-turbo DPF configuration under steady state conditions against the common DPF placement downstream of the turbine. The study covers a parametric study based on EGR and waste-gate valves opening. It has allowed comparing the variations on the engine operation as function of the EGR rate and the air-to-fuel ratio settings. Different soot loadings have been considered in order to extend the study over a wider range of operating conditions. Finally, the location of the DOC has been also considered as an additional parameter (upstream of the DPF or downstream of the turbines in the pre-turbo configuration). Results allow identifying the phenomena controlling the engine response when the DPF is placed upstream of the turbines. Among them highlight the increase of the thermal level that favors the passive regeneration, the DPF pressure drop reduction and the benefits that the use of two parallel monoliths brings out regarding the attenuation of the wave interference between cylinders during exhaust valve opening, which leads to make unnecessary the use of twin turbines. The analysis of the interaction among all the involved phenomena provides a comprehensive understanding of the proposed architecture and its potential regarding both the engine and the DPF behavior. © 2011 SAE International.",,"Diesel particulate filters; Engine operations; Engine performance; Exhaust valves; Experimental data; Heavy duty diesel vehicles; Heavy-duty diesel engine; High pressure turbine; Numerical studies; Operating condition; Parametric study; Particulate filters; Performance analysis; Proposed architectures; Soot aerosols; Soot loading; State-of-the-art technology; Steady-state condition; Thermal level; Two stage; Computer simulation; Machine design; Monolithic integrated circuits; Soot; Turbines; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859365749

Chronic uremia may be associated with an increased carbonyl overload (""carbonyl stress""), though carbonyl formation has been proposed so far for major plasma proteins only. In this study we looked for evidence and for the targets of plasma protein carbonylation in patients on hemodialysis. We also examined the effect of in vitro carbonylated albumin on mRNA levels of endothelial cell adhesion molecules involved in early atherogenesis. Methods: Carbonylated proteins in uremic plasma were detected by a covalent hydrazine bait strategy and identified by combining electrophoretic separation with mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests. Some plasma samples were first depleted of albumin and immunoglobulins to improve detection of lower abundance proteins. The functional impact of carbonylation was assessed in human vein endothelial cells by studying models of modified human serum albumin. Results: Post-dialysis plasma carbonylated protein levels were significantly increased compared to predialysis levels. Susceptibility to carbonyl formation was described on a open-platform investigation for a number of plasma proteins, albumin being the main scavenger of carbonyl reactive species. Incubation of endothelial cells with low doses of carbonylated albumin caused a significant increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 mRNA levels. Conclusions: Chronic uremia appears as a state of ""carbonyl stress"" targeting several different plasma proteins. Carbonylated albumin displayed biological effects that may be relevant to uremic atherosclerosis. © 2011 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.","Albumin; Atherogenesis; Carbonylation; Hemodialysis; Proteomics; Uremia","carbonyl derivative; human serum albumin; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; messenger RNA; plasma protein; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; aged; article; atherogenesis; cell adhesion; chemical stress; chronic disease; clinical article; controlled study; endothelium cell; female; hemodialysis patient; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; male; protein blood level; protein carbonylation; protein targeting; uremia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atherosclerosis; Cells, Cultured; Chronic Disease; Endothelial Cells; Female; Gene Expression; Humans; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Protein Carbonylation; Renal Dialysis; RNA, Messenger; Serum Albumin; Uremia; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Veins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960392126

A wide range of soil water availability from dry, deficit irrigation to full irrigation was examined. Leaf area greatly changed with soil water availability but not with the experimental site. The effect of soil drying on physiological indices was small over a certain range of soil water deficit (from 0% to approximately 40%). Within this range, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) strongly affected gs. To this regard, the adoption of two experimental sites differing in climatic conditions (i.e. air temperature, RH, VPD) has been useful for a better understanding of the mechanisms, which regulate stomatal opening. Therefore, in Mediterranean environment, the combined effect of soil water availability (mostly upon leaf growth) and climatic conditions (mostly upon plant physiology) must be considered in models for biomass production in tomato crop. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Crop physiology; Deficit irrigation; LAI; Lycopersicon esculentum; Soil water deficit; Vapour pressure deficit","air temperature; biomass; fruit; leaf area index; Mediterranean environment; semiarid region; soil water; stomatal conductance; transpiration; vapor pressure; water availability; Italy; Sicily; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955589154

The interviews had the objective to characterize the RWC use in this region, in term of both total and municipal wood consumption. Details on the type of appliances used in RWC were also gathered.The results of the survey were then statistically analyzed in order to allow an estimate of RWC with high spatial resolution (i.e., at municipal level) in relation to the size and altitude of the territory.The work provides new evidence of the importance of wood combustion as a key source for PM and NMVOC emissions at local level, and thus highlights the importance of technological improvements and new policies aimed at emission reduction in this sector.Considering the great differences in average PM emission factors between low efficiency appliances (fireplaces, old stoves) and high efficiency ones (new stoves, pellet burners), this work emphasizes the importance of obtaining more detailed information on the types of wood appliances used for arriving at a reliable PM emission inventory for RWC. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Fireplace; Particulate matter; Residential wood combustion; Stove; Wood smoke","Bottom up approach; Computer assisted; Emission inventories; Emission reduction; Fireplace; High efficiency; High spatial resolution; Particulate Matter; PM emissions; Regional levels; Residential wood combustions; Technological improvements; Wood combustion; Wood consumption; Wood smoke; Air quality; Chimneys; Combustion; Pollution; Stoves; Surveys; Wood; altitude; bottom-up approach; combustion; data set; emission inventory; estimation method; particulate matter; policy making; residential location; resolution; spatial analysis; survey; territory; wood; altitude; article; combustion; Computer Aided Telephone Interview; field emission; health survey; information; interview; Italy; particulate matter; policy; priority journal; regionalization; residential wood combustion; wood; Air Pollution; Chimneys; Combustion; Data; Emission; Italy; Surveys; Wood; Italy; Lombardy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955480698

The capacity of farmers to increase forage yield further, solely by increasing fertilizer inputs or through improved pasture management, is limited. Emerging requirements to balance industry production targets against the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and N losses pose further challenges. Plant breeding is being asked to deliver results more urgently than at any time previously, and this review attempts to highlight issues that might limit the prospects for future progress by seeking lessons from four past examples: (i) white clover breeding gains and the need to consider the complexity of the grazed grass-clover mixed sward, with its tendency for cycling in plant species composition; (ii) a systems field trial of new and old grass/clover cultivars, and how the complexity of growth of perennial forage crops, and the dynamic optimality required for sustainable harvesting might limit our ability to breed for 'yield'per se; (iii) the manipulation of a physiological trait (low 'maintenance' respiration) and the implications of such changes for plant fitness and G×E interactions; and (iv) an hypothesis-driven development of a trait (high-sugar grasses) and the value of 'proof of concept' studies, the requirement of scientific understanding of the mechanisms of trait expression, and how one might in future go about assessing breeding achievements. We discuss the general ecological considerations around shifts in the frequency distribution of traits in new populations, whether altered conventionally or by genetic modification, and how selection for a particular trait might inadvertently reduce both fitness and persistence. A major priority for breeding, we propose, might be to revisit previously abandoned traits that affected the physiological performance of forage species, armed now with a capacity to monitor gene expression at the molecular level, and so unravel/control the G×E interactions that limited their benefits. We also discuss how a 'loss of yield advantage' of new cultivars, seen when tested several years after sowing, requires urgent investigation and propose this might be associated with fitness costs of perenniality. Finally, we argue for a careful reconsideration of what are realistic expectations for systems field trials and that focus on forage breeding might be shifted more to 'proof of concept' studies, critical experimental design, comparing 'traits' rather than 'cultivars', and the wider ecological assessment of fitness and function of traits in the plant, community and ecosystem. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Breeding targets; Cultivar evaluation; Environmental impact; Fitness; Forage breeding; Forage quality; Pasture persistence; Respiration; Trait expression; WSC","alternative agriculture; cultivar; environmental impact; fitness; forage; future prospect; grass; greenhouse ecosystem; industrial production; livestock farming; pastoralism; perennial plant; persistence; plant community; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; ruminant; yield response; Animalia; Bovidae; Poaceae; Trifolium; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955490657

Dendrochronological methods were used. Long-term alkaline (pH 13.2-12.7) dust pollution emitted over 40 years from a cement plant was the reason of alkalisation (pH 7.8-8.1) and high concentrations of K, Ca and Mg in soil of affected territories. Two study sites, Kunda and Malla (2.5 and 5.0. km E from the emission source), were influenced by the dust emissions of the cement plant. Two other study sites, Eru (38. km W) and Revoja (34. km W), were situated on a relatively unpolluted area and served as control sites. The relationships between the radial growth and climate were almost similar on the control and dust-polluted sites. The climatic variables that had a significant effect on the radial growth of Norway spruce at both control and polluted sites were the temperature and precipitation of summer months of the current and preceding years. Specific to the Scots pine stands growing under dust pollution was a significant positive impact of the current spring temperature on the radial growth. A positive effect of precipitation during winter months on the radial growth was found at all sites.

In South Korea case, the total of GHGs from the waste incineration facilities has been increasing at an annual rate 10%. In these view, waste incineration facilities should consider to reduce GHG emissions.This study is designed to estimate the N2O emission factors from MSW incineration plants, and calculate the N2O emissions based on these factors. The three MSW incinerators examined in this study were either stoker or both stoker and rotary kiln facilities. The N2O concentrations from the MSW incinerators were measured using gas chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD) equipment.The average of the N2O emission factors for the M01 plant, M02 plant, and M03 plant are 71, 75, and 153g-N2O/ton-waste, respectively. These results showed a significant difference from the default values of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), while approaching those values derived in Japan and Germany. Furthermore, comparing the results of this study to the Korea Energy Economics Institute (KEEI) (2007) data on waste incineration, N2O emissions from MSW incineration comprised 19% of the total N2O emissions. © 2011.",,"Annual rates; Default values; Emission factors; Energy economics; Germany; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; MSW incineration; Nitrous oxide; South Korea; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy conversion; Gas chromatography; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Nitrogen oxides; Refuse incinerators; Waste incineration; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; emission control; greenhouse gas; incineration; municipal solid waste; nitrous oxide; waste management; article; calculation; controlled study; electron capture detection; gas chromatography; Germany; incineration; Japan; maximum allowable concentration; municipal solid waste; priority journal; solid waste management; South Korea; city; South Korea; Chromatography, Gas; Cities; Incineration; Nitrous Oxide; Republic of Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958268822

Manure was collected from a swine research barn by a scraper system and mixed with sawdust as a bulking agent. The manure sawdust mixture was placed in linear low density polyethylene containers for each composting method. A steady state chamber covering each container was used to measure CH4 and N2O fluxes during composting in order to sample temporal and spatial heterogeneous fluxes. Air samples were continuously analyzed for CH4 and N2O by a high frequency trace gas analyzer. Mean CH4 fluxes from FA, WM, TO, and no aeration were 5.2, 3.8, 7.5, and 34.6μg/m2/s, respectively. Mean N2O fluxes from FA, WM, TO, and no aeration were 1.6, 3.1, 7.9, and 11.4μg/m2/s, respectively. Ratios of CO2-equiv. emitted from FA, WM, TO and no aeration were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.59, respectively. Nitrous oxide was the main contributor to CO2-equiv. fluxes.

These statistical relationships can serve as validation targets for global carbon-cycle models. Fourier-transform coherence between atmospheric CO2 measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and Hadley Centre global-average temperatures changed in the late 20th century at interannual frequencies, from a 6-month time lag to a 90° phase lag that scaled CO2 fluctuations to a time-integral of the global-average temperature anomaly. Wavelet coherence estimates argue that this change occurred with a recognized ocean-circulation climate transition during the late 1970s. General features of these CO2-temperature correlations are confirmed using global-average temperature from other sources and atmospheric CO 2 measured at other locations, though only the Mauna Loa CO 2 record is long enough to resolve well the coherence properties before the 1970s transition. The CO2-coherence phase for the globalaverage surface-air temperature time series from NASA-GISS and the lowertroposphere temperature series from the MSU satellite is more complex than for the Hadley-Centre dataset, the only estimate that incorporates sea-surface temperature (SST) observations. Near f = 0.25 cyc/year, 4-year oscillation period, the CO2- coherence is particularly strong for the Hadley-Centre gridpoint temperature-anomaly time series from low-latitude oceans. This suggests that sea-surface temperature is a primary driver of the correlation, at least for the 0.2 &lt; f &lt; 0.5 cyc/yr bandpass where the El-Nino/Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) climate process dominates. Outside the ENSO bandpass coherence is significant between 14 long-running GLOBALVIEW CO 2-observing sites and the sea-level-pressure-based Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) time series, consistent with wind stress and mixed-layer-thickness influences on ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux, independent of temperature fluctuations. Evidence for terrestrial biosphere influence is strongest in the leading principal component of GLOBALVIEW CO2-variability at f = 0.25 cpy, where a larger amplitude and a 4-month phase shift distinguish the mid- and highlatitude Northern Hemisphere CO2 fluctuations from those of the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere. The terrestrial signal we infer, however, coheres more strongly with oceanic-gridpoint temperatures than to continental-gridpoint temperatures.","Carbon cycle; Climate change; El-Nino/Southern-Oscillation (ENSO); Greenhouse feedbacks; North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and interannual temperature fluctuations; Ocean circulation","air-sea interaction; annual variation; atmospheric chemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate feedback; Fourier transform; greenhouse effect; model validation; North Atlantic Oscillation; oceanic circulation; sea surface temperature; time series analysis; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Mauna Loa; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83155177163

The need for energy has to be reduced by a drive for energy efficiency and renewable energy. Government programmes for the above are also commented upon. Though India's CO2 emissions are unlikely to grow very much due to energy scarcity and energy mix the article examines the potential to reduce CO2 emissions and the associated costs involved in various options. It finds that 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 is feasible but would involve additional costs. The most promising option is to reduce energy demand by various measures to increase energy use efficiency in production and consumption. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy; India; Low carbon; Strategy","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Economics; Energy management; Hydrocarbons; International trade; Additional costs; Associated costs; Economic growths; Energy; Energy demands; Energy growth; Energy mix; Energy needs; Energy scarcity; Energy-use efficiency; India; Low carbon; Renewable energies; Strategy; Energy efficiency; carbon; carbon emission; coal; cost-benefit analysis; economic growth; emission control; energy efficiency; hydrocarbon; hydrogen; measurement method; renewable resource; state role; strategic approach; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958085522

Today the use of biosolids to improve the nutrient contents of a soil is a common practice. Contamination of soils by potentially toxic elements (e.g., Cd, Ni, Cr, Pb) from amendments of biosolids is subject to strict controls within the European Community in relation to total permissible metal concentrations, soil properties and intended use. In this context, heavy metal concentrations were studied in agricultural soils devoted to vegetable crops in the province of Alicante (SE Spain), where an intensive agriculture takes place. This study is aimed at ascertaining the chemical partitioning of Cd, Ni, Cr, and Pb in agricultural soils repeatedly amended with sludge. Selected soil properties relevant to control the mobility and bioavaibility of heavy metals were analyzed for the general characterisation of these agricultural soils. The distribution of chemical forms of Cd, Ni, Cr, and Pb in five biosolids-amended soils was studied using a sequential extraction procedure that fractionates the metal into soluble-exchangeable, specifically sorbed-carbonate bound, oxidizable, reducible, and residual forms. The biosolids incorporation has modified the soil composition, leading to the increment of heavy metals. The residual, reducible, and carbonate-sorbed forms were dominant. Detailed knowledge of the soil at the application site, especially pH, CEC, buffering capacity, organic matter, clay minerals, and clay content, is essential. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Amended soils; Biosolids; Heavy metals; SE Spain; Sequential extraction","Agricultural soils; Amended soil; Buffering capacities; Carbonate-sorbed forms; Characterisation; Chemical forms; Chemical partitioning; Clay content; European community; Food chain; Heavy metal concentration; Human health; Metal concentrations; Nutrient contents; Organic matter; Potentially toxic elements; SE Spain; Sequential extraction; Sequential extraction procedure; Soil composition; Soil property; Vegetable crops; Agriculture; Biological materials; Biosolids; Cadmium; Chemical contamination; Chromium; Clay minerals; Ecosystems; Lead; Metals; Organic minerals; Positive ions; Silicate minerals; Soils; Soil pollution; cadmium; chromium; lead; nickel; agricultural soil; bioavailability; biosolid; food chain; heavy metal; partitioning; soil pollution; soil property; agricultural land; article; biosolid; controlled study; crop; Europe; extraction; food chain; maximum allowable concentration; sequential extraction; sludge; soil analysis; soil fertility; soil pollution; soil pollution control; Spain; Alicante [Comunidad Valencia]; Comunidad Valencia; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955051904

Around a third of the global-mean SLR over the century is avoided by a mitigation scenario under which global-mean near surface air temperature stabilises close to the Copenhagen Accord limit of a 2C increase. Under BAU (a variant of the A1B scenario) the model-averaged projected SLR for 2090-2099 relative to 1980-1999 is 0.29 m-0.51 m (5%-95% uncertainties from treatment of land-based ice melt); under mitigation (E1 scenario) it is 0.17 m-0.34 m. This reduction is primarily from reduced thermal expansion. The spatial patterns of regional SLR are fairly dissimilar between the models, but are qualitatively similar across scenarios for a particular model. An impacts model suggests that by the end of the 21st century and without upgrade in defences around 55% of the 84 million additional people flooded per year globally under BAU (from SLR alone) could be avoided under such mitigation. The above projections of SLR follow the methodology of the IPCC Fourth Assessment. We have, however, also conducted a sensitivity study of SLR and its impacts where the possibility of accelerated ice sheet dynamics is accounted for.

During long-term follow-up, only a minority of cases show aggressive behavior with either lymph node or distant metastases. Recently, we had an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of nonsurgical, ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous laser ablation (PLA) for local treatment of PTMC in an otherwise inoperable patient. Patient and Methods: Neck US examination revealed an incidental, solitary, 8 × 7 × 7 mm hypoechoic nodule with microcalcifications of the right thyroid lobe. The patient suffered from decompensated liver cirrhosis, renal failure, and recent surgery followed by external beam radiation therapy for breast cancer. Cytologic diagnosis showed papillary thyroid carcinoma, but the patient declined surgery because of high risk of thyroid surgery. After local anesthesia with 2% xylocaine, PLA was performed according to the previously reported procedure with an Nd:YAG laser. Summary: The procedure was well tolerated, without side effects, and the patient required no analgesics. US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core-needle biopsy were performed at 1 and 12 months after PLA, which demonstrated necrotic material and inflammatory cells with no viable neoplastic cell. At the 24 months US follow-up examination, the area of necrosis further decreased, demonstrating a 4 × 4 mm hypoechoic zone and a small hyperechoic area due to fibrotic changes. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy confirmed the absence of malignant cells. Conclusions: Laser-induced thermal ablation was a safe and effective ablative treatment for a patient with PTMC confined to the thyroid gland who was at high surgical risk.

Since current assessments of worldwide hydrate-bound carbon vary by one order of magnitude, new technical efforts are required for improved and accurate hydrate quantifications. Here we present hydrate abundances determined for surface sediments at the high-flux Batumi seep area in the southeastern Black Sea at 840m water depth using state-of-the art autoclave technology. Pressure sediment cores of up to 2.65m in length were recovered with an autoclave piston corer backed by conventional gravity cores. Quantitative core degassing yielded volumetric gas/bulk sediment ratios of up to 20.3 proving hydrate presence. The cores represented late glacial to Holocene hemipelagic sediments with the shallowest hydrates found at 90cmbsf. Calculated methane concentrations in the different cores surpassed methane equilibrium concentrations in the two lowermost lithological Black Sea units sampled. The results indicated hydrate fractions of 5.2% of pore volume in the sapropelic Unit 2 and mean values of 21% pore volume in the lacustrine Unit 3. We calculate that the studied area of ~0.5km2 currently contains about 11.3kt of methane bound in shallow hydrates. Episodic detachment and rafting of such hydrates is suggested by a rugged seafloor topography along with variable thicknesses in lithologies. We propose that sealing by hydrate precipitation in coarse-grained deposits and gas accumulation beneath induces detachment of hydrate/sediment chunks. Floating hydrates will rapidly transport methane into shallower waters and potentially to the sea-atmosphere boundary. In contrast, persistent in situ dissociation of shallow hydrates appears unlikely in the near future as deep water warming by about 1.6°C and/or decrease in hydrostatic pressure corresponding to a sea level drop of about 130m would be required. Because hydrate detachment should be primarily controlled by internal factors in this area and in similar hydrated settings, it serves as source of methane in shallow waters and the atmosphere which is mainly decoupled from external forcing. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Autoclave technology; Black Sea; Gas hydrate; Gas volume; Hydrate rafting; Pressure core","Black sea; Coarse-grained deposits; Deep Water; Equilibrium concentration; External forcing; Gas accumulation; Gas seepage; Gas volume; Gravity core; Hemipelagic sediments; Holocenes; In-situ; Mean values; Methane concentrations; Pore volume; Sea floor; Sediment core; Shallow waters; Shallower water; State of the art; Surface sediments; Technical efforts; Water depth; Anoxic sediments; Bathymetry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydration; Hydrostatic pressure; Lithology; Methanation; Methane; Pressure vessels; Sea level; Seawater; Sedimentology; Seepage; Gas hydrates; deep water; detachment fault; gas hydrate; hydrocarbon exploration; methane; water depth; Black Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957969880

At the assumed distance to NGC7793 of 3.91Mpc, the limiting unabsorbed luminosity of the detected discrete X-ray sources is L X (0.2-10.0keV) ≈3×1036ergs-1. A total of 22 discrete sources were detected at the ∼3σ level or greater including one ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX). Based on multiwavelength comparisons, we identify X-ray sources coincident with one SNR, the candidate microquasar N7793-S26, one H II region, and two foreground Galactic stars. We also find that the X-ray counterpart to the candidate radio SNR R3 is time variable in its X-ray emission: we therefore rule out the possibility that this source is a single SNR. A marked asymmetry is seen in the distribution of the discrete sources with the majority lying in the eastern half of this galaxy. All of the sources were analyzed using quantiles to estimate spectral properties and spectra of the four brightest sources (including the ULX) were extracted and analyzed. We searched for time variability in the X-ray emission of the detected discrete sources using our measured fluxes along with fluxes measured from prior Einstein and Röntgensatellit observations. From this study, three discrete X-ray sources are established to be significantly variable. A spectral analysis of the galaxy's diffuse emission is characterized by a temperature of kT = 0.19-0.25keV. The luminosity function of the discrete sources shows a slope with an absolute value of Γ = -0.65 ± 0.11 if we exclude the ULX. If the ULX is included, the luminosity function has a long tail to high L X with a poor-fitting slope of Γ = -0.62 ± 0.2. The ULX-less slope is comparable to the slopes measured for the distributions of NGC6946 and NGC2403 but much shallower than the slopes measured for the distributions of IC 5332 and M83. Lastly, we comment on the multiwavelength properties of the SNR population of NGC7793. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society.

Each of these policies would have different consequences, and combinations of these policies could induce interactions yielding a whole that is not the sum of its parts. This paper utilizes the Haiku electricity market model to evaluate the economic and technology outcomes, climate benefits, and cost-effectiveness of three such policies and all possible combinations of the policies. A central finding is that the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions from CTP can be significantly greater than those from the other policies, even for similar levels of renewable electricity production, since of the three policies, CTP is the only one that distinguishes electricity generated by coal and natural gas. It follows that CTP is the most cost-effective among these approaches at reducing CO2 emissions. An alternative compliance payment mechanism in an RPS program could substantially affect renewables penetration, and the electricity price effects of the policies hinge partly on the regulatory structure of electricity markets, which varies across the country. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cap-and-trade; Renewable energy credits; Renewable portfolio standard","Cap-and-trade; Cap-and-trade program; Electricity market; Electricity market model; Electricity prices; Electricity production; Emissions reduction; Federal policies; Payment mechanism; Regulatory structure; Renewable electricity; Renewable electricity production; Renewable energy credits; Renewable portfolio standard; Renewables; Tax credits; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Regulatory compliance; Taxation; Electricity; carbon emission; electricity generation; electricity supply; emission control; emissions trading; energy market; energy policy; greenhouse gas; renewable resource; United States; Grevillea banksii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957630536

Building on multidisciplinary field work and results from the model GCOMAP, the aim is to (1) identify and characterize the barriers to plantation activities in four agro-ecological zones in the state of Karnataka and (2) investigate what would be required to overcome these barriers and enhance the plantation rate and productivity. The results show that a rehabilitation of the wasteland based on plantation activities is not only possible but also anticipated by the local population and would lead to positive environmental and socio-economic effects at a local level. However, in many cases, the establishment of plantation activities is hindered by a lack of financial resources, low land productivity and water scarcity. Based on the model used and the results from the field work, it can be concluded that certified emission reductions such as carbon credits or other compensatory systems may help to overcome the financial barrier; however, the price needs to be significantly increased if these measures are to have any large-scale impact. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Agro-ecological zones; Carbon finance; CDM; Plantations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958061520

The structure and surface properties of molecular films were investigated by contact angle measurements and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The blocking behavior of Au-6a and Au-6b SAMs was examined with cyclic voltammetry in the presence of redox probes such as K3Fe(CN)6, Ru(NH3) 6Cl3 and ferrocene. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the voltammetric behavior of the redox probes was dependent on the nature of the probe molecules, the electrolytic solution composition and the monolayer structure. The optical properties of the SAMs were studied by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. It was obtained that the fluorescence emission bands of Au-6a and Au-6b monolayers were red-shifted and broadened compared to those of free thiols in solution as well as significant reduction at their emission intensities. The fluorescence decay profiles of 6a and 6b monolayers were described by a monoexponential function. In order to determine the possible deactivation mechanism between the metal support and photoexcited molecules, spectroelectrochemical steady-state fluorescence and lifetime measurements on the Au-fluorophore electrodes were also performed as a function of the applied potential. These results indicate that the fluorescence quenching occurs via an energy transfer mechanism from the excited molecules to the gold substrate. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The potential impact of climate change on the broad portfolio of underutilized plant species has not been assessed. The impacts of climate change on wild underutilized species, will vary, depending on their natural distribution, nature of predicted changes, adaptive and resilience capacities, ability to migrate, dispersal capacity, nature and ecology of their new bioclimatic envelopes and their ability to survive in them and colonize new areas. The availability of pollinators and dispersal agents, the environment and the management practices that might be associated with the species will also be important. Less clear is the scenario regarding underutilized cultivated species, whose survival is dependent not only upon their resilience and adaptation but also on our own ability to recognize and promote sustainably their use in a context of changing markets, food trends and life styles (aspects whose coverage goes beyond the scope of this book). Out of an estimated portfolio of 30,000 edible plant species recorded worldwide, humankind depends upon just 12 crops for the bulk of its nutritional requirements. This situation has major implications for the future of food security and wellbeing and its gravity can be perhaps better appreciated today in the context of current debates over the future of the planet in climate changing scenarios. While many underutilized species may be at risk like other major crops due to climate change, the global community needs to recognize and appreciate that these very same species may hold the key to a food-secure future as this chapter highlights. On the other hand, underutilized species (wild or cultivated), may hold as well the key to future agro-ecosystem diversification and adaptation. Minimizing the threats and ensuring the conservation and sustainable utilization of these species is one of the greatest challenges we must address in the decades to come. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc..","Adaptation; And cooperation; Genetic diversity; In situ conservation; Nutrition; Policies; Underutilized species",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864400214

As the bypass ratio of aircraft engines is increased in order to reduce fuel consumption, emissions and jet mixing noise the fan noise that radiates from the bypass exhaust nozzle is becoming one of the loudest engine sources, despite the large areas of acoustically absorptive treatment in the bypass duct. This paper addresses this 'aft fan' noise source, in particular the prediction of the propagation of fan noise through the bypass exhaust nozzle/jet exhaust flow and radiation out to the far-field observer. The proposed prediction method is equally applicable to fan tone and fan broadband noise (and also turbine and core noise) but here the method is validated with measured test data using simulated fan tones. The measured data had been previously acquired on two model scale turbofan engine exhausts with bypass and heated core flows typical of those found in a modern high bypass engine, but under static conditions (i.e. no flight simulation). The prediction method is based on frequency-domain solutions of the linearized Euler equations in conjunction with perfectly matched layer equations at the inlet and far-field boundaries using high-order finite differences. The discrete system of equations is inverted by the parallel sparse solver MUMPS. Far-field predictions are carried out by integrating Kirchhoff's formula in frequency domain. In addition to the acoustic modes excited and radiated, some non-acoustic waves within the cold stream-ambient shear layer are also captured by the computations at some flow and excitation frequencies. By extracting phase speed information from the near-field pressure solution, these non-acoustic waves are shown to be convective KelvinHelmholtz instability waves. Strouhal numbers computed along the shear layer, based on the local momentum thickness also confirm this in accordance with Michalke's instability criterion for incompressible round jets with a similar shear layer profile. Comparisons of the computed far-field results with the measured acoustic data reveal that, in general, the solver predicts the peak sound levels well when the farfield is dominated by the in-duct target mode (the target mode being the one specified to the in-duct mode generator). Calculations also show that the agreement can be considerably improved when the non-target modes are also included, despite their low in-duct levels. This is due to the fact that each duct mode has its own distinct directionality and a non-target low level mode may become dominant at angles where the higher-level target mode is directionally weak. The overall agreement between the computations and experiment strongly suggests that, at least for the range of mean flows and acoustic conditions considered, the physical aeroacoustic radiation processes are fully captured through the frequency-domain solutions to the linearized Euler equations and hence this could form the basis of a reliable aircraft noise prediction method. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study gives strong indications of this being the case also in salmon. Three different storage conditions were used to promote the oxidized, reduced, and carbon monoxide (CO) bound forms of heme in salmon and mackerel fillets. Color determination (instrumental color analysis, imaging, and sensory evaluation) and spectroscopic measurements were performed to study how spectral changes corresponded to color variations. Storage in CO significantly increased the redness in mackerel. This was also seen in salmon to such a degree that it was visible over normal levels of salmon carotenoids. Air storage increased the yellowness and reduced the redness in mackerel, but this effect was partly concealed in salmon by the astaxanthin absorption. The spectral differences due to storage condition could be ascribed to the spectral features characterizing heme of different oxidation states and bound to different ligands. The status of heme should therefore always be considered when experiments related to salmon color are performed. The findings could help in the understanding, control, and prediction of color loss in salmon during processing, storage, and transport. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","carbon monoxide; Color; heme; packaging; salmon; storage","Air storage; Astaxanthin; Color analysis; Color variations; heme; Oxidation state; Salmo salar; salmon; Sensory evaluation; Spectral change; Spectral differences; Spectral feature; Spectroscopic measurements; Storage condition; Visible reflectance; Carbon monoxide; Porphyrins; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectroscopy; Color; heme; animal; Atlantic salmon; chemistry; conference paper; food handling; metabolism; methodology; oxidation reduction reaction; sea food; spectroscopy; Animals; Food Handling; Heme; Oxidation-Reduction; Salmo salar; Seafood; Spectrum Analysis; Salmo salar",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960613480

As these legal actions have grown from a few cases widely regarded as boundary-pushing oddities to over one hundred lawsuits under many different legal theories, their collective outcome plays an important role in the ways smaller scale regulatory action takes place. In so doing, these actions ""rescale"" energy regulation by mandating or preventing smaller scale regulatory action-local, state, or national-as part of overall approaches to addressing climate change. This article contributes to both the geography and legal literatures by considering how climate change litigation in the United States helps to address the multiscalar challenges facing the energy industry, and the ways in which fixed judicial structures provide a space for needed fluidity in the construction of multilevel approaches to sustainable energy production and consumption.

Whereas the dry season standing vegetation was dominated by emergent species, aquatic species (floating-rooted, free-floating, and submerged life forms) were more dominant during the wet season. Seed bank and seedling recruitment measurements indicated that many species are resilient with life history traits that enable them to respond rapidly to extreme hydrologic filters. Interestingly, species richness was highest during seasonal flooding. Our results highlight the importance of early-wet season rainfall for plant regeneration and community change. Our findings also indicate that a drier future would likely have a large impact upon wetland plant communities with a decrease in species richness and an increase in the abundance of drought-tolerant emergent species. © Society of Wetland Scientists 2011.","Climate change; Palo Verde National Park; Plant life forms; Seasonal hydrology; Seed bank; Tropical dry wetland","climate change; climate modeling; coastal zone; community response; disturbance; dominance; drought; drought stress; filter; flooding; freshwater environment; hydrological cycle; life history trait; measurement method; plant community; rainfall; recruitment (population dynamics); regeneration; seasonal variation; seed bank; species richness; tolerance; tropical environment; vegetation structure; wetland; Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80955151616

Important features of the theoretical model, known as the ion model of plasma, are discussed. This model can be applied for calculations of the radiative properties of complex materials over a wide range of plasma parameters. For purposes of indirect-driven inertial fusion based on the hohlraum concept, an optimization method is used for the selection of an effective complex hohlraum wall material, which provides high radiation efficiency at laser interaction with the wall. The radiation efficiency of the resulting material is compared with the efficiency of other composite materials that have previously been evaluated theoretically. A similar theoretical study is performed for the optically thin X-pinch plasma produced by exploding wires. Theoretical estimations of radiative efficiency are compared with experimental data that have been obtained from measurements of X-pinch radiation energy yield using two exploding wire materials, NiCr and Alloy 188. It is shown that the theoretical results agree well with the experimental data. A symmetric multilayer X-pinch, where W and Mo wires are used, is as well considered. The theoretical explanation of experimental phenomena is discussed based on the W and Mo radiative spectra. The ion model was as well applied for interpretation of experimental results on opacities of CHO-plasma obtained via indirect heating of low density polymer layers by means of soft X-rays. The new diagnostics method based on the deformation of the of the Carbon absorption K-edge when foam layer is heated to plasma is discussed. The spectral coefficients for X-ray absorption in CHO-plasma are calculated in the photon energy region around the Carbon K-edge for different plasma temperatures and mean foam density. In this case, the Carbon K-edge position on the energy scale can be used for plasma temperature diagnostic. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.","Absorption K-edge; Foam targets; Hohlraum radiation; Indirect heating; Planck mean free paths; Radiative opacity; Rosseland; X-ray source","Hohlraums; Indirect heating; Mean free path; Radiative opacities; Rosseland; X-ray sources; Absorption; Electron sources; Exploding wires; Foams; Heating; Inertial confinement fusion; Ions; Materials properties; Molybdenum; Opacity; Pinch effect; Plasmas; Pulsed lasers; Spectroscopy; X ray absorption; X ray apparatus; X rays; Laser fusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960367912

When GHG emissions are related to food production, the four most efficient regions are Eastern and Western Europe, North America, and the non-EU former Soviet Union which produced 46.3% of ruminant meat and milk energy and only 25.5% of enteric CH4 emissions in 2005. In comparison, the three least efficient producers (Asia, Africa, Latin America) produced an equivalent amount (47.1%) of ruminant meat and milk energy, and almost 69% of enteric CH4 emissions in 2005.

Climate can affect plants directly by altering growth rates, and indirectly by affecting predators and herbivores, which in turn influence plants. Diseases are also known to be important for the structure and function of food webs. However, the role of plant diseases in modulating ecosystem responses to a changing climate is poorly understood. This is partly because disease outbreaks are relatively rare and spatially variable, such that that their effects can only be captured in long-term experiments. Here we show that, although plant growth was favoured by the insulating effects of increased snow cover in experimental plots in Sweden, plant biomass decreased over the seven-year study. The decline in biomass was caused by an outbreak of a host-specific parasitic fungus, Arwidssonia empetri, which killed the majority of the shoots of the dominant plant species, Empetrum hermaphroditum, after six years of increased snow cover. After the outbreak of the disease, instantaneous measurements of gross photosynthesis and net ecosystem carbon exchange were significantly reduced at midday during the growing season. Our results show that plant diseases can alter and even reverse the effects of a changing climate on tundra carbon balance by altering plant composition. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"carbon balance; carbon sequestration; climate change; community composition; disease severity; ecosystem response; ecosystem structure; food web; fungus; growing season; plant community; snow cover; tundra; Sweden; Empetrum hermaphroditum; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84555175548

Most critical to the dry areas are scenarios of reduced rainfall. For the more arid zones sowing a faster maturing type (cv. Silverstar) on the 1 June resulted in the best outcome with some small gains and losses predicted. Sowing earlier or later resulted in yield losses of around 10 to 20%. In the wetter areas of southern Victoria, consistent gains in yield of around 10-20% should occur in all cultivar types (e.g. Silverstar, Chara or Mackellar), but only from later sowing times (July to August).

These patterns may be critical for effective plant recruitment in (semi)arid environments. Nevertheless, recruitment patterns of plant species within their range of distribution are still poorly known. Moreover, this response may be species-dependent, particularly between coexisting congenerics, which are thought to vary in demographic responses to climatic conditions as a coexistence-promoting mechanism. In this context, we investigated whether two congeneric plant species show synchronic age structures at varying spatial scales and whether they display demographic differences. Methods: We sampled 600 Helianthemum squamatum and H. syriacum individuals at six localities in Spain. We used dendrochronological techniques to estimate age and radial growth. We compared the age structure among populations and between species and assessed the effect of site and species on different demographic parameters. Correlations between age structure and climatic factors were also determined. Key results: We detected a very low intraspecific synchrony across sites but a high interspecific coupling in age structure within localities. Secondary growth, mean age, and flowering showed large intersite differences and small interspecific differences. Summer rainfall was a good predictor of age structure. Conclusions: Fine-scale climatic variability plays a major role in determining age structure of the studied species. Climatic variability is more relevant than interspecific differences. Our results illustrate the relevance of including spatial variation in summer rainfall patterns when modeling the impact of climate change on Mediterranean plant demography. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.","Age structure; Cistaceae; Coexistence; Demography; Dendrochronology; Gypsum environments; Helianthemum","calcium sulfate; rain; age structure; climate variation; coexistence; correlation; demographic survey; dendrochronology; gypsum; shrub; site effect; article; Cistaceae; drug effect; environment; growth, development and aging; histology; population dynamics; season; Spain; species difference; time; Calcium Sulfate; Cistaceae; Environment; Population Dynamics; Rain; Seasons; Spain; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Spain; Cistaceae; Helianthemum; Helianthemum squamatum; Helianthemum syriacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054042502

PM10, Black carbon (BC), SO2 and NO2 were reduced by 33%, 31%, 32% and 51%, respectively, whereas PM2.5 was not reduced during the Olympic period when compared to the reference period. Many pollution control measures that had been applied to prevent air pollution from contaminating the air quality in Beijing during the Olympic Games significantly reduced the larger particles (PM10), SO2 and NO2 but it did not as effectively reduce the much smaller particles (PM2.5). The sum of the measured water-soluble ions in total suspended particles (TSP) during the Olympic period was reduced by 35% when compared to the reference period. Each ion was reduced significantly by 43%-79% except for nitrogen-containing species. We estimated that CaSO4 reduction by 52% played a significant role in reducing larger particles during the Olympic period. Although many ions in PM2.5 showed a similar decreasing trend as those in TSP, NO3- in PM2.5 increased significantly. During the Olympic period, the atmospheric nitrogen cycle seemed to have been very complicated. Meteorological conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, or regional-scale air mass trajectory did not seem to be a major reason for the nitrate behavior. Instead, it is possible that the increase of ozone and/or oxidants around the center of Beijing may have accelerated the oxidation of nitrogen oxides to form nitrate. We found a trend in the concentration of high-molecular weight PAHs (HMW-PAHs), which had 5-7 rings decreased during the Olympic period. We considered that the reduction of HMW-PAHs that could be associated with the reduction of BC was due to the reduction of traffic flow resulting from traffic control measures implemented during that time period. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosol; Beijing; Black carbon; Olympic games; PM10; PM2.5; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); TSP; Water-soluble ions","Beijing; Black carbon; Olympic games; PM10; PM2.5; Polycyclic aromatics; TSP; Water-soluble ions; Air pollution control; Air quality; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric humidity; Ions; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Organic compounds; Ozone; Pollution; Pollution induced corrosion; Reduction; Traffic control; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; black carbon; calcium sulfate; nitrate; nitric oxide; nitrogen oxide; oxidizing agent; ozone; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfur dioxide; aerosol composition; air mass; air quality; air temperature; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; chemical composition; nitrogen oxides; Olympic Games; ozone; PAH; particulate matter; relative humidity; aerosol; air quality; article; chemical composition; China; humidity; nitrogen cycle; oxidation; particulate matter; pollution control; priority journal; sport; temperature measurement; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954576639

The model successfully reproduces general trends of a paleoclimate reconstruction of EP at the LGM except over the Atlantic Ocean. By conducting a series of sensitivity simulations, we investigate the mechanism controlling EP at the LGM in each basin. In the Southern Ocean, the model successfully reproduces the dipole pattern of the paleoreconstruction: the higher-latitude decrease and lower-latitude increase of EP. It is found that the lower-latitude increase of EP comes from iron fertilization effects by enhanced dust deposition, while the higher-latitude decrease of EP is caused by the reduction of surface shortwave due to spreading of sea ice there. We also find that increased dust input in other basins remotely affects EP in the Southern Ocean. In the Pacific Ocean, the model suggests that iron fertilization effects are dominant in open ocean regions. In the Atlantic Ocean, the model simulates overall reduction of EP, whereas the paleo reconstruction suggests the increase in some regions. We propose that the Atlantic response is strongly affected by distribution of iron limitation in a control climate. In our CTL simulation, the biological production is limited not by iron but by phosphate in the Atlantic Ocean, which leads to the decrease of EP in spite of the significant increase of dust deposition there. It is implied that the accurate evaluation of iron limitation in the present ocean is critical for evaluating changes in EP and associated reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentration at the LGM. © 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006711874

Our work makes use of the publicly available penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF) and gas and absorption line fitting (gandalf) IDL codes, aiming to improve the existing measurements for stellar kinematics, the strength of various absorption-line features, and the flux and width of the emissions from different species of ionized gas. Our fit to the stellar continuum uses both standard stellar population models and empirical templates obtained by combining a large number of stellar spectra in order to fit a subsample of high-quality SDSS spectra for quiescent galaxies. Furthermore, our fit to the nebular spectrum includes an exhaustive list of both recombination and forbidden lines. Foreground Galactic extinction is implicitly treated in our models, whereas reddening in the SDSS galaxies is included in the form of a simple dust screen component affecting the entire spectrum that is accompanied by a second reddening component affecting only the ionized gas emission. In order to check for systematic departures from the rather standard set of assumptions that enters our models, we provide a quality assessment for our fit to the SDSS spectra in our sample, for both the stellar continuum and the nebular emissions and across different wavelength regions. This quality assessment also allows the identification of objects with either problematic data or peculiar features. We hope to foster the discovery potential of our database; therefore, our spectral fit is available to the community. For example, based on the quality assessment around the Hα and [N II] λ6584 lines, approximately 1% of the SDSS spectra classified as ""galaxies"" by the SDSS pipeline do in fact require additional broad lines to be matched, even though they do not show a strong continuum from an active nucleus, as do the SDSS objects classified as ""quasars."" Finally, we provide new spectral templates for galaxies of different Hubble types, obtained by combining the results of our spectral fit for a subsample of 452 morphologically selected objects. © 2011.

Although, by far not perfect, the standard strategy employs the concept of relative biological effectiveness (RBE), which converts the delivered physical particle dose into a radio‐biologically equivalent dose of low LET beams. In order to introduce the respective RBE models into the inverse planning process of particle therapy one directly aims to optimize the biological effect, mostly expressed in terms of a linear quadratic model (LQM) for a dose‐effect relationship. We will first introduce the general framework of biological optimization for inverse planning of intensity modulated particle therapy (IMPT). The effects of the intrinsic radiation quality on the design of treatment plans will be demonstrated for various forms of dose delivery methods, like spread‐out Bragg peaks (SOBP), distal edge‐tracking (DET) or 3D‐spot scanning and different clinical treatment sites. So far, the employed models only account for the most important radiobiological factor, the anticipated local LET distribution, while other additional factors like the oxygen enhancement ratio or the influence of different fractionation schemes are not considered explicitly. Finally, another important issue will be briefly mentioned, the robustness of biologically optimized treatment plans versus uncertainties in the dose delivery process or even the limited knowledge of the biological input parameters of the employed models that are predicting the biological effect. Some results in the framework of the worst‐case optimization will be discussed. Learning Objectives: 1. To review the framework of biological inverse planning of carbon therapy 2.

Therefore, a sustainable approach to managing this waste has become a major concern in densely populated areas. Biological treatment is an efficient method for reducing the amount of organic waste, and for producing energy. A large number of biogas plants and compost facilities that use organic waste as a substrate for electricity and fuel production are being built around the world. The biological treatment process in these plants produces large amounts of organic waste, and there is therefore a growing need to find a sustainable use for this material. Organic waste, such as biogas residues and compost can be a valuable fertilizer for agricultural soils. They can serve as a source of plant nutrients and can also improve soil structure and water holding capacity. However, as organic residues are known to contain both heavy metals and organic contaminants there is a need for long term field experiments to ensure that soil and plant quality is maintained. In order to investigate the potential risks and benefits of using organic waste in agriculture, an 8. year field experiment was established in central Sweden. Under realistic conditions, compost and biogas residues from source-separated household waste were compared with traditional mineral fertilizer. We examined crop yield and soil chemical and microbiological properties. The main conclusion from the field experiment was that biogas residues resulted in crop yields almost as high as the mineral fertilizer NPS. In addition, several important soil microbiological properties, such as substrate induced respiration, potential ammonium oxidation and nitrogen mineralization were improved after application of both biogas residues and compost. Moreover, no negative effects could be detected from using either of the organic wastes. In particular the genetic structure of the soil bacterial community appeared to resist changes caused by addition of organic waste. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Microbial soil properties; Organic waste; Soil fertility; Soil properties","Ammonium compounds; Biochemical engineering; Biogas; Biological materials; Composting; Crops; Ecology; Experiments; Fertilizers; Heavy metals; Population statistics; Sewage; Silicate minerals; Soils; Substrates; Waste treatment; Agricultural soils; Ammonium oxidation; Biogas plants; Biological treatment; Biological treatment process; Compost facility; Crop yield; Efficient method; Field experiment; Fuel production; Genetic structure; Household waste; Land applications; Long term; Mineral fertilizers; Nitrogen mineralization; Organic contaminant; Organic residues; Organic waste; Organic wastes; Plant nutrients; Plant quality; Potential risks; Realistic conditions; Soil bacterial community; Soil fertility; Soil properties; Soil property; Soil structure; Substrate-induced respirations; Sustainable use; Water holding capacity; Energy conversion; agricultural soil; biogas; compost; crop yield; genetic structure; growth rate; microbial community; soil chemistry; soil ecosystem; soil fertility; soil microorganism; waste management; Sweden; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951510188

This modal shift from car and motorcycle to BRT reduced the emission intensity of primary pollutants, such as NO x and CO. We applied a combined structural equation model and an artificial neural network to evaluate the impact of the BRT system on the concentration of secondary pollutants in the roadside areas in the BRT corridors. An empirical analysis was carried out using data collected at five continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations located near to the BRT TransJakarta corridors in 2005. The establishment of our structural equation model gives a better understanding of the cause-effect relationship among the factors influencing roadside ambient air pollution, and was useful in simplifying the complexity of our artificial neural network model for predicting the modal shift's impact on the PM 10 values and concentration of O 3. The introduction of the BRT system, and the modal shift it produced, had a greater influence on rapidly decaying pollutants, such as PM 10, than on O 3 because of the exposure to near-source microenvironments, such as the roadside of the TransJakarta corridors. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Artificial neural network; Structural equation model; TransJakarta bus rapid transit system","Ambient air pollution; Ambient air quality; Artificial Neural Network; Artificial neural network models; Bus rapid transit systems; Cause-effect relationships; Emission intensity; Empirical analysis; Indonesia; Jakarta; Microenvironments; Modal shifts; Primary pollutants; Structural equation models; TransJakarta bus rapid transit system; Air quality; Buses; Light rail transit; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Pollution; Roadsides; Rapid transit; air quality; ambient air; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; bus transport; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); emission control; empirical analysis; nitrogen oxides; numerical model; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant; roadside environment; traffic emission; Indonesia; Jakarta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958754213

The study hypothesis is that urban regions alter the intensity and composition/structure of approaching thunderstorms because of land surface heterogeneity. Storm characteristics were studied over the Indianapolis region and four peripheral rural counties approximately 120 km away from the urban center. Using radar imagery, the time of event, changes in storm structure (splitting, initiation, intensification, and dissipation), synoptic setting, orientation, and motion were studied. It was found thatmore than 60%of storms changed structure over the Indianapolis area as compared with only 25%over the rural regions. Furthermore, daytime convection was most likely to be affected, with 71% of storms changing structure as compared with only 42%at night. Analysis of radar imagery indicated that storms split closer to the upwind urban region and merge again downwind. Thus, a larger portion of small storms (50-200 km2) and large storms (&gt;1500 km2) were found downwind of the urban region, whereas midsized storms (200-1500 km) dominated the upwind region. A case study of a typical storm on 13 June 2005 was examined using available observations and the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCARMesoscale Model (MM5), version 3.7.2. Two simulations were performed with and without the urban land use/Indianapolis region in the fourth domain (1.33-km resolution). The storm of interest could not be simulated without the urban area. Results indicate that removing the Indianapolis urban region caused distinct differences in the regional convergence and convection as well as in simulated base reflectivity, surface energy balance (through sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and virtual potential temperature changes), and boundary layer structure. Study results indicate that the urban area has a strong climatological influence on regional thunderstorms. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-land interaction; Convection; Heat islands; Mesoscale processes; Precipitation; Thunderstorms; Urban meteorology","Atmosphere-land interaction; Boundary layer structure; Heat island; Indiana; Indianapolis; Land surface; Mesoscale process; Pennsylvania; Potential temperature; Radar imagery; Rural regions; Sensible heat flux; Storm structure; Urban areas; Urban centers; Urban land use; Urban meteorology; Urban modification; Urban regions; Climatology; Heat flux; Radar imaging; Surface chemistry; Tracking radar; Thunderstorms; atmospheric convection; atmospheric modeling; boundary layer; climatology; heat island; mesoscale meteorology; meteorology; precipitation (climatology); radar imagery; storm; thunderstorm; urban area; urban atmosphere; Indiana; Indianapolis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959580404

The stereoscopy algorithm is adapted to work with either one- or two-dimensional data (i.e., from images or from observations that record the projected position of the source along an arbitrary axis). The accuracy of the algorithm is tested on simulated data, and then the algorithm is used to estimate the coronal radio source heights associated with the active region NOAA 10956, based on multifrequency imaging data over seven days from the Siberian Solar Radio Telescope near 5.7GHz, the Nobeyama Radio Heliograph at 17GHz, as well as one-dimensional scans at multiple frequencies spanning the 5.98-15.95GHz frequency range from the RATAN-600 instrument. The gyroresonance emission mechanism, which is sensitive to the coronal magnetic field strength, is applied to convert the estimated radio source heights at various frequencies, h(f), to information about magnetic field versus height B(h), and the results are compared to a magnetic field extrapolation derived from photospheric magnetic field observations obtained by Hinode and Michelson Doppler Imager. We found that the gyroresonant emission comes from heights exceeding the location of the third gyrolayer irrespective of the magnetic extrapolation method; implications of this finding for coronal magnetography and coronal plasma physics are discussed. © 2011.

Purified fibrinogen was exposed to 0, 25, 50 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2 for 5 min at 37°C and then stored at -80°C before analyses with LC-MS/MS. In a second series of experiments, normal plasma was exposed to 0 or 100 μmol/l CORM-2 in the absence or presence of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and hydroquinone (an organic reductant) to compete with carbon monoxide binding to a putative heme group found on fibrinogen. Coagulation was activated with tissue factor (n = 8 per condition). Thrombus growth was monitored with thrombelastography for 15 min. LC-MS/MS did not detect any direct modifications of amino acids in fibrinogen, but detection of small regions of both the alpha and gamma chains was lost following exposure to CORM-2 and endoproteinase digestion with trypsin and Glu-C. An ion with the same m/z and expected retention time as heme was found in the purified fibrinogen. Exposure of plasma to nitric oxide/hydroquinone significantly decreased CORM-2-mediated enhancement of coagulation without affecting the coagulation kinetics of plasma not exposed to CORM-2. Carbon monoxide derived from CORM-2 likely modifies fibrinogen via modulation of a fibrinogen-associated heme group(s). Whereas the precise molecular location of heme attachment and three-dimensional conformational change secondary to carbon monoxide exposure remain to be determined, fibrinogen appears to be a carbon monoxide sensing molecule. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health.

The range of coastal hazards includes climate-induced sea level rise, a long-term threat that demands broad response. Global sea levels rose 17 cm through the twentieth century, and are likely to rise more rapidly through the twenty-first century when a rise of more than 1 m is possible. In some locations, these changes may be exacerbated by (1) increases in storminess due to climate change, although this scenario is less certain, and (2) widespread human induced subsidence due to ground fluid withdrawal from, and drainage of, susceptible soils, especially in deltas. Relative sea level rise has a range of potential impacts, including higher extreme sea levels (and flooding), coastal erosion, salinization of surface and ground waters, and degradation of coastal habitats such as wetlands. Without adaptation, large land areas and millions of people could be displaced by sea level rise. Appropriate responses include climate mitigation (a global response) and/or adaptation (a local response). A combination of these strategies appears to be the most appropriate approach to sea level rise regardless of the uncertainty. Adaptation responses can be characterized as (1) protect, (2) accommodate, or (3) retreat. While these adaptation responses could reduce impacts significantly, they will need to be consistent with responses to all coastal hazards, as well as with wider societal and development objectives; hence, an integrated coastal management philosophy is required. In some developed countries, including England and the Netherlands, proactive adaptation plans are already being formulated. Coastal cities worldwide will be a major focus for adaptation efforts because of their concentrations of people and assets. Developing countries will pose adaptation challenges, especially in deltaic areas and small islands, which are the most vulnerable settings. © 2011 by The Oceanography Society.

This paper evaluates Guenther et al.'s [Guenther, A., Hewitt, C.N., Erickson, D., Fall, R., Geron, C., Graedel, T.E., Harley, P., Klinger, L., Lerdau, M., McKay, W.A., Pierce, T., Scholes, B., Steinbrecher, R., Tallamraju, R., Taylor, J., Zimmerman, P., 1995. A global model of natural volatile organic compound emissions. Journal of Geophysical Research 100, 8873-8892] global model of BVOC emissions, for application at a spatially detailed level to Hong Kong's tropical forested landscape using high resolution remote sensing and ground data. The emission estimates are based on a landscape approach which assigns emission rates directly to ecosystem types not to individual species, since unlike in temperate regions where one or two single species may dominate over large regions, Hong Kong's vegetation is extremely diverse with up to 300 different species in one hectare. The resulting BVOC emission maps are suitable for direct input to regional and local air quality models giving 10m raster output on an hourly basis over the whole of the Hong Kong territory, an area of 1100km2. Due to the spatially detailed mapping of isoprene emissions over the study area, it was possible to validate the model output using field data collected at a precise time and place by replicating those conditions in the model. The field measurement of emissions used for validating the model was based on a canister sampling technique, undertaken under different climatic conditions for Hong Kong's main ecosystem types in both urban and rural areas. The model-derived BVOC flux distributions appeared to be consistent with the field observations, indicating the robustness of the landscape modelling approach when applied to tropical forests at detailed level, as well as the promising role of remote sensing in BVOC mapping. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Foliar density; Hong kong; Leaf area index; Satellite image","Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Foliar density; Hong kong; Leaf Area Index; Satellite image; Air quality; Ecosystems; Estimation; Forestry; Gas chromatography; Remote sensing; Rural areas; Tropics; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric composition; biogenic volatile organic compound; organic compound; unclassified drug; volatile agent; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; data set; emission; estimation method; forest ecosystem; isoprene; landscape; leaf area index; measurement method; numerical model; observational method; remote sensing; resolution; rural area; satellite imagery; smog; spatial analysis; territory; urban area; volatile organic compound; air quality; article; ecosystem; Hong Kong; model; pollution monitoring; priority journal; tropical rain forest; vegetation; Air Quality; Ecosystems; Foliar Analysis; Forestry; Hong Kong; Image Analysis; Remote Sensing; Satellites; Tropics; Voc; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955484940

Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is widely recognized as a supporting tool that systematically integrates environmental aspects into strategic decision-making processes, thereby contributing to sustainable development. In this study, SEA was applied for an integrated assessment of environmental, social, and economic impacts of a wide range of scenarios for transport-related air quality policies to help decision-makers in identifying the most sustainable scenario with the purpose of reducing carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations from transport emissions in Hanoi City, Vietnam. In conducting SEA process, the urban air dispersion model MUAIR was used as a quantitative tool in prediction of CO concentrations. To evaluate the predicted impacts of scenarios, the SEA objectives concerning sustainability and the corresponding sustainable indicators were identified. Based on the likely significant predicted impacts on landscape, biodiversity, and health benefits, mitigation measures were proposed. These included planning in infrastructure development and implementation of public education campaign. The results of predicted and evaluated impacts of scenarios as well as proposed mitigation measures were taken into account for supporting sound decision-making that is consistent with the principles of sustainable development. Considering sustainable impacts of the scenarios, the SEA result clearly indicates that a combination of policy for public transport development and policy for installation of oxidation catalytic converter for motorcycles is the most sustainable scenario for reducing CO concentrations from transport emissions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","CO; Decision-making process; MUAIR; Strategic environmental assessment; Transport emissions; Transport-related air quality policy","air quality; carbon monoxide; decision making; economic impact; infrastructural development; policy making; pollution policy; public transport; strategic environmental assessment; sustainable development; traffic emission; transportation development; Hanoi; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955553844

The feeding strategy of two dominant Collembola species, epedaphic Isotoma viridis and euedaphic Willemia anophthalma was determined. The investigation was conducted following a shift to amaranth, a C4 plant, after 27years of continuous C3 crop rotation. The influence of new C4 plant carbon was observed in microbial phospholipids (PLFAs) with higher δ13C recorded in C4 amaranth than in C3 clover soils. The strongest enrichment occurred in the fungal PLFA 18:2ω6,9c and bacterial PLFA 18:1ω9t with 11.2‰ and 6.6‰, respectively. However, other bacterial PLFAs showed no isotopic change, suggesting that the microbial community simultaneously utilized "" new"" and "" old"" plant carbon. The δ13C of Collembola fatty acids displayed species specific lipid pattern, which was affected by crop type, but not fertilizer amendments. Isotopic separation of Collembola lipids from amaranth and clover plots was more distinct in I. viridis than W. anophthalma. With up to 18‰, the enrichment in Collembola lipids was stronger than in microbial PLFAs, pointing to a distinct incorporation of carbon resources originating from the actual plant residues. The δ13C pattern in I. viridis indicated trophic links with bacteria, saprotrophic fungi and plant tissues, while saprotrophic fungi and plant tissues were accountable for the patterns observed in W. anophthalma. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.","Carbon dynamics; Collembola; Diet; Fatty acid biomarkers; Fertilization; Stable isotopes","arable farming; bacterium; biomarker; C4 plant; carbon isotope; crop rotation; diet; fatty acid; feeding behavior; fertilizer application; fungus; insect; isotopic analysis; lipid; microbial activity; microbial community; phospholipid; saprotrophy; soil microorganism; stable isotope; Amaranthus caudatus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Collembola; Fungi; Isotoma viridis; Trifolium; Willemia anophthalma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957938782

Here, coconut methyl ester (CME), palm methyl ester (PME) and soybean methyl ester (SME) were tested to represent the wide spectrum of degree of saturations in the fatty acid composition. Fossil diesel which served as the blending component was used as the baseline fuel for benchmarking purposes. Phase I examined how engine speed and load affect patterns of variation in tailpipe emissions and engine performance parameters for the test fuels. Here, the trends in engine-out responses across the operational speed-load map for all the tested biodiesel fuels were similar and consistent throughout. However, there were marked differences in the levels of equivalence ratio and specific fuel consumption, as well as exhaust concentrations of CO, UHC and smoke opacity. This is mainly due to differences in fuel properties, especially fuel-bound oxygen content, density and impurity level. Phase II appraised the performance of 31 different fuel blend combinations of fossil diesel blended with CME, PME or SME at 10 vol.% interval under a steady-state test cycle. The use of biodiesel fuels with low to moderate degree of unsaturation was found to conclusively reduce regulated emission species of UHC, NO and smoke opacity levels by up to 41.7%, 5.4% and 61.3%, respectively. This is in contrast to the performance of the highly unsaturated SME, where CO, UHC, NO and smoke opacity levels are higher in relation to that of fossil diesel. Simultaneous NO-smoke reduction can be achieved through the introduction of at least 1 vol.% of PME or 50 vol.% of CME into diesel fuel, although minor trade-off in the higher specific fuel consumption is observed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Seeking to capitalize on the emergent ""green"" consumer, corporations are leading the next iteration in carbon footprinting: consumer products. This potentially lucrative low-carbon frontier, however, faces steep challenges due to complexities of scale, largely a function of the number of actors and geographies involved in globalized commodity and energy networks, and scope, which increasingly demands inclusion of emissions due to land use change (e.g., bio fuel production, timber harvest, livestock grazing, mining). Life cycle assessment (LCA)-the principal method behind product level GHG emissions footprint protocols-frequently avoids these challenges by narrowly delineating system boundaries, thereby excluding the ""messiness"" of space and place. Through a comparative model of energy sources and emissions in the globalized paper industry, this article reveals how complexities associated with geographic variation and land use change create indeterminacy in footprints based on these protocols. Using industry and trade data, the authors develop geographic information system transportation and energy models to map the globally dispersed pulp supply networks and to rescale Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change GHG inventory guidelines to include carbon loss associated with land use change in the carbon footprint of coated paper. Given their integrative abilities to conceptualize and model coupled human-ecological systems, sophisticated understanding of time-space dynamics and critical theoretical insights, geographers have much to contribute to the LCA and product carbon footprinting enterprise, which to date has been largely the intellectual domain of engineers. © 2011 by Association of American Geographers.","Carbon labels; Emissions; Land use change; Life cycle assessment; Paper industry","environmental economics; GIS; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; land use change; life cycle analysis; pulp and paper industry; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958703036

Earthworm gut, casts, and burrows have exhibited higher denitrification activities than the bulk soil, implicating priming of denitrifying organisms as a possible mechanism for this effect. Furthermore, the earthworm feeding strategy may drive N2O emissions, as it determines access to fresh organic matter for denitrification. Here, we determined whether interactions between earthworm feeding strategy and the soil denitrifier community can predict N2O emissions from the soil. We set up a 90-day mesocosm experiment in which 15N-labeled maize (Zea mays L.) was either mixed in or applied on top of the soil in the presence or absence of the epigeic earthworm Lumbricus rubellus and/or the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa. We measured N2O fluxes and tested the bulk soil for denitrification enzyme activity and the abundance of 16S rRNA and denitrifier genes nirS and nosZ through real-time quantitative PCR. Compared to the control, L. rubellus increased denitrification enzyme activity and N2O emissions on days 21 and 90 (day 21, P = 0.034 and P = 0.002, respectively; day 90, P = 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively), as well as cumulative N2O emissions (76%; P = 0.014). A. caliginosa activity led to a transient increase of N2O emissions on days 8 to 18 of the experiment. Abundance of nosZ was significantly increased (100%) on day 90 in the treatment mixture containing L. rubellus alone. We conclude that L. rubellus increased cumulative N2O emissions by affecting denitrifier community activity via incorporation of fresh residue into the soil and supplying a steady, labile carbon source. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.",,"16S rRNA; Aporrectodea caliginosa; Arable soils; Bulk soils; Crop residue; Denitrification enzyme activities; Denitrifiers; Denitrifying organisms; Earthworm feeding; Epigeic earthworms; Labile carbon; Maize (Zea mays L.); Mesocosms; Nitrous oxide; Real-time quantitative PCR; Agricultural wastes; Anesthetics; Association reactions; Denitrification; Enzyme activity; Experiments; Genes; Grain (agricultural product); Nitrogen oxides; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Soils; nitrous oxide; abundance; agricultural soil; crop residue; denitrification; earthworm; maize; mesocosm; microbial community; nitrous oxide; polymerase chain reaction; soil amendment; soil emission; soil fauna; animal; animal food; annelid worm; article; bacterium; chemistry; denitrification; maize; metabolism; microbiology; soil; Animal Feed; Animals; Bacteria; Denitrification; Nitrous Oxide; Oligochaeta; Soil; Zea mays; Aporrectodea caliginosa; Lumbricus rubellus; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960097507

High [Al] occurred under acidic conditions and for acid runoff neutralised by bicarbonate rich groundwater. Thermodynamic analysis indicates Al hydroxide/hydroxy-silicate oversaturation at circumneutral pH across the rivers, but undersaturation at lower/higher pH. The oversaturation reflects in part the presence of Al bearing colloids as indicated by (1) [Al] being correlated with components associated with both lithogenic (Fe, Ti and lanthanides) colloids and organic carbon, (2) baseflow studies using cross-flow ultrafiltration and (3) comparison of our data with Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN) information on labile and non-labile Al. Tree harvesting and emission reductions of SO x in acidic and acid sensitive catchments in mid-Wales led to acidification reversal, lower [Al] and changing [H +] - [Al] relationships. The [Al] decline was confined to acidic conditions while [Al] increased during the later part of the monitoring period with a peak around 2002 for moorland and forested systems. Colloidal production across the flow range was indicated late in the record by comparison of our data with information collected by the AWMN for a site in mid-Wales. This production seems interlinked with organic carbon and with dissolved CO 2 changes. In order for further understanding of Al hydrogeochemistry in river systems there is a need to integrate research that moves from equilibrium to kinetic and colloidal consideration including the critical issues of organic and inorganic controls within the context of bioavailability and aquatic stress. The colloidal Al may well be of low environmental concern to fish and other factors such as habitat may well be critical. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"aluminum; river water; article; colloid; ecotoxicology; habitat; kinetics; priority journal; research; river ecosystem; thermodynamics; United Kingdom; water contamination; Aluminum; Carbon; Colloids; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Great Britain; Kinetics; Rivers; Water Pollution, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961130976

Understanding how soil pools of these two elements change in response to disturbance and management is critical to maintaining ecosystem services such as forest productivity, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water resource protection. Fire is one of the principal disturbances acting on forest soil C and N storage and is also the subject of enormous management efforts. In the present article, we use meta-analysis to quantify fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage. Across a combined total of 468 soil C and N response ratios from 57 publications (concentrations and pool sizes), fire had significant overall effects on soil C (-26%) and soil N (-22%). The impacts of fire on forest floors were significantly different from its effects on mineral soils. Fires reduced forest floor C and N storage (pool sizes only) by an average of 59% and 50%, respectively, but the concentrations of these two elements did not change. Prescribed fires caused smaller reductions in forest floor C and N storage (-46% and-35%) than wildfires (-67% and-69%), and the presence of hardwoods also mitigated fire impacts. Burned forest floors recovered their C and N pools in an average of 128 and 103 years, respectively. Among mineral soils, there were no significant changes in C or N storage, but C and N concentrations declined significantly (-11% and-12%, respectively). Mineral soil C and N concentrations were significantly affected by fire type, with no change following prescribed burns, but significant reductions in response to wildfires. Geographic variation in fire effects on mineral soil C and N storage underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and the role of fire type in mediating C and N shifts (especially in the forest floor) indicates that averting wildfires through prescribed burning is desirable from a soils perspective. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Carbon sinks; Fire; Forest management; Meta-analysis; Soil carbon; Soil nitrogen; Temperate forests","carbon; nitrogen; disturbance; ecosystem service; forest floor; forest management; forest soil; forestry production; greenhouse gas; meta-analysis; mineral; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; temperate environment; wildfire; article; chemistry; ecosystem; fire; soil; tree; Carbon; Ecosystem; Fires; Nitrogen; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958846376

Investigations with solvatochromic probes in CB7 reveal that the polarity of the cavity resembles that of alcohols (e.g., n-octanol), while its polarizability (P=0.12) and apparent refractive index (nD=1.10±0.12) are extremely low, close to the gas phase. The calculated molecular quadrupole moments of CBs are extremely large (Θzz=- 120 to -340 Buckingham). A survey of reported binding constants of neutral guests and hydrophobic residues that form 1 :1 inclusion complexes with CB6, reveals a preferential inclusion of C3-C5 residues in its cavity. The largest guests which show non-negligible binding contain 7 heavy atoms (excluding hydrogen). For CB7, the strongest binding is observed for guests with adamantyl (10 heavy atoms) and ferrocenyl groups (11 heavy atoms), while the largest guests known to be complexed are carborane and the adduct of two pyridine derivatives (12 heavy atoms). The evaluation of different volumes shows that the most meaningful cavity, namely that responsible for binding of hydrophobic residues, is confined by the planes through the oxygen carbonyls. The volume of this inner cavity follows the formula V/ Å3=68+62(n-5)+12.5(n- 5)2, affording representative cavity volumes of 68 Å3 for CB5, 142 Å3 for CB6, 242 Å3 for CB7, and 367 Å3 for CB8. The volume of the 2 bond dipole regions is comparably smaller, amounting, for example, to 2×35 Å3 for CB6. The analysis of packing coefficients for representative sets of known guests with clearly defined hydrophobic binding motifs reveals average values of 47% for CB5, 58% for CB6, 52% for CB7, and 53% for CB8, which are well in line with the preferred packing (""55% solution"", see S. Mecozzi, J. Rebek, Chem. Eur. J. 1998, 4, 1016-1022) in related supramolecular host-guest assemblies. The driving force for binding of hydrophobic guests and residues by CBs is interpreted in terms of the unimportance of dispersion interactions (owing to the low polarizability of their cavity) and the dominance of classical and nonclassical hydrophobic effects related to the removal of very-high-energy water molecules (2 for CB5, 4 for CB6, 8 for CB7, and 12 for CB8) from the cavity. © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Specifically, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is evaluated for its ability to simulate the change in ozone (O3) levels in response to significant reductions in nitric oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions from the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call and vehicle fleet turnover between the years of 2002 and 2005. The dynamic model evaluation (i.e., the evaluation of a model's ability to predict changes in pollutant levels given changes in emissions) differs from previous approaches by explicitly accounting for known uncertainties in the NOx emissions inventories. Uncertainty in three sectors of NOx emissions is considered - area sources, mobile sources, and point sources - and is propagated using sensitivity coefficients calculated by the decoupled direct method in three dimensions (DDM-3D). The change in O3 levels between 2002 and 2005 is estimated based on differences in the empirical distributions of the modeled and observed data during the two years. Results indicate that the CMAQ model is able to reproduce the observed change in daily maximum 8-hr average O3 levels at more than two-thirds of Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring locations when a relatively moderate amount of uncertainty (50%) is assumed in area and mobile emissions of NOx together with a low amount of uncertainty (3%) in the utility sector (elevated point sources) emissions. The impact of other sources of uncertainty in the model is also briefly explored. © 2011.","Air quality modeling; CMAQ; DDM; Direct decoupled method; Dynamic model evaluation; Ozone; Sensitivity; Uncertainty","Air quality modeling; CMAQ; DDM; Decoupled methods; Dynamic model evaluation; Sensitivity; Uncertainty; Air quality; Dynamic models; Emission control; Fleet operations; Nitric oxide; Ozone; Pollution; Quality assurance; Reduction; Quality control; nitric oxide; ozone; air quality; emission inventory; nitric oxide; ozone; point source; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; air monitoring; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; article; community multiscale air quality model; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959764019

Since the utilization of energy resources is the main source of GHG emissions, restructuring current energy systems in order to incorporate low-carbon energy technologies is essential for the realization of the LCS vision. Energy policies promoting the penetration of these technologies must view the role of energy in society as a system, composed of several energy resources, conversion technologies and energy demand sectors. The feasibility of the LCS in the future can be better understood by means of energy models. Energy models are valuable mathematical tools based on the systems approach. They have been applied to aid decision-making in energy planning, to analyze energy policies and to analyze the implications arising from the introduction of technologies. The design of the LCS requires innovative energy systems considering a trans-disciplinary approach that integrates multi-dimensional elements, related to social, economic, and environmental aspects. This paper reviews the application of energy models considering scenarios towards an LCS under the energy systems approach. The models reviewed consider the utilization of waste for energy, the penetration of clean coal technologies, transportation sector models as a sample of sectoral approaches, and models related to energy-for-development issues in rural areas of developing countries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Appreciation of benefits such as technology transfer and local environmental improvement in developing countries increases the preference of collaboration with developing countries. Two factors hinder Japanese local governments' collaboration with developing countries from the perspective of citizens: a sense of environmental responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the city and a preference for domestic orientation even if the collaboration with developing countries is less costly and has benefits of technology transfer and local environmental improvement. The preference for a lower total cost of GHG emissions reductions is confirmed except for those with a sense of environmental responsibility.

Oxygen and H isotope compositions of the released water suggest a local meteoric origin. Combined with the positive Eu anomalies of the water, a large 18O shift of the water suggests extensive interaction with rocks.

The enrichments of Eu and 18O in water and the low thermal gradient of the area suggest that the water-rock interactions possibly occur deeper than 3670±200m. On the other hand, considering the relationship to the petroleum reservoir around the mud volcanoes, the depth of the gases can be derived from about 3600m, a depth that is greater than that generally estimated for reservoirs whose gas is characterized by 13C-enriched CO2. Oil biodegradation with CO2 reduction likely occurs at a shallower depth along the seepage system of the mud volcano. The results contribute to the worldwide data set of gas genesis in mud volcanoes. Moreover, they further support the concept that most terrestrial mud volcanoes release thermogenic gas produced in very deep sediments and may be early indicators of oil biodegradation, an important problem in the petroleum industry. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Cenozoic; Chemical compositions; Comprehensive studies; Data sets; Isotope compositions; Junggar Basin; Low-thermal gradients; Mesozoic; Methanogenesis; Mud volcanoes; Northwestern China; Oil biodegradation; Thermogenic gas; Thermogenic hydrocarbons; Water rock interactions; Anoxic sediments; Biodegradation; Carbon dioxide; Degradation; Europium; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Isotopes; Microbiology; Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Volcanoes; biodegradation; Cenozoic; chemical composition; gas field; Mesozoic; methanogenesis; mud volcano; oxygen isotope; petrochemical industry; petroleum; seepage; shale; water-rock interaction; China; Junggar Basin; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956260244

Rational engineering of carbon flow in plant cells requires a greater understanding of how starch breakdown fluxes respond to variations in enzyme concentrations, kinetic parameters, and metabolite concentrations. We have therefore developed and simulated a detailed kinetic ordinary differential equation model of the degradation pathways for starch synthesized in plants and green algae, which to our knowledge is the most complete such model reported to date.Results: Simulation with 9 internal metabolites and 8 external metabolites, the concentrations of the latter fixed at reasonable biochemical values, leads to a single reference solution showing β-amylase activity to be the rate-limiting step in carbon flow from starch degradation. Additionally, the response coefficients for stromal glucose to the glucose transporter kcatand KMare substantial, whereas those for cytosolic glucose are not, consistent with a kinetic bottleneck due to transport. Response coefficient norms show stromal maltopentaose and cytosolic glucosylated arabinogalactan to be the most and least globally sensitive metabolites, respectively, and β-amylase kcatand KMfor starch to be the kinetic parameters with the largest aggregate effect on metabolite concentrations as a whole. The latter kinetic parameters, together with those for glucose transport, have the greatest effect on stromal glucose, which is a precursor for biofuel synthetic pathways. Exploration of the steady-state solution space with respect to concentrations of 6 external metabolites and 8 dynamic metabolite concentrations show that stromal metabolism is strongly coupled to starch levels, and that transport between compartments serves to lower coupling between metabolic subsystems in different compartments.Conclusions: We find that in the reference steady state, starch cleavage is the most significant determinant of carbon flux, with turnover of oligosaccharides playing a secondary role. Independence of stationary point with respect to initial dynamic variable values confirms a unique stationary point in the phase space of dynamically varying concentrations of the model network. Stromal maltooligosaccharide metabolism was highly coupled to the available starch concentration. From the most highly converged trajectories, distances between unique fixed points of phase spaces show that cytosolic maltose levels depend on the total concentrations of arabinogalactan and glucose present in the cytosol. In addition, cellular compartmentalization serves to dampen much, but not all, of the effects of one subnetwork on another, such that kinetic modeling of single compartments would likely capture most dynamics that are fast on the timescale of the transport reactions. © 2011 Nag et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"algae; Chlorophyta; Embryophyta; beta amylase; glucose; glucose transporter; starch; article; biological model; chemistry; chloroplast; cluster analysis; cytology; enzymology; kinetics; metabolism; plant; solubility; beta-Amylase; Chloroplasts; Cluster Analysis; Glucose; Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Plants; Solubility; Starch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958846527

The use of OTCs clearly raised temperature and decreased soil moisture. The aboveground plant and root biomass increased in all OTCs in two meadows. A small temperature increase in OTCs resulted in swamp meadow acting as a net carbon sink and alpine meadow as a net source, and further warming intensified this processes, at least in a short term.

Fuel bioethanol burns cleaner than gasoline, is derived from renewable agricultural products, and creates local jobs and income. In December 2007, President Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which increased the renewable fuel standard that was mandated under energy Policy Act of 2005 to 36 billion gallons by 2022.In order to achieve this goal, ethanol production would need to be generated primarily from corn and cellulosic materials. Bioethanol producers are currently involved in variety of technological innovations to reduce energy consumption and production costs, increased efficiency and reduced emissions using the best available control technologies. However, industrial ethanol fermentation is a non-sterile process and contaminant microorganisms can lead to a decrease in industrial productivity and significant economic loss. Currently, bioethanol industries use different antimicrobials including antibiotics to control the contaminants in the fermentors. The emergence of antibiotic resistance among contaminant bacteria in bioethanol fermentors warrants the need for alternative antimicrobials to retain bioethanol production at a profitable level. In addition more and more ethanol producers are seeking to generate distillers grains that can be labeled antibiotic free to be sold in international markets where some restrictions are already in place for reducing and/or eliminating antibiotics usage in animal feed. This review examines the contamination problems, various intervention methods, emergence of antibiotic resistance in contaminant bacteria, and potential alternative options to elucidate antimicrobial products from various natural sources. In particular, emphasis has been given for natural antibacterial products from plant derived products to suggest a new research avenue for the search of new, non-conventional antimicrobial agents to control the contamination problem in the fuel bioethanol industries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This report includes the EC-IC bypass experience of a single centre over a period of 14 years. All consecutive 72 patients with atherosclerotic occlusive cerebrovascular lesions associated with haemodynamic compromise treated by EC-IC bypass surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Pre-operatively, 61% of patients presented with minor stroke and the remaining 39% with recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) despite maximal medical therapy. Angiography revealed a unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis/occlusion in 79%, bilateral ICA stenosis/occlusion in 15%, MCA stenosis/occlusion in 3% and other multiple vessel stenosis/occlusion in 3% of the cases. H215O positron emission tomography (PET) or 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT with acetazolamide challenge was performed for haemodynamic evaluation of the cerebral blood flow (CBF). All the patients had impaired haemodynamics pre-operatively in terms of reduced regional cerebrovascular reserve capacity and rCBF. Standard STA-MCA bypass procedure was performed in all patients. A total of 68 patients with 82 bypasses were reviewed with a mean follow-up period of 34 months. Stroke recurrence took place in 10 patients (15%) resulting in an annual stroke risk of 5%. Improved cerebral haemodynamics was documented in 81% of revascularised hemispheres. Patients with unchanged or worse haemodynamic parameters had significantly more post-operative TIAs or strokes when compared to those with improved perfusion reserves (30% vs.5% of patients, p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, EC-IC bypass procedure in selected patients with occlusive cerebrovascular lesions associated with haemodynamic impairment has revealed to be effective for prevention of further cerebral ischemia, when compared with a stroke risk rate of 15% reported to date in patients only under antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy. © 2011 The Neurosurgical Foundation.","carotid occlusion; EC-IC bypass; H2 15O PET; haemodynamic compromise; stroke prevention","acetazolamide; deuterium; hexamethylpropylene amine oxime technetium tc 99m; oxygen 15; warfarin; adult; aged; anticoagulant therapy; article; brain angiography; brain blood flow; brain hemorrhage; cerebral revascularization; chronic disease; cognitive reserve; Doppler flowmetry; drug withdrawal; extraintracranial anastomosis; female; follow up; heart atrium fibrillation; heart infarction; hemodynamics; human; internal carotid artery occlusion; kidney failure; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; middle cerebral artery occlusion; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; positron emission tomography; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; single photon emission computer tomography; stroke; transient ischemic attack; traumatic brain injury; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carotid Artery, Internal; Cerebral Revascularization; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Intracranial Arteriosclerosis; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Stroke; Switzerland; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957608971

This activity, deeply rooted in the culture and rural economy of the region, requires an urgent transformation if it is to become both more efficient and environmentally friendly. Silvopastoral systems that incorporate native trees and shrubs are instrumental for the productive rehabilitation of cattle production and for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. We discuss research progress and adoption of intensive silvopastoral systems in Colombia and Mexico. Intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) are a sustainable form of agroforestry for livestock production that combines fodder shrubs planted at high densities (more than 10,000 plants ha-1), trees and palms, and improved pastures. High stocking and the natural production of milk and meat in these systems are achieved through rotational grazing with electric fencing and a permanent supply of water for the cattle. While milk and meat production and cattle reproduction are enhanced, production costs decline as external inputs are replaced by natural processes related to fertility and biological control.

Rheological measurements are often performed to support the characterisation of the compounds. In this communication it is demonstrated that the crystallisation of polycarbonates in the molten state has to be taken into account for a comprehensive assessment of rheological experiments. This is particularly evident in the case of filled materials as particles can act as nucleating agents. The crystallisation behaviour of neat and filled polycarbonates is investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and its influence on rheological properties presented by dynamic-mechanical and creep experiments. From the results, the role of crystallisation processes becomes evident for a reliable interpretation of rheological investigations on polycarbonates and their modelling. Comparative measurements on the non-crystallisable polymethylmethacrylate underline the importance of a thorough discussion of the crystallinity in the case of polycarbonates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Land use changes can increase C loss rates which are extremely difficult to reverse, in the short term, opposite to organic carbon (OC) which accumulates in soil in the long-term. The aim of this research is to improve and test methodologies to assess land cover change (LCC) dynamics and temporal and spatial variability in C stored in vegetation at a wide scale. LCCs between 1956 and 2007 in Andalusia (Southern Spain) were selected for this pilot study, assessed by comparison of spatial data from 1956 to 2007 and were reclassified following land cover flows (LCFs) reported in major areas in Europe. Carbon vegetation densities were related to land cover, and C vegetation stocks for 1956 and 2007 were calculated by multiplying C density for each land cover class with land cover areas. The study area has supported important changes during the studied period with significant consequences for vegetation C stocks, mainly due to afforestation and intensification of agriculture, resulting in a total vegetation C stock of 156.08. Tg in 2007, with an increase of 17.24. Tg since 1956. This study demonstrates the importance of LCC for C sequestration in vegetation from Mediterranean areas, highlighting possible directions for management policies in order to mitigate climate change as well as promoting land conservation.

The consequence is that a large amount of power is wasted meaninglessly. With the broad availability of flexible-lighting technology like light-emitting diode lamps and everywhere available wireless internet connection, fast reacting, reliably operating, and power-conserving street lighting systems become reality. The purpose of this work is to describe the Smart Street Lighting (SSL) system, a first approach to accomplish the demand for flexible public lighting systems. Design/methodology/approach: This work presents the SSL system, a framework developed for a dynamic switching of street lamps based on pedestrians' locations and desired safety (or ""fear"") zones. In the developed system prototype, each pedestrian is localized via his/her smartphone, periodically sending location and configuration information to the SSL server. For street lamp control, each and every lamppost is equipped with a ZigBee-based radio device, receiving control information from the SSL server via multi-hop routing. Findings: This research paper confirms that the application of the proposed SSL system has great potential to revolutionize street lighting, particularly in suburban areas with low-pedestrian frequency. More important, the broad utilization of SSL can easily help to overcome the regulatory requirement for CO2 emission reduction by switching off lampposts whenever they are not required. Research limitations/implications: The paper discusses in detail the implementation of SSL, and presents results of its application on a small scale. Experiments have shown that objects like trees can interrupt wireless communication between lampposts and that inaccuracy of global positioning system position detection can lead to unexpected lighting effects. Originality/value: This paper introduces the novel SSL framework, a system for fast, reliable, and energy efficient street lamp switching based on a pedestrian's location and personal desires of safety. Both safety zone definition and position estimation in this novel approach is accomplished using standard smartphone capabilities.

Besides a cooled high-pressure EGR and the turbocharger with variable geometry turbine, the low-pressure EGR introduces an additional degree of freedom to control the cylinder charge. This increasing complexity of the air system can be handled with model based control structures and a model based controller calibration. Its static and dynamic properties are investigated. Besides the static couplings in the classical air path, additional couplings appear. A decentralised gain scheduled PI(D)-control approach is chosen to control the variables air mass flow rate, high-pressure EGR mass flow rate and charge air pressure. An automated controller calibration, based on a semi-physical mean value model of reduced complexity, is presented. The controller maps depend on the engine operation point and are calibrated by a local linearisation of the semi-physical model. Further, a semi-physical control is capable to almost solely control the air mass flow rate via the low-pressure EGR actuators. This control implicitly accounts for couplings between charge air pressure, high-pressure EGR and the low-pressure EGR system.

Few studies have either documented phenological advances or tested their climatic causes and demographic consequences in wild mammal systems. Using a long-term study of red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, we present evidence of significant temporal trends in six phenological traits: oestrus date and parturition date in females, and antler cast date, antler clean date, rut start date and rut end date in males. These traits advanced by between 5 and 12 days across a 28-year study period. Local climate measures associated with plant growth in spring and summer (growing degree days) increased significantly over time and explained a significant amount of variation in all six phenological traits, largely accounting for temporal advances observed in some of the traits. However, there was no evidence for temporal changes in key female reproductive performance traits (offspring birth weight and offspring survival) in this population, despite significant relationships between these traits and female phenology. In males, average antler weights increased over time presumably as a result of improved resource availability and physiological condition through spring and summer. There was no evidence for any temporal change in average male annual breeding success, as might be expected if the timing of male rutting behaviour was failing to track advances in the timing of oestrus in females. Our results provide rare evidence linking phenological advances to climate warming in a wild mammal and highlight the potential complexity of relationships between climate warming, phenology and demography in wild vertebrates. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate warming; Demography; Mammal; Phenology; Plant growth; Reproductive fitness; Sexual selection; Ungulate","climate change; deer; demographic trend; ecosystem response; environmental change; growth response; phenology; plant; reproductive behavior; rutting; temporal variation; trend analysis; vegetation dynamics; warming; Hebrides; Highland; Inner Hebrides; Rum; Scotland; United Kingdom; Aves; Cervus elaphus; Mammalia; Ungulata; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957859816

The aggregates were electrically conductive, with conductivities 3-fold higher than the conductivities previously reported for dual-species aggregates of Geobacter species in which the two species appeared to exchange electrons via interspecies electron transfer. The temperature dependence response of the aggregate conductance was characteristic of the organic metallic-like conductance previously described for the conductive pili of Geobacter sulfurreducens and was inconsistent with electron conduction through minerals. Studies in which aggregates were incubated with high concentrations of potential electron donors demonstrated that the aggregates had no significant capacity for conversion of hydrogen to methane. The aggregates converted formate to methane but at rates too low to account for the rates at which that the aggregates syntrophically metabolized ethanol, an important component of the reactor influent. Geobacter species comprised 25% of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from the aggregates, suggesting that Geobacter species may have contributed to some but probably not all of the aggregate conductivity. Microorganisms most closely related to the acetate-utilizing Methanosaeta concilii accounted for more than 90% of the sequences that could be assigned to methane producers, consistent with the poor capacity for hydrogen and formate utilization. These results demonstrate for the first time that methanogenic wastewater aggregates can be electrically conductive and suggest that direct interspecies electron transfer could be an important mechanism for electron exchange in some methanogenic systems. IMPORTANCE: The conversion of waste organic matter to methane is an important bioenergy strategy, and a similar microbial metabolism of complex organic matter in anaerobic soils and sediments plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Studies with laboratory cultures have demonstrated that hydrogen or formate can serve as an electron shuttle between the microorganisms degrading organic compounds and methanogens. However, the importance of hydrogen and formate as intermediates in the conversion of organic matter to methane in natural communities is less clear. The possibility that microorganisms within some natural methanogenic aggregates may directly exchange electrons, rather than producing hydrogen or formate as an intermediary electron carrier, is a significant paradigm shift with implications for the modeling and design of anaerobic wastewater reactors and for understanding how methanogenic communities will respond to environmental perturbations. © 2011 Morita et al.",,"acetic acid; alcohol; formic acid; hydrogen; methane; mineral; RNA 16S; methane; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic reactor; article; bacterial metabolism; bacterium pilus; concentration (parameters); controlled study; electric conductivity; electron transport; gene sequence; Geobacter; Geobacter sulfurreducens; interspecific relationship; methanogenic bacterium; Methanosaeta concilii; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; temperature; unindexed sequence; waste water; archaebacterium; bacterium; chemistry; classification; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; sewage; Geobacter sp.; Geobacter sulfurreducens; Methanosaeta concilii; Archaea; Bacteria; Electron Transport; Methane; Molecular Sequence Data; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052564960

We evaluated the usefulness of a dual stable isotope approach (δ13C, δ18O) for comparing the physiological performance of remaining trees between forest stands subjected to two different thinning intensities (moderate versus heavy) in a 60-year-old Pinus halepensis Mill. plantation in semiarid southeastern Spain. We measured bulk leaf δ13C and δ18O, foliar elemental concentrations, stem water content, stem water δ18O (δ18Ostemwater), tree ring widths and leaf gas exchange rates to assess the influence of forest stand density on tree performance. Remaining trees in low-density stands (heavily thinned) showed lower leaf δ18O, and higher stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthetic rate and radial growth than those in moderate-density stands (moderately thinned). By contrast, leaf δ13C, intrinsic water-use efficiency, foliar elemental concentrations and δ18Ostemwater were unaffected by stand density. Lower foliar δ18O in heavily thinned stands reflected higher gs of remaining trees due to decreased inter-tree competition for water, whereas higher photosynthetic rate was largely attributable to reduced stomatal limitation to CO2 uptake. The dual isotope approach provided insight into the early (12months) effects of stand density manipulation on the physiological performance of remaining trees. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Competition; Drought stress; Dual isotope approach; Oxygen isotopic composition; Pinus halepensis; Stomatal conductance","coniferous forest; drought stress; gas exchange; isotopic composition; oxygen isotope; photosynthesis; physiological response; population density; semiarid region; silviculture; stomatal conductance; thinning; tree ring; water availability; water content; Spain; Pinus halepensis; carbon; oxygen; rain; water; article; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; photosynthesis; pine; plant leaf; plant stem; season; Spain; temperature; tree; Carbon; Ecosystem; Oxygen; Oxygen Isotopes; Photosynthesis; Pinus; Plant Leaves; Plant Stems; Rain; Seasons; Spain; Temperature; Trees; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955729812

Besides, it may contribute to develop new mobility models which are more respectful to the environment. Therefore, this is the main objective of the LIFE+ Zero-HyTechPark in order to get more sustainable Technology Parks. On FHa building a real isolated hybrid (photovoltaic/micro-wind / hydrogen tech) renewable plant has been installed and also simulated with a specific own software developed. The hydrogen is used for two purposes, as long time energy electrical storage, and for mobile application, such as bike fleet. Also it has been installed a thermal solar panel roof plant to cover a percentage of thermal energy consumptions of the building. This project has the capacity to behave as a referent in sustainable architecture for research centres and as the first step in real sustainable urban projects. In small-scope, the experience will be extrapolated to other Technology Parks and industrial areas effectively reducing local emissions in short and medium term. The prototypes developed in this project present sustainable alternatives for common applications that are using fossil fuel. The use of hydrogen will reduce the CO2 for the future. © 2011, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

Cumulative carbon storage will be reduced through time as carbon loss through tree mortality outweighs carbon accumulation through tree growth.

Some non-CO 2 greenhouse gases have much shorter lifetimes than CO 2, so reducing their emissions offers an additional opportunity to lessen future climate change.

The rolling-up of a planar carbon lattice of graphene into a nanotube leads to an approximately 0. 6 eV decrease in the energy of defect formation. The SW defect introduces resonant, rather than discrete, energy levels into the electron spectrum of the CNT. In the case of a fractured CNT, the SW defect formation energy is smaller in the region of compression.

It is essential that decision-makers select an appropriate quantification methodology and have an appreciation of methodological strengths and shortcomings. This work compares four different waste emissions quantification methods, including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1996 guidelines, IPCC 2006 guidelines, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Waste Reduction Model (WARM), and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities- Partners for Climate Protection (FCM-PCP) quantification tool. Waste disposal data for the greater Toronto area (GTA) in 2005 are used for all methodologies; treatment options (including landfill, incineration, compost, and anaerobic digestion) are examined where available in methodologies. Landfill was shown to be the greatest source of GHG emissions, contributing more than threequarters of total emissions associated with waste management. Results from the different landfill gas (LFG) quantification approaches ranged from an emissions source of 557 kt carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) (FCM-PCP) to a carbon sink of -53 kt CO2e (EPA WARM). Similar values were obtained between IPCC approaches. The IPCC 2006 method was found to be more appropriate for inventorying applications because it uses a waste-in-place (WIP) approach, rather than a methane commitment (MC) approach, despite perceived onerous data requirements for WIP. MC approaches were found to be useful from a planning standpoint; however, uncertainty associated with their projections of future parameter values limits their applicability for GHG inventorying. MC and WIP methods provided similar results in this case study; however, this is case specific because of similarity in assumptions of present and future landfill parameters and quantities of annual waste deposited in recent years being relatively consistent. © 2011 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Composting; Decision making; Environmental Protection Agency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Municipal solid waste; Renewable energy resources; Climate protection; Greater Toronto Area; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Management assessment; Management decisions; Municipal government; Quantification methods; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Waste incineration; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; carbon dioxide; methane; anaerobic digestion; article; carbon footprint; carbon sink; climate change; landfill; landfill gas; landfill waste; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; waste management; air pollution; carbon sequestration; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; health; human; incineration; isolation and purification; methodology; standard; waste disposal; waste management; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Carbon Sequestration; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Incineration; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Urban Health; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959775659

However, their effects on the community of rumen methanogens in cattle rumens have not been investigated. Our objective was to evaluate effects of dry corn distillers grain with solubles (DDG) and CT from Acacia mearnsii added to the diet of cattle on rumen methanogens using PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. Eight ruminally cannulated beef heifers were used in a replicated 4×4 Latin square design with four 35d periods. Diets were (g DDG dry matter [DM]/kg DM): control (Ctrl; 0 DDG), 200 DDG, 400 DDG and 400 DDG plus 25g CT (400 DDG+CT). Rumen digesta samples were collected before feeding on d 25 and 28 of each period from 4 sites in the rumen. Total DNA extracted from rumen digesta samples (i.e., 0.5ml liquid+0.5g solid pooled by heifer for each period) was used to generate amplicons of partial 16S rRNA genes. The PCR products obtained were subjected to PCR-DGGE. Detectable methanogenic PCR-DGGE profiles from periods 1 and 2 clustered while periods 3 and 4 formed a second cluster. A total of 25 distinct PCR-DGGE bands were identified, of which 16 bands were successfully cloned and sequenced. The sequences of 11 bands had 97-100% similarity with Methanobrevibacter sp., and this was supported by clustering of 10 of these bands with this species upon phylogenetic analysis of the sequences. The remaining bands clustered with Methanosphaera stadmanae. Although no effect of diet on total methanogenic PCR-DGGE profiles occurred, the proportion of bands 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11 increased and bands 16 and 18 decreased with increased DDG in the diet. Bands 13 and 19 were in all diets except 400 DDG+CT. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the copy numbers of total methanogenic 16S rRNA gene did not differ among diets. Findings from PCR-DGGE and qRT-PCR analysis suggest that inclusion of DDG or a mixture of DDG and CT altered the diversity of rumen methanogens without affecting total methanogen associated 16S rRNA copy numbers thereby indicating that copy numbers of particular species of methanogens may be required to explain the altered diversity of rumen methanogens.

Mature leaves can 'sense' elevated [CO2] and this regulates stomatal development of expanding leaves (systemic regulation). It is unclear if systemic regulation is involved in determination of leaf thickness and Narea - traits that are significantly correlated with photosynthetic capacity. A cuvette system was used whereby [CO2] around mature leaves was controlled separately from that around expanding leaves. Expanding leaves of poplar (Populus trichocarpa×P. deltoides) seedlings were exposed to elevated [CO 2] (720μmol mol-1) while the remaining mature leaves inside the cuvette were under ambient [CO2] of 360μmol mol -1. Reverse treatments were performed. Exposure of newly developing leaves to elevated [CO2] increased their thickness, but when mature leaves were exposed to elevated [CO2] the increase in thickness of new leaves was less pronounced. The largest response to [CO2] was reflected in the palisade tissue thickness (as opposed to the spongy tissue) of new leaves. The Narea of new leaves was unaffected by the local [CO2] where the new leaves developed, but decreased following the exposure of mature leaves to elevated [CO2]. The volume fraction of mesophyll cells compared with total leaf and the mesophyll cell density changed in a manner similar to the response of Narea. These results suggest that Narea is controlled independently of the leaf thickness, and suggest that Narea is under systemic regulation by [CO2] signals from mature leaves that control mesophyll cell division. © 2011 The Author(s).","Acclimation; anatomy; high CO2; leaf development; leaf thickness; mesophyll; nitrogen; poplar; stomata; systemic","carbon dioxide; nitrogen; analysis of variance; article; aspen; cytology; drug effect; environment; growth, development and aging; histology; mesophyll cell; metabolism; plant leaf; Analysis of Variance; Carbon Dioxide; Environment; Mesophyll Cells; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Populus; Populus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957500113

Therefore, amendments that alter soil resources should affect vegetation dynamics and are potential tools for controlling exotic species. We tested the effects of two types of carbon addition, sugar and activated carbon (AC), on an exotic-dominated grassland plant community. Sugar stimulates the microbial community and temporarily reduces plant available nitrogen (N), while AC adsorbs plant available N. Six experimental plots and three carbon treatments were used: sugar (1000 g m-2; 42% C), AC (420 g m-2; 100% C), and control. Treatments were applied in a split-plot design in spring 2008. Aboveground biomass, plant cover, species richness, and plant basal area were tracked for two growing seasons. Although total biomass was not affected by C addition, the distribution of biomass among life forms was affected: carbon addition reduced forb biomass but had no effect on grasses or legumes. Total cover was lower in sugar-treated plots, and sugar also altered the proportional composition of that cover by reducing the abundance of forbs, especially in the first year. Five species were particularly sensitive to sugar addition: Myosotis discolor, Sonchus asper, Taraxacum officinale, Valerianella locusta, and Vulpia bromoides. Sugar also reduced plant basal area in the first year. These results suggest that sugar and, to a lesser extent, AC could be useful management tools. Sugar could be applied to areas where herbicide use is undesirable, reducing the abundance of exotic forbs and providing a window of opportunity for native species establishment. © 2011 by the Northwest Scientific Association.",,"aboveground biomass; activated carbon; basal area; grass; grassland; growing season; habitat conservation; herbicide; legume; microbial community; nutrient availability; pesticide application; plant community; prairie; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; species richness; sugar; vegetation dynamics; Pacific Northwest; Myosotis discolor; Poaceae; Sonchus; Sonchus asper; Taraxacum officinale; Valerianella; Valerianella locusta; Vulpia bromoides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959563816

A set of multiyear numerical experiments is performed using the atmospheric model inter-comparison project (AMIP) protocol with observed sea surface temperature (SST). The default value of time step for 64 × 128 horizontal resolution with semi-Lagrangian dynamical core is 60. min. The model overestimates the mean and underestimates the standard deviation. The mean and standard deviation of ISMR systematically decrease with decrease of time step size. With respect to observations, the mean becomes more reasonable but standard deviation becomes less reasonable. There is a decrease in precipitation over the Saudi Arabia, Maritime Continent, and northwestern Arabian Sea with decrease in time step, while over the Eastern Indian Ocean, Eastern Arabian Sea, and Eastern Bay of Bengal there is an increase in precipitation. The pattern correlation of precipitation with observation systematically increases with decrease of time step. In regard to the IAV of ISMR, simulation with 20. min time step outperforms the other time steps i.e. 60, 40, 30, and 05. min. When it is decreased to 20. min, the model bias in precipitation climatology is reduced and the low-level westerly jet over the Indian peninsular becomes more realistic.

Sea water penetrates the fissures of the volcanic bed and is heated by magma. This heated sea water rises to the surface dissolving large amounts of minerals which provide a source of energy and nutrients to chemoautotrophic organisms. Although this environment is characterized by extreme conditions (high temperature, high pressure, chemical toxicity, acidic pH and absence of photosynthesis) a diversity of microorganisms and many animal species are specially adapted to this hostile environment. These organisms have developed a very efficient metabolism for the assimilation of inorganic CO2 from the external environment. In order to develop technology for the capture of carbon dioxide to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, enzymes involved in CO2 fixation and assimilation might be very useful.

Transport today is a challenge comparable to cholera in the nineteenth and air pollution in the twentieth century in its complexity, cost, engineering and health consequences. Engineers dealing with the 'low-carbon' transport agenda must contribute to carbon dioxide reduction targets as a matter of policy requirement. Cross-disciplinary synergies between low-carbon approaches and health are important to both policy fields. Transport is not an end in itself, but provides access to facilities, people, work, education and goods and can build physical activity into everyday life. Simultaneously, transport causes stress, disruption of communities, injuries and death, noise and air pollution, causing physical and mental ill-health, and is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. Benefits of motorised transport accrue particularly to the wealthy, while adverse effects fall disproportionately on the disadvantaged. Effective low-carbon policies must reduce the need to travel and promote modal shift as well as embracing technological advances. However, making transport carbon dioxide-free will neither offset all health issues nor deliver all quality-of-life requirements. This paper explores ways in which the low-carbon and health agendas are complementary, and where potential conflicts could arise.","Public health; Sustainability; Transport planning","Adverse effect; Carbon dioxide reduction; Cross-disciplinary; Health consequences; Health issues; Low-carbon; Modal shifts; Physical activity; Potential conflict; Public health; Quality-of-life; Technological advances; Transport planning; Transport policy; Twentieth century; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Health; Pollution control; Transportation; Atmospheric movements; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; health impact; public health; sustainability; traffic emission; transportation planning; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960717783

Although commissioning has earned increased recognition in recent years, it remains an enigmatic practice whose visibility severely lags its potential. The application of commissioning to new buildings ensures that they deliver or exceed the performance and energy savings promised by their design and intended operation. When applied to existing buildings, commissioning identifies deficiencies and the almost inevitable ""drift"" from intended performance over time, and carries out interventions to put the building back on course. More formally, commissioning is a systematic, forensic approach to quality assurance and performance risk management, rather than a technology per se. This article presents the world's largest compilation and meta-analysis of commissioning experience and the associated literature, comprising 643 non-residential buildings, 99 million ft2 of floorspace, $43 million in commissioning expenditures, and the work of 37 commissioning providers. The median normalized cost to deliver commissioning is $0.30/ft2 ($2009 currencies) for existing buildings and $1.16/ft2 for new construction (or 0.4% of the overall construction cost). The one third of projects for which data are available reveal over 10,000 energy-related deficiencies, the correction of which resulted in 16% median whole-building energy savings in existing buildings and 13% in new construction, with payback times of 1.1 and 4.2 years, respectively. Because energy savings exceed commissioning costs, the associated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions come at a ""negative"" cost of -$110/tonne CO2 for new buildings and -$25/tonne for new construction. Cases with comprehensive commissioning attained nearly twice the overall median level of savings and five times the savings of the least-thorough projects. Significant non-energy benefits such as improved indoor air quality are also achieved. Applying the median whole-building energy-saving values to the US non-residential buildings stock corresponds to an annual energy-saving potential of $30 billion (and 340 Mt of CO2) by the year 2030. © 2011 The Author(s).","Carbon reductions; Commercial buildings; Commissioning; Energy efficiency; Quality assurance; Risk management; Savings persistence","Building commissioning; Building energy; Building energy saving; Carbon reduction; Commercial buildings; Commissioning; Commissioning costs; Construction costs; Energy cost; Energy saving; Energy saving potential; Existing building; Floorspace; In-buildings; Indoor air quality; Meta-analysis; Non-energy; Payback time; Performance risk; Residential building; Savings persistence; Air quality; Apartment houses; Associated gas; Cost reduction; Earthquake resistance; Energy conservation; Energy management; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Indoor air pollution; Office buildings; Quality assurance; Quality control; Risk analysis; Risk management; Energy efficiency; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; risk assessment; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952621553

Type of bedding affects many parameters related to poultry production including NH3 losses. In a randomized complete block design, 3 trials compared the cumulative NH3 volatilization for laboratory-prepared litter (4 bedding types mixed with excreta) and commercial litter (sampled from a broiler house during the second flock on reused pine wood chips). Litters were assessed at the original moisture content and 2 higher moisture contents. Broiler excrement was mixed with pine wood shavings, rice hulls, sand, and vermiculite to create litter samples. Volumetrically uniform litter samples were placed in chambers receiving humidified air where the exhaust passed through H3BO3 solution, trapping litter-emitted NH3. At the original moisture content, sand and vermiculite litters generated the most NH3 (5.3 and 9.1 mg of N, respectively) whereas wood shavings, commercial, and rice hull litters emitted the least NH3 (0.9-2.6 mg of N). For reducing NH3 emissions, the results support recommendations for using wood shavings and rice hulls, already popular bedding choices in the United States and worldwide. In this research, the organic bedding materials generated the least NH3 at the original moisture content when compared with the inorganic materials. For each bedding type, incremental increases in litter moisture content increased NH3 volatilization. However, the effects of bedding material on NH3 volatilization at the increased moisture levels were not clearly differentiated across the treatments. Vermiculite generated the most NH3 (26.3 mg of N) at the highest moisture content. Vermiculite was a novel bedding choice that has a high water absorption capacity, but because of high NH3 generation, it is not recommended for further study as broiler bedding material.

GABA is transported into mitochondria, where it is catabolized into TCA cycle or other intermediates. Although there is circumstantial evidence for mitochondrial GABA transporters in eukaryotes, none have yet been identified. Described here is an Arabidopsis protein similar in sequence and topology to unicellular GABA transporters. The expression of this protein complements a GABA-transport-deficient yeast mutant. Thus the protein was termed AtGABP to indicate GABA-permease activity. In vivo localization of GABP fused to GFP and immunobloting of subcellular fractions demonstrate its mitochondrial localization. Direct [3H]GABA uptake measurements into isolated mitochondria revealed impaired uptake into mitochondria of a gabp mutant compared with wild-type (WT) mitochondria, implicating AtGABP as a major mitochondrial GABA carrier. Measurements of CO2 release, derived from radiolabeled substrates in whole seedlings and in isolated mitochondria, demonstrate impaired GABA-derived input into the TCA cycle, and a compensatory increase in TCA cycle activity in gabp mutants. Finally, growth abnormalities of gabp mutants under limited carbon availability on artificial media, and in soil under low light intensity, combined with their metabolite profiles, suggest an important role for AtGABP in primary carbon metabolism and plant growth. Thus, AtGABP-mediated transport of GABA from the cytosol into mitochondria is important to ensure proper GABA-mediated respiration and carbon metabolism. This function is particularly essential for plant growth under conditions of limited carbon. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","γ-aminobutyric acid; carbon; GABA transporter; metabolism; mitochondria; TCA cycle","Aminobutyric acids; Arabidopsis; Artificial media; Carbon availability; Carbon metabolism; Cytosols; GABA transporter; Immunobloting; In-vivo; Low light; Metabolite profiles; Plant growth; Primary carbon; Protein complement; Radiolabeled substrates; Subcellular fractions; TCA cycle; Wild types; Amino acids; Carbon dioxide; Metabolism; Physiology; Proteins; Mitochondria; 4 aminobutyric acid; 4 aminobutyric acid carrier; Arabidopsis protein; carbon; carbon dioxide; green fluorescent protein; hybrid protein; proline; amino acid sequence; analysis of variance; Arabidopsis; article; citric acid cycle; confocal microscopy; cytosol; enzymology; gene expression regulation; gene vector; genetic complementation; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; immunoblotting; light; metabolism; methodology; mitochondrion; open reading frame; plant leaf; plant root; protoplast; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; seedling; Southern blotting; tobacco; Amino Acid Sequence; Analysis of Variance; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Blotting, Southern; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Citric Acid Cycle; Cytosol; GABA Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Genetic Complementation Test; Genetic Vectors; Genotype; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Immunoblotting; Light; Microscopy, Confocal; Mitochondria; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Open Reading Frames; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Proline; Protoplasts; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Seedling; Tobacco; Arabidopsis; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960894781

Local availability and conversion into secondary energy carriers with a lower capital investment shows more weights on its interests. The substitution of fossil fuel by biomass fuel can have a strong effect on the mitigation of climate change through reducing greenhouse gases, which can be an important consideration for CDM projects in Bangladesh. This study uses literature review to analyse the legal framework of carbon trading under CDM, CDM additionality, CDM and bioenergy promotion, land availability and technology for biomass production, and sustainability of CDM projects in Bangladesh. The barriers to CDM projects in Bangladesh are explained as well as measures for promoting biomass production. Biomass and bioenergy-based CDM projects can be attractive and support sustainable development in Bangladesh. The study suggests capacity building and policy changes needed in order to comply with CDM modalities.

In natural cycles, carbon stocks are regulated by vegetation dynamics through the rates of mortality, recruitment and turnover. This study was conducted in five permanent monitoring plots (1 ha each: total 5 ha) in the Rio Doce State Park (RDSP), the most continuous Atlantic Forest remaining in Minas Gerais, Brazil and considered one of the world's hotspots. The aboveground biomass ranged from 201 Mg/ha in the primary forest to 92 Mg/ha in the secondary forest. The recruitment rate (1.8) was higher than the mortality rate (1.1); however, the average diameter of dead trees was higher than that of the recruited trees. Notwithstanding this result, the internal diametric increment (ingrowth) in RDSP was compensated by the biomass loss of dead trees, producing positive growth in the annual biomass and increasing their carbon stocks by 1.0 Mg C/ha/yr. Interest in conservation and management of tropical forests has intensified since the 2007 IPCC results. Thus, our study provides data that will help calibrate the use of international methodologies in local projects using data previously collected with a standardized methodology.","Aboveground biomass; Carbon stock; Permanent monitoring plots; Tropical forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960090550

At the Russian River RBF site (Sonoma County, CA), transport of C. parvum oocysts and oocyst-sized (3 μm) carboxylate-modified microspheres through poorly sorted (sorting indices, σ1, up to 3.0) and geochemically heterogeneous sediments collected between 2 and 25 m below land surface (bls) were assessed. Removal was highly sensitive to variations in both the quantity of extractable metals (mainly Fe and Al) and degree of grain sorting. In flow-through columns, there was a log-linear relationship (r2 = 0.82 at p &lt; 0.002) between collision efficiency (α, the probability that colloidal collisions with grain surfaces would result in attachment) and extractable metals, and a linear relationship (r2 = 0.99 at p &lt; 0.002) between α and σ1. Collectively, variability in extractable metals and grain sorting accounted for ∼83% of the variability in α (at p &lt; 0.0002) along the depth profiles. Amendments of 2.2 mg L-1 of Russian River dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reduced α for oocysts by 4-5 fold. The highly reactive hydrophobic organic acid (HPOA) fraction was particularly effective in re-entraining sediment-attached microspheres. However, the transport-enhancing effects of the riverine DOC did not appear to penetrate very deeply into the underlying sediments, judging from high α values (∼1.0) observed for oocysts being advected through unamended sediments collected at ∼2 m bls. This study suggests that in evaluating the efficacy of RBF operations to remove oocysts, it may be necessary to consider not only the geochemical nature and size distribution of the sediment grains, but also the degrees of sediment sorting and the concentration, reactivity, and penetration of the source water DOC. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"California; Chlorine disinfection; Collision efficiency; Cryptosporidium parvum; Depth profile; Dissolved organic carbon; Flowthrough; Geochemically heterogeneous sediments; Grain surface; Highly sensitive; Land surface; Linear relationships; Oocysts; Riverbank filtration; Russian River; Sediment grains; Source waters; Anoxic sediments; Carboxylation; Chlorine; Metals; Microspheres; Organic acids; Organic carbon; Radial basis function networks; Stream flow; Water analysis; Sedimentology; aluminum; carboxylic acid; iron; organic carbon; chlorine; colloid; disinfection; dissolved organic carbon; filtration; fluvial deposit; geochemical method; grain size; heterogeneity; hydrophobicity; land surface; linearity; metal; pollutant removal; protozoan; river bank; sediment; sediment chemistry; sensitivity analysis; size distribution; article; binding site; Cryptosporidium parvum; filtration; nonhuman; oocyst; oocyte transport; riparian ecosystem; sediment; California; Carbon; Cryptosporidium parvum; Filtration; Geologic Sediments; Metals, Heavy; Microspheres; Oocysts; Particle Size; Rivers; Water Pollution; Water Purification; California; Sonoma County; United States; Cryptosporidium parvum; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959868346

Two different types of spectral forcing are applied to the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to simulate the ozone response between periods of quiet and high solar activity. One scenario uses the solar proxy reconstructions model from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRLSSI), and the other is based on SSI observations from the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE). The SORCE observations show 3-5 times more variability in ultraviolet (UV) radiation than predicted by the proxy model. The NRLSSI forcing had minimal impact on ozone, however, the higher UV variability from SORCE induced a 4% reduction in ozone concentration above 40 km at solar active conditions. The model result is supported by 8 years (2002-2010) of ozone observations from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument. The SABER ozone variations have greater similarity with the SORCE SSI model simulations. The model and satellite data suggests that the ozone response is due to enhanced photochemical activity associated with larger UV variability.

It is particularly interesting for forest mitigation projects which are either ineligible in compliance markets or confronted with a plethora of technical and financial hurdles and lacking market demand. As the OTC market is not regulated, voluntary standards have been created to secure the social and environmental integrity of the traded mitigation projects and thus to ensure the quality of the resulting carbon credits. Building on a theoretical efficiency-legitimacy framework, this study aims to identify and analyse the characteristics and indicators that determine the efficiency and organisational legitimacy of standards for afforestation/reforestation carbon projects.Results: All interviewed market actors consider third-party certification and standards as a crucial component of market functionality, which provide quality assurance mechanisms that reduce information asymmetries and moral hazard between the actors regarding the quality of carbon credits, and thus reduce transaction costs. Despite this development, the recent evolution of many new and differing standards is seen as a major obstacle that renders it difficult for project developers and buyers to select an appropriate standard. According to the interviewed experts the most important legitimating factors of standards are assurance of a sufficient level of quality of carbon credits, scientifically substantiated methodological accounting and independent third-party verification, independence of standard bodies, transparency, wide market acceptance, back-up of the wider community including experts and NGOs, rigorous procedures, and the resemblance to the Afforestation/Reforestation (A/R) CDM due to its international policy endorsements. In addition, standards must provide evidence that projects contribute to a positive social and environmental development, do no harm as a minimum requirement and build a strong track record of successful projects. Project developers require clear, easily and practically applicable standards at lowest possible costs with a high potential in order to achieve good carbon prices, while buyers require that standards are legitimate, credible and that no public criticism arises when carbon credits are purchased from projects certified by a certain standard.Conclusions: Despite the fragmented and immature state of the OTC market, standards act as 'market-making' intermediaries and contribute to the quality and transparency of the OTC market. However, the variety of different standards imposes new hurdles for their efficiency and often creates confusion instead of confidence among potential buyers. Despite the lacking legitimacy of the standards, pressures from the institutional environment on standards ensure a minimum quality of carbon credits (including positive social and environmental impacts of carbon credits) that serves as an insurance mechanism for the integrity of standards. Its unregulated nature and the pressure from an increasingly competitive environment provides innovative space to deliver efficient certification procedures without imposing unreasonably high transaction costs on market actors. Furthermore, voluntary standards imply a more innovative certification approach, as one legal authority could do, because standards have to compete for adopters backed by civil society organisations. Thereby, the forest sector in OTC voluntary market bears great opportunities to provide the forest sector with crucial lessons for international climate policy and governmental institutions when designing regulation for forest regulation such as international and national REDDplus schemes. © 2011 Merger and Pistorius; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"afforestation; carbon balance; certification; civil society; clean development mechanism; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; forest ecosystem; forest management; innovation; institutional framework; international law; nongovernmental organization; price dynamics; reforestation; social impact; standard (regulation); transaction cost; voluntary approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051636476

In the short term, companies could face decisions about acquisitions of water-dependent companies and natural resources or might be planning facilities or operations in communities vulnerable to erosion and flooding, changes in water supplies, and increasing health-care costs. In the intermediate term, companies need to assess these vulnerabilities to determine appropriate insurance coverage, plan for new infrastructure, implement preventative health-care programs, or protect natural resources. A technical approach needs to involve predictive tools that can provide bounding estimates at regional scales. The implications of those changes need to be translated to consequences that can affect specific businesses. Corporations must be cognizant of the uncertainties in this forecasting process and for that reason it is essential to link the likelihood of outcomes with the magnitudes of consequences.

The objective of the present study was to fit allometric equations to quantify the accumulation of biomass (B), carbon (C), and carbon equivalent (CO 2e) in a mixed plantation of 12 years of age of Pinus devoniana Lindl. and Pinus pseudostrobus Lindl., in Jerécuaro, state of Guanajuato, México. The biomass of each tree, leaves plus branches (Bhr), stem (Bf) and total (Bt) was calculated using the ratio between dry weight and fresh weight, in 20 trees of each species. Through stem analyses and the Schumacher model the rate of annual increment of B, C and CO 2e was obtained. Results indicate that the allometric equations efficiently quantify the components of biomass, especially of Bf (R 2&gt;0.85) in P. pseudostrobus, this species showing the highest increments in aboveground biomass. The total aboveground biomass, of 60.2 and 58.4 % was registered in the stem; 39.8 and 41.6 % in the leaves and branches of P. devoniana and P. pseudostrobus. Values calculated were 39.36 t B ha -1, 19.68 t C ha -1 and 72.02 t CO 2e ha -1, after 12 years of the establishment of the plantation. According to the Schumacher model, the maximum productivity of aboveground biomass (Bf and Bhr) is reached at 20 years of age, which represents 3.96, 1.98 and 7.27 t ha -1 year -1 of B, C and CO 2e.","Biomass components; Carbon fixation; Growth models; Pinus devoniana Lindl.; Pinus pseudostrobus Lindl.; Productivity","Pinus devoniana; Pinus pseudostrobus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960858231

We have quantified these effects in a large, long-term (7-y) soil-warming study in a deciduous forest in New England. Soil warming has resulted in carbon losses from the soil and stimulated carbon gains in the woody tissue of trees. The warming-enhanced decay of soil organic matter also released enough additional inorganic nitrogen into the soil solution to support the observed increases in plant carbon storage. Although soil warming has resulted in a cumulative net loss of carbon from a New England forest relative to a control area over the 7-y study, the annual net losses generally decreased over time as plant carbon storage increased. In the seventh year, warming-induced soil carbon losses were almost totally compensated for by plant carbon gains in response to warming. We attribute the plant gains primarily to warming-induced increases in nitrogen availability. This study underscores the importance of incorporating carbon-nitrogen interactions in atmosphere-ocean-land earth system models to accurately simulate land feedbacks to the climate system.","Climate system feedbacks; Ecological stoichiometry; Forest carbon budget; Forest nitrogen budget; Global climate change","carbon; nitrogen; soil organic matter; article; carbon storage; climate change; controlled study; molecular interaction; nitrogen availability; plant tissue; priority journal; quantitative analysis; soil degradation; soil warming; temperate deciduous forest; tree; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959360687

Under this ""fair share"" sectoral assumption, aggressive near-term actions are necessary in three areas: vehicle miles traveled (VMT), vehicle fuel economy (FE), and fuel carbon intensity (FCI). Two generic scenarios demonstrate the important role of FCI in meeting the 2050 goal. The first scenario allows deep reductions in FCI to compensate for relatively modest FE improvements and VMT reductions. The second scenario assumes optimistic improvements in FE, relatively large reductions in VMT and less aggressive FCI reductions. Each generic scenario is expanded into three illustrative scenarios to explore the theoretical implications of meeting the 2050 goal by relying exclusively on biofuels and hybrid vehicles, biofuels and plug-in hybrid vehicles, or hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles.

Waste reduction in composting centres and in Bendo Landfill done by the scavengers has been observed. The results showed that the recyclable material from Bendo landfill was plastics, paper, metal and glass. Waste reduction done by scavengers was about 7.5% and 12.8% for plastics and for paper respectively. Reduction on metal and glass were very small (below 0.01%) because most of the waste has been sorted by the scavengers before delivered to the landfill. Meanwhile, composting centres has reduced the organic waste from household about 10.33% of total organic waste. However, though the relatively significant waste amount reduction rate because of these two waste treatment methods, the methane emission reduction from 1993 until 2012 is inconsiderable. Without waste reduction, the methane emission is estimated about 8.78E+06 ton CO2eq per year, whereas with waste reduction, the methane emitted from Bendo landfill is estimated about 8.71E+06 ton CO2eq per year. It means that the scavenging activity and composting centers have contributed 1% reduction of methane emission. The small percentage of paper compared to that of organics waste in waste component causes the insignificant methane emission reduction in Bendo landfill, whereas the low capacity of composting centers led to slight contribution. The focus on reduction of organic component in municipal solid waste disposed of in landfill is likely to be an appropriate way to reduce methane emission from the landfill significantly.","Composting; Landfill; Methane emission reduction; Scavenger; Waste reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82755182227

This is especially true for the conservation of ice-dependent species as climate warming has reduced sea ice cover. Polar bears are an interesting case to examine, as they are subject to a bundle of institutions, many of which cross scales and have in the past resulted in successful collective action. However, key policies such as the US Endangered Species Act, premised on mediating short-term disturbances, may not fit new problems that cross geographic and temporal scales and require the conservation of slow ecosystem processes such as oceanographic conditions or sea ice habitats. In this case, it is argued that the American polar bear regime as it has evolved no longer fits contemporary social-ecological dynamics. Through an analysis of the scale, efficacy and feasibility of individual policies making up the regime, the current bundle of policies are evaluated against a model of social-ecological system dynamics. The results indicate that the regime has increased its geographic scale to match population dynamics, but has focused on short-term disturbance over long-term resilience and is characterized by trade-offs between efficacy and feasibility. The equity of these trade-offs for indigenous communities that live with bears as part of a social-ecological system is highlighted.

Significant regional-scale ecosystem services disruptions are affecting Alaska Natives' subsistence hunting and harvest success. The well-being of rural native communities is still highly dependent on access and ability to harvest wild foods such as salmon and moose (Alces alces gigas) among many others. Over the last decade communities in the Koyukuk-Middle Yukon (KMY) region of Interior Alaska report an inability to satisfy their needs for harvesting moose before the hunting season closes, citing warmer falls, changing precipitation and water levels, and the regulatory framework as primary causes. Through the integration of ethnographic methods to record indigenous observations and understanding of climate (IC) with analysis of meteorological data, we provide a comprehensive picture of vulnerability to recent warming trends in the Koyukuk-Middle Yukon region of Interior Alaska, one that captures more than statistical analysis of ""norms"" can provide.

This paper describes a low-risk scenario for assisted colonization using plants. Using an analysis of temperate grassy woodlands from Australia, relevant ecosystem attributes are identified which make assisted colonization a sensible strategy, and that may characterize other favorable situations globally. The contributing elements include: a biota adapted to resource conservatism, a naturally connected landscape with component species having wide distributions over a large climatic gradient, current land use unrelated to endogenous disturbance regimes resulting in extensive replacement and modification of the ecosystem over its entire range. Intensive agriculture can create a highly-disturbed and nutrient-enriched landscape matrix, which effectively fragments the species assemblage. Relocation of plant species within and close to their range is not going to create an invasive situation in these landscapes. Candidates for assisted colonization are forbs and interstitial grasses that have persisted over much of their range, but which have declined within that range due to land use impacts. The suggested priority receiving sites would be those with a moderate level of past modifications, now being managed for conservation and with low nutrient status.

California is in the forefront of developing science-based planning elements and programs that support a more integrative and adaptive approach to address climate impacts, including the development of new tools such as the designation of marine protected areas. California's coastal cities and counties are developing Climate Action Plans (CAPs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The state has also completed the 2009 California Climate Adaptation Strategy that identifies goals and actions needed to better integrate scientific information into coastal planning. The article emphasizes the need to broaden the scope of local coastal plans to include new biodiversity protection and land-use elements that address the anticipated impacts from climate change on coastal ecosystems. A number of strategies to strengthen the connection between scientists, stakeholders, and local coastal planners are described in the article. In particular, science and scientists should play a crucial role in identifying coastal areas that may serve as ""climate-change refugia"" where species hit the hardest by climate impacts are projected to relocate. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biodiversity protection; Bioregionalism; California; Climate action plans; Climate change; Local coastal planning","Biodiversity protection; Bioregionalism; California; Climate action plans; Local coastal planning; Biodiversity; Coastal zones; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Planning; adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone management; emission control; greenhouse gas; land use; regionalism; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956154165

Methods and Results: We applied SBS at 0, 60, 70 or 100kgweek-1 to cattle waste as it accumulated on the floors of four cattle pens, housing eight cattle each. We observed significant pH decreases in all of the treated wastes on day one; however, the 60kgweek-1 treatment returned to control levels by day four, while the others remained significantly lower. Heterotrophic plate counts of the waste revealed that all treatments reduced the bacterial populations in the wastes on day one; however, all returned to control levels by day four. The 16S rRNA gene libraries derived from the wastes revealed significant reductions in sequences associated with the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and increases in the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Spirochaetes on day one, but resembled the control by day seven. Sequences associated with Escherichia coli increased significantly after SBS application, but became undetectable by day seven. Conclusions: SBS application significantly alters the bacterial population structure of waste during the first few days of application, but the populations return to almost normal after 7days. Significance and Impact of the Study: Application of SBS to animal waste can reduce emissions; however, biosecurity precautions must be rigorously maintained during the initial application to ensure that pathogenic E. coli is not released into the environment.

While the scientific community debates the merits of managed relocation, species are already being moved to new areas predicted to be more suitable under climate change. To inform these moves, we construct a quantitative decision framework to evaluate the timing of relocation in the face of climate change. We find that the optimal timing depends on many factors, including the size of the population, the demographic costs of translocation and the expected carrying capacities over time in the source and destination habitats. In some settings, such as when a small population would benefit from time to grow before risking translocation losses, haste is ill advised. We also find that active adaptive management is valuable when the effect of climate change on source habitat is uncertain, and leads to delayed movement. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The conference had over 400 delegates from 36 countries, an attendance which attests to the global research effort ongoing in this area. The meeting addressed microbial aspects of ruminal CH4 production, and methods to measure GHG from livestock and manure. Strategies to mitigate enteric CH4 emissions from ruminants, as well as CH4 and N2O emissions from manure, were a key focus of the conference. Other papers outlined how modelling can be used to estimate GHG emissions at the animal, farm, regional and global scale. The key importance of modelling GHG from an agricultural systems perspective was apparent, both in a policy making and regulatory perspective, although its predictive accuracy is difficult to assess and lower than desirable, much lower in some cases. It is clear that mitigation strategies which reduce GHG emissions, while improving the efficiency and economic viability of livestock production, are the most likely to be adopted in practice. Such strategies will be required to ensure that animal agriculture will be able to satisfy the growing global demand for food with a minimal impact on the environment.

The data set used covers a nine-year period (1999-2007) and is unique in the sense that it includes-besides the daily number of respiratory hospital admissions-not just the hourly mean concentrations of CO, PM10, NO, NO2, O3 and SO2 with meteorological variables (temperature, global solar flux, relative humidity, air pressure and wind speed), but two pollen variables (Ambrosia and total pollen excluding Ambrosia) as well. The analysis was performed using three age categories for the pollen season of Ambrosia and the pollen-free season. Meteorological elements and air pollutants are clustered in order to define optimum environmental conditions of high patient numbers. ANOVA was then used to determine whether cluster-related mean patient numbers differ significantly. Furthermore, two novel procedures are applied here: factor analysis including a special transformation and a time-varying multivariate linear regression that makes it possible to determine the rank of importance of the influencing variables in respiratory hospital admissions, and also compute the relative importance of the parameters affecting respiratory disorders. Both techniques revealed that Ambrosia pollen is an important variable that influences hospital admissions (an increase of 10 pollen grains m-3 can imply an increase of around 24% in patient numbers). The role of chemical and meteorological parameters is also significant, but their weights vary according to the seasons and the methods. Clearer results are obtained for the pollination season of Ambrosia. Here, a 10 μg m-3 increase in O3 implies a patient number response from -17% to +11%. Wind speed is a surprisingly important variable, where a 1 m s-1 rise may result in a hospital admission reduction of up to 42-45%. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Cluster analysis; Factor analysis including a special transformation; Respiratory hospital admissions; Time-varying multivariate linear regression","Air pollutants; Air pressures; Data sets; Environmental conditions; Factor analysis; Factor analysis including a special transformation; Hospital admissions; Hungary; Joint effect; Mean concentrations; Meteorological elements; Meteorological parameters; Meteorological variables; Multi variate analysis; Multivariate linear regressions; Pollen grains; Relative importance; Respiratory disorders; Respiratory hospital admissions; Respiratory problems; Solar flux; Time varying; Wind speed; Air quality; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospherics; Cluster analysis; Hospitals; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Meteorological problems; Multivariant analysis; Pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Time varying systems; Wind effects; Chemical analysis; atmospheric pollution; chemical pollutant; cluster analysis; data set; dicotyledon; environmental conditions; factor analysis; health risk; hospital sector; linearity; meteorology; nitrogen oxides; pollen; pollution exposure; regression analysis; relative humidity; respiratory disease; wind velocity; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; article; hospital admission; human; meteorological phenomena; pollination; priority journal; ragweed pollen; respiratory tract disease; Fejer; Hungary; Szeged; Ambrosia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959758268

Planktonic foraminifera assemblage analyses, coupled with isotopic measurements (δ18O) from benthic (Planulina wuellerstorfi) and planktonic (Globigerinoides ruber) foraminifera monospecific samples were conducted along the topmost 11m of the sequence. High resolution X-ray fluorescence measurements (0.5cm resolution), giving access to major element ratio, have completed the geochemical analyses along the core. Seasonal and annual past sea surface temperatures (SST) were quantitatively reconstructed. Local sea-surface salinity (SSS) changes were then estimated by coupling SST with planktonic δ18O data. Our data provide a set of both oceanic and continental markers of environmental changes along the north-western African margin. The major changes detected in our record are discussed in the light of the regional paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic history of the last 220ka. Coupled oceanographic and atmospheric processes portray the climatic evolution of the area, and show strong links among the regional oceanography (water mass advection), the upwelling dynamics and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migration. An increased upwelling activity (or influence of upwelling filaments) is noted at the end of the two last glacial periods, probably in response to a more southerly position of the ITCZ. Higher SSS are recorded over the area during arid intervals and were tentatively interpreted as signing a southward shift of the Cape Verde Frontal Zone.

However, just adjacent to this sharp transition, the radio flux increases. This radio limb-brightening is observed over at least half of the perimeter of both lobes. We describe slowly propagating steady-state diffusion fronts that explain these counterintuitive features. Because of the natural buoyancy of radio lobes, the magnetic field is largely tangent to the lobe boundary, an alignment that polarizes the radio emission and dramatically reduces the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. As cosmic ray electrons diffuse slowly into the cluster gas, the local magnetic field and gas density are reduced as gas flows back toward the radio lobe. Radio emission peaks can occur because the synchrotron emissivity increases with magnetic field and then decreases with the density of non-thermal electrons. A detailed comparison of steady diffusion fronts with quantitative radio observations may reveal information about the spatial variation of magnetic fields and the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. On larger scales, some reduction of the gas density inside the Virgo lobes due to cosmic ray pressure must occur and may be measurable. Such X-ray observations could reveal important information about the presence of otherwise unobservable non-thermal components such as relativistic electrons of low energy or proton cosmic rays. © 2011.

In order to document spatio-temporal modelling abilities, the observations conducted in the declined climax mountain Norway spruce forest during the recovery period (1995-2006) are used for simulation and spatial analysis in the GIS environment. The developed spatio-temporal model is used for simulation of forest vegetation dynamics in a mountain spruce forest in the framework of regeneration processes after stress from air pollution. In order to explore the spatial and temporal phenomena of regeneration processes, the spatio-temporal model is based on a large set of ordinary differential equations that solve dynamic processes in sets of microsites arranged in grids for each ground vegetation species and each age group of Norway spruce seedlings. The spatial extent of the explored site is composed of a set of 50 × 50 microsites. Each microsite is represented by a square with dimensions of 1. m × 1. m. The presented simulation studies are mainly focused on seedlings from the seed year 1992, in order to explore the longest monitored time series of survival. It is based on exponential growth models that are related to the environmental conditions for each microsite. The canopy gaps based on estimates of the local crown projected area, the soil type layer, and the dominant grass density are used to provide case simulation studies. The first case study simulates the influence of microsite positions in relation to the local tree crown projections on the survival of spruce seedlings. It is assumed that the density of the trees is the main factor that determines the light and heat supply to the ground level of the Norway spruce seedlings. The second case study extends the previous study to include terms that determine the growth ratio in dependence on the crown projection area. The third case study provides further extensions in order to simulate growth ratio relations to the local soil type. The fourth case study demonstrates the local influence of the dominant grasses, such as Avenella flexuosa and Calamagrostis villosa, on the natural regeneration of Norway spruce. Starting from the conditions at the sites before the recovery period, the case simulation studies are able to project the short-term succession for a regeneration decade and the approximate long-term development. In addition to the standard simulation procedures based on solution of ordinary differential equations, spatio-temporal modelling in the GIS environment is able to provide spatial data management, analysis and visualization of the data. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Diffusion-reaction model; GIS; Ground vegetation; Mountain spruce forest; Spatio-temporal modelling","Age groups; Canopy gaps; Complex model; Diffusion-reaction model; Dynamic process; Environmental conditions; Exponential growth; Forest ecosystem; Forest vegetation; Ground level; Ground vegetation; Heat supply; Land-cover change; Local influence; Long-term development; Microsites; Mountain spruce forests; Natural regeneration; Norway spruce; Norway spruce seedlings; Projected area; Projection area; Regeneration process; Simulation procedures; Simulation studies; Soil types; Spatial analysis; Spatial data management; Spatial extent; Spatial patterns; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal models; Spruce seedlings; Tree crowns; Vegetation dynamics; Air quality; Computer simulation; Data visualization; Ecosystems; Growth rate; Information management; Landforms; Ordinary differential equations; Plant extracts; Research; Time series; Vegetation; Visualization; Reforestation; atmospheric pollution; canopy; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; data management; dominance; environmental conditions; forest ecosystem; GIS; grass; growth modeling; land cover; light effect; montane forest; numerical model; observational method; population density; reforestation; regeneration; restoration ecology; seedling; soil type; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; succession; survival; vegetation dynamics; vegetation structure; visualization; Calamagrostis villosa; Deschampsia flexuosa flexuosa; Picea; Picea abies; Picea engelmannii; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959363517

Sustainable transportation, and especially cycling, can contribute to the mitigation of CO2 emissions since cycling possesses an intrinsic zero-emission value. Few studies have been conducted that appraise the CO2 reduction potential of cycling. Opportunity costs enable the estimation of avoided CO2 emissions resulting from bicycle trips. The methodology developed in this research allows the attribution of a climate value to cycling by substituting bicycle trips with their most likely alternative transportation modes and calculating the resulting additional CO2 emissions. The methodology uses data on the current modal shares of cycling mobility, the competition of cycling with other transportation modes, and CO2 emission factors to calculate the climate value of cycling. When it is assumed that the avoided CO2 emissions of cycling mobility could be traded on financial carbon markets, the climate value of cycling represents a monetary value. Application of the methodology to the case of Bogotá, Colombia - a city with a current bicycle modal share of 3.3% on a total of 10 million daily trips - results in a climate value of cycling of 55,115 tons of CO2 per year, corresponding to an economic value of between 1 and 7 million US dollars when traded on the carbon market. © 2011 The Authors.

GHG are reduced by production of renewable energy as a substitute for fossil fuels via reduction of fugitive GHG emissions from stored and land applied manures, as well as by reduction in use of chemical fertilizers in crop production. Anaerobic digestion (AD) biotechnologies produce biogas at average rates of 0.30, 0.25 and 0.48L/g volatile solids from swine, bovine and poultry slurries, respectively. The biogas produced is of high quality with a CH4 concentration of 60-80%. AD may be an acceptable solution to management of P surplus by precipitating up to 25% of it in batch or semi-batch operated bioreactors, and by precipitating and concentrating up to 70% of bioreactor effluent P in long term storage bottom sludge. Effluents from AD are better balanced to meet crop needs than raw manure slurries, thereby reducing the need for supplementary chemical N and P fertilizers. Both capture of energy and reduced needs for chemical fertilizers will substantially decrease the C footprint of livestock food products. On-farm biogas production contributes to more sustainable livestock operations by substantially reducing other environmental impacts related to manure management. It reduces the risk of water pollution associated with animal manure slurries (i.e., eutrophication) by removing 0.80-0.90 of soluble chemical oxygen demand. In addition, some AD eliminate zoonotic pathogens and parasites in livestock manures. AD also improves human/farm cohabitation in rural regions by reducing odour emissions by 70-95%. This reduction allows more frequent and better timing of manure land application. Both timing of application and improved nutrient balance have the potential to increase nutrient uptake by crops and minimize nutrient losses to the environment. Reduction in the viability of weed seeds during AD reduces the need for herbicides and makes bioreactor effluent more acceptable to organic farmers. Inadequate regulatory polices and incentives are obstacles to widespread implementation of AD in developed and developing countries. However, adoption of AD is an alternative which could substantially reduce the C and environmental footprint of housed livestock operations.

Particularly, to ensure balance in global energy demand and supply and accurately reflect alternative global pathways spillover for all technologies as well as energy carrier cost/prices should be estimated under the same global scenario. The technology composition, CO2 emissions and system cost in Norway up to 2050 exhibit sensitivity to spillover. Moreover, spillover may reduce both CO2 emissions and total system cost. National energy system analysis of low carbon society should therefore consider technology development paths in global policy scenarios.

It is emphasized that the impacts of climate change are expected in urban areas affecting several sectors of urban life. Empirical evidence shows that local governments are essential to implement policies related to climate change. Overall, the response of cities focuses on mitigation and adaptation. The paper tried to understand the processes of urbanization and industrialization as a way to realize the condition and the origins of urban environmental vulnerability in Brazil, and to alert the large socioeconomic deficits and environmental impacts of Brazilian cities that make policies and responses more urgent and more complicated. Thus, it is not old wine in new bottle, but the opportunity not only to correct past mistakes, but also transform the Brazilian cities for the future in a more sustainable and just manner. For this to happen it is necessary to involve studies in public administration and local governance in these discussions.","Adaptation; Cities; Climate change; Local governance; Mitigation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858217958

Methods: Analytical and numerical solution of a nonlinear set of equations in order to describe the interaction between beta radiation and clonogenic transformed cells which are part of a primary tumor and related metastases. Under the consideration that beta emissions in this particular case can be taken as high LET radiation, the critical time and fraction number for local minima in the transformed cell population and can be found in closed form. Results: This theory can explain the observed behavior for the primary tumor and particularly for metastases in a mice‐melanoma experimental model, where 3 out of 7 of the treated animals showed no metastases. This result suggests the possibility of a fractionation scheme for total dose which can produce the same effect when repeated intravenous inoculations are provided at the proper critical time intervals. Conclusions: For metastases control with radionuclides, which are beta emitters like FDG as therapeutic agents, a treatment planning and follow up is possible from a quantitative point of view using a radiobiological kinetic model based on DNA damage mechanisms.

It contributes to the existing literature by examining the effect of urbanization, taking into account dynamics and the presence of heterogeneity in the sample of countries. The results show an inverted-U shaped relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions. Indeed, the elasticity emission-urbanization is positive for low urbanization levels, which is in accordance with the higher environmental impact observed in less developed regions. Among our contributions is the estimation of a semi-parametric mixture model that allows for unknown distributional shapes and endogenously classifies countries into homogeneous groups. Three groups of countries are identified for which urbanization's impact differs considerably. For two of the groups, a threshold level is identified beyond which the emission-urbanization elasticity is negative and further increases in the urbanization rate do not contribute to higher emissions. However, for the third group only population and affluence, but not urbanization, contribute to explain emissions. The differential impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions should therefore be taken into account in future discussions of climate change policies. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Developing countries; Panel data; Q25; Q4; Q54; Semi-parametric mixture model; Urbanization","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; environmental impact; environmental policy; heterogeneity; parameterization; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955106619

Thus, an updated recommendation for a breath carbon monoxide (CO) cut-off is needed that optimally determines smoking status. We evaluated and compared the performance of breath CO and semiquantitative cotinine immunoassay test strips (urine and saliva NicAlert®) alone and in combination. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Urban drug addiction research and treatment facility. Participants Ninety non-treatment-seeking smokers and 82 non-smokers. Measurements Participants completed smoking histories and provided breath CO, urine and saliva specimens. Urine and saliva specimens were assayed for cotinine by NicAlert® and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS). Findings An optimal breath CO cut-off was established using self-report and LCMSMS analysis of cotinine, an objective indicator, as reference measures. Performance of smoking indicators and combinations were compared to the reference measures. Breath CO ≥5 parts per million (p.p.m.) optimally discriminated smokers from non-smokers. Saliva NicAlert® performance was less effective than the other indicators. Conclusions In surveys of smokers and non-smokers in areas with strong smoke-free laws, the breath carbon monoxide cut-off that discriminates most effectively appears to be ≥5p.p.m. rather than the ≥10p.p.m. cut-off often used. These findings may not generalize to clinical trials, regions with different carbon monoxide pollution levels or areas with less stringent smoke-free laws. © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.

PM emission rates from a dairy in the San Joaquin Valley of California were investigated during June 2008. The facility had 1,885 total animals, including 950 milking cows housed in free-stall pens with an open-lot exercise area, and 935 dry cows, steers, bulls, and heifers housed in open lots. Point sensors, including filter-based aerodynamic mass samplers and optical particle counters (OPC), were deployed at select points around the facility to measure optical and aerodynamic particulate concentrations. Simultaneously, vertical PM concentration profiles were measured both upwind and downwind of the facility using lidar. The lidar was calibrated to provide mass concentration information using the OPCs and filter measurements. Emission rates were estimated over this period using both an inverse modeling technique coupled with the filter-based measurements and a mass-balance technique applied to lidar data. Mean emission rates calculated using inverse modeling (±95% confidence interval) were 3.8 (±3.2), 24.8 (±14.5), and 75.9 (±33.2) g d -1 AU -1 for PM 2.5, PM 10, and TSP, respectively. Mean emissions rates based on lidar data were 1.3 (±0.2), 15.1 (±2.2), and 46.4 (±7.0) g d-1 AU-1 for PM 2.5, PM 10, and TSP, respectively.

The private benefits could include improvements in yields and a decrease in costs while the public benefits could include a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to a diminution in the use of heavy machinery. The aim of this study is to estimate and compare total on-farm GHG emissions from conventional and zero tillage systems based on selected grain crop rotations in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia. The value chain was identified, including all inputs, and emissions. In addition, studies of soil carbon sequestration and nitrous oxide emissions under the different cropping systems were reviewed. The value chain analysis revealed that the net effect on GHG emissions by switching to zero tillage is positive but relatively small. In addition though, the review of the sequestration studies suggests that there might be soil-based emissions that result from zero tillage that are being under-estimated. Therefore, zero tillage may not necessarily reduce overall GHG emissions. This could have major implication on current carbon credits offered from volunteer carbon markets for converting conventional tillage to reduced tillage system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Conventional tillage; Farm inputs; Greenhouse gas emissions; Zero tillage","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; crop improvement; crop rotation; crop yield; cultivation; dryland farming; emission control; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; machinery; public service; soil carbon; tillage; Australia; Darling Downs; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957575108

Fluxes of N2O, CO2 and CH4 from soil were measured under maize (Zea mays L.) grown using 0, 60 and 120 kg N hm-2 as NH4NO3-N and composted manure-N in three seasons on clay (Chromic luvisol) and sandy loam (Haplic lixisol) soils in Zimbabwe. The fluxes were measured using the static chamber methodology involving gas chromatography for ample air analysis. Over an average of 122 days we estimated emissions of 0.1 to 0.5 kg N2O-N hm-2, 711 to 1574 kg CO2-C hm-2 and-2.6 to 5.8 kg CH4-C hm-2 from six treatments during season II with the highest fluxes. The posed hypothesis that composted manure-N may be better placed as a mitigation option against soil emissions of GHG than mineral fertilizer-N was largely supported by N2O fluxes during the wet period of the year, but with high level of uncertainty. Nitrogen addition might have stimulated both emissions and consumption of CH4 but the sink or source strength depended highly on soil water content. We concluded that the application of mineral-N and manure input may play an important role with reference to global warming provided the season can support substantial crop productivity that may reduce the amount of N2O loss per unit yield. Confidence in fluxes response to agricultural management is still low due to sporadic measurements and limited observations from the southern African region. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cattle manure; Greenhouse gas; Maize; Mineral fertilizer; Plant captured carbon","agricultural emission; agricultural management; air sampling; cattle; clay; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; gas chromatography; global warming; greenhouse gas; maize; manure; sandy loam; seasonality; soil emission; soil water; water content; yield response; Zimbabwe; Bos; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956081133

Multiple 30-year simulations are conducted for each of the seven methods and results are analyzed in terms of the mean climatology and the probability density functions (PDFs) of key variables based on daily data. Results show that the method used for canopy interception strongly affects how rainfall is partitioned between canopy evaporation and throughfall. However, the impact on total evaporation is much smaller, and the impact on rainfall and air temperature is negligible. Similarly, the PDFs of canopy evaporation and transpiration for six selected regions are strongly affected by the method used for canopy interception, but the impact on total evaporation, temperature and precipitation is negligible. Our results show that the parameterization of rainfall interception is important to the surface hydrometeorology, but the seven interception parameterizations examined here do not cause a statistically significant impact on the climate of the coupled model. We suggest that broad scale climatological differences between coupled climate models are not likely the result of how interception is parameterized. This conclusion is inconsistent with inferences derived from earlier uncoupled simulations, or simulations using very simplified climate models. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,"climate modeling; evaporation; hydrometeorology; interception; probability density function; rainfall; regional climate; throughfall; transpiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959776913

A reduction in obliquity increases the meridional gradient of the annual mean insolation, causing a strengthening of the atmospheric and ocean circulation that transports more heat poleward. The heat transport does not balance the direct obliquity forcing completely, and additional local radiative fluxes are required to explain the change in the equilibriumenergy budget. The surface temperature generally increases at low latitudes and decreases at high latitudes following the change in the insolation. However, in some areas, the sign of the temperature change is opposite of the forcing, indicating the strong influence of feedbacks. These feedbacks are also responsible for a decrease in the global mean temperature despite that the change in the global mean insolation is close to zero. The processes responsible for these changes are increases in the ice fraction at high latitudes and the global cloud fraction-both of which reduce the absorbed solar radiation. A reduction in the global greenhouse trapping, due to changes in the distribution of the water vapor content of the atmosphere as well as a change in the lapse rate, has an additional cooling effect. Among these feedbacks, clouds and the lapse rate have the larger contribution, with water vapor and surface albedo having a smaller effect. The implications of the findings presented here for interpretation of obliquity cycles in the paleoclimate record are discussed. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy budget; Feedback; Radiation","Annual mean; Cooling effects; Energy budgets; Global clouds; Global-mean temperature; Heat transport; High Latitudes; Ice fraction; Influence of feedback; Lapse rate; Low latitudes; Meridional gradients; Ocean circulation; Paleoclimate records; Radiative fluxes; Surface albedo; Surface temperatures; Temperature changes; Water vapor contents; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Earth (planet); Feedback; Greenhouse effect; Incident solar radiation; Sun; Water content; Water vapor; Climate models; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate feedback; climate modeling; energy budget; heat transfer; radiation budget; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959330860

Over a total area of about 7000 m2, detailed measurements of woody biomass were conducted using structural information such as diameter at breast height (dbh), total height, and stem height. At the same time, the wet weight of herbaceous, shrubs, and litter was registered within that area. Soil samples were also collected to determine parameters such as bulk density and organic carbon. The above-ground tree biomass (AGB) was quantified by two non-destructive methods. This biomass was expressed from each reservoir studied in t.ha-1 and the carbon content was then calculated using a factor of 0.5. Carbon stocks in the ecosystems studied were 162, 92, and 48tC.ha-1 for Yungas, Chaco, and shrublands, respectively. Our results show that carbon is concentrated in the soil or as AGB. The latter is the most important reservoir in Yungas, while the soil plays this role in the other two, drier environments. In the province of Salta, native forests play a significant role in the mitigation of greenhouse gases. Our results reveal the magnitude of carbon stocks in some characteristic regional native forests, and estimate their carbon sequestration potential.

To implement the strategy, a £3·8 billion, 25-year private finance initiative contract was developed and awarded in April 2009 for the construction and operation of waste disposal facilities to process domestic refuse arising from nine of the ten boroughs within Greater Manchester. The new facilities include 25 household waste recycling centres, seven transfer loading stations, four in-vessel composting plants, a materials recovery facility and five mechanical biological treatment plants.

Replacement of Portland clinkers up to 20 wt.% with SCMs in normal cements reduced CO2 emission by 0.18 kg CO2/kg. The compressive strength exceeded the standard specification for Portland cement ASTM C-150. Blended cement samples containing 20% Portland clinker replacement had compressive strengths of 37 MPa after 28 days of curing time. The microstructure evolution of blended cement at a composition of 80:20 was similar to that of the 100% Portland cement, where the structure between days 28 and 56 reached a steady state. Blended cements with compositions of 70:30 and 60:40 still showed progress of CSH plate formation and the lack of massive structure development. It is shown that the use of supplementary cementing materials could be as one of alternative ways to reduce CO2 emissions during cement production.","CO2 emission; Mechanical strength; Portland clinkers; Portland-blended cement; SCMs","Blended cement; Cement production; Curing time; Microstructure evolutions; Partial replacement; Portland clinkers; Portland-blended cement; SCMs; Steady state; Structure development; Supplementary cementing materials; Cementing (shafts); Compressive strength; Portland cement; Pozzolan; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959618754

However, depending on the metabolic state of the respective cell the starch-related carbon fluxes are different. The vast majority of the transitory starch biosynthesis relies on the hexose phosphate pools derived from the reductive pentose phosphate cycle and, therefore, is restricted to ongoing photosynthesis. Transitory starch is usually degraded in the subsequent dark period and mainly results in the formation of neutral sugars, such as glucose and maltose, that both are exported into the cytosol. The cytosolic metabolism of the two carbohydrates includes reversible glucosyl transfer reactions to a heteroglycan that are mediated by two glucosyl transferases, DPE2 and PHS2 (or, in all other species, Pho2).In heterotrophic cells, accumulation of starch mostly depends on the long distance transport of reduced carbon compounds from source to sink organs and, therefore, includes as an essential step the import of carbohydrates from the cytosol into the starch forming plastids. In this communication, we focus on starch metabolism in heterotrophic tissues from Arabidopsis thaliana wild type plants (and in various starch-related mutants as well). By using hydroponically grown A. thaliana plants, we were able to analyse starch-related biochemical processes in leaves and roots from the same plants. Within the roots we determined starch levels and the morphology of native starch granules. Cytosolic and apoplastic heteroglycans were analysed in roots and compared with those from leaves of the same plants. A. thaliana mutants lacking functional enzymes either inside the plastid (such as phosphoglucomutase) or in the cytosol (disproportionating isoenzyme 2 or the phosphorylase isozyme, PHS2) were included in this study. In roots and leaves from the three mutants (and from the respective wild type organ as well), starch and heteroglycans as well as enzyme patterns were analysed. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.","Cytosolic glucosyl transferases; Cytosolic heteroglycans; Heterotrophic tissues; Photoautotrophic tissues; Starch metabolism","Arabidopsis protein; carbon; monosaccharide; starch; water; Arabidopsis; article; autotrophy; cytology; cytosol; enzymology; growth, development and aging; hydroponics; metabolism; plant leaf; plant root; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; solubility; ultrastructure; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Autotrophic Processes; Carbon; Cytosol; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Hydroponics; Monosaccharides; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Solubility; Starch; Water; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958772222

The allocation of fuels, other than rice husks, was decided based on the current demand for and supply of rice husks. To prevent the bulky nature of rice husks, briquette production is also discussed. In the power generation scenarios, the differences between two capacities (5 MW and 30 MW) were analyzed. The results of analysis reveal that CH4 and N2O emissions from open burning contribute largely to the current GHG emissions. Therefore, ceasing open burning alone has a large GHG mitigation potential. The use of briquettes, even though GHG is emitted during the production stage, can still contribute to GHG emission mitigation as the production is more efficient than rice husk burning or dumping. In the power generation scenarios, most GHG emissions were derived from the combustion process. Therefore, gasification which has a little combustion process is the most efficient GHG mitigator. Both the replacement of grid electricity by generated electricity, and the replacement of diesel oil by pyrolyzed oil show larger GHG mitigation potentials than what could be derived from open burning cessation alone. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Combustion; Cooking; Gasification; GHG emission; Mitigation; Pyrolysis","Combustion pro-cess; Diesel oil; GHG emission; GHG mitigation; Grid electricity; Life cycle inventory analysis; Mitigation; Open burning; Production stage; Pyrolyzed oil; Rice husk; Viet Nam; Briquets; Briquetting; Combustion; Diesel fuels; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Gas generators; Gasification; Global warming; Life cycle; Pyrolysis; Greenhouse gases; combustion; diesel; electricity generation; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; mitigation; pyrolysis; rice; An Giang; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960374791

Bioenergy production and trade will likely continue to increase into the future, driven by climate change concerns, emissions reduction targets, increasing concerns about domestic energy security and favourable policies. The harmonization of European standards and the development of certification systems are key issues to resolving potential negative effects of increased biomass trade. Certification systems not only address the issue of environmental sustainability from production to end-use, but also allow for product differentiation while adding value to sustainably produced products, which can ultimately enhance a competitive and sustainable bioenergy market. In addition to analyzing bioenergy trade growth in the European Union, a questionnaire survey of 92 bioenergy experts from eight member states within the European Union was conducted. Survey results show that bioenergy is highly accepted in the European Union but that there is a lack of European standards and policy harmonization, along with the absence of a competitive market or a certification system, all of which are necessary for sustainable production and trade of bioenergy.

However, premises and internal process optimisation on industrial parks is not considered sufficient to limit greenhouse emissions in Flanders. Structural transition is called for, aiming for industrial clustering and energy autonomy based on renewables. Therefore, the concept of industrial symbiosis is analysed to determine how it could improve the energy-related carbon management on industrial parks. This article explores the literature on industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks searching for specific energy strategies, and is illustrated with case studies. Energy management on industrial parks can be integrated in the entire development process and park management. Maximising efficiency is a promising local optimisation issue, in which business should be engaged, stimulated and facilitated. By clustering buildings and processes, by energy exchange, collective production and joint contracting of energy services, local synergies can be intensified. Yet, uncertainty and variability in time of energy consumption can keep developers from tailoring industrial park design and utilities. Instead flexibility and solidity could be gained, and the offer of business space could be diversified, supported by a persevering issuing procedure to join similar and matching energy profiles. Energy management on industrial parks in Flanders has only recently started but is expected to gain professionalism. However further research is needed on this flexible design and thermal planning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2010, solar PV's share of the Australian electricity market was still only 0.1%. The program was also environmentally ineffective and costly, reducing emissions by 0.09MtCO2-e/yr over the life of the rebated PV systems at an average cost of between AU$238 and AU$282/tCO2-e. In addition, the data suggest there were equity issues associated with the program, with 66% of all successful applicants residing in postal areas that were rated as medium-high or high on a Socio-economic Status (SES) scale. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Photovoltaic; Renewable energy; Solar PV","Australian electricity market; Average cost; Energy systems; Photovoltaic; PV generation; PV system; Rebate program; Renewable energy; Renewable energy programs; Residential photovoltaic; Socio-economic status; Solar photovoltaics; Solar PVs; Economics; Photovoltaic effects; Solar energy; Solar power generation; cost-benefit analysis; electricity supply; energy planning; household energy; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; socioeconomic status; solar power; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955884566

Approximately half the world's population is at risk and it is of prime importance to evaluate the burden of malaria at the spatial as well as the temporal level. The role of the environment with regard to the determinants of transmission and burden of the disease are described followed by a discussion of special issues such as urban malaria, human population mapping and the detection of changes at the temporal scale. Risk maps at appropriate scales can provide valuable information for targeted control and the present review discusses the essentials of principles, methods, advantages and limitations of remote sensing along with a presentation of ecological, meteorological and climatologic data which rule the distribution of malaria. The panel of commonly used analytic methods is examined and the methodological limitations are highlighted. A review of the literature details the increasing interest in the use of remotely sensed data in the study of malaria, by mapping or modeling several malariometric indices such as prevalence, morbidity and mortality, which are discussed with reference to vector breeding, vector density and entomological inoculation rate, estimates of which constitute the foundation for understanding endemicity and epidemics.","Environment; Indicators; Malaria; Remote sensing; Satellites; Statistics; Urban malaria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052070357

Based on a systematic vegetation inventory and an ordination analysis, four plant community types were chosen for the study: Ericales-Pleurozium string tops, Betula-Sphagnum string margins, Trichophorum tussock flarks and Carex-Scorpidium wet flarks. We measured plant community CO2 exchange with a closed chamber technique during the growing season of 2007 and early summer of 2008. Nonlinear regression models were used for simulating the CO2 exchange over the measurement period for different mire components and for the whole mire. The CO2 exchange dynamics distinguished two functional components in the mire: an ombrotrophic component (Ericales-Pleurozium string tops) and a minerotrophic component (other plant community types). Minerotrophic plant communities responded similarly to environmental controls, the most important of these being variation in leaf area and aerobic peat volume (water level). The ombrotrophic component dynamics were more obscure; frost and possibly peat moisture played a role. The minerotrophic communities functioned as effective CO2 sinks in the simulation, while the net CO2 exchange of the ombrotrophic community was close to zero. The smaller NEE of the ombrotrophic community was due to less efficient photosynthesis per unit leaf area in combination with high ecosystem respiration resulting from a large aerobic peat volume. Our study shows that a fen/bog functional dichotomy can also exist within one mire. Wet minerotrophic communities within northern mires can act as effective CO2 sinks. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chamber; Eddy covariance; Functional diversity; Net ecosystem exchange; Peatland; Photosynthesis; Plant community; Respiration","bog; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; eddy covariance; frost; growing season; mire; net ecosystem exchange; nonlinearity; peatland; photosynthesis; plant community; respiration; spatial variation; tussock grassland; volume; Finland; Betula; Carex; Ericales; Pleurozium; Scorpidium; Sphagnum; Trichophorum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957830843

The function of bZIP11 has been investigated in over-expression studies, and bZIP11 has been found to inhibit plant growth. The addition of sugar does not rescue the growth inhibition phenotype. Here, the function of the bZIP11 transcription factor was investigated. The mechanism by which bZIP11 regulates growth was studied using large-scale and dedicated metabolic analysis, biochemical assays and molecular studies. bZIP11 induction results in a reprogramming of metabolism and activation of genes involved in the metabolism of trehalose and other minor carbohydrates such as myo-inositol and raffinose. bZIP11 induction leads to reduced contents of the prominent growth regulatory molecule trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P). The metabolic changes detected mimic in part those observed in carbon-starved plants. It is proposed that bZIP11 is a powerful regulator of carbohydrate metabolism that functions in a growth regulatory network that includes T6P and the sucrose non-fermenting-1 related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1). © 2011 The Authors.

Methane and ethylene were selected as the surrogate fuel in the present study due to their drastically different features of ignition and extinction properties and flame propagation speeds, such that the mixtures of them may be utilized to mimic practical hydrocarbon fuels with various kinetic properties in experiments. The recently released USC Mech-II for C1-C4 was grafted with the NOx sub-mechanism in GRI-Mech 3.0 with updated reaction parameters for prompt NO formation. The resulting detailed mechanism with 129 species and 900 reactions was first validated against experiments involving NOx enrichment and reasonably good agreements were observed. The detailed mechanism was then employed as the starting mechanism for the reduction. A skeletal mechanism with 44 species and 269 reactions was derived using the methods of directed relation graph (DRG) and DRG-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA); a 39-species reduced mechanism with 35 semi-global reaction steps was further obtained using the linearized quasi steady state approximations (LQSSA). Five species related to prompt NO were retained in the reduced mechanism because of their significant impacts on the fuel oxidation. The reduced mechanism closely agrees with the detailed mechanism for ignition and extinction of homogenous mixtures, as well as selected 1-D flames over a wide range of parameters with NO concentrations between 0% and 3%. The observed worst-case relative error of the reduction is approximately 20%. The reduced mechanism was further validated with experiments involving excessive NOx enrichment. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.","Directed relation graph; DRG-aided sensitivity analysis; Linearized quasi steady state approximation; Mechanism reduction; Methane-ethylene mixture; NO enrichment","Directed relation graph; DRG-aided sensitivity analysis; Mechanism reduction; Methane-ethylene mixture; NO enrichment; Quasi steady state approximation; Ethylene; Experiments; Fuels; Linearization; Methane; Mixtures; Sensitivity analysis; Reduction; ethylene; fuel; hydrocarbon; methane; nitrogen oxide; article; controlled study; heat sensitivity; intermethod comparison; nonhuman; oxidation kinetics; priority journal; skeleton; thermal conductivity; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955920316

We discuss and evaluate the two leading candidates for auction format: a uniform-price sealed-bid auction and an ascending-bid dynamic auction, either of which could be augmented with a ""price collar"" to ensure that the price of allowances is neither too high nor too low. We identify the primary trade-offs between these two formats as applied to carbon allowance auctions and suggest additional auction design features that address potential concerns about efficiency losses from collusion and other factors. We conclude that, based on currently available evidence, a uniform-price sealed-bid auction is more appropriate for the sale of carbon allowances than the other leading auction formats, in part because it offers increased robustness to collusion without significant sacrifice of price discovery. © The Author 2011.

The measurements are normally used to derive atmospheric temperatures and winds, but uncertainties on the actual emission layers were so far a serious drawback for their correct interpretation. The non-LTE models used for Mars and Venus in the present analysis are entirely similar in order to perform consistent comparisons between the two planets. In particular, the same scheme of CO2 states and ro-vibrational bands are used, with similar assumptions on collisional routes and rate coefcients, and also the same radiative transfer approximations. The emissions at 10-μm are produced in both atmospheres by the same excitation mechanism: radiative pumping of the CO2(0001) vibrational state by direct solar absorption(at 4.3 μm) and indirect absorption (at 2.7 μm, followed by collisional quenching). The computed radiances are specially strong in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere of the two planets during maximum solar illumination, producing a population inversion in such conditions with the lower states of the bands, the CO2 (1000) and CO 2(0200). We obtained that other population inversions are also possible, involving higher energy CO2 states. The larger solar ux available on Venus is found to produce larger vibrational populations and stronger emissions than equivalent atmospheric layers on Mars, in agreement with the observations. A number of perturbation studies were used to determine the exact emission altitudes, or weighting function peaks, for usual nadir sounding.

These measurements represent an excellent dataset to perform comparative studies between the terrestrial planets' upper atmospheres, and also to test our theoretical understanding of these emissions. In order to exploit these datasets, we apply a set of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) models developed at the IAA/CSIC, in Granada, Spain, to a selection of data. In general, the models can explain the main spectral features of the measurements, and also the altitude and solar zenith angle variations. However, the simulations for Mars and Venus give an incorrect ratio of the emissions at two wavelengths, 4.4 and 4.32μm. In order to explain this deficiency, a revision of the most uncertain non-LTE energy transfer parameters has been performed. The quenching rate of ν3 quanta of high-energy CO2 states by CO2 itself could reduce the model-data discrepancy if increased by a factor 24, still within its current uncertainty range. This factor, however, is subject to the uncertainty in the thermal structure. A number of simulations with the non-LTE models were also used to study and compare the role of radiative transfer in this spectral region in the three terrestrial planets. Sensitivity studies of density and temperature are also presented, and they permit an analysis of how the differences between the planets and between the three instruments affect their sounding capabilities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Aeronomy; Infrared astronomy; Planetary atmospheres; Radiative transfer; Remote sounding","Aeronomy; Comparative studies; Data sets; Earth orbits; Energy transfer parameters; ENVISAT; Fluorescence emission; High energy; Infrared astronomy; Limb emission; Limb measurements; MARS-EXPRESS; Non-LTE; Nonlocal; Planetary atmosphere; Quenching rate; Remote sounding; Sensitivity studies; Solar zenith angle; Spectral feature; Spectral region; Terrestrial planets; Thermal structure; Thermodynamic equilibria; Two wavelength; Venus Express; Computer simulation; Energy transfer; Instruments; Planets; Radiation; Radiative transfer; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Upper atmosphere; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961166821

In all cases, the most stable structure featured the adatom(s) at positions near one of the edges of the GNR. However, whereas in the most stable structures of the single-adatom systems Ni/GNR, Ru/GNR, Rh/GNR, and Pd/GNR the adatom was located above a bay of the zigzag edge, Fe/GNR and Co/GNR were found to be most stable when the adatoms were at a first-row hole site, while the two configurations were nearly equienergetic for Pt/GNR. Similarly, whereas the most stable structures of the two-adatom systems Ni2/GNR, Ru2/GNR, Rh2/GNR, and Pd2/GNR had the adatoms above two neighboring edge bays, Co2/GNR and Pt2/GNR were most stable with the adatoms stacked in a double-decker configuration above a single edge bay, and Fe2/GNR with the adatoms stacked at a single first-row hole site. Adatom adsorption involved strong hybridization between the metal d states and the GNR states, and adsorption at sites near a GNR edge generally reduced the average magnetic moment of carbon atoms at that edge to near zero, though in some cases-notably two Co2/GNR configurations-it led to the GNR edges having non-negligible magnetic moments of the same sign even though at the start of the optimization the metal atoms were nonmagnetic and the GNR edges had opposite signs (the preferred configuration of the pristine GNR). The electronic character of GNRs with adsorbed transition metal atoms or dimers depended on the species and concentration of the adsorbate and on the adsorption site(s), different stable or near-stable systems exhibiting semiconducting, zero-gap semiconducting, metallic, or half-metallic behavior. © 2011 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961184772

The orientation of the Au 16 cluster and number of neighboring surface vacancies affect the overall structural and electronic properties of the cluster. The results of the PBE, vdW-DF, and vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functionals are compared for the cluster-substrate interaction for systems with and without defects. In the presence of defects size two and greater, an Au atom adsorbs into the topmost graphene layer; this strongly influences the binding energy (&gt;3 eV), while inducing substantial bending in the carbon plane and altering electronic properties of the system. Though the Td-symmetry and electronegative properties of the Au16 structure change in the presence of greater neighboring defects, elements of the cagelike starting structure remain throughout. The electron localization function shows that the in-plane Au-C bonds are of delocalized (metallic) nature and there is a local charge transfer to the coordinating Au. However, the net charge transfer between adsorbate and substrate is considerable only for the defect-free case (0.8e to Au 16). Finally, the binding of O2 molecules to the adsorbed Au16 cluster is used to probe the potential catalytic activity of graphite and carbon nanotube systems, and in one case (for defect size two) the adsorbed O2 switches on the catalytically active superoxo-state. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Defect size; Defect-free; Density-functional study; Electron localization function; Exchange-correlation functionals; Graphene layers; In-plane; Structure change; Surface vacancies; Adsorption; Binding energy; Carbon nanotubes; Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Defects; Electronic properties; Graphene; Graphite; Ion exchange; Surface defects; Van der Waals forces; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961216893

Expanding biofuel production into areas now used for agriculture reduces the need to clear natural ecosystems, leading to indirect climate benefits through reduced greenhouse-gas emissions and faster payback of carbon debts. Biofuel expansion may also cause direct, local climate changes by altering surface albedo and evapotranspiration, but these effects have been poorly documented. Here we quantify the direct climate effects of sugar-cane expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado, on the basis of maps of recent sugar-cane expansion and natural-vegetation clearance combined with remotely sensed temperature, albedo and evapotranspiration over a 1.9 million km 2 area. On a regional basis for clear-sky daytime conditions, conversion of natural vegetation to a crop/pasture mosaic warms the cerrado by an average of 1.55 (1.45-1.65)C, but subsequent conversion of that mosaic to sugar cane cools the region by an average of 0.93 (0.78-1.07)C, resulting in a mean net increase of 0.6C. Our results indicate that expanding sugar cane into existing crop and pasture land has a direct local cooling effect that reinforces the indirect climate benefits of this land-use option. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"albedo; biofuel; cerrado; climate change; crop production; ecosystem management; emission; evapotranspiration; land use; mapping; remote sensing; sugar cane; surface; Brazil; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052202529

Changes in the operation of a combustion process, for example, can induce fluctuations that have unexpected consequences such as an increased level of emissions. Despite the importance of these changes, their impact and relevance are often ignored in analyses of industrial process data due to the complexity of these phenomena. It seems that the behavioral evolution of a process could be understood more easily by monitoring the transition of the process from one characteristic state to another. We demonstrate here that the self-organizing map (SOM) provides an efficient method for revealing the most characteristic features of input data, making it a powerful tool for discovering general phenomena and visualizing the behavior and evolution of a combustion process. In this approach the process data are analyzed using a SOM and K-means clustering to create subsets representing the separate process states in the boiler. A trajectory analysis is then performed to indicate fluctuations in the process and their implications. The results show that process fluctuations can significantly affect the levels of nitrogen oxides released. The method enables efficient diagnosis, and provides a clear illustration of the evolution of the process and an applicable means of defining the best path for achieving a more efficient process that produces less emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial neural network; Energy production; Fluidized bed; K-means; Nitrogen oxide; Self-organizing map","Artificial Neural Network; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion pro-cess; Efficient method; Efficient process; Energy productions; Harmful emissions; Industrial processs; Input datas; K-means; K-means clustering; Process data; Process fluctuations; Process state; Trajectory analysis; Conformal mapping; Fluidization; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Self organizing maps; Fluidized bed combustion; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; cluster analysis; combustion; data interpretation; emission control; industrial practice; nitrogen oxides; power generation; power plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79251597159

However, hydrological changes (wet/dry conditions) during the LIA appear to be very different across different climatic regimes, suggesting that the position, strength and/or pattern of atmospheric circulation could have changed significantly in the past. Therefore, paleohydrological studies may have some implications for potential future hydrological changes in an anticipated warming world. In this study, we investigated hydrological changes over the last ~800 years in the arid Tarim Basin, northwestern China. We used carbon isotopes of plant remains (mainly leaves) from a 10.5 m long aeolian sand sediment section to evaluate changes in dry/wet conditions. The average value of carbon isotopes of plant remains during the LIA period (~AD 1490 to 1890) is -26.0‰, ranging from -28.2‰ to -23.6‰, much lower than values before (average of -24.3‰, from -25.5‰ to -22.4‰) and after this period (average of -22.8‰, -24.6‰ to -21.6‰). Although other environmental factors could also affect carbon isotopes to some degree, such consistent, large negative isotopic excursions of up to 6‰ strongly suggest a wetter climatic condition in the study area at that time, which is also consistent with two silty clay layers, indicating a wet depositional environment, found around AD 1560 and AD 1625 during the LIA period. This inference is consistent with previous studies suggesting a relatively wet period during the LIA in the Tarim Basin and possibly extending to the western central Asia region, but appears to be opposite to hydrological changes in regions that are today dominated by Asian monsoon systems. This pattern of regional hydrological changes may be related to possible changes in the trajectory or strength of the westerlies and/or the orographic effect in this region, as previous studies suggested. © The Author(s) 2010.","aridity; LIA; plant carbon isotopes; Tarim Basin","arid region; aridity; atmospheric circulation; carbon isotope; depositional environment; hydrological change; Little Ice Age; orographic effect; paleoclimate; paleohydrology; trajectory; warming; westerly; China; Tarim Basin; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954623003

However, planning of chemical centres still involves many formidable challenges, including locating production sites, arrangement of transportation, and selection of appropriate technologies. These problems become further complicated when considering the geographic situation of a region under study.In this paper, we propose a multi-period mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach to the optimal planning of chemical centres. The planning horizon is firstly divided into several time intervals, and the planning region is represented by a grid. Then a superstructure representation is developed to capture all available logistic and technical options. Based on the superstructure representation, an MIP problem is developed, and by solving it an optimal planning strategy can be obtained.

The high strength carbon emissions has brought great harm to the earth since industrialization before hundreds of years, and the global warming and extreme weather cause humans to develop low-carbon economy. Low-carbon economy has become a consensus of the entire human race no matter developed countries or developing countries, which is the combination of the lifestyle changing and production structure basic changing and technical innovation. It is well known that China is the largest developing country in the world. With the rapid industrialization of country, energy demand of Chinese society is increasing in an incredible speed, China has become the second largest energy consumer and the first carbon emissions country at present. Furthermore, Chinese energy structure and production methods are very inappropriate, which cannot guarantee the sustainable development of China in future, and therefore actively developing low-carbon economy is the only road to realize China's economic development mode change and sustainable development, which is supported by central government and local governments. Low carbon economy for China is not only an opportunity but also a great challenge. Firstly, this paper discusses the current situation of energy supply and energy structure in China. Secondly, current situation of units' energy consumption in China is discussed. Thirdly, some application practices of low carbon are described, such as low carbon traffic, low carbon city, and low carbon village.

A total of 20 species in 13 genera are described, amongst which one species Biharisporites grosstriletus sp. nov. is new. The other 19 are previously known from the Euramerican and Gondwanan floral provinces, but are described here for first time from the Cathaysian Province. Using first appearances of selected megaspore species and changes in species abundance in the succession, four assemblage zones can be recognised. In ascending order these are the Auritolagenicula renaulti-Setosisporites brevispinosus (RB, Moscovian), the Bentzisiporites margaritatus-Spencerisporites striatus (MS, Kasimovian-Roadian), the Biharisporites grosstriletus (G, Wordian-Capitanian) and the Biharisporites cf. foskettensis (F, Wuchiapingian) assemblage zones. Comparison with already known in situ megaspores indicates that the parent plants of the dispersed megaspores were mainly lycopods and this in turn indicates their likely palaeoenvironmental significance. Selaginella-like herbs and subarborescent lycopods which were low in abundance compared with arborescent lycopods in the early Pennsylvanian appeared to have become prevalent from the Late Pennsylvanian in northern China. However, some arborescent lycopods (mainly sigillarians) still played an important role in the Permian coal forming plants of the region. Several Carboniferous megaspores characteristic of Euramerica persist into the Mid Permian in North China, indicating that a warm and humid climate prevailed in this area during Pennsylvanian to Roadian, whereas the climate of Euramerica had already become arid by the end of the Carboniferous. This warm and humid climate in northern China made it a refuge for some typically Euramerican Carboniferous plants. From Roadian, with the disappearance of coal and marine sediments together with the appearance of red beds, the MS megaspore zone progressively changed to the G zone. This probably reflects the adaptation of the parent plants to a more and more arid climate. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Late Permian; Megaspores; North China; Pennsylvanian; Stratigraphy","abundance; adaptation; biostratigraphy; coal; herb; humid environment; marine sediment; moss; new record; paleobotany; paleoenvironment; Pennsylvanian; Permian; spore; succession; taxonomy; China; Shanxi; Lycopodium; Selaginella; Setosisporites; Sigillaria; Spencerisporites striatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957555498

Design/methodology/approach: A climate change adaptation strategy tool (CCAST) with built-in GIS capability has been developed for agricultural industries. Development of the GIS functionality within CCAST includes the implementation of map projection, boundary allocation, interpolation and a graphical display of spatial data. In total, 20 climatic and crop indices are computed alongside basic climate variables (rainfall and temperature) from downscaled global climate models at 1,062 sites across the state of New South Wales (NSW) located in eastern Australia. Findings: A case study in Australia is used to demonstrate use of this tool. This shows selecting suitable genotypes of wheat is a key adaptation strategy to mitigate the impacts of climate change on wheat cropping. It shows that spring wheat genotypes will become predominate, while the winter genotypes will only be viable in clearly defined areas where sufficient days of cool temperature exist for completion of vernalisation in a future warmer climate.

Even though bioethanol production from sugarcane is considered to be a beneficial and cost-effective greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategy, it is still a matter of controversy due to insufficient information on the total GHG balance of this system. Aside from the necessity to account for the impact of land use change (LUC), soil N2O emissions during sugarcane production and emissions of GHG due to preharvest burning may significantly impact the GHG balance. Based on a thorough literature review, we show that direct N2O emissions from sugarcane fields due to nitrogen (N) fertilization result in an emission factor of 3.87±1.16% which is much higher than suggested by IPCC (1%). N2O emissions from N fertilization accounted for 40% of the total GHG emissions from ethanol-sugarcane production, with an additional 17% from trash burning. If LUC-related GHG emissions are considered, the total GHG balance turns negative mainly due to vegetation carbon losses. Our study also shows that major gaps in knowledge still exist about GHG sources related to agricultural management during sugarcane production, e.g. effects of irrigation, vinasse and filter cake application. Therefore, more studies are needed to assess if bioethanol from sugarcane is a viable option to reduce energy-related GHG emissions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biofuel; Ethanol; Global warming; Land use change; LCA; Sugarcane","Bioethanol; Biofuels; Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Economics; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Land use; Nitrogen fertilizers; Sugar cane; Agricultural management; Alternative energy source; Bio-ethanol production; Emission factors; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Land-use change; Literature reviews; Mitigation strategy; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859082020

Aggregates with closed- (internal mixing) and open-cell configurations are constructed by means of stochastic procedures using homogeneous and core-shell spheres with smooth or rough surfaces as building blocks. The complex aggregate shape and composition can be accounted for by using the hit-and-miss Monte Carlo geometric photon tracing method. We develop an integral expression for diffraction by randomly oriented aggregates based on Babinet's principle and a photon-number weighted geometric cross section. With reference to surface-wave contributions originally developed for spheres, we introduce a nonspherical correction factor using a non-dimensional volume parameter such that it is 1 for spheres and 0 for elongated particles. The extinction efficiency, single-scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor results for randomly oriented columns and plates compare reasonably well with those determined from the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) computer codes for size parameters up to about 20. The present theoretical approach covers all size ranges and is particularly attractive from the perspective of efficient light absorption and scattering calculations for complex particle shape and inhomogeneous composition.We show that under the condition of equal volume and mass, the closed-cell configuration has larger absorption than its open-cell counterpart for both ballistic and diffusion-limited aggregates. Because of stronger absorption in the closed-cell case, most of the scattered energy is confined to forward directions, leading to a larger asymmetry factor than the open-cell case. Additionally, light absorption for randomly oriented snowflakes is similar to that of their spherical counterparts under the condition of equal geometrical cross section area for both external and internal mixing states; however, nonspherical snowflakes scatter less light in forward directions than spheres, resulting in a substantial reduction of the asymmetry factor. We further demonstrate that small soot particles on the order of 1 γm internally mixed with snow grains could effectively reduce snow albedo by as much as 5-10%. Indeed, the depositions of black carbon would substantially reduce mountain-snow albedo, which would lead to surface warming and snowmelt, critical to regional climatic surface temperature amplification and feedback. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Aggregate aerosol; Black carbon; Geometric optics; Monte Carlo photon tracing; Snow grain; Surface waves","Asymmetry factor; Black carbon; Building blockes; Closed cells; Complex aggregates; Complex particles; Computer codes; Core-shell spheres; Correction factors; Cross section; Cross-section area; Diffusion-limited aggregates; Discrete dipole approximation; Elongated particles; Extinction efficiency; Finite difference time domains; Geometric optics; Internal mixing; MONTE CARLO; Monte Carlo photon tracing; Non-Spherical; Nonspherical particle; Open-cell; Photon-tracing methods; Rough surfaces; Scattering calculations; Single-scattering albedo; Size parameters; Size ranges; Snowmelt; Soot particles; Stochastic procedure; Substantial reduction; Surface temperatures; Surface warming; Theoretical approach; Volume parameters; Wave approach; Absorption; Agglomeration; Atmospheric aerosols; Finite difference time domain method; Forward scattering; Geometry; Light; Light absorption; Monte Carlo methods; Photons; Plants (botany); Snow; Solar radiation; Spheres; Surface waves; Aggregates; aerosol; aggregate; albedo; asymmetry; black carbon; diffraction; light scattering; mixing; Monte Carlo analysis; snow; soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955741600

Not all forms of agriculture, however, have equivalent impacts on global warming. Industrial agriculture contributes significantly to global warming, representing a large majority of total agriculture-related GHG emissions. Alternatively, ecologically based methods for agricultural production, predominantly used on small-scale farms, are far less energy-consumptive and release fewer GHGs than industrial agricultural production. Besides generating fewer direct emissions, agro-ecological management techniques have the potential to sequester more GHGs than industrial agriculture. Here, we review the literature on the contributions of agriculture to climate change and show the extent of GHG contributions from the industrial agricultural system and the potential of agro-ecological smallholder agriculture to help reduce GHG emissions. These reductions are achieved in three broad areas when compared with the industrial agricultural system: (1) a decrease in materials used and fluxes involved in the release of GHGs based on agricultural crop management choices; (2) a decrease in fluxes involved in livestock production and pasture management; and (3) a reduction in the transportation of agricultural inputs, outputs and products through an increased emphasis on local food systems. Although there are a number of barriers and challenges towards adopting small-scale agroecological methods on the large scale, appropriate incentives can lead to incremental steps towards agro-ecological management that may be able to reduce and mitigate GHG emissions from the agricultural sector. © CAB International 2011.","Adaptation; Agro-ecology; Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial agriculture; Land conversion; Mitigation; Small-scale agriculture",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052496089

Methods and Materials: For 35 LA-NSCLC patients, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and IMRT plans were made to a prescription dose (PD) of 66 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Dose escalation was performed toward the maximal PD using secondary endpoint constraints for the lung, spinal cord, and heart, with de-escalation according to defined esophageal tolerance. Dose calculation was performed using the Eclipse pencil beam algorithm, and all plans were recalculated using a collapsed cone algorithm. The normal tissue complication probabilities were calculated for the lung (Grade 2 pneumonitis) and esophagus (acute toxicity, grade 2 or greater, and late toxicity). Results: IMRT resulted in statistically significant decreases in the mean lung (p <.0001) and maximal spinal cord (p = .002 and 0005) doses, allowing an average increase in the PD of 8.6-14.2 Gy (p ≤.0001). This advantage was lost after de-escalation within the defined esophageal dose limits. The lung normal tissue complication probabilities were significantly lower for IMRT (p <.0001), even after dose escalation. For esophageal toxicity, IMRT significantly decreased the acute NTCP values at the low dose levels (p = .0009 and p <.0001). After maximal dose escalation, late esophageal tolerance became critical (p <.0001), especially when using IMRT, owing to the parallel increases in the esophageal dose and PD. Conclusion: In LA-NSCLC, IMRT offers the potential to significantly escalate the PD, dependent on the lung and spinal cord tolerance.

Methanotrophic bacteria living in close association with mosses are thus not restricted to Sphagnum species and low-pH peatlands. 2.Moss-associated methane oxidation (MAMO) can be an effective buffer for CH4 emissions from permafrost-affected tundra, a region that is of high importance for the global greenhouse gas budget. Combining biogeochemical and molecular approaches revealed that MAMO in polygonal ponds exceeds methanotrophic activity in terrestrial sites by up to two orders of magnitude. 3.Moss-associated methane oxidation is not only promoted by submerged conditions but also by light exposure. Polygonal ponds covered by the brown moss Scorpidium scorpioides became a net sink for atmospheric CH4 (-1.7mgCH4m-2day-1) when exposed to sunlight but a CH4 source (21.6mgCH4m-2day-1) in the absence of light. 4.Based on stable isotope probing with 13CH4, carbon deriving from CH4 was incorporated into the bacterial fatty acids 16:1ω7 and 18:1ω9/ω7 common in methanotrophs and into plant phytol, sitosterol and stigmastanol, all of which are highly abundant in moss biomass. 5.Synthesis. A mutualistic symbiosis between methanotrophic bacteria and brown mosses reduces CH4 emissions from Arctic polygonal tundra by at least 5%. Both partners benefit from this association: the moss from the additional CO2 supplied through methane oxidation and the methane-oxidizing bacteria from the oxygen produced through photosynthesis. Considering that submerged mosses are widely abundant in the polar region, MAMO may have a major impact on carbon turnover rates in Arctic freshwater environments. © 2011 The Authors.

Integrating energy input-output model with carbon emission pinch analysis, we propose a framework for managing urban energy system. This framework could analyze current energy demands and CO2 emissions, predict their future possibilities and optimize energy mix of key sectors under CO2 emission constraints. Key sectors are identified by the energy input-output table from both direct and accumulative perspectives. Moreover, taking Suzhou, a typical manufacturing center and export-oriented city in China, as a case example, energy metabolism of Suzhou in 2020 is predicted using energy input-output model. And three sectors named Coking, Smelting and pressing of metals and Production and supply of electric power are identified to have big effects on CO2 emissions. Subsequently, energy mix of three identified key sectors is optimized under CO2 emission constraints by the carbon emission pinch analysis. According to the results, clean energy sources will occupy a great position in Suzhou's future energy demands. And the reuse of wastes as energy sources should be limited to achieve CO2 mitigation targets.

Increasingly alternative economies are being suggested, whereby the growing energy demand of the future is met with greater efficiency and with more renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and biomass. This implies a gradual shift from the reliance on conventional hydrocarbon-driven technologies toward more innovative, carbon-neutral, sustainable ones. Using hydrogen in fuel-cell applications offers a number of advantages over existing fuels and other emerging competitors. It is a high-quality, carbon-free energy carrier that can achieve improved efficiencies with reduced or zero GHG emissions over the entire ""well-to-wheel"" (WTW) life cycle. These benefits are even further underpinned by the fact that hydrogen can be manufactured from a number of primary energy sources, such as natural gas, coal, biomass, and solar energy, contributing toward greater energy security and flexibility. Based on these attributes, a number of long-term strategic initiatives have been undertaken to promote the development of national and regional hydrogen economies [1].

ZmPTF1 encoded a putative protein of 481 amino acids that had identity with OsPTF1 in basic region. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that ZmPTF1 was quickly and significantly up-regulated in the root under phosphate starvation conditions. Overexpression of ZmPTF1 in maize improved root development, enhanced biomass both in hydroponic cultures and sand pots, and the plants developed more tassel branches and larger kernels when they were grown in low phosphate soil. Compared with wild type, overexpressing ZmPTF1 altered the concentrations of soluble sugars in transgenic plants, in which soluble sugars levels were lower in the leaves and higher in the roots. Overexpression of ZmPTF1 enhanced the expression of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and sucrose phosphate synthase1 participated in sucrose synthesis in the leaves but decreased them in the root, and reduced the expression of genes involved in sucrose catabolism in the roots. The modifications on the physiology and root morphology of the plants enhanced low phosphate tolerance and increased the yield under low phosphate conditions.

Solute concentrations were 5 times the median of 65mg/l for global average. Total cationic exchange capacity (Tz+) ranged from 2.4 to 6.1meq/l; and the mean (4.4meq/l) was significantly higher than that of the global river waters. Calcium and bicarbonate dominated the annual ionic composition, accounting for more than 70% of the solute flux that exceeded 71×106kg/yr. Lower concentrations of most measured elements during the monsoon high flow period could be explained by dilution effects from precipitation. Three major reservoirs contributed to the dissolved load: carbonates, silicates and anthropogenic inputs, i.e., some 83% of the riverine cations from carbonates and 17% from silicates. The chemical weathering rate of 26.1t/km2/yr, with respective carbonate and silicate weathering rates of 20.3t/km2/yr (8.46mm/kyr) and 5.75t/km2/yr (2.13mm/kyr), was comparable to the average for global rivers, but higher than that for the Changjiang River in China. The CO2 consumption rate was estimated to be 173.7×103mol/km2/yr and 202.9×103mol/km2/yr by silicate and carbonate weathering, respectively. The CO2 consumed by rock chemical weathering in the upper Changjiang River reduced the atmospheric CO2 level and constituted a significant part of the global carbon budget. Consequently the carbon sink potential of rock chemical weathering in the Qinghai-Plateau deserves extra attention. Population density and anthropogenic activities, particularly agricultural practices, contributed remarkably to dissolved solutes and associated CO2 consumption worldwide, and anthropogenic inputs probably contributed some 10.4% to the dissolved solutes in the Longchuanjiang River. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Anions; Anthropogenic activity; Cations; Chemical weathering; CO2 consumption; Yangtze (Changjiang) River basin","anion; carbon budget; carbon sink; cation; chemical composition; chemical weathering; concentration (composition); human activity; hydrochemistry; lee wave; river water; solute; water chemistry; China; Longchuan River; Yangtze Basin; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953784783

Tea is an important cash crop, and tea plantations commandeer large amounts of arable land throughout the world. In China, 1.3 million hectares dedicated to tea plantation cultivation have been established throughout the last five decades, resulting in a current total of 1.6 million hectares countrywide. For this study, C density and C pools related to biomass as well as the soil and the litter layer were estimated based upon 563 biomass and 255 soil samples procured from both field survey data and data obtained from literature. Subsequent estimations reveal that the total amount of C stored within biomass, the litter layer, and the soil of tea plantations in China is 83.3Tg C (1Tg=1012g C), 8.0Tg C and 225.0Tg C, respectively, and the average C density of biomass, the litter layer, and the soil is 50.90Mg, 4.91Mg, and 137.5Mg C ha-1, respectively. Despite varying climatic conditions and tea plant types specific to the three separate zones, no significant differences were found in biomass C densities. This suggests that the similar managerial (e.g., pruning) practices applied in their maintenance may in fact be the primary factor that shapes tea plantation C storage. Although tea plantations store less C than do resident mature forests, the considerable C storage of tea plantations makes them a factor of critical importance in regional C accounting that cannot be ignored in future research and policymaking initiatives. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon density; Crop plantation; Soil carbon; Vegetation carbon","arable land; assessment method; biomass; carbon sequestration; cash cropping; climate conditions; cultivation; estimation method; litter; planation; policy making; pruning; soil carbon; survey; tea; vegetation structure; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958047569

Here we assess the applicability of carbon finance instruments for the improvement in building energy efficiency by adopting the high efficiency standards as well as advanced energy supply systems, building on a case study in a northern city in China. We find that upgrading the current Chinese BEE standard to one of the best practices in the world coupled with the state-of-the-art energy supply system implies an abatement cost at 16US$/tCO2, which is compatible with the international carbon market price. The institutional reorganization turns out to be indispensable to facilitate the implementation of the proposed scheme of local government-led energy efficiency programme in the form of programmatic CDM in China's buildings sector. We show that with international support such as carbon finance, the BEE improvement will facilitate city's transition to low-carbon supply in the longer term. More importantly, it is argued that demand-side energy performance improvement in buildings should be considered a prerequisite to shifting low-carbon energy supply technologies such as fuel-switching, renewable power generation and Carbon Capture and Storage to address climate mitigation in light of cost-effectiveness and environmental integrity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Abatement costs; Buildings sector; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon emissions; Carbon finance; Carbon markets; Demand-side; Economic instruments; Energy performance; Energy supply system; Energy supply technology; Environmental integrity; High efficiency; In-buildings; Low-carbon; Policy and economics; Policy makers; Renewable power generation; Scaling-up; Buildings; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Energy resources; Fuel storage; Instruments; Energy efficiency; abatement cost; carbon emission; demand-side management; emission control; emissions trading; energy efficiency; local government; mitigation; policy making; power generation; renewable resource; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960950665

International financial and technology transfer are bound to bridge the gap under well-designed institutional framework to facilitate the transition to low(er) carbon development trajectories in developing countries. So far, cities, which contribute nearly 80% of global emissions, have not yet been recognised as a legitimate entity to implement different greenhouse gas mitigation policies and measures with relevant technical and financial abilities. Here we discuss the scope and scale of different climate-relevant financial mechanisms and describe their comparative advantages and weakness in financing climate resilient urban infrastructures (buildings and transport in particular). We show the limitations of current instruments available in scaling up necessary financial flows into developing cities to achieve the long term climate stabilisation targets. Lastly, the paper examines the feasibility of factoring the sector-wise and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) mechanisms into local authorities' long-term mitigation strategy by raising necessary funds to facilitate shifting the business as usual trajectories in developing cities in the next decades. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cities; Climate finance; NAMA; Sectoral approach; Urban infrastructure","capital flow; developing world; emission control; emission inventory; environmental economics; feasibility study; financial provision; global climate; greenhouse gas; institutional framework; national strategy; urban region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960042520

This paper attempts to address this question by investigating the driving forces of transport demand and relevant policy measures that facilitate mitigating GHG emissions in the urban transport sector in Indian cities based on a critical review of the literature. Our overview of existing literature and international experiences suggests that it is critical to improve urban governance in transport infrastructure quality and develop efficient public transport, coupled with integrated land use/transport planning as well as economic instruments. This will allow Indian cities to embark on a sustainable growth pathway by decoupling transport services demand of GHG emissions in the longer term.

The IFMP-REGM is a hybrid methodology of interval mathematical programming, fuzzy linear programming and multi-stage stochastic programming. It can not only handle uncertainties presented as discrete intervals, fuzzy sets and probability distributions, but also reflect dynamic variations of system conditions, particularly for large-scale multistage problems with sequential structures. The uncertain information can be incorporated within a multi-layer scenario tree; revised decisions are permitted in each time period based on the realized values of the uncertain events.

Our example of land-use change to hardwood plantation forestry in sub-tropical Australia illustrates an innovative implementation framework for a social learning process that helped build knowledge and community capacity for adaptive co-management of dynamic and shared landscapes. The action research methodology relied on deliberation over local knowledge, existing and emergent scientific findings, resulting in attitudinal change.

From our measurements at the semi-polluted Heidelberg site in the upper Rhine Valley, we find that in the catchment area CH4 emissions decreased on average by 32 ± 6% from the second half of the 1990s until the first half of the 2000s, but the observed long-term trend of emissions is considerably smaller than that previously reported for southwest Germany. In contrast, regional fossil fuel CO2 levels, estimated from high-precision 14CO2 observations, do not show any significant decreasing trend since 1986, in agreement with the reported emissions for this region. In order to provide accurate verification, these regional measurements would best be accompanied by adequate atmospheric transport modelling as required to precisely determine the relevant catchment area of the measurements. Furthermore, reliable reconciliation of reported emissions will only be possible if these are known at high spatial resolution in the catchment area of the observations.

Objectives: Here, we sought to address the brain-region-specific effects of diesel exhaust (DE) and key cellular mechanisms underlying DE-induced microglia activation, neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic (DA) neurotoxicity. Methods: Rats were exposed to DE (2.0, 0.5, and 0 mg/m 3) by inhalation over 4 weeks or as a single intratracheal administration of DE particles (DEP; 20 mg/kg). Primary neuron-glia cultures and the HAPI (highly aggressively proliferating immortalized) microglial cell line were used to explore cellular mechanisms. Results: Rats exposed to DE by inhalation demonstrated elevated levels of whole-brain IL- 6 (interleukin- 6) protein, nitrated proteins, and IBA - 1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1) protein (microglial marker), indicating generalized neuroinflammation. Analysis by brain region revealed that DE increased TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α), IL 1β, IL-6, MIP-1α (macrophage inflammatory protein-1α) RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products), fractalkine, and the IBA-1 microglial marker in most regions tested, with the midbrain showing the greatest DE response. Intratracheal administration of DEP increased microglial IBA-1 staining in the substantia nigra and elevated both serum and whole-brain TNFα at 6 hr posttreatment. Although DEP alone failed to cause the production of cytokines and chemokines, DEP (5 μg/mL) pretreatment followed by lipopolysaccharide (2.5 ng/mL) in vitro synergistically amplified nitric oxide production, TNFα release, and DA neurotoxicity. Pretreatment with fractalkine (50 pg/mL) in vitro ameliorated DEP (50 μg/mL)-induced microglial hydrogen peroxide production and DA neurotoxicity. Conclusions: Together, these findings reveal complex, interacting mechanisms responsible for how air pollution may cause neuroinflammation and DA neurotoxicity.","Air pollution; Brain; Microglia; Neuroinflammation; Oxidative stress; Parkinson's disease","advanced glycation end product receptor; calcium binding protein; chemokine; cytokine; dopamine; fractalkine; hydrogen peroxide; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; macrophage inflammatory protein 1; nitric oxide; protein Iba 1; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; air pollution; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; brain region; cell activation; cell immortalization; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytokine production; encephalitis; exhaust gas; glia; in vitro study; long term exposure; male; mesencephalon; microglia; nerve cell culture; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; rat; regulatory mechanism; substantia nigra; Air Pollution; Animals; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Chemokine CCL3; Chemokine CX3CL1; Dopaminergic Neurons; Hydrogen Peroxide; Inflammation; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-6; Male; Microfilament Proteins; Microglia; Rats; Rats, Inbred WKY; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Vehicle Emissions; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961033108

One of the most recent efforts in this quest was the release of a Green Campus Action Plan for the University of Cape Town by the Properties and Services Department in 2008. While the Plan proposed a number of carbon emission mitigation interventions for the University, it also stressed the need to conduct a detailed and comprehensive carbon footprint analysis for the whole University. The aim of this analysis was to determine the carbon footprint of UCT, not only to give a tangible number with which the University's carbon sustainability level can be compared with other academic institutions, but also to provide the much needed baseline against which future mitigation efforts on the university campus can be measured. UCT's carbon footprint for the year 2007 was found to be about 83 400 tons CO2-eq, with campus energy consumption, Transportation and Goods and Services contributing about 81%, 18% and 1% the footprint respectively. Electricity consumption alone contributes about 80% of all the emissions associated with university activities. UCT's per-capita emissions for 2007 amount to about 4.0 tons CO2-eq emissions per student. For comparison only, South Africa's 2007 per capita emissions were estimated at 10.4 tons CO2-eq. In terms of energy consumption only, UCT's footprint is about 3.2 tons CO2-eq per student, higher than the National University of Lesotho's value of 0.1 and much lower than Massachusetts Institute of Technology's value of 33.1.","Carbon footprint; Greenhouse gas emissions; University of Cape Town",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051817029

Yeast infections are common and often occur in the skin and mucous membranes; however emerging species have changed this epidemiological profile. The ability to colonize different anatomical sites has been associated with the pathogenicity of Candida when environmental conditions are particularly favorable. In the case of hot, humid climates, the attrition suffered by the skin and weakened immune defenses may result in yeasts becoming pathogenic rather than commensal organisms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to diagnose yeast infections in military personnel and to evaluate the frequency of these infec tions in the individuals evaluated. METHODS: The clinical material analyzed was see ded in duplicate in Sabouraud dextrose agar (Difco TM) and Mycosel medium (Difco™). The etiologi cal agents were identified by observing the germ tubes, micro cul tu re and physiological cha racteris tics, assimila tion of car bon sour ces (auxa no gram) and fermentation of car bon sour ces(zymo gram). RESULTS: Of a total of 197 patients evaluated, 91 (46.2%) had episodes of candidiasis. The genitocrural region was the most com monly affected area (47.7%) followed by the inter digital regions (between the toes or fingers) (27.8%). Candidaalbicans, Candida parapsi - losis, Candidatropica is, Candida glabrata and emergent species such as Candida krusei and Candida guilliermondii were found.

At room temperature (RT), a saturation TMA dose produced 0.8 monolayers (ML) of semi-ordered species on a Ge(100) surface due to the dissociative chemisorption of TMA. STS confirmed the chemisorption of TMA passivated the bandgap states due to dangling bonds. By annealing the TMA-dosed Ge surface, the STM observed coverage of TMA sites decreased to 0.4 ML at 250 C, and to 0.15 ML at 450 C. XPS analysis showed that only carbon content was reduced during annealing, while the Al coverage was maintained at 0.15 ML, consistent with the desorption of methyl (-CH 3) groups from the TMA adsorbates. Conversely, saturation TMA dosing at RT on the monolayer H2O pre-dosed Ge(100) surface followed by annealing at 200 C formed a layer of Ge-O-Al bonds with an Al coverage a factor of two greater than the TMA only dosed Ge(100), consistent with Ge-OH activation of TMA chemisorption and Ge-H blocking of CH3 chemisorption. The DFT shows that the reaction of TMA has lower activation energy and is more exothermic on Ge-OH than Ge-H sites. It is proposed that the H2O pre-dosing enhances the concentration of adsorbed Al and forms thermally stable Ge-O-Al bonds along the Ge dimer row which could serve as a nearly ideal atomic layer deposition nucleation layer on Ge(100) surface. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",,"Atomic imaging; Bandgap state; Carbon content; Direct reactions; Dissociative chemisorption; Functionalized; Ge surfaces; Ge(100); Ge(100) surface; Nucleation layers; Room temperature; Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (stm); Scanning tunneling spectroscopy; Thermally stable; Trimethylaluminum; Ultrahigh vacuum techniques; XPS analysis; Activation energy; Aluminum; Annealing; Atomic layer deposition; Atomic spectroscopy; Chemisorption; Dangling bonds; Desorption; Monolayers; Nucleation; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Scanning tunneling microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Germanium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051685547

Although they are capable of providing high quality atmospheric chemistry profiles through the utilization of high resolution inputs relating meteorology and emissions with chemical reactions, they cannot simulate air quality accurately if other input data are not appropriate and reliable. There have been few studies on the importance of chemical initial conditions (ICs) as it is considered that the impact of concentration fields specified at the beginning of simulation wears off quickly. This paper demonstrates that the significant errors during the early part of the simulation can damage model predictions and conversely if the ICs are prescribed appropriately with available observations, they can compensate for the shortcomings of the air quality prediction system especially when the episode-based emissions inputs representing real-life emission variations such as forest fires as well as the effects of long-range transport events that are not reflected in the basic model inputs. The key hypothesis of the present study is that prediction of aerosols can be improved by the initialization of the aerosol fields with the satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). We compare the effects of using fine mode and total AOD for the initialization in terms of regional bias characteristics. We found that the impacts of two-step initial conditions adjustments could be substantial in the case of aerosol events such as wildfires, which the present modeling system does not consider during simulation due to the deficiency in the emission inputs. The total AOD case helped to refine PM2.5 predictions over the northwestern area, where wildfire events occurred, for the fire event days improving the correlation coefficient significantly from 0.12 to 0.67. CMAQ predicted PM2.5 concentrations in the fine mode case decreased by 10-50 μg/m3 in large areas of the northwestern region, resulting in more realistic PM2.5 predictions with reduced unusual high peak cells. This study suggest that the use of initial conditions adjusted by total or fine mode AOD can help to improve PM2.5 simulations, even though further refinements of the vertical distribution of aerosols are critically needed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosol optical depth; Aerosol simulation; CMAQ; Initial conditions; MODIS AOD; Particulate matter simulation","Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol simulation; CMAQ; Initial conditions; MODIS AOD; Particulate matter simulation; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Computer simulation; Deforestation; Fires; Forecasting; Atmospheric aerosols; aerosol property; air quality; atmospheric modeling; error analysis; forest fire; long range transport; optical depth; particulate matter; prediction; satellite imagery; vertical distribution; wildfire; aerosol; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; air quality standard; article; community multiscale air quality model; fire; forest; optical depth; particulate matter; prediction; priority journal; simulation; telecommunication; Aerosols; Air Quality; Chemical Reactions; Deforestation; Forecasts; Forest Fires; Meteorology; Particles; Simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958074798

These initiatives include local deliberative processes of low-carbon futures as well as local-global interactions in 'eco-innovation jam' dialogues carried out in a virtual space, but founded on communicating with local stakeholder groups. Experiences from national processes and international examples of these structured dialogues of community engagement raise important questions of environmental justice and deliberative processes that facilitate participation by some groups, but perhaps also neglect others. This is particularly relevant since the environmental justice discourse traditionally frames environmental concerns in a place-bound manner that includes local responses to environmental questions. In this paper we argue the importance of local and global forums and deliberative processes for community engagement in order to incorporate stakeholders' perceptions of future options for low-carbon living, travelling and consuming services and products. Important policy transformations in planning for low-carbon societies are outlined and results from cases are discussed. We conclude with three remarks about the importance of citizen participation for understanding local conditions for change, processes of localized internationalization, and new roles for nation states facing the climate change challenge.

In particular, Treponema denticola trans-enoyl-CoA reductase (Ter), which utilizes NADH as the reducing power, was used for the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA instead of Clostridium acetobutylicum butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase to by-pass the need of Clostridial ferredoxins. Addition of polyhistidine-tag increased the overall activity of Ter and resulted in higher 1-butanol production. Removal of oxygen is an important factor in the synthesis of 1-butanol in this organism. This result represents the first autotrophic 1-butanol production. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Biofuel; Butanol; Cyanobacteria; Metabolic engineering; Synthetic biology","1-butanol; Butyryl-CoA; Chemical feedstocks; Chromosomal integration; Clostridium acetobutylicum; Clostridium species; Cyanobacteria; Cyanobacterium; Environmental problems; Metabolic engineering; Production pathways; Reducing power; Synechococcus elongatus; Synthetic biology; Carbohydrates; Carbon dioxide; Clostridium; Enzyme activity; Gene expression; Metabolism; Alcohols; biofuel; butanol; carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; coenzyme A; ferredoxin; methylcrotonoyl coenzyme A carboxylase; polyhistidine tag; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; article; biofuel production; chromosomal localization; Clostridium; cyanobacterium; enzyme activity; fermentation technique; gene expression; metabolic engineering; priority journal; Synechococcus elongatus; Treponema denticola; 1-Butanol; Bacterial Proteins; Butyryl-CoA Dehydrogenase; Carbon Dioxide; Clostridium acetobutylicum; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Genetic Engineering; Organisms, Genetically Modified; Synechococcus; Treponema denticola; Clostridium; Clostridium acetobutylicum; Cyanobacteria; Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301; Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942; Treponema denticola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958747820

Two complementary environmental screening methods developed by the U.S. EPA, namely: (i) the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) and (ii) Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI), are used to quantify geographic and chemical environmental impacts in the U.S. PWB manufacturing industry based on Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data. Although the release weight percentages of industrial chemicals such as methanol, glycol ethers and dimethylformamide comprise the larger fraction of reported air and water emissions, results indicate that lead, copper and their compounds' releases correspond to the highest environmental impact from toxicity potentials and risk-screening scores. Combining these results with further knowledge of PWB manufacturing, select alternative chemical processes and materials for pollution prevention are discussed. Examples of effective pollution prevention options in the PWB industry include spent etchant recovery technologies, and process and material substitutions. In addition, geographic assessment of environmental burden highlights states where promotion of pollution prevention strategies and emissions regulations can have the greatest effect to curb the PWB industry's toxic release impacts. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental impact assessment; Pollution prevention; Printed wiring boards; Risk screening; Toxics Release Inventory","Chemical process; Circuit designs; Emissions regulations; Environmental burdens; Environmental indicators; Glycol ethers; Hazardous chemicals; Manufacturing industries; Material substitutions; Plating process; Pollution prevention; Printed wiring boards; Recovery technology; Risk screening; Screening methods; Spent etchant; Toxic release; Toxicity potential; Toxics Release Inventory; Water emissions; Weight percentages; Air pollution; Dimethylformamide; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Ethers; Glycols; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Industrial emissions; Industry; Lead compounds; Manufacture; Methanol; Pollution control; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuit design; Rating; Toxicity; Environmental impact; carcinogen; copper; ether; formaldehyde; glycol; lead; methanol; n,n dimethylformamide; water; emission inventory; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; environmental risk; heavy metal; manufacturing; prioritization; regulatory approach; risk assessment; secondary sector industry; toxicity test; air; article; ecotoxicity; electronics; electronics industry; environmental impact assessment; geographic distribution; pollution; printed wiring board; risk assessment; screening; United States; Electronic Waste; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Industrial Waste; Metals; Organic Chemicals; Risk Assessment; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953803820

The simulation experiments were carried out with a QSPA Kh-50 (Quasi-Stationary Plasma Accelerator) in Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology (Ukraine) and an RPI-IBIS (Multi-Rod Plasma Injector) facility in the Andrzej Soltan Institute for Nuclear Studies (IPJ) Swierk (Poland). QSPA Kh-50 generates hydrogen plasma streams of duration of 0.25 ms and the heat loads in the range of 0.2- 2.5 MJ/m2, which correspond to the Edge Localized Modes (ELM) impacts expected in ITER. The plasma stream diameter is 18 cm, averaged ion energy is about 0.4 keV, and the maximum plasma pressure achieves 3.2 bar. Due to that fact, using the QSPA Kh- 50 it is possible to simulate ITER transient events. Deuterium plasma streams with power density of 10-50 W/m2 and pulse duration of 1-5 μs, generated by RPIIBIS were used for comparative studies and determination of an initial stage of evaporated impurities dynamics during plasma-surface interactions as well as features of surface damages appearing under varied plasma parameters. In order to determinate the main plasma parameters (an electron density and temperature) and to study of impurities behavior at the time of discharge the use was made of optical spectroscopy methods. The onset of a vapor shield in front of the target surface was investigated in dependence on a surface heat load for tungsten (W) and carbon (C) targets. Information about dynamics of the W- and C-ions production was obtained. Some issues of the droplet splashing at the tungsten surfaces and the formation of hot spots upon the graphite surface, which can be sources of the enhanced evaporation, are also discussed.",,"Heavy ions; Plasma devices; Plasma interactions; Plasma theory; Spectroscopic analysis; Thermal load; Tokamak devices; Tungsten; Comparative studies; Droplet splashing; Edgelocalized modes; Graphite surfaces; Institute of Physics; Optical spectroscopy; Plasma facing materials; Plasma-surface interactions; Electric discharges",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051988035

Approximately 40 nautical miles SE from Urania Lake, the presence of anoxic hypersaline lake, which we named Thetis, was confirmed by swath bathymetry profiling and through immediate sampling casts. The brine surface of the Thetis Lake is located at a depth of 3258m with a thickness of ~157m. Brine composition was found to be thalassohaline, saturated by NaCl with a total salinity of 348‰, which is one of highest value reported for DHALs. Similarly to other Mediterranean DHALs, seawater-brine interface of Thetis represents a steep pycno- and chemocline with gradients of salinity, electron donors and acceptors and posseses a remarkable stratification of prokaryotic communities, observed to be more metabolically active in the upper interface where redox gradient was sharper. [ 14C]-bicarbonate fixation analysis revealed that microbial communities are sustained by sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophic primary producers that thrive within upper interface. Besides microaerophilic autotrophy, heterotrophic sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation are likely the predominant processes driving the ecosystem of Thetis Lake. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"methane; RNA 16S; sea water; archaeon; article; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; biochemistry; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; salinity; sea; Archaea; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biochemical Processes; Biodiversity; Methane; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Salinity; Seawater; Prokaryota; Urania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051936638

Regional frequency models, which take into account data in fixed or flexible 'regions' when fitting a distribution at any site, lead to estimates with much smaller errors compared to a single-site analysis, and efficiently reduce random and climatologically irrelevant variations in the estimates of the model parameters and high quantiles. The region-of-influence (ROI) methodology with a built-in regional homogeneity test is recognized as a useful approach, with the model based on proximity of sites outperforming the Hosking-Wallis regional frequency analysis. Comparison of estimates of the return period of a heavy precipitation event on 24 June 2009, which triggered a disastrous local flash flood, illustrates that the at-site analysis leads to unrealistic and extremely uncertain estimates that strongly depend on whether or not a single outlying observation is involved in the sample, while all regional methods yield return periods in the same order of several hundreds of years, notwithstanding whether the 2009 data are included in the sample. The ROI method may be found useful for modelling probabilities of other meteorological variables, extremes of which are strongly influenced by sampling variability, and may also represent an efficient tool for 'smoothing' random variations in the estimates of model parameters and high quantiles of precipitation in high-resolution regional climate model simulations. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Central Europe; Extreme value analysis; Precipitation extremes; Region-of-influence method; Regional frequency analysis","Central Europe; Extreme value analysis; Precipitation extremes; Region of influences; Regional frequency analysis; Computer simulation; Estimation; Parameter estimation; Probability distributions; Random errors; Uncertainty analysis; Climate models; climate modeling; climatology; error analysis; flash flood; frequency analysis; precipitation assessment; regional climate; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960746529

Six scenarios of future enduse technology evolution are analyzed without any future emissions mitigation policy, and with two linear emissions constraints that begin in 2012 and achieve 50% and 80% reductions from 1990 CO2 emissions levels in 2050.The scenarios show that end-use technologies are important for reducing near-term energy demand and CO2 emissions, and advanced transportation technologies in particular are important for allowing the energy system as a whole to achieve deep emissions reductions in a cost-effective manner. Total discounted economic costs of meeting the emissions constraints are reduced by up to 53% by advanced end-use technologies, and similar cost reductions are observed when the policies allow intertemporal shifting in the emissions pathways (i.e., banking and borrowing). The scenarios highlight the importance of end-use technologies that facilitate electrification and decrease the direct use of hydrocarbon fuels through efficiency improvement, but we stress that end-use technology advancement should be complementary to technology advancement in energy supply.

Subsequently, recent studies on advanced ESIPT molecules and their optoelectronic applications are surveyed, particularly focusing on chemical sensors, fluorescence imaging, proton transfer lasers, and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Organic fluorescent molecules harnessing excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process are drawing great attention due to their unique and beneficial photophysical properties such as a large Stokes' shift, no self-absorption, and easy population inversion of the keto form, which are attributed to its intrinsic four-level photocycle scheme.

GOSAT carries two instruments. The Thermal And Near-infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) measures reflected radiances in the 0.76 μ oxygen band and in the weak and strong CO2 bands at 1.6 and 2.0 μ . The TANSO Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI) uses four spectral bands at 0.380, 0.674, 0.870, and 1.60 μ to identify clear soundings and to provide cloud and aerosol optical properties. Vicarious calibration was performed at Railroad Valley, Nevada, in the summer of 2009. The site was chosen for its flat surface and high spectral reflectance. In situ measurements of geophysical parameters, such as surface reflectance, aerosol optical thickness, and profiles of temperature, pressure, and humidity, were acquired at the overpass times. Because the instantaneous field of view of TANSO-FTS is large (10.5 km at nadir), the spatially limited reflectance measurements at the field sites were extrapolated to the entire footprint using independent satellite data. During the campaign, six days of measurements were acquired from two different orbit paths. Spectral radiances at the top of the atmosphere were calculated using vector radiative transfer models coupled with ground in situ data. The agreement of the modeled radiance spectra with those measured by the TANSO-FTS is within 7%. Significant degradations in responsivity since launch have been detected in the short-wavelength bands of both TANSO-FTS and TANSO-CAI. © 2006 IEEE.","Carbon dioxide CO2; Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT); thermal and near-infrared sensor for carbon observation (TANSO); vicarious calibration","Aerosol optical property; Aerosol optical thickness; Field of views; Flat surfaces; Fourier transform spectrometers; Geophysical parameters; Global distribution; Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT); Greenhouse gases observing satellites; In-situ data; In-situ measurement; Near-infrared sensors; Radiance spectra; Reflectance measurements; Responsivity; Satellite data; Short-wavelength; Spectral band; Spectral radiance; Spectral reflectances; Sun synchronous orbits; Surface reflectance; Top of the atmospheres; Vector radiative transfer models; Vicarious calibration; Atmospheric aerosols; Calibration; Carbon dioxide; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Infrared detectors; Landforms; Methane; Optical properties; Oxygen; Radiative transfer; Railroads; Reflection; Sensors; Weather satellites; Spacecraft instruments; aerosol; calibration; carbon dioxide; cloud; environmental monitoring; Fourier transform; geophysics; GOSAT; greenhouse gas; humidity; in situ measurement; methane; near infrared; numerical model; observational method; optical property; oxygen; pressure effect; reflectance; satellite data; spectral analysis; spectrometer; temperature effect; wavelength; Nevada; Railroad Valley; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955620772

It combines new biomass and flux data from a study, that was conducted in a miombo woodland within the Kataba Forest Reserve in the Western Province of Zambia, with data from other studies.Results: The measurements at Kataba compared protected area (3 plots) with a highly disturbed plot outside the forest reserve and showed considerably reduced biomass after logging for charcoal production. The average aboveground biomass content of the reserve (Plots 2-4) was around 150 t ha-1, while the disturbed plot only contained 24 t ha-1. Soil carbon was not reduced significantly in the disturbed plot. Two years of eddy covariance measurements resulted in net ecosystem exchange values of -17 ± 31 g C m-2y-1, in the first and 90 ± 16 g C m-2in the second year. Thus, on the basis of these two years of measurement, there is no evidence that the miombo woodland at Kataba represents a present-day carbon sink. At the country level, it is likely that deforestation for charcoal production currently leads to a per capita emission rate of 2 - 3 t CO2y-1. This is due to poor forest regeneration, although the resilience of miombo woodlands is high. Better post-harvest management could change this situation.Conclusions: We argue that protection of miombo woodlands has to account for the energy demands of the population. The production at national scale that we estimated converts into 10,000 - 15,000 GWh y-1of energy in the charcoal. The term ""Charcoal Trap"" we introduce, describes the fact that this energy supply has to be substituted when woodlands are protected. One possible solution, a shift in energy supply from charcoal to electricity, would reduce the pressure of forests but requires high investments into grid and power generation. Since Zambia currently cannot generate this money by itself, the country will remain locked in the charcoal trap such as many other of its African neighbours. The question arises whether and how money and technology transfer to increase regenerative electrical power generation should become part of a post-Kyoto process. Furthermore, better inventory data are urgently required to improve knowledge about the current state of the woodland usage and recovery. Net greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced substantially by improving the post-harvest management, charcoal production technology and/or providing alternative energy supply. © 2011 Kutsch et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Biomass; Deforestation; Eddy covariance; Miombo woodland; Soil carbon","aboveground biomass; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; charcoal; deforestation; eddy covariance; electrical power; energy flux; energy resource; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; logging (timber); net ecosystem exchange; power generation; regeneration; soil carbon; technology transfer; woodland; Western Province [Zambia]; Zambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051800934

In particular, the relationship between leaf traits and climate has received much attention. This paper presents a functional-trait-centred approach to identify potential impacts of climate and land use change on plant species assemblages. Using species atlas data, we modelled the relative frequencies of species with different leaf anatomies (LARF) as a function of observed climate and land use data on a regular spatial grid across Germany. Subsequently, we projected the geographical distribution of LARF with simulated climate and land use data for the late 21st century under two future scenarios. We used a conditional autoregressive regression model to account for spatially structured variation in LARF that remained unexplained by the environmental factors considered. We found a clear relationship between the climatic gradient of water availability and shifts in LARF: increasing water deficit was associated with a decreasing proportion of species with hygromorphic leaves in the composition and increasing proportions of species with scleromorphic and mesomorphic leaves. The variation in LARF due to land use was only small. Under future environmental scenarios the proportion of species with hygromorphic leaves was projected to decrease in all parts of Germany, whereas the proportions of species with sclero- and mesomorphic leaves were projected to increase on average. In particular, Germany's south-western and north-eastern areas were projected to experience functional change in LARF. Our study highlights the relationship between functional traits and plant species vulnerability to climate change. Our results suggest that the functional-trait-centred approach can provide a powerful additional modelling tool to estimate potential impacts of climate change on plant species assemblages. © 2011 The Authors.

In this regard, incineration as a widely used waste treatment technology functions as an alternative to landfill treatment. This study emphasizes the comparison of emission characteristics of pollutants such as NOx, SOx, particulates, and global warming gas (CO2) between incinerators and thermal power plants in Taiwan. From the data and construction information presented here, four types of incinerators as defined by different air pollution control devices (APCDs) are discussed. Taiwan's MSW incineration is considered an available and successful technology for renewable energy exploitation as compared to that of other countries. Thus, a comparison of the pollutant control and emission characteristics of MSW incineration showed that its pollutants are much lower than those from thermal power plants. The pollutants emission level (PEL) of different pollutants shows that the particulates, NOx, and SOx in thermal power plants are about 31, 16, and 267 times more than those in incinerators. Estimation CO2 emission level (CEL) values indicate that the CO2 generated from thermal power plants is lower than those emitted from MSW incineration processes. The reasons for this are the different carbon content, heat energy transfer rate, and heating value between MSW and thermal power stocks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2; MSW incineration; Pollutants; Thermal power plant","Air pollution control devices; Carbon content; Construction information; Emission characteristics; Emission level; Heat energy; Heating value; Limited space; MSW incineration; Pollutant control; Pollutants; Pollutants emissions; Renewable energies; Thermal power; Thermal power plant; Thermal power plants; Treatment technologies; Air pollution control; Air pollution control equipment; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Energy conversion; Energy transfer; Gas plants; Global warming; Incineration; Municipal solid waste; Pollution; Power plants; Refuse incinerators; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste treatment; Waste incineration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; heat transfer; incineration; municipal solid waste; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollutant; pollution control; power plant; thermal power; Taiwan",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051469794

Design/methodology/approach: The paper elaborates on the adverse consequences of climate change in South East Asia, the current efforts taken by the regional countries, the current barriers to deal with the problems and presents a framework for planning responses. Findings: The consequences of climate change from a public health perspective, as well as from an economic, political and resource security standpoint, for South East Asia can be disastrous. Consequently, there is an urgent need to plan national and regional level measures for climate change mitigation and develop comprehensive plans in response to the current and projected climate-related health risks. Practical implications: The paper attempts to provide a detailed framework for addressing the health-related risks of climate change, in such a manner that it can be followed by all countries of the region. Originality/value: South East Asia could face disastrous public health consequences due to climate change. A detailed framework for mitigating climate change effects in the context of public health has been suggested, focusing on strengthening the evidence base to aid climate change policy, advancing knowledge and training to mitigate climate change, implementing adaptation measures, greenhouse gas reduction and developing collaborative work.

The effect of different types and sizes of rapidity distributions is studied in elliptical flow. The elliptical-flow patterns show the important role of nearby spectator matter on the participant zone. This role is further explained on the basis of the passing time of the spectator and the expansion time of the participant zone. The transition from in-plane to out-of-plane emission is observed only when the mid-rapidity region is included into the rapidity bin. Otherwise no transition occurs. The transition energy is found to be highly sensitive to the size of the rapidity bin, while it is only weakly dependent on the type of the rapidity distribution.

On titanate nanowire and tube supports the gold 4f7/2 XP emission appeared after reduction at 83.7 eV and 85.6 eV indicating two different sizes or chemical environments of gold nanoclusters. The titanate nanostructures stabilize the nearly atomically dispersed state of gold (85.6 eV peaks in XPS).

Since 2005 the Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN, www. miren. ethz. ch) investigates the risk of plant invasions into mountains and develops preventive management strategies. A database of non-native and invasive plant species in mountains worldwide includes currently some 1500 species. Particularly problematic are woody species and ornamental plants that are often pre-adapted to a mountain climate. The risk of plant invasions in mountains is expected to increase in the near future. Climate change will enable the upward movement of lowland invaders into mountain ecosystems. Increased anthropogenic land use and disturbances and a shift of land use from grazing systems to tourism, which will lead to the introduction of new non-native plants, may further increase invasion risks. Mountains, and in particular the European Alps, are among the very few ecoregions in the world not yet badly affected by plant invasions. Managers have the unique opportunity to respond in time to an emerging threat. Preventive measures are the most effective and cost-efficient management option. Regulation of the transport of potentially invasive plant species should be a management priority. With climate change the upward movement of native lowland plants may also become a conservation concern. A broad discussion of the valuation and management of the change of mountain floras is needed.

Previously, models have been developed to minimize the cost of a CCS infrastructure network that captures a given amount of CO2. The CCS process can be costly, however, and large-scale implementation by industry will require government regulations and economic incentives. The incentives can price CO2 emissions through a tax or a cap-and-trade system. This paper extends the earlier mixed-integer linear programming model to endogenously determine the optimal quantity of CO2 to capture and optimize the various components of a CCS infrastructure network, given the price per tonne to emit CO2 into the atmosphere. The spatial decision support system first generates a candidate pipeline network and then minimizes the total cost of capturing, transporting, storing, or emitting CO2. To illustrate how the new model based on CO2 prices works, it is applied to a case study of CO2 sources, reservoirs, and candidate pipeline links and diameters in California. © The Author(s) 2011.","CCS; infrastructure; location; model; network; optimization; pipeline","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; decision support system; gas pipeline; linear programing; numerical model; point source pollution; price dynamics; transport process; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958714828

But one major concern related to geological CO2 storage is the possibility of leakage from the reservoir and subsequent effects on the environment, which cannot completely be excluded. This study aims at investigating the environmental impact of CO2 release from reservoirs into near surface terrestrial environments. To understand the effect of CO2 leakage on such an ecosystem, detailed knowledge on the abundance and diversity of plants and microorganisms is essential. Therefore, an ecosystem study has been conducted within the Network of Excellence ""CO2GeoNet"" on a natural CO2 vent at the Laacher See, Germany. Near surface CO2 conditions and CO2 fluxes of the venting area were described by means of conventional soil gas measurement equipment, and brought up the difference between the CO2 anomalies and their surroundings. A comparison of the soil columns between control sites and the centre of the venting area showed a small but significant change in the soil pH below 10cm. The botanical survey revealed vegetation changes which, like the investigation of important soil microbial communities, showed significant differences between the CO2-rich sites (up to 90% and more of soil gas), medium CO2 sites (∼20%), and control locations with background CO2 concentrations. The ecosystem appears to be adapted to the different conditions through species substitution or adaptation, showing a shift towards anaerobic and acidotolerant to acidophilic species under elevated CO2 concentrations. It is hoped that the final outcome of this ongoing study will be the identification of possible botanical and microbial indicators, whose presence or absence provides easily detectable evidence for leakage of CO2 from deep reservoirs into near surface terrestrial ecosystems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Acidification; CO2; Denitrification; Laacher See; Methanogenesis; Microbiology","Control sites; Deep reservoirs; Effect of CO; Elevated CO; Geological storage; Germany; Laacher See; Methanogenesis; Microbial indicators; Microbial populations; Natural CO; Near-surface; Soil column; Soil gas; Soil microbial community; Soil pH; Species substitution; Terrestrial ecosystems; Terrestrial environments; Vegetation change; Biology; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Soils; Vegetation; Carbon dioxide; abundance; anoxic conditions; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon emission; carbon flux; concentration (composition); denitrification; ecosystem response; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbiology; soil analysis; species diversity; vegetation cover; Germany; Laacher See; Rhineland-Palatinate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051471757

Assisted colonization is perceived by some as a last option for conserving endangered species and by others as a risky and unwise management effort due to current gaps of knowledge. Based on the pros and cons of the recent debate, we show that the current discussion mainly focuses on the assisted colonization of rare and endangered species beyond their natural range of distribution. We suggest that a more useful approach for the conservation of endangered species could occur by focusing on the relevant foundation or keystone species, which ensure ecosystem integrity for a multitude of dependent species by governing the habitat structure and micro-climate of the site. Examples of foundation species include dominant tree species in forests or dominant corals in coral reefs. For a given conservation or restoration need (e.g. conservation of rare species), we recommend the assisted colonization of pre-adapted ecotypes of the relevant foundation species from climates similar to future expectations for the target site. This approach could lead to climate-safe habitats for endangered species with minimal adverse effects on recipient ecosystems. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","Adaptation strategy; Assisted migration; Core species; Ecosystem engineers; Managed relocation; Managed translocation; Species conservation","adaptation; conservation management; coral reef; endangered species; habitat structure; restoration ecology; species conservation; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954506857

A main concern of this technology is in ensuring that the upwardly buoyant CO2 does not migrate to the surface. Simulation studies suggest that substantial amounts of CO2 can be trapped within permeable sections of a reservoir by capillary forces and intra-reservoir heterogenities, but there is little experimental observation of these phenomena. We report the results of CO2 core flooding experiments at high pressure and temperature performed to investigate the impact of natural capillary heterogeneity in a sandstone rock on CO2 saturation buildup and trapping. CO2 and water were injected through a Mt. Simon sandstone core at 9 MPa pore pressure and 50C. The core had two regions of distinct capillarity: An upstream 10 cm long region of the core consisted of a relatively high permeability and homogenous sand. A downstream 3 cm long region of the core consisted of a low permeability region characterized by significant cross-bedding and a high capillary entry pressure for CO 2. During a drainage process of CO2 displacing water, CO2 builds up upstream of the capillary barrier. Once in place, CO2 on the upstream side of the barrier cannot be displaced during 100% water flooding leading to trapped saturations that are a factor 2-5 times higher than what would be expected from residual trapping alone.

The paper focuses on the economic difference between energy savings and the repayment of investment.Taking out the average remaining 20% equity in long-term property mortgage loans and utilising it for extensive energy renovation improves both the economy and the extent of included measures.Approximately 30% of energy consumption in Denmark is used for space heating. The existing 1 million single-family houses account for approximately half of this, thus making energy renovation a key factor for the reduction of CO2 emissions.The conclusions were that in average the possible budget for renovation varied between €20,000 and 40,000 per single-family house. The equity of the house was particularly dependant on geographical location and construction period. Different energy renovation measures were analysed in terms of economy showing that a wide range of specific measures had a positive economic balance for the homeowner from year 1. The economic balance between saved energy and repayment of the investment is however very dependent on the assumed future energy price. An example showed that a typical house from 1925, still in its original form, could yield annual savings for the homeowner of approximately €2600, assuming a future energy price of 0.2 €/kW. h. At the current energy price level of 0.1 €/kW. h energy renovation in general is almost economically neutral for the homeowner. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Assessed public property value; Energy renovation; Energy savings; Equity; Long-term mortgage loans; Single-family houses","Economics; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heating; Houses; Energy renovation; Energy savings; Equity; Long-term mortgage loans; Property value; Single-family houses; Investments; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic analysis; equity; financial market; future prospect; geographical region; heating; homeowner; long-term change; public sector; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951516946

Those changes are probably due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Even if human greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced, air temperature will continue to rise. Results: Four regional climate models were analysed for Germany. These models project an increase in mean annual air temperature between 1 and 2°C for the middle of the twenty-first century and an increase between 2.5 and 4°C for the end of this century with respect to the mean annual air temperature of the period 1971-2000. Conclusion: This change in climate also affects human health. More and more intense heat waves could for instance increase the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality. In order to keep the impacts of climate change for humans and the environment as small as possible, there is an urgent need to adapt to the changing climate. © 2011 Springer Medizin Verlag.","Adaptation needs; Climate change; Health impacts; Heat waves; Regional climate models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961173811

The CP kinetics followed the non-classical II®-S model, in which CP begins in a spin cluster of proximate abundant spins I(*) and rare spins S, then is controlled by spin diffusion of the abundant spins I from bulk to the I(*) spins of the spin cluster and finally is governed by spin-lattice relaxation of the abundant spins in the rotating frame. The corresponding CP kinetics parameters were determined and analyzed. It was demonstrated that the, λ and Tdf values (the CP time constant, the cluster composition parameter and the 1H spin-diffusion constant, respectively) were very useful to discriminate the functional groups, especially in the 3D parameter space. In order to conveniently analyze the large amount (175) of the collected CP parameters, the number of the observed variables was reduced using the principal component (PC) analysis. The 2D plot of PC2 vs. PC1 showed adequate separation of the CH3, CH2, CH and C cases (C stands for carbons without adjacent hydrogens). It was demonstrated that those cases were located along the PC1 axis in the order of increasing 1H13C dipolar couplings: C&lt;CH 3&lt;CH&lt;CH2.

NM 87185, United States","Research involving management of carbon dioxide has increased markedly over the last decade as it relates to concerns over climate change. Capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) in geological formations is one of many proposed methods to manage, and likely reduce, CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels in the electricity sector. Saline formations represent a vast storage resource, and the waters they contain could be managed for beneficial use. To address this issue, a methodology was developed to test the feasibility of linking coal-fired power plants, deep saline formations for CO2 storage, and extracting and treating saline waters for use as power plant cooling water. An illustrative hypothetical case study examines a representative power plant and saline formation in the south-western United States. A regional assessment methodology includes analysis of injection-induced changes in subsurface groundwater chemistry and fate and transport of supercritical CO2. Initial water-CO2-formation reactions include dissolution of carbonate minerals as expected, and suggest that very little CO2 will be stored in mineral form within the first few centuries. Reservoir simulations provide direct input into a systems-level economic model, and demonstrate how water extraction can help manage injection-induced overpressure. Options for treatment of extracted water vary depending upon site specific chemistry. A high efficiency reverse osmosis system (HERO™) shows promise for economical desalination at the volumes of recovered water under consideration. Results indicate a coupled use CO2 storage and water extraction and treatment system may be feasible for tens to hundreds of years. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide storage; Power generating station cooling water; Saline formation assessment; Water treatment costs","Assessment methodologies; Beneficial use; Carbon dioxide storage; Coal-fired power plant; Deep saline formations; Economic models; Electricity sector; Fate and transport; Formation reaction; Generating stations; Geological formation; Groundwater chemistry; High efficiency; Overpressure; Plant water; Reservoir simulation; Reverse osmosis systems; Saline formation; Site-specific; Storage resources; Supercritical CO; Treatment systems; Water extraction; Water management policy; Water treatment costs; Carbon dioxide; Carbonate minerals; Chemical analysis; Climate change; Coal; Coal storage; Computer simulation; Desalination; Direct injection; Dissolution; Electric substations; Fossil fuel power plants; Groundwater; Petroleum reservoirs; Reverse osmosis; Solvent extraction; Water cooling systems; Water filtration; Water injection; Water management; Water treatment; Saline water; carbon dioxide; carbonate; coal-fired power plant; desalination; electricity industry; feasibility study; overpressure; power generation; research work; water management; water use; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051473927

We find that the best-fit transit depths for visits in the same bandpass can vary by as much as 8% of the total (4.7σ significance) from one epoch to the next. Although we cannot entirely rule out residual detector effects or a time-varying, high-altitude cloud layer in the planet's atmosphere as the cause of these variations, we consider the occultation of active regions on the star in a subset of the transit observations to be the most likely explanation. We find that for the deepest 3.6 μm transit the in-transit data have a higher standard deviation than the out-of-transit data, as would be expected if the planet occulted a star spot. We also compare all published transit observations for this object and find that transits observed in the infrared typically have smaller timing offsets than those observed in visible light. In this case, the three deepest Spitzer transits are all measured within a period of five days, consistent with a single epoch of increased stellar activity. We reconcile the presence of magnetically active regions with the lack of significant visible or infrared flux variations from the star by proposing that the star's spin axis is tilted with respect to our line of sight and that the planet's orbit is therefore likely to be misaligned. In contrast to the results reported by Beaulieu et al., we find no convincing evidence for methane absorption in the planet's transmission spectrum. If we exclude the transits that we believe to be most affected by stellar activity, we find that we prefer models with enhanced CO and reduced methane, consistent with GJ 436b's dayside composition from Stevenson et al. It is also possible that all transits are significantly affected by this activity, in which case it may not be feasible to characterize the planet's transmission spectrum using broadband photometry obtained over multiple epochs. These observations serve to illustrate the challenges associated with transmission spectroscopy of planets orbiting late-type stars; we expect that other systems, such as GJ 1214, may display comparably variable transit depths. We compare the limb-darkening coefficients predicted by PHOENIX and ATLAS stellar atmosphere models and discuss the effect that these coefficients have on the measured planet-star radius ratios given GJ 436b's near-grazing transit geometry. Our measured 8 μm secondary eclipse depths are consistent with a constant value, and we place a 1σ upper limit of 17% on changes in the planet's dayside flux in this band. These results are consistent with predictions from general circulation models for this planet, which find that the planet's dayside flux varies by a few percent or less in the 8 μm band. Averaging over the eleven visits gives us an improved estimate of 0.0452% 0.0027% for the secondary eclipse depth; we also examine residuals from the eclipse ingress and egress and place an upper limit on deviations caused by a non-uniform surface brightness for GJ 436b. We combine timing information from our observations with previously published data to produce a refined orbital ephemeris and determine that the best-fit transit and eclipse times are consistent with a constant orbital period. We find that the secondary eclipse occurs at a phase of 0.58672 0.00017, corresponding to ecos (ω) = 0.13754 0.00027, where e is the planet's orbital eccentricity and ω is the longitude of pericenter. We also present improved estimates for other system parameters, including the orbital inclination, a/R , and the planet-star radius ratio. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society.

Our method accommodates the fundamental differences between the troposphere and middle atmosphere in the long-wave regime within a single parameterization that extends continuously from the surface up to the mesopause region and takes the deviations from the gray limit and from the local thermodynamic equilibrium into account. For this purpose, frequency-averaged Eddington-type transfer equations are derived for four broad absorber bands. The frequency variation inside each band is parameterized by application of the Elsasser band model extended by a slowly varying envelope function. This yields additional transfer equations for the perturbation amplitudes that are solved numerically along with the mean transfer equations. Deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium are included in terms of isotropic scattering, calculating the single scattering albedo from the two-level model for each band. Solar radiative flux densities are computed for four energetically defined bands using the simple Beer-Bougert-Lambert relation for absorption within the atmosphere. The new scheme is implemented in a mechanistic general circulation model from the surface up to the mesopause region. A test simulation with prescribed concentrations of the radiatively active constituents shows quite reasonable results. In particular, since we take the full surface energy budget into account by means of a swamp ocean, and since the internal dynamics and turbulent diffusion of the model are formulated in accordance with the conservation laws, an equilibrated climatological radiation budget is obtained both at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Deviation from LTE; Deviation from the gray limit; Eddington transfer equation; Idealized radiation scheme; Mechanistic general circulation model; Middle atmosphere; Perturbation radiative fluxes","Deviation from LTE; Deviation from the gray limit; Idealized radiation scheme; Mechanistic general circulation model; Middle atmosphere; Perturbation radiative fluxes; Transfer equation; Climatology; Solar radiation; Surface chemistry; Atmospheric turbulence; atmospheric general circulation model; heating; mesopause; middle atmosphere; parameterization; perturbation; radiation budget; radiative transfer; scattering; solar radiation; thermodynamics; top of atmosphere; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954573174

In this paper, a combination of 15N-labelled fertilizer application and automatic chamber measurements was used to investigate N2O fluxes and soil-plant N transfers for high- and low-density clover patches in an intensively-managed, upland pasture (Auvergne, France) over the course of one growing season. During the six-month study period, N2O fluxes were highly variable. Maximum daily N2O emission was 52 g N2O-N ha-1, and was associated with fertilizer application early in the growing season. Smaller peaks of N2O emission occured in response to cutting events and fertilizer application later in the growing season. Nitrous oxide fluxes derived from 15N-labelled fertilizer peaked at 40% shortly after fertilizer application, but the dominant source of N2O fluxes was the soil N pool. Contrary to expectations, clover density had no significant effects on N content or patterns of 15N recovery in plant or soil mineral N pools. Nevertheless, we found a tendency for increased N2O-N losses from the low clover treatment. Furthermore, 15N recovery in N2O was higher in the low- compared to the high-density clover treatment during favorable growing conditions, suggesting transient shifts in plant/soil competition for N depending on legume abundance. Multiple regression analysis revealed that water-filled pore space (WFPS) and clover dry mass were the main factors driving cumulative N2O emissions in the high clover treatment, whereas variation in cumulated N2O emissions in the low clover treatment was best explained by WFPS and grass mass.

We combined these measures to an impact metric, which is embedded in a broader vulnerability framework and quantifies the impacts of winter storms under climate change until 2060. Sensitivity of forest stands to windthrow was mainly driven by a high proportion of coniferous trees, a complex orography and poor quality soils. Both climate models simulated an increase in the frequency of severe storms, whereby differences between regions and models were substantial. Potential impacts will increase although they will vary among regions with the highest impacts in the mountainous regions.

Here we demonstrate a contrasting scenario in which land-use-related changes in sediment delivery rates drive the formation of expansive marshland, and vegetation feedbacks maintain their morphology despite recent sediment supply reduction. Stratigraphic analysis and radiocarbon dating in the Plum Island Estuary (Massachusetts, United States) suggest that salt marshes expanded rapidly during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries due to increased rates of sediment delivery following deforestation associated with European settlement. Numerical modeling coupled with the stratigraphic observations suggests that existing marshland could survive, but not form under the low suspended sediment concentrations observed in the estuary today. These results suggest that many of the expansive marshes that characterize the modern North American coast are metastable relicts of high nineteenth century sediment delivery rates, and that recent observations of degradation may represent a slow return to pre-settlement marsh extent. In contrast to ecosystem management practices in which restoring pre-anthropogenic conditions is seen as a way to increase ecosystem services, our results suggest that widespread efforts to restore valuable coastal wetlands actually prevent some systems from returning to a natural state. © 2011 Geological Society of America.",,"Coastal wetlands; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Massachusetts; North American; Numerical modeling; Radiocarbon dating; Salt marshes; Sea level rise; Sediment delivery; Sediment supply; Stratigraphic analysis; Suspended sediment concentrations; Vegetation feedbacks; Anoxic sediments; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Sedimentology; Stratigraphy; Suspended sediments; Wetlands; ecosystem management; eighteenth century; land use; nineteenth century; radiocarbon dating; sea level; Massachusetts; Plum Island Estuary; United States; Prunus domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954602865

Here we present two palaeo-records from the Lore Lindu Biosphere Reserve and National Park in central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The park comprises one of the largest remaining and most biodiverse mountain forests of Sulawesi. Outstanding megalithic sites reveal long-term human impact on the area. Thus, modern vegetation composition within the park has been determined by complex site histories, natural and anthropogenic. Palaeo-records from sites between 1,000 and 1,400 m a. s. l. demonstrate that human activity as well as climate variations have to be considered as the main drivers of vegetation changes in the region for the last 2,000 years. Human impact is reflected by large amounts of charred fragments in the pollen records plus low values of arboreal pollen resulting from forest clearance. The stratigraphy of one of the pollen records shows effects of a general cooling trend during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Biomass loss due to the conversion of lower montane rainforest to grassland has reduced the carbon storage potential in the area of the Lore Lindu Park. Recommendations for conservation policy that may be made from the environmental history within the biosphere reserve thus include the consideration of human influence in easily accessible areas, particularly in face of recent settlement intensification. © 2010 The Author(s).","Archaeology; Climate change; Fire history; Indonesia; Nature conservation; Vegetation history",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955039924

Various integrated air quality modeling systems have been developed to analyze the consequences of air pollution caused by traffic flows. However, the quantitative relationship between vehicle-kilometers-traveled (VKT) and pollution concentrations while considering wind direction effects has rarely been explored in the context of land-use regression models (LUR). In this research, VKTs occurring within circular buffers around air pollution monitoring stations are simulated, using a traffic assignment model, and weighted by eight wind directions frequencies. The relationships between monitored pollution concentrations and weighted VKTs are estimated using regression analysis. In general, the wind direction weighted VKT variable increases the explanatory power of the models, particularly for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. The case of ozone is more complex, due to the effects of solar radiation, which appears to overwhelm the effects of wind direction in the afternoon hours. The statistical significance of the weighted VKT variable is high, which makes the models appropriate for impact analysis of traffic flow growth. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Pollution concentration; Regression modeling; Vehicle-kilometers-traveled; Wind direction","Air quality modeling; Air-pollution monitoring stations; Circular Buffer; Explanatory power; Impact analysis; Land-use regression models; Nitrogen dioxides; Pollution concentration; Regression modeling; Seoul , Korea; Statistical significance; Traffic assignment models; Traffic flow; Urban air pollution; Vehicle emission; Wind direction; Wind directions; Air pollution control; Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Computer simulation; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Radiation effects; Regression analysis; Sun; Traffic control; Traffic surveys; Vehicles; Pollution; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; pollution monitoring; regression analysis; solar radiation; traffic emission; urban atmosphere; wind direction; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; article; exhaust gas; model; priority journal; solar radiation; South Korea; traffic; travel; urban area; wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954623893

In order to reduce NOx emissions, most of the generators are equipped with SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) or OFA (Over-Fire Air) systems, while some generators being equipped with both systems. Here we present experimental evidence of higher boiler efficiency with efficient NOx control with consideration for influences on unburned carbon, under the condition that it should meet local and federal emissions requirements. The higher boiler efficiency has been achieved for a newly installed SCR system by optimizing OFA and reducing excess air quantity. The test was conducted over 6 months with a 500 MW coal-fired boiler. Stepwise closing of OFA dampers was carried out with and without simultaneous excess air optimization at a 500 MW nominal rating. We confirmed that our new operation leads to the following benefits: a) Reduction of UBC due to higher temperature in the furnace's main combustion zone, b) Improved fly-ash recycling ratio, c) Reduction of spray water into re-heater due to lower temperatures in the second (upper) combustion zone, and d) Reduction of exhaust gas loss. As a result, the boiler efficiency has increased by up to 0.4% and UBC (unburned carbon) has decreased by 0.8%. In conclusion, we confirmed that our new operation mode yields better boiler efficiency for newly installed SCR systems and mixed coal firing operating conditions. © 2011 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Air-staging; NOx retrofit; Over-fire-air; Selective catalytic reduction","airflow; carbon; catalysis; combustion; efficiency measurement; emission control; environmental issue; exhaust emission; experimental study; heating; nitrogen oxides; optimization; reaction kinetics; reduction; temperature profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959267872

The approach based on cyclic carbonate monomers derived from 2,2-bis(methylol)propionic acid (bis-MPA) allowed a simple and versatile route to functional monomers capable of undergoing ring opening polymerization (ROP). The resulting polymers possessed the predicted molecular weights based on the molar ratio between monomers to initiators and the narrow molecular weight distributions. Transmittance measurement for aqueous polymer solutions provided an evidence for temperature-responsiveness with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in the range of 36 °C-60 °C, depending on the molecular weight of hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains, compositions of copolymers, molar ratios of hydrophilic to hydrophobic monomers in the corona, and the hydrophobic core.

Paclitaxel release from the micelles was faster, and cellular uptake of the micelles was higher at the body temperature (i.e. 37 °C) as compared to a temperature below the LCST. While the polymer was not cytotoxic, paclitaxel-loaded micelles killed HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells more efficiently at the body temperature as compared to free paclitaxel and paclitaxel-loaded micelles at the temperature below the LCST.

In an absence of emission input data required for chemical transport modeling to predict the haze, the climatological approach in combination with statistical analysis was used. An automatic meteorological classification scheme was developed using regional meteorological station data of 8years (2001-2008) which classified the prevailing synoptic patterns over Northern Thailand into 4 patterns. Pattern 2, occurring with high frequency in March, was found to associate with the highest levels of 24h PM10 in Chiangmai, the largest city in Northern Thailand. Typical features of this pattern were the dominance of thermal lows over India, Western China and Northern Thailand with hot, dry and stagnant air in Northern Thailand. March 2007, the month with the most severe haze episode in Chiangmai, was found to have a high frequency of occurrence of pattern 2 coupled with the highest emission intensities from biomass open burning. Backward trajectories showed that, on haze episode days, air masses passed over the region of dense biomass fire hotspots before arriving at Chiangmai. A stepwise regression model was developed to predict 24h PM10 for days of meteorology pattern 2 using February-April data of 2007-2009 and tested with 2004-2010 data. The model performed satisfactorily for the model development dataset (R2=87%) and test dataset (R2=81%), which appeared to be superior over a simple persistence regression of 24h PM10 (R2=76%).

Inverse proportionality of pellet-induced edge localized mode (ELM) energy loss to pellet injection frequency is found to be similar with spontaneous ELMs in KSTAR. Pellet injection frequency is proposed to be a key parameter to control the ELM frequency and resultantly the ELM energy loss. Extending KSTAR modelling, a pellet-induced density perturbation model is applied to the ELMy H-mode discharge of ITER so that the control of type-I ELMy H-mode by pellet injection is demonstrated to check the availability of pellet ELM pacing for mitigating ELM peaks in ITER. The simulation predicts that 25 MJ of energy loss could be released by type-I ELM in ITER which exceeds the material limit of plasma-facing components (PFCs). However, the ELM pacing simulation indicates that pellet injection from high-field side and low-field side in ITER can significantly mitigate the ELM energy loss by up to a factor of 7.35 at 20 Hz of pellet injection. The performance of pellet pacing is expected to be effective but still might be insufficient to satisfy engineering restrictions of PFCs. Further improvements of mitigation performance will be required to achieve fully controlled ELMy H-mode plasmas in ITER. © 2011 IAEA, Vienna.",,"Density perturbation; Edgelocalized modes; Energy loss; H-mode discharges; High-field; Key parameters; Low-field sides; Pellet injection; Plasma-facing components; Electric discharges; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Energy dissipation; Plasma simulation; Plasma theory; Pelletizing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957592502

The stack model assumed steady-state and constant-load operation of a co-flow stack with an external reformer at atmospheric pressure. Representing a conventional cell type, separators with two flow paths, one each for the anode and cathode gas, were simulated under conditions in which the cathode gas was composed of either air and carbon dioxide (case I) or oxygen and carbon dioxide (case II). The results showed that the average cell potential in case II was higher than that in case I due to the higher partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the cathode gas. This result indicates that the amount of heat released during the electrochemical reactions was less for case II than for case I under the same load. However, simulated results showed that the maximum stack temperature in case I was lower than that in case II due to a reduction in the total flow rate of the cathode gas. To control the stack temperature and retain a high cell potential, we proposed the use of a separator with three flow paths (case III); two flow paths for the electrodes and a path in the center of the separator for the flow of nitrogen for cooling. The simulated results for case III showed that the average cell potential was similar to that in case II, indicating that the amount of heat released in the stack was similar to that in case II, and that the maximum stack temperature was the lowest of the three cases due to the nitrogen gas flow in the center of the separator. In summary, the simulated results showed that the use of a separator with three flow paths enabled temperature control in a co-flow stack with an external reformer at atmospheric pressure. © 2011 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Although northern peatlands contain one-third of the world's soil organic carbon, little is known about the long-term responses to experimental climate change of vascular plant communities in these Sphagnum-dominated ecosystems. We aimed to see how long-term experimental climate manipulations, relevant to different predicted future climate scenarios, affect total vascular plant abundance and species composition when the community is dominated by mosses. During 8 years, we investigated how the vascular plant community of a Sphagnum fuscum-dominated subarctic peat bog responded to six experimental climate regimes, including factorial combinations of summer as well as spring warming and a thicker snow cover. Vascular plant species composition in our peat bog was more stable than is typically observed in (sub)arctic experiments: neither changes in total vascular plant abundance, nor in individual species abundances, Shannon's diversity or evenness were found in response to the climate manipulations. For three key species (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Betula nana and S. fuscum) we also measured whether the treatments had a sustained effect on plant length growth responses and how these responses interacted. Contrasting with the stability at the community level, both key shrubs and the peatmoss showed sustained positive growth responses at the plant level to the climate treatments. However, a higher percentage of moss-encroached E. hermaphroditum shoots and a lack of change in B. nana net shrub height indicated encroachment by S. fuscum, resulting in long-term stability of the vascular community composition: in a warmer world, vascular species of subarctic peat bogs appear to just keep pace with growing Sphagnum in their race for space. Our findings contribute to general ecological theory by demonstrating that community resistance to environmental changes does not necessarily mean inertia in vegetation response. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bryophyte; Climate change; Diversity; Long-term manipulation; Peatland; Resistance; Snow addition; Spring warming; Summer warming; Vascular vegetation composition","abundance; bryophyte; carbon sequestration; climate change; community composition; growth response; peatland; plant community; species diversity; vascular plant; Betula nana; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Empetrum hermaphroditum; Sphagnum; Sphagnum fuscum; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955003716

Tropical forest restoration can provide substantial benefits for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and poverty alleviation. Yet the unpredictability of the synchronized flowering and consequent mass fruiting of many forest trees in Borneo presents a distinctive set of challenges for forest restoration. Significant financing and a considerable coordinated effort are required to prepare for future mass fruiting events if we are to capitalize on opportunities for ecological restoration. The continued high rate of forest clearance in this region and the rarity of mass fruiting events suggest that there may be few remaining opportunities to prevent widespread species extinctions. In this article we propose a facilitatory policy framework for forest restoration in Borneo to stimulate action in advance of the next mass fruiting of forest trees. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Dipterocarpaceae; Ecological restoration; Forest restoration; General flowering; Mass fruiting; Poverty alleviation","Dipterocarpaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959827245

Each one of the ten new member states is characterized by relatively low per capita energy consumption and relatively low energy efficiency, and the share of renewables in their energy mix tends to be low, too. The paper examines the problem when policy measures create a decrease in environmental capital instead of an increase. In this case it hardly seems justified to talk about environmental protection. The authors describe a case of a Hungarian rapeseed oil mill which would not be of too much interest on its own but given that almost all similar plants went bankrupt, there are some important lessons to learn from its survival. The enterprise the authors examined aimed at establishing a micro-regional network. They completed a brown-field development to establish a small plant on the premises of a former large agricultural cooperative. By partnering with the former employees and suppliers of the onetime cooperative, they enjoyed some benefits which all the other green-field businesses focusing on fuel production could not.

These early assessments, internationally and in New Zealand, provided a limited view of 'smart farmer' adaptation. While impact assessment provides some useful insights, experience with vulnerability and adaptation assessment provides a more appropriate foundation for understanding and characterising practical smart farmer adaptation. Findings are presented from 8 years of engagement with farmers in eastern regions of New Zealand. A comprehensive farm resilience picture has emerged from this work. This picture reflects a strong belief from real-world smart farmers that there is sufficient knowledge and experience to adapt to climate change. Proactive farmers are already reading multiple signals, including changes in climate, and are responding. The farm resilience picture provides a foundation for exploring alternative adaptation options and pathways for agriculture. These are presented and discussed in response to two proposed climate change scenarios, a high carbon world scenario and a rapidly decarbonising world scenario. Knowledge intensive, low input systems are consistent with the resilience picture drawn from farmers. Such systems are also consistent with a rapidly decarbonising world scenario and, it is argued, are likely to become increasingly attractive under a high carbon world scenario. A smart farming approach, focused on resilience, provides the basis for development of a response capacity, with potentially significant co-benefits in terms of adaptation and mitigation to climate change. Wider issues and needs to support the further development of farm resilience, and more widely landscape or regional resilience, are identified and discussed. It is apparent from this work that ongoing engagement with smart farmers, focused on resilience, can contribute significantly to development of a coordinated 'bottom up' and 'top down' response capacity. Addressing the psychology of change is a fundamental need to ensure wider engagement. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change scenarios; Further development; Impact assessments; Input systems; Knowledge and experience; New zealand; Topdown; Farms; Climate change; agricultural production; agricultural worker; bottom-up approach; climate change; ecosystem resilience; environmental impact assessment; farmers knowledge; top-down approach; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955805697

These events are often known to result in public health disasters, but we can lessen the effects of these disasters. By addressing the factors that cause changes in climate, we can mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the factors that make society vulnerable to the effects of climate, we can adapt to climate change. To adapt to climate change, a comprehensive approach to disaster risk reduction has been proposed. By reducing human vulnerability to disasters,we can lessen - and at times even prevent - their impact. Humanvulnerability is a complex phenomenon that comprises social, economic, health, and cultural factors. Because public health is uniquely placed at the community level, it has the opportunity to lessen human vulnerability to climate related disasters. At the national and international level, a supportive policy environment can enable local adaptation to disaster events. The purpose of this article is to introduce the basic concept of disaster risk reduction so that it can be applied to preventing and mitigating the negative effects of climate change and to examine the role of community-focused public health as a means for lessening human vulnerability and, as a result, the overall risk of climate-related disasters. © 2011 American Medical Association.

CO2 that leaks into the air from below-ground CCS sites will also be unusual in lacking the O2 deficit normally associated with typical land CO2 sources, such as from combustion or ecosystem exchanges. CCS may also produce distinct isotopic changes in atmospheric CO2. Using simple models and calculations, we estimate the impact of CCS or leakage on regional atmospheric composition. We also estimate the possible impact on global atmospheric composition, assuming that the technology is widely adopted. Because of its unique signature, CCS may be especially amenable to monitoring, both regionally and globally, using atmospheric observing systems.

Two approaches were followed. In the amorphous water phase approach, structures of methylamine-carbon dioxide-water [CH 3NH2/CO2/(H2O)n] clusters (n = 0-20) were studied using density functional theory (DFT). In the crystalline water approach, we simulated methylamine and carbon dioxide interactions on a fragment of the crystalline water ice surface in the presence of additional water molecules in the CH3NH2/CO2 environment using DFT and effective fragment potentials (EFP). Both the geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis results obtained from these two approaches suggested that the surrounding water molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the CH3NH2/CO2 complex draw the carbon dioxide closer to the methylamine. This enables, when two or more water molecules are present, an electron transfer from methylamine to carbon dioxide to form the methylcarbamic acid zwitterion, CH3NH 2+CO2-, in which the carbon dioxide is bent. Our calculations show that the zwitterion is formed without involving any electronic excitation on the ground state surface; this structure is only stable in the presence of water, i.e. in a methyl amine-carbon dioxide-water ice. Notably, in the vibrational frequency calculations on the methylcarbamic acid zwitterion and two water molecules we find the carbon dioxide asymmetric stretch is drastically red shifted by 435 cm-1 to 1989 cm -1 and the carbon dioxide symmetric stretch becomes strongly infrared active. We discuss how the methylcarbamic acid zwitterion CH3NH 2+CO2- might be experimentally and astronomically identified by its asymmetric CO2 stretching mode using infrared spectroscopy. © the Owner Societies.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958064392

We investigate the NIR flux variation of the torus in response to a UV flash for various geometries. Anisotropic illumination by the disk and the torus self-occultation contrast our study with earlier works. Both the waning effect of each clump and the torus self-occultation selectively reduce the emission from the region with a short delay. Therefore, the NIR delay depends on the viewing angle (where a more inclined angle leads to a longer delay), and the time response shows an asymmetric profile with negative skewness, opposing the results for optically thin tori. The range of the computed delay coincides with the observed one, suggesting that the viewing angle is primarily responsible for the scatter of the observed delay. We also propose that the red NIR-to-optical color of type 1.8/1.9 objects is caused not only by the dust extinction but also the intrinsically red color. Compared with the modest torus thickness, both a thick and a thin tori display weaker NIR emission. A selection bias is thus expected such that NIR-selected AGNs tend to possess moderately thick tori. A thicker torus shows a narrower and more heavily skewed time profile, while a thin torus produces a rapid response. A super-Eddington accretion rate leads to much weaker NIR emission due to the disk self-occultation and the disk truncation by self-gravity. A long delay is expected from an optically thin and/or a largely misaligned torus. Very weak NIR emission, such as in hot-dust-poor active nuclei, can arise from a geometrically thin torus, a super-Eddington accretion rate, or a slightly misaligned torus. © 2011.

Functional relationships between these environmental variables and S. alterniflora physiological responses were then used to improve C4-leaf photosynthesis models. Field studies were conducted in monocultures of S. alterniflora in Virginia, USA. On average, S. alterniflora exhibited lower light saturation values (~1000 μmol m-2 s-1) than observed in other C4 plants. Maximum carbon assimilation rates and stomatal conductance to water vapor diffusion were 36 μmol (CO2) m-2 s-1 and 200 mmol (H2O) m-2 s-1, respectively. Analysis of assimilation-intercellular CO2 and light response relationships were used to determine Arrhenius-type temperature functions for maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity (Vpmax), and maximum electron transport rate (Jmax). Maximum Vcmax values of 105 μmol m-2 s-1 were observed at the leaf temperature of 311 K. Optimum Vpmax values (80. 6 μmol m-2 s-1) were observed at the foliage temperature of 308 K. The observed Vpmax values were lower than those in other C4 plants, whereas Vcmax values were higher, and more representative of C3 plants. Optimum Jmax values reached 138 μmol (electrons) m-2 s-1 at the foliage temperature of 305 K. In addition, the estimated CO2 compensation points were in the range of C3 or C3-C4 intermediate plants, not those typical of C4 plants. The present results indicate the possibility of a C3-C4 intermediate or C4-like photosynthetic mechanism rather than the expected C4-biochemical pathway in S. alterniflora under field conditions. In a scenario of atmospheric warming and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, S. alterniflora will likely respond positively to both changes.

Harvesting of stumps influences the forest floor by changing vegetation and soil organic layers and exposing mineral soil across large areas. We studied whether stump harvesting after clear felling poses further short-term changes in boreal forest soil decomposer community (microbes and mesofauna) and vegetation when compared to the traditional site preparation practice (mounding). In general, stump harvesting caused decline in enchytraeid abundance but did not induce further major changes in decomposer community otherwise nor in vegetation of each soil micro-habitat (intact soil and exposed mineral soil). However, the abundances of almost all decomposer animals were lower in the exposed mineral soil than in the intact soil. Stump removal increased the area of exposed mineral soil in the clear felled areas, leading to lower amount of high quality habitat for most decomposer organisms. Hence, it is obvious that there are (or will be) differences in the decomposer community dynamics between the treatments at the forest stand level. Both species richness and coverage of plants benefitted from large-scale exposure of mineral soil. Because the stump removal procedure disturbs soil organic layers and negatively affects the decomposer community, it has the potential to alter nutrient dynamics in forests. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuel; Boreal forest soil; Decomposer community; Forest management; Stump harvesting; Vegetation","Anthropogenic carbon; Boreal forests; Community dynamics; Decomposer community; Decomposers; Energy productions; Forest floors; Forest stand; High quality; Logging residues; Mesofauna; Mineral soils; Nutrient dynamics; Organic layers; Plant communities; Renewable energy source; Site preparation; Species richness; Stump harvesting; Animals; Ecosystems; Energy harvesting; Forestry; Harvesting; Silicate minerals; Vegetation; Soils; abundance; anthropogenic source; biofuel; boreal forest; carbon emission; decomposition; ecosystem response; energy efficiency; forest floor; forest management; habitat type; harvesting; plant community; renewable resource; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; species richness; vegetation structure; Animalia; Enchytraeidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958067807

The floods cause heavy damages and perturbation in the serviceability of urban infrastructures as well as transportation. Therefore, different factors affecting the urban water flood characteristics should be considered in urban development planning, especially in metropolitan areas. In recent years, climate change and its consequences have affected the total components of the water cycle as well as floods. These effects are intensified in urban areas because of the anthropogenic effects they have on the water cycle, such as reducing the infiltration capacity of basins, construction regardless of the channel's right of way, and disposal of sediment and solid wastes into channels that will decrease the channels' safe carrying capacity. In this way, incorporating climate change impact on urban water studies could help to achieve more reliable results to be applied in real-time planning of urban areas through selection of best management practices (BMPs). In this study, an algorithm for selecting the BMPs to improve the system performance and reliability in dealing with urban flash floods is proposed that considers the anthropogenic and climate change effects. The suggested algorithm is applied to the Tehran metropolitan area drainage system as a case study. First, the future rainfall pattern of the study area under climate change impact is simulated. Then, the effectiveness of present and future development projects for improvement of drainage system performance is evaluated under different scenarios. Also, the effect of solid wastes and sediments carried with surface runoff in system performance is considered.

Methane emissions from a cattail invasive to North America Typha angustifolia (narrow leaf cattail) increased 148% under an enriched atmosphere of CO2 (700ppm). Root biomass also increased under elevated CO2 for T. angustifolia and was correlated with methane flux, suggesting that future CO2 stimulation may lead to higher methane emissions from Typha-dominated wetlands. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","CO2; Invasive plants; Microbial community; T-RFLP; Typha","Archaea; Typha; Typha angustifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957872490

Among several plausible reasons, the exposure of edge plane and creation of impurity band/surface states near the Fermi level are considered as major causes behind the catalytic activity. However, CNTs without nitrogen doping are not known to catalyze the ORR. In this work, we study the ORR activity of functionalized carbon nanotubes with different functional groups, such as sulfonic acid and phosphonic acid, in order to understand the role of surface functionalities in catalyzing the reaction. Functionalized CNTs show significantly enhanced activity towards the ORR, while CNTs without such surface functional groups do not reveal any such special ORR activity. Linear sweep voltammetry experiments with different rotation rates show diffusion controlled limiting current values for functionalized CNTs, and the 'n' values derived from Koutecky-Levich plots are 3.3 and 1.7 for S-MWCNTs and P-MWCNTs, respectively.

The exposure system designed successfully simulated chemical reactions that power plant emissions undergo in a plume during transport from the stack to receptor areas (e.g., urban areas). Test atmospheres developed for toxicological experiments included scenarios to simulate a sequence of atmospheric reactions that can occur in a plume: (1) primary emissions only; (2) H2SO4 aerosol from oxidation of SO2; (3) H2SO4 aerosol neutralized by gas-phase NH3; (4) neutralized H2SO4 with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed by the reaction of α-pinene with O3; and (5) three control scenarios excluding primary particles. The aged particle mass concentrations varied significantly from 43.8 to 257.1g/m 3 with respect to scenario and power plant. The highest was found when oxidized aerosols were neutralized by gas-phase NH3 with added SOA. The mass concentration depended primarily on the ratio of SO2 to NOx (particularly NO) emissions, which was determined mainly by coal composition and emissions controls. Particulate sulfate (H2SO4 + neutralized sulfate) and organic carbon (OC) were major components of the aged particles with added SOA, whereas trace elements were present at very low concentrations.

The reasons for the slowdown are incompletely understood, with past work identifying changes in fossil fuel, wetland and agricultural sources and hydroxyl (OH) sinks as important causal factors. Here we show that the late-twentieth-century changes in the CH 4 growth rates are best explained by reduced microbial sources in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results, based on synchronous time series of atmospheric CH 4 mixing and 13C/ 12C ratios and a two-box atmospheric model, indicate that the evolution of the mixing ratio requires no significant change in Southern Hemisphere sources between 1984 and 2005. Observed changes in the interhemispheric difference of 13C effectively exclude reduced fossil fuel emissions as the primary cause of the slowdown. The 13C observations are consistent with long-term reductions in agricultural emissions or another microbial source within the Northern Hemisphere. Approximately half (51 ± 18%) of the decrease in Northern Hemisphere CH 4 emissions can be explained by reduced emissions from rice agriculture in Asia over the past three decades associated with increases in fertilizer application and reductions in water use. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

From national surveys, we find that an increase in a state's unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the probability that residents think global warming is happening and reduced support for the U.S. to target policies intended to mitigate climate change.

The technical potential was assessed in two different case regions in Finland using two contrasting processing technologies, one oriented to recycle carbon and the other one to maximise replacement of fossil energy. The reduction in nutrient surplus through efficient recycling of biomass and consequent decline in fertiliser use was calculated. The reduction in GHG emissions was estimated based on the replacement of fossil energy and the diminished fertiliser manufacture. It was established that the full potential of use of the biomass to reduce GHG emissions can only be exploited in biorefineries that both produce energy and efficiently recycle nutrients. Such biorefineries have the potential to significantly mitigate climate change and prevent eutrophication. The potential reduction in GHG emissions corresponded to a third of agricultural emissions, and the reduction in fertiliser manufacture contributed with an additional fifth of that. The energy recovery corresponded to 5-10% of the fossil energy used in the regions, and the reduction in energy use for manufacture of fertilisers represented an additional 14-20% in comparison with that. The potential for nutrient recycling corresponded to 99-120% of P and 45-72% of N in the yields harvested in the regions. The choice of technology had a more pronounced impact on energy recovery, GHG emissions and C budget than on nutrient recycling. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Agrifood waste and by-product; Bioenergy; Carbon; GHG emissions; Nutrient surplus; Recycling","Agrifood; Agrifood waste and by-product; Bio-energy; Biorefineries; Efficient recycling; Energy recovery; Energy use; Fertilisers; Finland; Fossil energy; GHG emission; Nutrient recycling; Potential reduction; Processing technologies; Technical potential; Biomass; Energy conversion; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Manufacture; Nutrients; Recovery; Recycling; Climate change; agricultural emission; bioenergy; biomass; carbon budget; climate change; crop yield; domestic waste; eutrophication; fertilizer application; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; mitigation; recycling; waste management; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953291236

The conclusion is that market failures and the need to prepare for longer-term climate objectives make it essential to regulate the specific fuel consumption of new cars. The current European regulation, being full of derogations and other loopholes, makes support from national incentive schemes important. However, for efficiency, and in order to prevent excessive taxation, common guidelines are needed. They should prescribe that all incentives must comply with certain basic principles, the three most important being technical neutrality and equal treatment of all cars; continuous incentive (rather than a number of CO2 thresholds); and that the size of fees and bonuses should not depart substantially from the marginal abatement cost in other sectors. However, selective incentives to emerging technologies by definition cannot be technologically neutral. Such incentives, thus, should only be allowed if the member state can show that there are good reasons to expect that the learning curve and economies of scale will make production cost decline considerably. This requirement will prevent them from subsidizing mature technologies and minimize the risk for lock-in effects and the distortion of competition. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The reduction of the climatic impact of these emissions is related to the vegetation susceptibility to fire (fire risk), as well as to the understanding of possible implications of changes in atmospheric circulation on fire risk in the near-future. This study evaluates the environmental susceptibility to fire occurrence based on a Potential Fire Index (PFI). Two climate simulations from the ECHAM5/MPI-OM climate model have been used to calculate the PFI: present day (1980-2000) and an experiment for the end of the twenty-first century (2080-2100). The results indicate that the proposed PFI methodology could properly reproduce the areas with the highest fire incidence under present conditions. Moreover, it was found that under greenhouse warming conditions the PFI foresees an increase in the fire risk area, particularly for the Amazon region. We concluded, furthermore, that changes of vegetation predicted to occur in the future lead to substantial modifications in the magnitude of the PFI, and may potentially extend the length of the fire season due to induced longer drought periods as compared to current conditions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Amazon region; Atmospheric circulation; Climate simulation; Climatic impact; Coupled climate model; Drought periods; Fire risks; Greenhouse warming; Vegetation fire; Air pollution; Climate models; Climatology; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Vegetation; Fires; atmospheric circulation; carbon emission; climate effect; climate modeling; drought; forest fire; greenhouse gas; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954997856

In 2002, the MTA violated a strong professional norm of debt management by refinancing $13 billion of long-term debt in a way that increased rather than decreased the cost of repayment. This behavior, heavily influenced by the informal advice of investment bankers, seemed to many observers to confirm the oft-decried tendency of debt-issuing public authorities to sacrifice their accountability to citizens in order to please the bankers and other debt-market participants on whom they depend for financial resources. Yet the MTA's choice appears on closer examination to have fulfilled the common desires of contemporary fare payers, tax payers, voters, and elected officials to maximize current spending while deferring costs to future tax and fare payers. The MTA case highlights potential conflicts between the professional imperative of democratic accountability and the competing professional norms of cost minimization, sustainability, and intergenerational equity. The fundamental structure of this dilemma is also apparent in other policy arenas with intergenerational implications, such as social security and climate policy, and raises the question of when obedience to market, political, and hierarchical expectations can justify sacrificing professional principles. © The Author(s) 2011.","accountability; capital budgeting; debt networks; financial management; public authorities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650158348

A new gas collection system that includes a near-surface high permeability layer beneath the landfill cover was evaluated for enhancing capture of LFG and mitigating CH4 emissions. Simulations of gas transport in two-dimensional domains demonstrated that the permeable layer reduces CH4 emissions up to a factor of 2 for particular spatially variable gas permeability fields. When individual macrocracks formed in the cover soil and the permeable layer was absent, CH4 emissions increased to as much as 24% of the total CH4 generated, double the emissions when the permeable layer was installed. CH4 oxidation in the cover soil was also much more uniform when the permeable layer was present: local percentages of CH4 oxidized varied between 94% and 100% across the soil cover with the permeable layer, but ranged from 10% to 100% without this layer for some test cases. However, the permeable layer had a minor effect on CH4 emissions and CH4 oxidation in the cover soil when the ratio of the gas permeability of the cover soil to the mean refuse gas permeability ≤0.05.

The carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) contained in the exhaust emissions from 76 gasoline-powered passenger cars equipped with three-way catalysts has been assessed by vehicle speed, vehicle mileage and model year. The results show that CO, HC, NOx and CO CO2 emissions remained almost unchanged at higher speeds but decreased rapidly at lower speeds. While a reduction in CO, HC and NOx emissions was noticeable in vehicles of recent manufacture and lower mileage, CO CO2 emissions were found to be insensitive to vehicle mileage, but strongly dependent on gross vehicle weight. Lower emissions from more recent gasoline-powered vehicles arose mainly from improvements in three-way catalytic converter technology following strengthened emission regulations.

V6T 1Z4, Canada","As adaptation is increasingly recognised as an important component in responding to climate change, adaptation measures are slowly emerging at different scales of governance across Europe and elsewhere in the industrialised North. The relative novelty of adaptation measures in this context opens up an opportunity to examine the ways in which more well-established systems of governance are able to address concerns of a changing climate and its expected effects. This paper examines the modes of climate change adaptation governance systems, by presenting two empirical multi-scale case studies in Finland and Italy. The two countries represent different stages of planned adaptation measures: while Finland began work on adaptation relatively early and elected for a mainstreaming approach, Italy has yet to form concrete national adaptation actions. In both cases, however, adaptation actions have autonomously emerged at lower scales of governance, raising questions as to the role and importance of vertical integration. This study concludes that the governance of adaptation is mainly taking place through both formal institutions and networks across actors at various scales. Though such networks present actors at sub-national scales the resources and opportunity to engage in planned adaptation, the ability of a wider set of actors to plan adaptation remains somewhat limited by a lack of coordination at the national scale. As a result, there exists an opportunity for increased interaction and participation of actors across scales. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change adaptation; Finland; Governance; Institutions; Italy; Networks","adaptation; article; climate change; consensus; cooperation; environmental planning; Finland; government regulation; human; information dissemination; Italy; priority journal; social network; trust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952701082

They will probably play a role in future climate policies too, as global payments may reward local reductions of loss of natural land cover. We estimate the impact of PAs on natural land cover within each of 147 countries by comparing outcomes inside Pas with outcomes outside. We use 'matching' (or 'apples to apples') for land characteristics to control for the fact that PAs very often are non-randomly distributed across their national landscapes. Protection tends towards land that, if unprotected, is less likely than average to be cleared. For 75 per cent of countries, we find protection does reduce conversion of natural land cover. However, for approximately 80 per cent of countries, our global results also confirm (following smaller-scale studies) that controlling for land characteristics reduces estimated impact by half or more. This shows the importance of controlling for at least a few key land characteristics. Further, we show that impacts vary considerably within a country (i.e. across a landscape): protection achieves less on lands far from roads, far from cities and on steeper slopes. Thus, while planners are, of course, constrained by other conservation priorities and costs, they could target higher impacts to earn more global payments for reduced deforestation. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Conservation impacts; Deforestation; Land cover; Matching; Protected areas; REDD","deforestation; environmental policy; habitat conservation; human activity; land cover; national park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955456901

The model includes emissions embodied in transportation, energy, water, waste, food, goods, and services. We further quantify greenhouse gas and financial savings from 13 potential mitigation actions across all household types. The model suggests that the size and composition of carbon footprints vary dramatically between geographic regions and within regions based on basic demographic characteristics. Despite these differences, large cash-positive carbon footprint reductions are evident across all household types and locations; however, realizing this potential may require tailoring policies and programs to different population segments with very different carbon footprint profiles.

This paradigm shift to in-use testing has forced the development of portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) for particulate matter (PM). These PM measurements are not trivial for laboratory work, and are even more complex for in-use testing. This study evaluates five PM PEMS in comparison to UCR's mobile reference laboratory under in-use conditions. Three on-highway, heavy-duty trucks were selected to provide PM emissions levels from 0.1 to 0.0003 g/hp-h, with varying compositions of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), and sulfate. The on-road driving courses included segments near sea level, at elevations up to 1500 m, and coastal and desert regions. The photoacoustic measurement PEMS performed best for the non-aftertreatment system (ATS)-equipped engine, where the PM was mostly EC, with a linear regression slope of 0.91 and an R 2 of 0.95. The PEMS did not perform as well for the 2007 modified ATS equipped engines. The best performing PEMS showed a slope of 0.16 for the ATS-equipped engine with predominantly sulfate emissions and 0.89 for the ATS-equipped engine with predominantly OC emissions, with the next best slope at 0.45 for the predominantly OC engine. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Elemental carbon; Emissions measurements; Emissions regulations; Heavy duty; Heavy duty diesel vehicles; Heavy duty trucks; Laboratory work; On-road driving; Paradigm shifts; Particulate Matter; Photoacoustic measurements; PM emissions; Automobiles; Engines; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Sea level; Air pollution control equipment; carbon; diesel fuel; elemental carbon; organic carbon; sulfate; unclassified drug; atmospheric pollution; carbon; desert; diesel engine; exhaust emission; laboratory method; linearity; measurement method; paradigm shift; particulate matter; regression analysis; sea level; slope; sulfate; article; coastal plain; desert; diesel engine; driving ability; gas analysis; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; portable emissions measurement system; Carbon; Chromatography, Ion Exchange; Environmental Monitoring; Gasoline; Geography; Linear Models; Motor Vehicles; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Sulfates; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960504035

Specifically, the Secretariat marketed (filtered, framed, and reiterated) strategic frames of the biodiversity-climate change interface that reframed biodiversity from a passive victim of climate impacts, to an active player in climate response measures (i.e. adaptation). This reframing is significant in that a major hurdle to selling the benefits of biodiversity conservation to countries with more pressing development concerns has been the perceived limited relevance of conservation to human well-being. In emphasizing biodiversity's role in human adaptation and security, the Secretariat has begun to shape member state discourse surrounding the biodiversity-climate change linkage. Ultimately aimed at enriching our emerging theoretical understanding of the role of international bureaucracies in global governance, this article illuminates: (1) how the Secretariat understands and manages biodiversity-climate linkages; (2) the origins of the Secretariat's understanding and activities surrounding this issue; and (3) how Secretariat participation in overlap management is beginning to influence CBD political processes and outcomes. © 2011 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"adaptation; biodiversity; bureaucracy; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; entrepreneur; environmental issue; environmental policy; environmental politics; governance approach; marketing; strategic approach; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960479700

We used ester-linked phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers as a proxy for microbial biomass to quantify spatial and temporal differences in soil microbial communities from February 2003 to May 2005. Further, we used the 13C signature of the fossil CO2 source for elevated CO2 plots to trace recent plant C inputs into soil organic matter (SOM) and broad microbial groups using δ13C (‰). Differences between individual δ13CPLFA and δ13C SOM for fungal biomarkers indicated active metabolism of newer C in elevated CO2 soils. Total PLFA-C was greater in shrub microsites compared to plant interspaces, and CO2 treatment differences within microsites increased under higher soil water availability. Total, fungal, and bacterial PLFA-C increased with decreasing soil volumetric water content (VWC) in both microsites, suggesting general adaptations to xeric desert conditions. Increases in fungal-to-bacterial PLFA-C ratio with decreasing VWC reflected functional group-specific responses to changing soil water availability. While temporal and spatial extremes in resource availability in desert ecosystems contribute to the difficulty in identifying common trends or mechanisms driving microbial responses in less extreme environments, we found that soil water availability and soil microsite interacted with elevated CO2 to shift fungal and bacterial biomarker abundances in Mojave Desert soils.

During the Little Ice Age, the cold climate was unfavourable for the growth of lake algae, and therefore the lake primary productivity declined.

As suckers from existing old plantations represent a high risk of Cosmopolites sordidus and viral disease transmission, the demand for disease-free, tissue-cultured banana plantlets is increasing. However, the price of such plantlets from commercial laboratories is too high (about 3-4 times more expensive than suckers) due to -among others-the reliance on imported potting mixes for the weaning of plantlets. With the objective of finding low-cost potting mixes for weaning, a trial was set up using soil and manure mix, locally available by-products from the sugar industry (scum, flyash and bagassse), cocopeat (after use from soil-less cultures) and imported jiffy pellets. After deflasking, banana plantlets (2.5 cm tall) of 'Petite Naine' (AAA, Cavendish) were placed in eleven different potting mixes: (1) Scum, (2) Flyash, (3) Flyash + Scum (2:3), (4) Bagasse + Flyash (1:1), (5) Flyash + Scum (1:1), (6) Flyash + Scum (3:2), (7) Flyash + Scum (7:3), (8) cocopeat, (9) jiffy pellets, (10) non-sterile soil + cow manure (1:1), and (11) autoclaved soil + cow manure (1:1). The plantlets were covered with transparent plastic cover to maintain humidity for 10 days. The number of dead plantlets, plantlet height and leaf emission were recorded. Mortality was negligible indicating that the non-sterile mixes did not cause any disease incidence. Plantlet development was fastest in sterile soil + manure mix and slowest in cocopeat and flyash/bagasse mixture. A low-cost option for weaning, which could reduce hardening costs by over 90%, was thus developed.","Disease-free planting material; Fusarium wilt; Weaning","Cosmopolites sordidus; Fusarium",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053370201

They are known to be harmful to other plankton and fish and have often caused large-scale fish mortality in many countries. Thus, the population dynamics of raphidophytes is a critical concern for scientists, the aquaculture industry, and government officers from many countries. Raphidophyte growth and mortality should be investigated to understand bloom dynamics. Raphidophytes were thought to be exclusively autotrophic organisms. However, several recent studies have revealed that raphidophytes are able to feed on heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria, i.e. raphidophytes are mixotrophic algae. Further, high-resolution video microscopy has revealed the mechanism by which raphidophytes feed on bacteria, which involves capturing prey cells in the mucus excreted by mucocysts and engulfing the cells through mucocysts. These discoveries may influence the conventional view on both raphidophyte bloom dynamics and plankton energy flow and carbon cycling. In the present study, I review prey, feeding mechanisms, and ingestion rates of mixotrophic marine raphidophytes. In addition, I examine the ecological significance of raphidophyte mixotrophy. © 2011 The Author(s) Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology © 2011 International Society of Protistologists.","Chattonella; Feeding; Fibrocapsa; Food web; Graze; Harmful algal bloom; Heterosigma; Red tide; Trophic interactions","sea water; aquaculture; autotrophy; bacterium; cell organelle; energy efficiency; feeding behavior; fish; food web; growth rate; heterotrophy; marine environment; microscopy; mixotrophy; mortality; plankton; population distribution; red tide; resolution; state role; trophic interaction; algal bloom; bacterium; conference paper; growth, development and aging; heterotrophy; metabolism; microbiology; parasitology; phototrophy; physiology; stramenopile; symbiosis; Bacteria; Harmful Algal Bloom; Heterotrophic Processes; Phototrophic Processes; Seawater; Stramenopiles; Symbiosis; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chattonella; Fibrocapsa; Heterosigma; Raphidophyceae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959857891

A graphite felt cathode modified with neutral red (NR-graphite cathode) was used as a solid electron mediator to induce bacterial cells to fix CO2 using electrochemical reducing power. Bacterial CO2 consumption was calculated based on the variation in the ratio of CO2 to N2 in the gas reservoir. CO2 consumed by the bacteria grown in the electrochemical bioreactor (2,000 ml) reached a maximum of approximately 1,500 ml per week. Time-coursed variations in the bacterial community grown with the electrochemical reducing power and CO2 in the mineral-based medium were analyzed via temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of the 16S rDNA variable region.

In particular, primary production is amounting to the common currency in field experiments world-wide. Rarely, however, are multiple ecosystem functions measured in a single study in order to address general patterns across different categories of responses and to analyse effects of climate extremes on various ecosystem functions. We set up a long-term field experiment, where we applied recurrent severe drought events annually for five consecutive years to constructed grassland communities in central Europe. The 32 response parameters studied were closely related to ecosystem functions such as primary production, nutrient cycling, carbon fixation, water regulation and community stability. Surprisingly, in the face of severe drought, above- and below-ground primary production of plants remained stable across all years of the drought manipulation. Yet, severe drought significantly reduced below-ground performance of microbes in soil indicated by reduced soil respiration, microbial biomass and cellulose decomposition rates as well as mycorrhization rates. Furthermore, drought reduced leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange and leaf protein content, while increasing maximum uptake capacity, leaf carbon isotope signature and leaf carbohydrate content. With regard to community stability, drought induced complementary plant-plant interactions and shifts in flower phenology, and decreased invasibility of plant communities and primary consumer abundance. Synthesis. Our results provide the first field-based experimental evidence that climate extremes initiate plant physiological processes, which may serve to regulate ecosystem productivity. A potential reason for different dynamics in various ecosystem services facing extreme climatic events may lie in the temporal hierarchy of patterns of fast versus slow response. Such data on multiple response parameters within climate change experiments foster the understanding of mechanisms of resilience, of synergisms or decoupling of biogeochemical processes, and of fundamental response dynamics to drought at the ecosystem level including potential tipping points and thresholds of regime shift. Future work is needed to elucidate the role of biodiversity and of biotic interactions in modulating ecosystem response to climate extremes. © 2011 The Authors.

Location Global. Methods We applied generalized linear modelling to a global database of local ant assemblages to predict the species density of ants globally. Predictors evaluated included simple climate variables, combined temperature×precipitation variables, biogeographic region, elevation, and interactions between select variables. Areas of the planet identified as beyond the reliable prediction ability of the model were those having climatic conditions more extreme than what was represented in the ant database. Results Temperature was the most important single predictor of ant species density, and a mix of climatic variables, biogeographic region and interactions between climate and region yielded the best overall model. Broadly, geographic patterns of ant diversity match those of other taxa, with high species density in the wet tropics and in some, but not all, parts of the dry tropics. Uncertainty in model predictions appears to derive from the low amount of standardized sampling of ants in Asia, in Africa and in the most extreme (e.g. hottest) climates. Model residuals increase as a function of temperature. This suggests that our understanding of the drivers of ant diversity at high temperatures is incomplete, especially in hot and arid climates. In other words, our ignorance of how ant diversity relates to environment is greatest in those regions where most species occur - hot climates, both wet and dry. Mainconclusions Our results have two important implications. First, temperature is necessary, but not sufficient, to explain fully the patterns of ant diversity. Second, our ability to predict ant diversity is weakest exactly where we need to know the most, the warmest regions of a warming world. This includes significant parts of the tropics and some of the most biologically diverse areas in the world. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aridity; Biodiversity; Biogeography; Formicidae; Species richness; Temperature","ant; aridity; biogeography; climate change; climate variation; database; ecological modeling; global climate; species diversity; species richness; temperature effect; warming; Africa; Asia; Formicidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958088243

In addition to constructing plausible scenarios for urban expansion, emission, car fleet, and fuel consumption for year 2026 and comparing them with a 2004 base case, a time series is built to obtain accumulated economic benefits. Experimental techniques were used to build a vehicle library for a car simulator that included a Prius 2002, chosen as the HEV technology representative for this work. The simulator is used to estimate the emissions and fuel consumption of the car fleet scenarios. In the context of an urban scenario for year 2026, a complex air quality model obtains the concentrations of criterion pollutants corresponding to these scenarios. Using a technology penetration model, the hybridized fleet starts unfolding in year 2009 reaching to 20% in 2026. In this year, the hybridized fleet resulted in reductions of about 10% of CO2 emissions, and yielded reductions in daytime mean concentrations of up to 7% in ozone and 3.4% in PM2.5 compared to the 2004 base case. These reductions are concentrated in the densely populated areas of Mexico City. By building a time series of costs and benefits it is shown that, depending on fuel prices and using a 5% return rate, positive accumulated benefits (CO 2 benefits + energy benefits + public health benefits - private costs) will start generating in year 2015 reaching between 2.8 and 4.5 billion US Dlls in 2026. Another modernized private fleet consisting exclusively of Tier I and II cars did not yield appreciable results, signaling that a change in private car technology towards HEV's is needed to obtain significant accumulated benefits. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An analysis based on functional traits of feeding, reproduction, and position in the sediment shows that HP is depauperate in deposit feeders, subsurface carnivores, and species with no protective barrier. Sediment chemistry analysis shows that PCBs are the major risk drivers at HP (1,570 ppb) and that the reference sites contain very low levels of PCB contamination (9 ppb). Different feeding traits support the existence of direct pathways of exposure, which can be mechanistically linked to PCB bioaccumulation by biodynamic modeling. The model shows that the deposit feeder Neanthes arenaceodentata accumulates approximately 20 times more PCBs in its lipids than the facultative deposit feeder Macoma balthica and up to 130 times more than the filter feeder Mytilus edulis. The comparison of different exposure scenarios suggests that PCB tissue concentrations at HP are two orders of magnitude higher than at the reference sites. At full scale, in situ sorbent amendment with activated carbon may reduce PCB bioaccumulation at HP by up to 85 to 90% under favorable field and treatment conditions. The modeling framework further demonstrates that such expected remedial success corresponds to exposure conditions suggested as the cleanup goal for HP. However, concentrations remain slightly higher than at the reference sites. The present study demonstrates how the remedial success of a sorbent amendment, which lowers the PCB availability, can be compared to reference conditions and traditional cleanup goals, which are commonly based on bulk sediment concentrations. © 2011 SETAC.","Benthic community; Bioavailability; Biodynamic modeling; Functional ecology; Sediment remediation","Benthic communities; Bioavailability; Biodynamic modeling; Functional ecology; Sediment remediation; Activated carbon; Anoxic sediments; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Chemical analysis; Contamination; Deposits; Ecology; Feeding; Organic pollutants; Sedimentology; Sorption; Tissue; Polychlorinated biphenyls; activated carbon; polychlorinated biphenyl; sorbent; activated carbon; benthos; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; bioremediation; bivalve; carnivore; community structure; concentration (composition); feeding behavior; filter; in situ test; lipid; magnitude; numerical model; PCB; pollution effect; reproduction; risk factor; sediment chemistry; Amphipoda; animal tissue; article; benthos; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameters); ecosystem; feeding behavior; macoma balthica; mussel; Mytilus; Neanthes arenaceodentata; nonhuman; priority journal; sediment; soil chemistry; soil pollution; United States; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Behavior, Animal; Bivalvia; Charcoal; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Remediation; Food Chain; Geologic Sediments; Invertebrates; Models, Biological; Polychaeta; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; San Francisco; Water Pollutants, Chemical; California; San Francisco Bay; United States; Macoma balthica; Mytilus edulis; Neanthes arenaceodentata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960097665

It helps to explore emerging forms of participatory action and climate change pedagogy in the mountain resort of Canmore (Canada), facilitated by the Biosphere Institute, a local nongovernmental organization, that indicate a strong potential. The Mountain Air program involves schoolchildren and businesses in tackling clean air and idling impacts from local transport (including taxis used by visitors). The results of a door-to-door community social marketing campaign, Sustainable Action Canmore, are also discussed. Detailed and ongoing requirements of participatory action are described, and the results of the two programs are analyzed.

In order to provide optimized climate scenarios for climate change impact research, this study merges linear and nonlinear empirical-statistical downscaling techniques with bias correction methods and investigates their ability for reducing RCM error characteristics. An ensemble of seven empirical-statistical downscaling and error correction methods (DECMs) is applied to post-process daily precipitation sums of a high-resolution regional climate hindcast simulation over the Alpine region, their error characteristics are analysed and compared to the raw RCM results. Drastic reductions in error characteristics due to application of DECMs are demonstrated. Direct point-wise methods like quantile mapping and local intensity scaling as well as indirect spatial methods as nonlinear analogue methods yield systematic improvements in median, variance, frequency, intensity and extremes of daily precipitation. Multiple linear regression methods, even if optimized by predictor selection, transformation and randomization, exhibit significant shortcomings for modelling daily precipitation due to their linear framework. Comparing the well-performing methods to each other, quantile mapping shows the best performance, particularly at high quantiles, which is advantageous for applications related to extreme precipitation events. The improvements are obtained regardless of season and region, which indicates the potential transferability of these methods to other regions. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Alpine region; Bias correction; Empirical statistical downscaling; Error correction; Precipitation modelling; Regional climate modelling","Alpine regions; Analogue method; Bias correction; Climate change impact; Climate condition; Climate scenarios; Correction method; Down-scaling; Error characteristics; Extreme precipitation; High quantile; High resolution; Hindcasts; Multiple linear regression method; Post process; Regional climate; Regional climate modelling; Regional climate models; Statistical downscaling; Climate change; Error correction; Linear regression; Linear transformations; Optimization; Precipitation (meteorology); Systematic errors; Climate models; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; downscaling; empirical analysis; error correction; precipitation assessment; regional climate; regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960724856

Three quantitative methods were chosen for this reconstruction, i.e. Leaf Margin Analysis (LMA), Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP), and the Coexistence Approach (CA). These methods, however, yield inconsistent results, particularly for the precipitation, as also shown in European and other East Asian Cenozoic floras. The wide range of the reconstructed climatic parameters includes the Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) of 18.5-24.7°C and the Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) of 1213-3711. mm. Compared with the modern Lincang climate (MAT, 17.3°C; MAP, 1178.7. mm), the Miocene climate is slightly warmer, wetter and has a higher temperature seasonality. A detailed comparison on the palaeoclimatic variables with the coeval Late Miocene Xiaolongtan flora from the eastern part of Yunnan allows us to investigate the development and interactions of both South Asian and East Asian monsoons during the Late Miocene in southwest China, now under strong influence of these monsoon systems. Our results suggest that the monsoon climate has already been established in southwest Yunnan during the Late Miocene. Furthermore, our results support that both Southeast Asian and East Asian monsoons co-occurred in Yunnan during the Late Miocene. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Lincang; Miocene; Monsoon; Palaeoclimate; Southwestern China; Yunnan","floristics; leaf; Miocene; paleobotany; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); reconstruction; seasonality; vegetation history; China; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955479870

Middle-aged (18 months) C57/BL6 mice were randomly assigned to receive either a control diet or a diet supplemented with 0.05% trans-resveratrol for 10 months. Young (6 months) and middle-aged (18 months) mice were used as controls. Resveratrol supplementation did not reduce the aging-associated loss of muscle mass or improve maximal isometric force production, but it appeared to preserve fast-twitch fiber contractile function. Resveratrol supplementation did not improve mitochondrial content, the subcellular localization of cytochrome c protein content, or PGC1 protein content. Resveratrol increased manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), reduced hydrogen peroxide, and lipid peroxidation levels in muscle samples, but it was unable to significantly reduce protein carbonyl levels. The data suggest that resveratrol has a protective effect against aging-induced oxidative stress in skeletal muscle, likely through the upregulation of MnSOD activity, but sarcopenia was not attenuated by resveratrol. © The Author 2011.

The Miocene appeared as the last warm episode in earth history, prior to the establishment of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Furthermore, the Miocene was characterized by both, large-scale marine transgressions and pronounced episodes of regressions, e.g. opening and closure of marine corridors as well as appearance and disappearance of lakes and swamps. The sea-level changes and instability of the climate system strongly influenced not only marine ecosystems but also the terrestrial biota.To throw new light on the Miocene evolution of European ecosystems and climate dynamics, we compared plant assemblages from southeastern Europe. Palaeogeographically this area is a transitional belt between Tethyan and Paratethyan realms, and it thus constitutes a crucial geographical position when one tries to comprehend the exchange pathways of various floristic elements, appearance and evolution of steppe vegetation, interaction between forest and steppe vegetation, and of course the corresponding climates influencing the vegetation dynamics.Both macro- and microfloristic plant associations were considered in our analysis. Large palaeofloristic and palaeocoenotic transformations occurred during the Miocene. The Early to Middle Miocene flora is rich and diverse in thermophilous elements, which formed polydominant mesophytic to hygromesophytic forests. Early Miocene climate was warm and humid with mean annual temperatures mainly above 16°C and annual rainfalls over 1000. mm.The Middle Miocene was the warmest period of the whole Miocene, with annual temperatures ranging from 17°C to 19°C and winter temperatures from 7°C to 12.5°C. Climatic changes after the Miocene climatic optimum caused changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure. The vegetation shows a decreasing trend in abundance of palaeotropic and thermophilous elements, reduction of macrothermic elements, and disappearance of evergreen laurel forests. Together with these changes is a corresponding increase in the role of arctotertiary species in plant communities, and they became dominants in mesophytic forests.The available data indicate that major vegetation changes occur in the late Miocene. This period is characterized by more diverse climatic conditions, which were directed by global climatic changes and probably complicated by regional palaeogeographic reorganizations and tectonic processes. Slight cooling and some drying is recorded for the beginning of the Late Miocene, followed by fluctuations of palaeoclimate parameters observed which display cycling change of humid/dryer and warmer/cooler conditions.

The forecast of air pollution can be used as warning to the public and for decision makers to establish strategies and measures in cases of high air-pollution levels. It has long been recognised that pollutant gases cause significant impacts on crops and studies conducted revealed that surface ozone is responsible for most of the crop-yield losses from air pollutants. Hence, this study aims to fit and exemplify time-series analysis in forecasting ozone concentrations in Sungai Petani, a town situated in the Muda Irrigation Scheme Area (MADA), Kedah.

Parametric seasonally-adjusted ARIMA (l,0,l)x(2,l,2)12 with constant model was successfully applied to predict the long-term trend of ozone concentration. The detection of a steady statistically-significant upward trend for ozone concentration in Sungai Petani is quite alarming because MADA produces 40% of the total rice production in Malaysia.

The present microcosm-study investigates the effect of different forms of inorganic N fertilizers on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from two different agricultural soils. The relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and soil microbial communities, N transformation rates and plant (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Morex) growth were investigated. Repeated N fertilization led to increased N2O emissions. In a parallel survey of functional microbial population dynamics we observed a stimulation of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidisers accompanied with these N2O emissions. The ratio of archaeal to bacterial ammonium monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene copies (data obtained from Inselsbacher et al., 2010) correlated positively with N2O fluxes, which suggests a direct or indirect involvement of archaea in N2O fluxes. Repeated N fertilization also stimulated methane oxidation, which may also be related to a stimulation of ammonia oxidizers. The fertilizer effects differed between soil types: In the more organic Niederschleinz soil N-turnover rates increased more strongly after fertilization, while in the sandy Purkersdorf soil plant growth and soil respiration were accelerated depending on fertilizer N type. Compared to addition of NH4+ and NO3-, addition of NH4NO3 fertilizer resulted in the largest increase in global warming potential as a summary indicator of all GHG related effects. This effect resulted from the strongest increase of both N2O and CO2 emission while plant growth was not equally stimulated, compared to e.g. KNO3 fertilization. In order to decrease N losses from agricultural ecosystems and in order to minimize soil derived global warming potential, this study points to the need for interdisciplinary investigations of the highly complex interactions within plant-soil-microbe-atmosphere systems. By understanding the microbial processes underlying fertilizer effects on GHG emissions the N use efficiency of crops could be refined. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agricultural soil; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Microbial community structure; N fertilizer; Nitrous oxide","agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; fertilizer application; gas flow; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; microbial community; microcosm; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; prokaryote; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; transformation; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956161232

The disparity in income and the living conditions of these producers is alarming, but society, governments, and research and development (R&D) commit little to modify their livelihoods. Prospects for change are good, considering the expanding demand for small ruminant products, but smallholders are not yet benefitting from this opportunity. This paper reviews the status of small ruminant populations in dry areas of Central Asia, the Caucasus, West Asia, North Africa, and some countries of Latin America. Overall the small ruminant population is increasing in these regions. The market opportunities for products of these species are also reviewed. Meat is in high demand all over the countries and demand is often not met by local supply. Milk is produced only in some regions. The prices of wool are depressed whereas fine fibers can reach attractive prices. Smallholder systems could supply the expanding demand but are still unprepared because conditions do not favor technology adoption. The main trends affecting the production systems in dry areas are discussed: enhanced market demand with opportunities and constraints, feed scarcity and climate change. A research strategy is then described, based on the experience gathered by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas and its collaborators, focusing on the improvement of productivity and smallholders' incomes. Examples of successful experience of adaptive research tested by farmers at a small scale are noted. To achieve sustained improvement of productivity and of farmers' income, certain basic conditions must be met: the joint action of R&D, within the domain of development projects, through outscaling of technologies; appropriate policies; participatory action, and the mid- to long-term commitment to sustain these conditions by government and donor/funding agencies. South-south and south-north exchanges can facilitate this process. The problems faced by farmers are not insurmountable. With the commitment of all actors involved in the development of a given dry region/country, R&D could induce a change and improve the living conditions of small ruminant farmers and halt rural migration. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Dry areas; Research; Small ruminant production","Bovidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957932571

Global projections of climate change indicate negative impacts on water systems with increasing flooding and drought events. This investigation presents the modeling of climate change effects on the hydrology and water resources availability in the Rio Conchos basin, the main tributary of the lower portion of the bi-national Rio Grande/Bravo basin, and its impact on the water treaty signed between the United States of America and Mexico in 1944. One of the problems most relevant to the study basin is the frequent occurrence of long drought periods. Coupled with increased water demands and low irrigation efficiencies, the competition for water resources is high on both sides of the border. Three main parts are addressed in this research. First, a hydrologic model has been developed using the one-dimensional, 2 layer soil moisture accounting scheme embedded in a water evaluation and planning model. Second, downscaled precipitation and temperature data, from five general circulation models for two emission scenarios, viii A1B and A2, were used as inputs to the Rio Conchos hydrologic model to determine the effect on basin hydrology. A multi-model ensemble is developed and several techniques, such as probability density functions, wavelet analysis, and trend analysis, are used to assess the impacts. Third, a water resources planning model for the basin has been developed, which integrates the hydrologic model and water management modeling, to evaluate the impacts on the entire water system and simulate adaptive strategies to mitigate climate change in the study basin. Skill-weighted multi-model ensemble results show that annual average runoff may be reduced by 12% ± 53% and 20% ± 45% in 2080-2099 relative to 1980-1999 for the A1B and A2 scenarios, respectively.

The copper smelter which is situated in the centre of the town is the main pollutant, mostly because of its old technology, which leads to environmental pollution caused by higher concentrations of SO2 and PM10. These facts show that the word is about a very polluted region in Europe which, apart from harming human health in the region itself, poses a particular danger for wider area of southeastern Europe. Optimization of heavy metal's total emission was undertaken because years of long contamination of the soil with heavy metals of anthropogenic origin created a danger that those heavy metals may enter the food chains of animals and people, which can lead to disastrous consequences. This work represents the usage of Geographic Information System (GIS) for establishing a multifactor assessment model to quantitatively divide polluted zones and for selecting control sites in a linear programming model, combined with PROMETHEE/GAIA method, Screen View modeling system, and linear programming model.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a historical analysis, the structural features of all WIRs, and an analysis of content and limitations of WIR 2010. Findings: The paper starts with considering the historical background leading to successive units dealing with transnational corporations (TNCs) within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The commonalities in structure, content and methodology among all WIRs are discussed. The essay then analyses the World Investment Report 2010. The conclusions make suggestions for revisiting some of the themes of earlier WIRs. Research limitations/implications: As a review essay, the paper does not present new empirical results. Practical implications: The paper makes suggestions for possible content in future WIRs and for revisiting some of the earlier themes in the context of the new economic, political and technological environment. It also argues that tackling problems related to damages to a global public good - the environment - requires the cooperation of both developed and developing regions as well as the development and implementation of global strategies. Social implications: The WIR has always had a developmental and policy focus. This is also the case of the WIR 2010. However, given the topic - FDI in low-carbon products and processes - there are limitations in considering possible policies for developing countries, first because dealing with the environment requires more focus on the developed countries, and second because there is still no international agreement on global strategies towards climate change. Originality/value: The paper presents a historical analysis of the World Investment Report. It presents an analysis of the common structural, content and methodological features of all WIRs, and of WIR 2010 in relation to development and policies in the world economy. The paper stresses the relevance of dealing with a global public good - the environment - at the global level not at the level of single nations or regions. It also highlights the need to consider the problem and related policies in relation to developed countries. It discusses the limitations in terms of strategies and policies due to lack of international agreement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business environment; Investments; Transnational companies; World economy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960623985

The ever rising demand for these systems, the growing public concern on issues like global warming or national security, along with emerging technologies that promise great synergies between both (plug-in hybrid vehicles or electrified rail), creates the necessity for a new framework for long-term planning. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology to investigate long-term investment portfolios of these two infrastructures and their interdependencies. Its multiobjective nature, based on the NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm, assures the discovery of the Pareto front of solutions in terms of cost, sustainability and resiliency. The optimization is driven by a cost-minimization network flow program which is modified in order to explore the solution space. The modular design enables the use of metrics to evaluate sustainability and resiliency and better characterize the objectives that the systems must meet. An index is presented to robustly meet long-term emission reduction goals. An example of a high level representation of the continental United States through 2050 is presented and analyzed using the present methodology. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Energy; Evolutionary programming; Long-term investment; Multiobjective optimization; Transportation","Emerging technologies; Emission reduction; Energy; Energy and transportation; Greenhouse emissions; Long term planning; Long-term investment; Modular designs; Multi objective; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; National security; Network flows; NSGA-II; Pareto front; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Public concern; Solution space; Computer programming; Evolutionary algorithms; Global warming; Investments; Sustainable development; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960054254

The contribution of Africa to the global carbon cycle is characterized by its low fossil fuel emissions, a rapidly increasing population causing cropland expansion, and degradation and deforestation risk to extensive dryland and savannah ecosystems and to tropical forests in Central Africa. A synthesis of the carbon balance of African ecosystems is provided at different scales, including observations of land-atmosphere CO2 flux and soil carbon and biomass carbon stocks. A review of the most recent estimates of the net long-term carbon balance of African ecosystems is provided, including losses from fire disturbance, based upon observations, giving a sink of the order of 0.2 Pg C yr-1 with a large uncertainty around this number. By comparison, fossil fuel emissions are only of the order of 0.2Pg Cyr-1 and land-use emissions are of the order of 0.24Pg Cyr -1.

These effects include the acute impact of extreme temperatures, especially heat waves in urban areas, and heavy rainfalls with flooding, mud flows and landslides. High precipitation events can have long-term effects like post-traumatic stress syndrome, damage to infrastructure and buildings with impact on health, and migration which also should be in the focus of public health planning. © 2011 Springer Medizin Verlag.","Adaptation measures; Climate change; Health risks; Public health; Weather extremes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961173687

It is argued that the diversity of different possible geoengineering techniques-encompassing solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and further divided into territorial techniques and commons-based techniques-rules out a single mode of geoengineering governance. Whereas some geoengineering techniques may be effective when implemented by a small number of countries, others would need to be implemented around the globe and involve most countries of the world, with different countries having different comparative advantages in the various geoengineering techniques. Such an enterprise would generate collective action problems related to implementation and disagreements over who should pay for the financial and nonfinancial costs of geoengineering. Nonetheless, a more coherent system of geoengineering governance is possible and is necessary if international conflict is to be avoided and the risks of unintended consequences are to be minimized. Any new international institutional design on geoengineering will need to address some pressing political and scientific questions, including the desired mean temperature of the world's climate, the possible role of CDR technologies in carbon offsets and emissions-trading schemes, and whether there should be differentiated obligations between different groups of states. © 2011 SAGE Publications.","carbon dioxide removal; geoengineering; global commons; governance; risk; solar radiation management","carbon dioxide; environmental planning; environmental politics; global warming; governance approach; implementation process; international conflict; solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958729055

This article attempts to provide the first systematic cataloging of the emerging patterns of policy evaluation undertaken in different parts of the European Union. Theories of policy evaluation suggest that these evaluation practices should acknowledge the inherent complexity of climate policy making, be reflexive by questioning official policy goals, and be participatory. A meta-analysis of 259 climate policy evaluations suggests that current practice engages with some but not all of these issues. This article concludes by analyzing the implications of this finding for those in the academic and practitioner community who are keen to understand the extent to which climate policy evaluation is delivering on its promises. © The Author(s).2011.","Climate policy; European Union; Evaluation theory; Meta-analysis; Policy evaluation","environmental policy; European Union; meta-analysis; policy making; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956146850

Using indicators to monitor environmental impacts and evaluate the efficacies of policies and regulations has been practiced for a long time, and it can serve as a useful tool for decision making and for comparison between different countries. Although numerous indicators have been developed for relevant subjects, integrated approaches that consider individual changes, dynamic interaction, and multi-dimensions of indicators are scarce. This paper aimed to develop a Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to assess the problems. This DPSIR model is mainly related to energy consumption, environmental impacts, and policy responses. The objectives of the paper were: (1) conduct a literature review on the indicators that have been used in GHG-related studies; (2) develop a DPSIR model that incorporates GHG-related indicators and evaluate their relationships using a cause-effect chain of GHG emission; and (3) develop a calculative method that can be used to explain the dynamic correlation among the interdependent indicators. Taiwan is a significant source of global GHG emissions. A case study, using the developed framework and Taiwan's actual data of the past two decades, was conducted. The results indicate that regulatory strategies for pollution control are inadequate in terms of ensuring environmental quality, and the nature does not have the capability to revert the impacts from the existing level of pollution. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cause-effect chain; Driving Force-Pressure- State-Impact-Response; Greenhouse effect; Indicator","Cause-effect; Cause-effect chain; Climate change mitigation; Driving Force-Pressure- State-Impact-Response; Dynamic correlation; Dynamic interaction; Environmental quality; GHG emission; Integrated approach; Literature reviews; Research and development; Supply and demand; Technology development; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Decision making; Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Pollution control; Rating; Greenhouse effect; carbon emission; climate change; environmental assessment; environmental impact; environmental indicator; environmental modeling; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental quality; greenhouse effect; pollution control; regulatory framework; climate change; decision making; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; mathematical analysis; policy; pollution control; review; scientific literature; Taiwan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Decision Support Techniques; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Chemical; Taiwan; Taiwan",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959739492

Design/methodology/approach: To assess the water quality impact of the study, wetland sampling sites were selected to represent the receiving wetland, wetland background, effluent discharge point, and the adjacent canals. Water samples were taken in different seasons of the year and analyzed for water quality parameters including pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, chloride, total organic carbon, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, TKN and phosphorus. USEPA-approved standard methods were followed and Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures were compiled. Analysis of variance and Student Newman-Keuls Post-Hoc analysis were performed on the sampling results to evaluate the water quality differences among the sampling sites. Findings: No water quality degradation was detected in the wetland study after receiving treated municipal wastewater for 40 years. Dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature were not different from the background level. Total organic carbon and nutrients levels reduced significantly in the receiving wetland, indicating effective waste assimilation. Salinity in the immediate receiving area was reduced substantially, which offers potential application to buffer saltwater intrusion and wetland restoration. Practical implications: The practice in this study offers potential implications in wastewater nutrients removal, wetland restoration, minimizing saltwater intrusion in coastal wetland. Originality/value: This study investigated the water quality impact in wetland after receiving municipal effluent for 40 years. Results provide evidence of effective assimilation in wetlands and offer potential applications in coastal wetland restoration. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Waste; Water; Water pollutants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959215918

Most uniform melters are cold-tops, with a layer of raw batch insulating the surface. The cold batch cover also almost eliminates volatile losses to the atmosphere. If local electricity pricing is favorable, one should consider electrical Joule heating for temperature control on the way to the forming operation. The throat boost will keep the glass in the throat fluid, speeding the recovery for emergency situations, during a forced cooldown. Electrical boost systems are a reasonably inexpensive way to add the possibility of extra tonnage. Electric boosting and throat boost have important value even beyond the cost of applied energy.

Four ruminally cannulated cows were fed a hay diet and transitioned to a 65% grain and 35% hay diet. The cattle were maintained on an high-concentrate diet for 3 weeks before the transition back to an hay diet, which was fed for an additional 3 weeks. Rumen fluid and solids and fecal samples were obtained prior to feeding during weeks 0 (hay), 1, and 3 (high-concentrate), and 4 and 6 (hay). Subacute ruminal acidosis was induced during week 1. During week 3 of the experiment, there was a significant increase in the number of protozoa present in the rumen fluid (P = 0.049) and rumen solids (P = 0.004), and a significant reduction in protozoa in the rumen fluid in week 6 (P = 0.003). No significant effect of diet on density of rumen methanogens was found in any samples, as determined by real-time PCR. Clone libraries were constructed for weeks 0, 3, and 6, and the methanogen diversity of week 3 was found to differ from week 6. Week 3 was also found to have a significantly altered methanogen community structure, compared to the other weeks. Twenty-two unique 16S rRNA phylotypes were identified, three of which were found only during high-concentrate feeding, three were found during both phases of hay feeding, and seven were found in all three clone libraries. The genus Methanobrevibacter comprised 99% of the clones present. The rumen fluid at weeks 0, 3, and 6 of all the animals was found to contain a type A protozoal population. Ultimately, high-concentrate feeding did not significantly affect the density of rumen methanogens, but did alter methanogen diversity and community structure, as well as protozoal density within the rumen of nonlactating dairy cattle. Therefore, it may be necessary to monitor the rumen methanogen and protozoal communities of dairy cattle susceptible to depressed pH when methane abatement strategies are being investigated. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"animal; animal food; article; cattle; chemistry; classification; eating; female; genetics; isolation and purification; lactation; metabolism; Methanobrevibacter; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; parasitology; pH; phylogeny; physiology; ruminant stomach; Trichostomatia; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Eating; Female; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lactation; Methanobrevibacter; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Rumen; Trichostomatida; Animalia; Bos; Methanobrevibacter; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960576724

A goal was to understand whether sulfate is generated by re-oxidation of sulfide throughout the sulfate and methane zones, which might explain the abundance of active sulfate reducers deep below the main sulfate zone. Sulfate penetrated down to 130cm where methane started to build up and where the concentration of free sulfide peaked at 5.5mM. Below this sulfate-methane transition, sulfide diffused downwards to a sulfidization front at 520cm depth, below which dissolved iron, Fe2+, accumulated in the pore water. Sulfate reduction rates measured by 35S-tracer incubations in the sulfate zone were high due to high concentrations of reactive organic matter. Within the sulfate-methane transition, sulfate reduction was distinctly stimulated by the anaerobic oxidation of methane. In the methane zone below, sulfate remained at positive "" background"" concentrations of &lt;0.5mM down to the sulfidization front. Sulfate reduction decreased steeply to rates which at 300-500cm depth were 0.2-1pmol SO42-cm-3d-1, i.e., 4-5 orders of magnitude lower than rates measured near the sediment surface. The turn-over time of sulfate increased from 3years at 12cm depth to 100-1000years down in the methane zone. Sulfate reduction in the methane zone accounted for only 0.1% of sulfate reduction in the entire sediment column and was apparently limited by the low pore water concentration of sulfate and the low availability of organic substrates. Amendment of the sediment with both sulfate and organic substrates immediately caused a 10- to 40-fold higher, "" potential sulfate reduction"" which showed that a physiologically intact community of sulfate reducing bacteria was present. The "" background"" sulfate concentration appears to be generated from the reaction of downwards diffusing sulfide with deeply buried Fe(III) species, such as poorly-reactive iron oxides or iron bound in reactive silicates. The oxidation of sulfide to sulfate in the sulfidic sediment may involve the formation of elemental sulfur and thiosulfate and their further disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate. The net reaction of sulfide and Fe(III) to form pyrite requires an additional oxidant, irrespective of the formation of sulfate. This could be CO2 which is reduced with H2 to methane. The methane subsequently diffuses upwards to become re-oxidized at the sulfate-methane transition and thereby removes excess reducing power and enables the formation of excess sulfate. We show here how the combination of these well-established sulfur-iron-carbon reactions may lead to the deep formation of sulfate and drive a cryptic sulfur cycle. The iron-rich post-glacial sediments underlying Holocene marine mud stimulate the strong sub-surface sulfide reoxidation observed in Aarhus Bay and are a result of the glacial to interglacial history of the Baltic Sea area. Yet, processes similar to the ones described here probably occur widespread in marine sediments, in particular along the ocean margins. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"concentration (composition); diffusion; iron; marine sediment; methane; organic geochemistry; oxidation; reaction rate; reduction; sediment chemistry; sulfate-reducing bacterium; sulfur cycle; Aarhus Bay; Denmark; Midtjylland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955432780

Two approaches were used in model development: (1) a fire or plot level analysis, based on a dataset which includes the proportion of the pre-fire woody fuel load consumed at each fire; and (2) a stage level analysis, based on a dataset where woody fuel consumption was measured at a woody fuel particle level (i.e. pre-fire and post-fire diameter). For the plot level analysis a generalised linear model (GLM) approach identified the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) as the best predictor of the proportion of woody fuel consumed, with an R2 of 0.58 and mean absolute error of 10%. The stage level analysis recognised the various combustion stages through which a burning woody particle would pass, but failed to develop an accurate model that predicted the ignition, partial and full consumption of woody fuels based on fuel, fire behaviour and environmental variables. Analysis showed that consumption of woody fuel particles is highly variable and that variation in fire behaviour potentially has a greater impact on woody fuel consumption, than does variation in fuel characteristics (e.g. state of decay, fuel suspension and interactions with other fuel particles). The FFDI GLM provides forest and fire managers with a tool to manage woody fuel consumption objectives and may assist fire managers with forecasting post-frontal fire behaviour. The FFDI GLM may also assist forest and fire managers to better meet land management goals and to comply with air quality and emission targets. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Coarse woody debris; Eucalypt forest fire; Forest Fire Danger Index; Woody fuel consumption","Australia; Coarse woody debris; Combustion stage; Data sets; Emission targets; Environmental variables; Eucalypt forest; Eucalypt forest fire; Fire behaviour; Fire managers; Forest Fire Danger Index; Forest fires; Fuel characteristics; Fuel loads; Fuel particles; High intensity; Land managements; Linear model; Mean absolute error; Model development; Post-fire; Woody fuel consumption; Air quality; Debris; Deforestation; Fuel gages; Fuels; Ignition; Management; Managers; Steel metallurgy; Suspensions (fluids); Fires; air quality; coarse woody debris; coniferous forest; data set; ecosystem management; fire behavior; forest fire; fuel consumption; land management; prescribed burning; wildfire; Air Quality; Deforestation; Dispersions; Eucalyptus; Fiber Debris; Forest Fires; Forest Management; Fuels; Ignition; Measuring Instruments; Metallurgy; Steel; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955021443

Conventional strategies of addressing climate change through universal, interstate negotiations - the most prominent of which is the Kyoto Protocol - have been stymied by the gaps that exist between the negotiating powers of states, rendering such initiatives stagnant and ineffectual. In response, a number of new actors and processes have begun to challenge the traditionally exclusive authority of nation-states to create rules and manage environmental problems via multi-national treaties. Dozens of innovative climate response initiatives, or ""governance experiments,"" have emerged at multiple levels of politics and across multiple jurisdictions: individuals, cities, states/provinces, corporations, and even new multilateral initiatives. This book explains how and why these new governance experiments have emerged, drawing upon a database of such initiatives to ascertain how these initiatives fit together and how they influence what is defined as environmental governance. In assessing the relational impact of these initiatives (whether they complement each other or clash; whether they can be scaled up or down; and whether they can be expanded beyond their current jurisdictional and geographic boundaries), the book provides insight into whether this experimentation is likely to result in an effective response to climate change. Additionally, it draws broader conclusions about how we understand global governance, addressing questions of how we understand authority and what we accept as modes of rule-making in global political spaces. © 2011 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

First, a hindcast was performed using the atmospheric concentrations of three greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) specified annually and globally on the basis of observations for the period 1870-1999. The hindcast results were compared with observations to evaluate the GCM's reliability in future climate simulations. Second, climate projections for a 100-year period (2000- 2099) were made using six scenarios of the atmospheric concentrations of the three greenhouse gases according to the A1FI, A1T, A1B, A2, B1, and B2 emission profiles of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. The present CCSM simulations are found to be consistent with IPCC's AR4 results in the temporal and spatial distributions for both the present-day and future periods. The GCM results were used to examine the changes in extreme temperatures and precipitation in East Asia and Korea. The extreme temperatures were categorized into warm and cold events: the former includes tropical nights, warm days, and heat waves during summer (June-July-August) and the latter includes frost days, cold days, and cold surges during winter (December-January-February). Focusing on Korea, the results predict more frequent heat waves in response to future emissions: the projected percentage changes between the present day and the late 2090s range from 294% to 583% depending on the emission scenario. The projected global warming is predicted to decrease the frequency of cold extreme events; however, the projected changes in cold surge frequency are not statistically significant. Whereas the number of cold surges in the A1FI emission profile decreases from the present-day value by up to 24%, the decrease in the B1 scenario is less than 1%. The frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events year-round were examined. Both the frequency and the intensity of these events are predicted to increase in the region around Korea. The present results will be helpful for establishing an adaptation strategy for possible climate change nationwide, especially extreme climate events, associated with global warming. © The Korean Meteorological Society and Springer 2011.","CCSM3; Climate projection; Extreme precipitation events; Extreme temperature events",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80055098763

The objectives of this research are to study the formation of the pollution plume over the city during a 3-day episode in February 2006 and to study two abatement strategies of air pollution for HCMC. The meteorology in HCMC is influenced by local phenomena and global phenomenon which create convergence fronts over and cause the formation of the plume of pollutants over the city. The plume of Ozone (O3) is developed in the north-western part of the city. The models successfully simulated these phenomena and their results are in good agreement with measurements. Two abatement strategies are studied in this work to help the local government who will make decisions for managing air quality in HCMC. For making a better-informed decision, the probabilistic estimate for the photochemical model is carried out in this research. The Monte Carlo method that is applied in this research for the uncertainty analyses is an efficient method of producing a probabilistic output from the photochemical model.

However, because of uncertainties around household behaviour patterns, it is very difficult to assess and compare the GHG reduction impacts of different intervention schemes for whole housing stock. Intervention schemes include policy instruments such as incentives or rebates for energy efficient appliances or renewable energy, and regulatory building code requirements for energy efficiency. This paper presents a decision support tool based on mathematical diffusion that evaluates the adoption levels of different schemes or pathways towards reducing GHG emissions in housing stock. It is an extension of the Bass diffusion model that accommodates financial and non-financial benefits, ceilings of adoption and interactions between intervention options. The model capability was tested using a case study of seven suburbs in Brisbane, Australia, comprising of 25,000 houses and units.

The average annual daily CH4 flux was 30.2mgm-2d-1, but the daily emission rates varied considerably over time. Several factors were identified that explained some of this variation. (1) Grazing cattle moving through the source area of the eddy flux mast increased the measured emission rates by one order of magnitude during short time periods. (2) Friction velocity exerted a strong control on the CH4 flux whenever there were water pools on the surface. (3) An exponential response of the daily CH4 flux to soil temperature at 20cm depth was found for most of the study period, but not for parts of the summer season that coincided with a low water level in the river flowing through the wetland. (4) Additional variations in the CH4 emission rates were related to the spatial heterogeneity of the source area. This area covered not only different plant communities but also a gravel road and a river surface, and it had a microtopography that visibly induced a large spatial variability in the wetness of the top soil. It is shown that the control mechanisms for the methane emission from restored wetlands are more complex than those reported for natural wetlands, since they include both management activities and slow adaptive processes related to changes in vegetation and hydrology. On the basis of eddy fluxes of carbon dioxide measured at the same site it is finally demonstrated that the variability in the CH4 fluxes strongly affects the greenhouse gas sink strength of the restored wetland. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","CH4 emissions; Eddy covariance; Greenhouse gas budget; Restored wetlands","adaptive management; carbon dioxide; cattle; eddy covariance; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; identification method; methane; observational method; plant community; restoration ecology; soil depth; soil temperature; spatial variation; wetland; Denmark; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955599131

We identified the proportion of noncalcifying macroalgae with particular carbon use strategies using the natural abundance of carbon isotopes and pH drift experiments in a kelp forest. We also identified all calcifying macroalgae in this system; these were the dominant component of the benthos (by % cover) at all depths and seasons while cover of noncalcareous macroalgae increased at shallower depths and during summer. All large canopy-forming macroalgae had attributes suggestive of active uptake of inorganic carbon and the presence of a CO2 concentration mechanism (CCM). CCM species covered, on average, 15-45% of the benthos and were most common at shallow depths and during summer. There was a high level of variability in carbon isotope discrimination within CCM species, probably a result of energetic constraints on active carbon uptake in a low light environment. Over 50% of red noncalcifying species exhibited values below -30‰ suggesting a reliance on diffusive CO2 uptake and no functional CCM. Non-CCM macroalgae covered on average 0-8.9% of rock surfaces and were most common in deep, low light habitats. Elevated CO2 has the potential to influence competition between dominant coralline species (that will be negatively affected by increased CO2) and noncalcareous CCM macroalgae (neutral or positive effects) and relatively rare (on a % cover basis) non-CCM species (positive effects). Responses of macroalgae to elevated CO2 will be strongly modified by light and any responses are likely to be different at times or locations where energy constrains photosynthesis. Increased growth and competitive ability of noncalcareous macroalgae alongside negative impacts of acidification on calcifying species could have major implications for the functioning of coastal reef systems at elevated CO2 concentrations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Algae; Carbon concentrating mechanisms; Coralline algae; Kelp forest; Light; Ocean acidification; Stable isotopes","acidification; benthos; carbon dioxide; coastal zone; coralline alga; forest canopy; forest cover; inorganic carbon; kelp forest; macroalga; stable isotope; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957819250

Any incentive system to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) will have to overcome those limits. This paper reviews the main challenges to implementing effective REDD+ mitigation activities in SSA. We estimate that SSA is currently a net carbon sink of approximately 319 TgCO2 yr-1. Forest degradation and deforestation put the forest carbon stock at risk (mean forest carbon stock is 57,679 TgC).

Unfortunately, places with high marginal costs also tend to have high marginal damages. Ton-for-ton trading reduces emissions in low damage areas (rural) while increasing emissions in high damage areas (cities). From 2000 to 2007, conservative estimates of the value of mortality risk suggest that trades increased damages from $0.8 to $1.1 billion annually relative to the initial allowance allocation and from $1.5 to $1.9 billion annually relative to a uniform performance standard. With U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) values, trades increased damages from $2.4 to $3.2 billion annually compared to the initial allowance allocation and from $4.4 to $5.4 billion compared to a uniform performance standard. It is not clear that the ton-for-ton SO2 cap and trade program is actually more efficient than comparable command and control programs.

Even though this has been widely acknowledged, only few papers exist that have studied cities holistically from a demand, i.e., consumption, perspective. The study presents a detailed analysis of the carbon footprint of two metropolitan cities from a consumption perspective. With the analysis of consumer carbon footprints (carbon consumption), the distribution of emissions in the key source categories is presented and compared. Materials and methods: The study utilizes Finnish consumer survey data by cities, regional emission data for key processes, and general emission data to produce a hybrid LCA model for a holistic assessment of city-level greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption perspective. Results and discussion: The study results showed the carbon consumption to be 13.2 t CO2e per person in Helsinki with a 17,400 € annual consumption expenditure and 10.3 t CO2e per person in Porvoo with a 15,900 € annual consumption expenditure, respectively. The dominant carbon sources for metropolitan living are heat and electricity, building and property, private driving, and services. Within the cities, some significant differences were found. The carbon emissions from energy consumption are 4.5 t CO2e for an average consumer in Helsinki, whereas an average consumer in Porvoo only causes 2.0 t CO2e due to the cleaner energy production in Porvoo. On the other hand, private driving causes 2.0 t CO2e in Porvoo, but only 1.3 t in Helsinki. The overall trip generation in Helsinki is only half of that in Porvoo, and also, the usage of public transport is at a substantially higher level in Helsinki. The current results contradict interestingly some earlier studies in finding that the theoretical carbon-reducing influence of city density is overridden with other factors, such as the type of energy production, energy efficiency of the housing stock, and increased use of services. In our study, Helsinki represents a metropolitan area with a denser structure and a more efficient public transport system, but still consuming around 25% more carbon emissions than the other city in the metropolitan area, Porvoo. The sensitivity analysis showed that even with the normalization of the key parameters between the two cities, the main finding still holds. Conclusions: The evaluation of the carbon footprint of cities from the consumption perspective, instead of a more traditional production perspective, seems to offer an interesting new insight into the carbon footprints of the cities. It identifies similar key sources of carbon as production-oriented studies but further emphasizes the significance of the utilized services in the carbon footprint evaluations. In the future, the carbon footprint of services, especially in the service-intensive economies and cities that tend to outsource their manufacturing and carbon emissions, should be further examined since they cause an ever increasing proportion of the carbon consumption of consumers. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon footprint; Climate change mitigation; Consumption; Green cities; Hybrid LCA; Urban structures","article; building; car driving; carbon footprint; carbon source; carbon utilization; city; electricity; energy consumption; energy yield; Finland; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; heat; poverty; priority journal; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960616704

Urban density is considered crucial in climate change mitigation since it reduces automobile dependence and decreases unit sizes, for example. This letter analyzes the effect of density in a city context. In the study the Finnish capital Helsinki is divided into two areas of different urban densities: the high density downtown area and the more scarcely populated suburbs. The study is a continuation of a recently published study on the implications of urban structure on carbon emissions, and analyzes further the main finding of the first study - that higher urban density might have negligible or even reverse effect on the per capita carbon emissions. Similarly to the previous study, a consumption based tiered hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is employed in order to produce a comprehensive assessment, free of territorial boundaries and system cutoffs typical of traditional LCAs. Based on the findings of the previous study, it is hypothesized that when assessing city level carbon dioxide emissions from a wider, consumer oriented LCA perspective, increased urban density may not necessarily reduce carbon emissions. Surprisingly, the study finds that carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions are substantially higher in the dense downtown area than in the surrounding suburbs, which is suggested to imply that the increased consumption due to the higher standard of living increases emissions more than the higher density is able to reduce them. The results demonstrate that, while increasing urban density can be justified from a number of ecological, social and economic viewpoints, density is not necessarily a key parameter in the particular case of climate change. In cities like Helsinki, where wealth is concentrated in the downtown area, climate policies should give higher priority to the energy consumption of buildings, to alternative energy production and distribution modes, as well as to low carbon consumption within the city. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon emissions; climate change; consumption; D variables; LCA; life cycle assessment; urban density",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053484406

Standard interpretation methods for nuclear-resistivity logs cannot distinguish between mobile and residual hydrocarbon saturation. In extreme cases, fluid pumpout or production testing are the only options to ascertain whether the reservoir's in-situ hydrocarbon is mobile. We develop a new method to distinguish mobile from residual hydrocarbon and to quantify residual hydrocarbon saturation. The method combines modeling of resistivity and nuclear logs with the physics of mud-filtrate invasion to quantify the effect of residual hydrocarbon saturation on both nuclear and resistivity logs. This strategy explicitly takes into account the different volumes of investigation of resistivity and nuclear measurements and does not assume that the near-borehole region is flushed to the level of residual hydrocarbon saturation. The method begins with an initial multi-layer petrophysical model which is constructed via standard procedures of well-log interpretation and core measurements. Thereafter, we simulate the physics of mudfiltrate invasion and the corresponding resistivity, density, and neutron logs. Initial estimates of residual hydrocarbon saturation and parametric relative permeability are refined until achieving a good agreement between simulated and measured neutron and density logs. Next, we refine initial estimates of water saturation, porosity, and permeability until securing a good match between numerically simulated and measured resistivity logs. The method of interpretation considers two specific options for implementation: (1) quantification of the influence of residual hydrocarbon saturation on the radial distribution of fluid saturation due to invasion, and (2) appraisal of invasion effects on the vertical distribution of fluid saturation within a flow unit that exhibits both hydrocarbon and water saturation in capillary equilibrium. Application examples are described for the cases of tight-gas sand reservoirs invaded with water-base mud (WBM) and oil-bearing reservoirs invaded with oil-base mud (OBM). In the case of tight-gas sands, our method explains the marginal productivity of deeply invaded beds that exhibit cross-over between density and neutron logs. For a 15-porosity unit formation, when the residual gas saturation increases by 10 saturation units, the cross-over between neutron and density logs increases by 2.4 porosity units. Interpretation results indicate measurable sensitivity of nuclear logs to residual hydrocarbon saturation in cases of deep WBM invasion due to immiscibility between invaded and in-situ fluids. However, the accuracy of the method decreases with increasing values of both hydrocarbon pore volume and hydrocarbon density.

Compared with electrons, FI based on a beam of quasi-monoenergetic ions has the advantage of a more localized energy deposition, and stiffer particle transport, bringing the required total beam energy close to the theoretical minimum. Due to short pulse laser drive, the ion beam can easily deliver the 200 TW power required to ignite the compressed D-T fuel. In integrated calculations we recently simulated ion-based FI targets with high fusion gain targets and a proof of principle experiment [1]. These simulations identify three key requirements for the success of ion-driven fast ignition (IFI): (1) the generation of a sufficiently high-energetic ion beam (≈400-500 MeV for C), with (2) less than 20% energy spread at (3) more than 10% conversion efficiency of laser to beam energy. Here we present for the first time new experimental results, demonstrating all three parameters in separate experiments. Using diamond nanotargets and ultrahigh contrast laser pulses we were able to demonstrate >500 MeV carbon ions, as well as carbon pulses with ΔE/E < 20%.

Many cities are currently not able to fulfill European air quality standards for these critical pollutants. Meanwhile, promising new abatement technologies such as diesel particle filters (DPFs) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts are developed to reduce PM and RNC emissions. Herein, effects of a urea-based SCR system on RNC emissions are discussed and we quantified the highly reactive intermediates isocyanic acid (HNCO) and ammonia (NH3), both potential secondary pollutants of the urea-based SCR chemistry. A diesel engine (3.0 L, 100 kW), operated in the ISO 8178/4 C1, cycle was used as test platform. A V2O5-based SCR catalyst was either applied as such or down-stream of a high oxidation potential-DPF (hox-DPF). With active SCR, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) conversion efficiencies of 0.86-0.94 and 0.86-0.99 were obtained. On the other hand, mean HNCO and NH3 emissions increased to 240-280 and 1800-1900 mg h-1. On a molar basis, HNCO accounted for 0.8-1.4% and NH3 for 14-25% of the emitted RNCs. On roads, SCR systems will partly be inactive when exhaust temperatures drop below 220 °C. The system was active only during 75% of the test cycle, and urea dosing was stopped and restarted several times. Consequently, NO conversion stopped but interestingly, NO2 was still converted. Such light-off and shutdown events are frequent in urban driving, compromising the overall deNOx efficiency. Another important effect of the SCR technology is illustrated by the NH3/NO2 ratio, which was &gt;1 with active SCR, indicating that exhaust is basic rather than acidic after the SCR catalyst. Under these conditions, isocyanic acid is stable. The widespread use of various converter technologies already affected RNC release. Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) and hox-DPFs increased NO2 emissions, three-way catalysts (TWCs) those of NH3. The investigated SCR technology substantially lowered NO and NO2 emissions, while NH3 levels were comparable to those of TWC vehicles (300-1500 mg h-1). If applied in the future, the combined DPF/SCR technology will change ambient RNC levels, PM compositions and atmospheric redox- and acid/base-chemistry in traffic-affected areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","DeNOx technology; Diesel particulate filter; Heavy duty vehicles; Isocyanic acid; Secondary NO2 formation; Selective catalytic reduction","DENOX technologies; Diesel particulate filters; Heavy duty vehicles; Isocyanic acid; Secondary NO2 formation; Active filters; Air filters; Air quality; Air quality standards; Atmospheric chemistry; Catalysts; Conversion efficiency; Diesel engines; Fuel filters; Metabolism; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Pollution; Reduction; Technology; Urea; Selective catalytic reduction; ammonia; diesel fuel; isocyanate; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; reactive nitrogen species; urea; abatement cost; advanced technology; air quality; ammonia; catalyst; diesel engine; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; traffic emission; trucking; air quality standard; article; catalysis; diesel engine; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; noise reduction; oxidation; particulate matter; pollutant; priority journal; reduction; traffic; traffic and transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954988185

A large-scale model of cellular metabolism in developing embryos of Brassica napus (bna572) was used to predict biomass formation and to analyze metabolic steady states by flux variability analysis under different physiological conditions. Predicted flux patterns are highly correlated with results from prior 13C metabolic flux analysis of B. napus developing embryos. Minor differences from the experimental results arose because bna572 always selected only one sugar and one nitrogen source from the available alternatives, and failed to predict the use of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Flux variability, indicative of alternative optimal solutions, revealed alternative pathways that can provide pyruvate and NADPH to plastidic fatty acid synthesis. The nutritional values of different medium substrates were compared based on the overall carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) for the biosynthesis of biomass. Although bna572 has a functional nitrogen assimilation pathway via glutamate synthase, the simulations predict an unexpected role of glycine decarboxylase operating in the direction of NH 4+ assimilation. Analysis of the light-dependent improvement of carbon economy predicted two metabolic phases. At very low light levels small reductions in CO2 efflux can be attributed to enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase) and glycine decarboxylase. At higher light levels relevant to the 13C flux studies, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase activity is predicted to account fully for the light-dependent changes in carbon balance. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","carbon partitioning; constraint-based model; flux balance analysis; linear program; stoichiometric model","Carbon partitioning; Constraint-based; flux balance analysis; Linear programs; stoichiometric model; Amino acids; Biochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Conversion efficiency; Fatty acids; Forecasting; Metabolism; Nitrogen fixation; Physiological models; Physiology; Plants (botany); Sugars; Vegetable oils; Oilseeds; carbon; fatty acid; glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating); nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; nitrogen; pyruvic acid; quaternary ammonium derivative; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; sucrose; article; biological model; biology; biosynthesis; citric acid cycle; computer simulation; cytosol; glycolysis; growth, development and aging; light; metabolism; metabolome; plant seed; prenatal development; rapeseed; Brassica napus; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Citric Acid Cycle; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Cytosol; Fatty Acids; Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating); Glycolysis; Light; Metabolome; Models, Biological; NADP; Nitrogen; Pyruvic Acid; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Seeds; Sucrose; Brassica napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960900581

However, the existing GCMs have only limited ability to simulate the complex and local climate features, such as precipitation. Furthermore, the outputs provided by GCMs are too coarse to be useful in hydrologic impact assessment models, as these models require information at much finer scales. Therefore, downscaling of GCM outputs is usually employed to provide fine-resolution information required for impact models. Among the downscaling techniques based on statistical principles, multiple regression and weather generator are considered to be more popular, as they are computationally less demanding than the other downscaling techniques. In the present study, the performances of a multiple regression model (called SDSM) and a weather generator (called LARS-WG) are evaluated in terms of their ability to simulate the frequency of extreme precipitation events of current climate and downscaling of future extreme events. Areal average daily precipitation data of the Clutha watershed located in South Island, New Zealand, are used as baseline data in the analysis. Precipitation frequency analysis is performed by fitting the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to the observed, the SDSM simulated/downscaled, and the LARS-WG simulated/downscaled annual maximum (AM) series. The computations are performed for five return periods: 10-, 20-, 40-, 50- and 100-year. The present results illustrate that both models have similar and good ability to simulate the extreme precipitation events and, thus, can be adopted with confidence for climate change impact studies of this nature. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Generalized Extreme Value distribution; Global Climate Models; Statistical downscaling; Weather generator","Adaptation strategies; Annual maxima; Areal averages; Baseline data; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Down-scaling; Emission scenario; Extreme events; Extreme precipitation; Future climate; Generalized extreme value; Generalized extreme value distribution; Global climate model; Global Climate Models; Hydrologic impacts; Impact model; Local climate; Multiple regression model; Multiple regressions; Precipitation data; Precipitation frequency; Return periods; South Island , New Zealand; Statistical downscaling; Statistical principles; Weather generator; Climate change; Landforms; Rain; Regression analysis; Watersheds; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); watershed; Clutha River; New Zealand; Otago; South Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952988380

From the late 19th century to the present, agricultural practices in the Great Plains of the United States have dramatically reduced soil organic carbon (C) levels and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in this region. This paper details the development of an innovative method to assess these processes. Detailed land-use data sets that specify complete agricultural histories for 21 representative Great Plains counties reflect historical changes in agricultural practices and drive the biogeochemical model, DAYCENT, to simulate 120 years of cropping and related ecosystem consequences. Model outputs include yields of all major crops, soil and system C levels, soil trace-gas fluxes (N2O emissions and CH4 consumption), and soil nitrogen mineralization rates. Comparisons between simulated and observed yields allowed us to adjust and refine model inputs, and then to verify and validate the results. These verification and validation exercises produced measures of model fit that indicated the appropriateness of this approach for estimating historical changes in crop yield. Initial cultivation of native grass and continued farming produced a significant loss of soil C over decades, and declining soil fertility led to reduced crop yields. This process was accompanied by a large GHG release, which subsided as soil fertility decreased. Later, irrigation, nitrogen-fertilizer application, and reduced cultivation intensity restored soil fertility and increased crop yields, but led to increased N2O emissions that reversed the decline in net GHG release. By drawing on both historical evidence of land-use change and scientific models that estimate the environmental consequences of those changes, this paper offers an improved way to understand the short-and long-term ecosystem effects of 120 years of cropping in the Great Plains. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Agricultural history; Biogeochemical models; Cropland; Grassland; Great Plains (USA); Greenhouse gas emissions, GHG; Land-use change; Methane (CH4) flux; Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from soil; Pasture; Soil carbon","agricultural practice; assessment method; biogeochemical cycle; crop yield; cultivation; data set; emission; environmental change; fertilizer application; gas exchange; grass; greenhouse gas; irrigation; land use change; methane; mineralization; native species; nineteenth century; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; numerical model; soil fertility; soil organic matter; yield response; agriculture; air pollutant; article; chemistry; computer simulation; crop; ecosystem; environment; greenhouse effect; history; theoretical model; time; United States; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Environment; Greenhouse Effect; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Models, Theoretical; Time Factors; United States; Great Plains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958796231

The model combines a deterministic renewable portfolio planning module with a Monte Carlo simulation of system operation that determines the expected least-cost dispatch from each technology, the necessary reserve capacity, and the expected carbon emissions at each hour. Each system is designed to meet a maximum loss of load expectation requirement of 1 day in 10 years. The present study includes wind, centralized solar thermal, and rooftop photovoltaics, as well as hydroelectric, geothermal, and natural gas plants. The portfolios produced by the model take advantage of the aggregation of variable generators at multiple geographically disperse sites and the incorporation of meteorological and load forecasts. Results are presented from a model run of the continuous two-year period, 2005-2006 in the California ISO operating area. A low-carbon portfolio is produced for this system that is capable of achieving an 80% reduction in electric power sector carbon emissions from 2005 levels and supplying over 99% of the annual delivered load with non-carbon sources. A portfolio is also built for a projected 2050 system, which is capable of providing 96% of the delivered electricity from non-carbon sources, despite a projected doubling of the 2005 system peak load. The results suggest that further reductions in carbon emissions may be achieved with emerging technologies that can reliably provide large capacities without necessarily providing positive net annual energy generation. These technologies may include demand response, vehicle-to-grid systems, and large-scale energy storage. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon emissions; Intermittent generation; Renewable energy; Solar power; Wind power","California ISO; Carbon emissions; Carbon source; Demand response; Electric power sector; Emerging technologies; Energy generations; Intermittent generation; Load forecast; Loss of load expectation; Low-carbon; Monte Carlo approach; Monte Carlo Simulation; Operating area; Photovoltaics; Portfolio planning; Renewable energies; Renewables; Reserve capacity; Solar power; Solar thermal; System operation; System peaks; Vehicle to grids; Computer simulation; Gas plants; Loss of load probability; Monte Carlo methods; Solar power plants; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Solar energy; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; demand analysis; electrical power; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; renewable resource; technological development; temporal analysis; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952443079

They are not only growing sources of greenhouse gases, but (in common with urban settlements in other regions) are also hotspots of vulnerability to floods, heat waves, and other hazards that climate change is expected to aggravate. This paper reviews the existing literature on the climate linkages and the relevance of urban development in LAC. It briefly describes research on existing mitigation and adaptation responses. It then explores why it is important to include a pro-poor perspective in adaptation actions. Although LAC cities have been the sources of many initiatives, policies and actions aimed at mitigating emissions and adapting to climate change, these have focused mostly on mitigation. It has been difficult to promote adaptation at the local level without the necessary support from higher levels of government and the international community. This has left a gap in the support and funding of locally determined, locally driven and necessary adaptation that serves and works with those most at risk. The best opportunities to adapt to climate change are linked with actions that address the underlying causes of vulnerability and respond to more than one problem at a time. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,"adaptive management; climate change; environmental impact assessment; flood; governance approach; greenhouse gas; human settlement; literature review; mitigation; risk assessment; sustainability; urban area; urban climate; urban development; vulnerability; Caribbean Islands; Latin America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955625851

Historical events provoked much interest, and sometimes alarm, because bright aurora becomes visible at mid-latitudes. However, they had little economic impact because the major technologies of those eras were not sensitive to space weather. This is no longer true. The widespread adoption of advanced technological infrastructures over the past 40 years has created significant sensitivity. So these events now have the potential to disrupt those infrastructures - and thus have profound economic and societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such events are rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of the events. This limitation is uniquely serious for space weather since it is a global phenomenon. Many other natural hazards (e.g. flash floods) are highly localised, so statistically significant datasets can be assembled by combining data from independent instances of the hazard recorded over a few decades. Such datasets are the foundation on which reliable risk assessment methodologies are built. But we have a single instance of space weather so we would have to make observations for many centuries in order to build a statistically significant dataset. We show that it is not practicable to assess the risk from extreme events using simple statistical methods. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of solar-terrestrial physics to find other ways to assess these risks. We discuss three alternative approaches: (a) use of proxy data, (b) studies of other solar systems, and (c) use of physics-based modelling. We note that the proxy data approach is already well-established as a technique for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not yet provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms. This latter risk is more suited to the other approaches, but significant research is needed to make progress. We need to develop and expand techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar systems (stellar flares, radio emissions from planetary aurorae). And to make progress in modelling severe space weather, we need to focus on the physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e.g. how can dayside and tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to envelop mid-latitudes?. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of COSPAR.","Extreme events; Natural hazards; Risk assessment; Severe events; Space weather","Economic and social effects; Geomagnetism; Geophysics; Hazards; Solar system; Storms; Extreme events; Natural hazard; Physics-based modelling; Risk assessment methodologies; Severe events; Solar Terrestrial Physics; Space weather; Technological infrastructure; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955830886

There have been (and still are) many lessons learned from these existing emissions trading markets for the functioning and the design of carbon trading schemes. This article describes the history and design features of the three most important noncarbon US programs in air quality management: the domestic SO2 Acid Rain Program, the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) in Southern California addressing SO2 and NOx, and the NOx Budget Program in the Northeastern states of the United States focusing on the decrease of summer ozone. Special attention is given to the question as to whether these programs were successful with respect to (1) the functioning of the markets, (2) their cost-effectiveness, and (3) their environmental effectiveness.

Lessons learned include, inter alia, rules to increase companies' flexibility (e.g., banking of allowances); grandfathering as political-motivated allocation rule; design options to reduce uncertainties, transaction costs, and rent seeking of special interest groups; monitoring and enforcement regulation; and the idea of focusing on learning and flexible systems. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",,"Acid rain; Air quality; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Environmental protection; Quality management; Sulfur dioxide; Acid rain programs; Budget programs; Emissions Trading; Emissions Trading Scheme; Environmental effectiveness; Southern California; Special interest groups; Transaction cost; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961236602

The tropospheric NO2 columns from the CMAQ model simulations were then compared with those retrieved from a satellite sensor, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), over the Korean peninsula as well as briefly over East Asia. The results showed that the CMAQ modeling, using the NOx emissions from the CAPSS inventory over South Korea, produced tropospheric NO2 columns that were over-predicted by factors between 1.38 and 1.87 compared to the OMI-retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns. This appears to be in line with the findings from a previous study, i.e. when the ACE-ASIA emission inventory was used for the episodes from 2001 to 2003, the CMAQ modeling tended to produce NO2 columns that were ~1.46 times larger than the GOME-derived NO2 columns over South Korea. On the other hand, over North Korea, the NOx emissions of the INTEX-B emission inventory appear to be overestimated by factors between 1.55 and 7.46 (3.18 over the four seasonal episodes), based on the comparison study between the CMAQ-simulated and OMI-retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns.

It is important to understand this relationship because it will compound the already significant burden of diseases on national economies and public health. Authorities need to be able to assess, anticipate, and monitor human health vulnerability to climate change, in order to plan for, or implement action to avoid these eventualities. Environmental health indicators (EHIs) provide a tool to assess, monitor, and quantify human health vulnerability, to aid in the design and targeting of interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. Our aim was to identify the most suitable framework for developing EHIs to measure and monitor the impacts of climate change on human health and inform the development of interventions. Using published literature we reviewed the attributes of 11 frameworks. We identified the Driving force-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) framework as the most suitable one for developing EHIs for climate change and health. We propose the use of EHIs as a valuable tool to assess, quantify, and monitor human health vulnerability, design and target interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for the future development of EHIs as a multidisciplinary approach to link existing environmental and epidemiological data and networks.

If human health effects are enhanced by PM0.1's ability to cross cell membranes, then more information is needed describing the sources of ultrafine particles that are deposited in the human respiratory system. The current study presents results for the source apportionment of airborne particulate matter in six size fractions smaller than 1.8 μm particle diameter including ultrafine particles (PM0.1) in one of the most polluted air basins in the United States. Size-resolved source apportionment results are presented at an urban site and rural site in central California's heavily polluted San Joaquin Valley during the winter and summer months using a molecular marker chemical mass balance (MM-CMB) method. Respiratory deposition calculations for the size-resolved source apportionment results are carried out with the Multiple Path Particle Dosimetry Model (MPPD v 2.0), including calculations for ultrafine (PM0.1) source deposition. Diesel engines accounted for the majority of PM0.1 and PM1.8 EC at both the urban and rural sampling locations during both summer and winter seasons. Meat cooking accounted for 33-67% and diesel engines accounted for 15-21% of the PM0.1 OC at Fresno. Meat cooking accounted for 22-26% of the PM0.1 OC at the rural Westside location, while diesel engines accounted for 8-9%. Wood burning contributions to PM0.1 OC increased to as much as 12% of PM0.1 OC during the wintertime. The modest contribution of wood smoke reflects the success of emissions control programs over the past decade. In contrast to PM0.1, PM1.8 OC had a higher fraction of unidentified source contributions (68-85%) suggesting that this material is composed of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) or primary organic aerosol (POA) that has been processed by atmospheric chemical reactions. Meat cooking was the largest identified source of PM1.8 organic carbon (OC) at the Fresno site (12-13%) while diesel engines were the largest identified PM1.8 OC source at the rural site (5-8%). Wood burning contributions to PM1.8 OC increased during the wintertime at both sites (6-9%) but were relatively small during the summertime (∼1%).As expected, diesel engines were the dominant source of PM0.1 EC respiratory deposition at both the urban and rural site in both summer and winter (0.01-0.03 μg PM0.1 EC deposited per m3 air inhaled). Meat cooking accounted for 0.01-0.025 μg PM0.1 OC deposited per m3 air inhaled while diesel fuel accounted for 0.005-0.013 μg PM0.1 OC deposited per m3 air inhaled. Minor contributions from wood burning, motor oil, and gasoline fuel were calculated at levels &lt;0.005 μg PM0.1 OC deposited per m3 air inhaled at both urban and rural locations during winter and summer seasons. If the burden of PM0.1 deposited in the respiratory system is relevant for human health effects, then future toxicology studies should be carried out at PM0.1 concentrations and source mixtures equivalent to those measured in the current study. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CMB; MOUDI; PM0.1; San Joaquin Valley; Ultrafine particles","Air basins; Airborne particulate matters; Atmospheric chemical reaction; California; Carbonaceous particulate matter; Chemical mass balance; CMB; Emissions control; Gasoline fuels; Human health effects; Human respiratory system; Molecular marker; Motor oil; MOUDI; Multiple-path; Organic aerosol; Particle diameters; Rural locations; Rural site; Sampling location; San Joaquin Valley; Secondary organic aerosols; Size fraction; Source apportionment; Source contributions; Summer months; Summer season; Ultrafine; Ultrafine particle; Urban site; Winter seasons; Wood burning; Wood smoke; Atmospheric aerosols; Cell membranes; Cytology; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engines; Health; Landforms; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Respiratory mechanics; Respiratory system; Smoke abatement; Thermal processing (foods); Wood; Particles (particulate matter); carbon; air quality; biomass burning; diesel engine; emission control; health risk; mass balance; particle size; particulate matter; public health; respiratory disease; rural area; toxicology; urban site; air pollution; airborne particle; ambient air; article; atmosphere; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; cooking; diesel engine; dosimetry; exhaust gas; meat; particle size; particulate matter; primary organic aerosol; priority journal; rural area; secondary organic aerosol; smoke; summer; United States; urban area; winter; wood; Aerosols; California; Carbon; Cells; Cytology; Diesel Engines; Engines; Fuels; Health; Membranes; Particles; Particulate Emissions; Respiration; Smoke; Wood; California; San Joaquin Valley; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80955181102

Additionally, children in diesel-powered school buses may be exposed to higher levels of particulates and other pollutants than children in cars. One solution to emission and fuel concerns is use of hybrid-electric school buses, which have the potential to reduce emissions and overall lifecycle costs compared with conventional diesel buses. Hybridelectric technologies are available in the passenger vehicle market as well as the transit bus market and have a track record indicating fuel economy and emissions benefits. This paper summarizes the results of an in-use fuel economy evaluation for two plug-in hybrid school buses deployed in two different school districts in Iowa. Each school district selected a control bus with a route similar to that of the hybrid bus. Odometer readings, fuel consumption, and maintenance needs were recorded for each bus. The buses were deployed in 2008 and data were collected through May 2010. Fuel consumption was calculated for each school district. In Nevada, IA, the overall average fuel economy was 8.23 mpg for the hybrid and 6.35 mpg for the control bus. In Sigourney, IA, the overall average fuel economy was 8.94 mpg for the hybrid and 6.42 mpg for the control bus. The fuel consumption data were compared for the hybrid and control buses using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results indicate that fuel economy for the Nevada hybrid bus was 29.6% better than for the Nevada control bus, and fuel economy for the Sigourney hybrid bus was 39.2% higher than for the Sigourney control bus.

Devising policies for sustainable use and allocation of limited water resources is made difficult by substantial population growth, degrading environmental quality and uncertainty regarding possible changes in water availability due to climate change. We use the Water Resources Evaluation and Planning software to evaluate water needs and scarcity for three case study areas in Yemen representing different ecological conditions (Sana'a, Sadah, and Aden City) under a range of scenarios that include potential climate change and adaptation strategies. These management strategies, identified by stakeholder processes, have the potential to reduce vulnerability and build resilience. The modelled results suggest that current and predicted patterns of water consumption will soon fully deplete available supplies, and are a bigger driver of vulnerability than potential climate change for the region. In the absence of new strategies to bring into balance water supply and demand patterns, results for all three case studies suggest the pressing water crisis will only worsen.

To evaluate the sustainability of these projects, a solar plant and wind power project on Con Co Island, Quang Tri province, Vietnam is taken as a case study. The analytic hierarchy process and multi-criteria assessment are applied as the main measurement instruments. Scenario I provides the sustainability scores of composite sustainable development index (ICSD: 0.509) for the solar plant and for the wind plant (ICSD: 0.490). In Scenario II both power projects score high (the solar plant ICSD: 0.86 and the wind power ICSD: 0.838). The multi-indicator assessment allows evaluating the two projects on the island. The results of this study indicated that, these projects help to reduce the environmental pollution and improve the local life.

Predicted future impacts vary by region, but all are projected to suffer productivity declines by the late twenty-first century unless successful mitigation measures are implemented soon. Exacerbating the climate change challenge, doubling of overall crop productivity will be required by mid-century. Clearly, crop protection will become increasingly difficult as higher-yielding varieties present a larger and more tempting target to all pests, and the pests themselves extend their ranges poleward and into other new geographies owing to reduced winter kill and longer growing seasons. Fortunately, good progress on enhancing crop protection technology to meet these challenges is already being made, but the scope of this climatic provocation is such that complacency is not an option.

In this paper, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to evaluate the carbon emission performance of 29 Chinese provincial administrative regions (Tibet and Taiwan are not included since of data lack) by computing potential carbon emission reductions for energy conservation technology (ECT) and energy structural adjustment (ESA). The results reveal that ECT promotion and reductions in inter-regional technological disparity would be effective in reducing carbon emissions in technically inefficient regions. However, most of the provincial administrative regions investigated have an irrational energy structure and exhibit an overdependence on coal consumption, so ESA is required to reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, enormous emission reductions could be achieved by promoting ECT, developing renewable energy, increasing the proportion of non-fossil energy, delivering low-carbon energy and applying ESA. Based on the estimation, some policy implications and suitable suggestions are proposed for policy makers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy conservation technology; Environmental DEA; Potential carbon emission reduction","Carbon emissions; Coal consumption; Conservation technologies; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Energy structures; Environmental DEA; Fossil energy; Low-carbon; Policy implications; Policy makers; Potential carbon emission reduction; Potential reduction; Renewable energies; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission inventory; energy conservation; energy policy; performance assessment; policy approach; policy strategy; renewable resource; structural adjustment; technology adoption; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953317011

In the present study we report that Milan winter-PM2.5 inhibited proliferation in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) by inducing mitotic arrest. The cell cycle arrest was followed by an increase in mitotic-apoptotic cells, mitotic slippage and finally an increase in ""classical"" apoptotic cells. Exposure to winter-PM10 induced only a slight effect which may be due to the presence of PM2.5 in this fraction while pure combustion particles failed to disturb mitosis. Fewer cells expressing the mitosis marker phospho-histone H3 compared to cells with condensed chromosomes, suggest that PM2.5 induced premature mitosis. PM2.5 was internalized into the cells and often localized in laminar organelles, although particles without apparent plasma membrane covering were also seen. In PM-containing cells mitochondria and lysosomes were often damaged, and in mitotic cells fragmented chromosomes often appeared. PM2.5 induced DNA strands breaks and triggered a DNA-damage response characterized by increased phosphorylation of ATM, Chk2 and H2AX; as well as induced a marked increase in expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-regulated genes, CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and AhRR. Furthermore, some disturbance of the organization of microtubules was indicated. It is hypothesized that the induced mitotic arrest and following cell death was due to a premature chromosome condensation caused by a combination of DNA, mitochondrial and spindle damage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Apoptosis; Cell death; DNA-damage; Mitotic arrest; Particulate matter","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; ATM protein; checkpoint kinase 2; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1B1; histone H2AX; airborne particle; article; cell cycle arrest; cell damage; cell death; cell membrane; cell organelle; cell proliferation; cell viability; chromosome; combustion; controlled study; DNA damage; DNA fragmentation; gene expression regulation; histone phosphorylation; human; human cell; internalization; mitosis inhibition; mitosis spindle; particulate matter; priority journal; protein binding; protein phosphorylation; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; DNA Damage; Humans; Lung; Mitochondria; Mitosis; Mitotic Spindle Apparatus; Particulate Matter; Repressor Proteins; Respiratory Mucosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960286112

As quality and quantity of root exudates are dependent on plant genotype, the genetic engineering of plants might also influence carbon partitioning within the plant and thus microbial rhizosphere community structure. In this study, the carbon allocation patterns within the plant-rhizosphere system of a genetically modified amylopectin-accumulating potato line (Solanum tuberosum L.) were linked to microbial degraders of root exudates under greenhouse conditions, using 13C-CO2 pulse-chase labelling in combination with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. In addition, GM plants were compared with the parental cultivar as well as a second potato cultivar obtained by classical breeding. Rhizosphere samples were obtained during young leaf developmental and flowering stages. 13C allocation in aboveground plant biomass, water-extractable organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and PLFA as well as the microbial community structure in the rhizosphere varied significantly between the natural potato cultivars. However, no differences between the GM line and its parental cultivar were observed. Besides the considerable impact of plant cultivar, the plant developmental stage affected carbon partitioning via the plant into the rhizosphere and, subsequently, microbial communities involved in the transformation of root exudates. © 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.","13C labelling; Carbon partitioning; Genetically modified potato plants; Microbial biomass; Phospholipid fatty acid analysis; Rhizosphere","amylopectin; carbon; fatty acid; phospholipid; biomass; carbon; cultivar; exudation; fatty acid; genetic engineering; genetically modified organism; microbial community; photosynthetically active radiation; potato; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; article; bacterium; biomass; carbohydrate metabolism; chemistry; crop; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; plant exudate; plant root; potato; rhizosphere; soil; transgenic plant; Amylopectin; Bacteria; Biomass; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Crops, Agricultural; Fatty Acids; Phospholipids; Plant Exudates; Plant Roots; Plants, Genetically Modified; Rhizosphere; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Solanum tuberosum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955643647

More information is needed on transgenerational effects of global change on plants and their interactions with pathogens. The current study assessed potential maternal effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on performance and disease susceptibility of first-generation offspring of the Mediterranean legume Onobrychis crista-galli. Mother plants were grown at three CO2 concentrations, and the study focused on their offspring that were raised under common ambient climate and CO2. In addition, progeny were exposed to natural infection by the fungal pathogen powdery mildew. In one out of 3 years, offspring of high-CO2 treatments (440 and 600 ppm) had lower shoot biomass and reproductive output than offspring of low-CO2 treatment (280 ppm). Disease severity in a heavy-infection year was higher in high-CO2 than in low-CO2 offspring. However, some of the findings on maternal effects changed when the population was divided into two functionally diverging plant types distinguishable by flower color (pink, Type P; white, Type W). Disease severity in a heavy-infection year was higher in high-CO2 than in low-CO2 progeny in the more disease-resistant (Type P), but not in the more susceptible plant type (Type W). In a low-infection year, maternal CO2 treatments did not differ in disease severity. Mother plants of Type P exposed to low CO2 produced larger seeds than all other combinations of CO2 and plant type, which might contribute to higher offspring performance. This study showed that elevated CO2 potentially exerts environmental maternal effects on performance of progeny and, notably, also on their susceptibility to natural infection by a pathogen. Maternal effects of global change might differently affect functionally divergent plant types, which could impact population fitness and alter plant communities. © 2011 Grünzweig.","Biomass production; Environmental maternal effects; Fungal pathogen; Natural population; Onobrychis crista-galli; Plant disease; Plant type",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858339064

Rising temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation will cause substantial changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment, which will then affect the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in ways that we are only beginning to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect organisms and biogeochemical cycles directly, but will also increase upper ocean stratification. The changes in the ocean's carbonate chemistry induced by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e. ocean acidification) will probably affect many organisms and processes, although in ways that are currently not well understood. Ocean deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved oxygen (O2) from the ocean, is bound to occur in a warming and more stratified ocean, causing stress to macro-organisms that critically depend on sufficient levels of oxygen. These three stressors-warming, acidification and deoxygenation-will tend to operate globally, although with distinct regional differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be strongest in the high latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen regions of the low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation. Specific regions, such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems, will be strongly affected by all three stressors, making them potential hotspots for change. Of additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude of the organic matter exported to the ocean's interior, which then might cause substantial changes in the oxygen concentration there. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation are essentially irreversible on centennial time scales, i.e. once these changes have occurred, it will take centuries for the ocean to recover. With the emission of CO2 being the primary driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation strategy is to reduce these emissions. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Deoxygenation; Ocean acidification; Ocean carbon cycle; Ocean oxygen cycle; Ocean warming","Deoxygenations; Ocean acidification; Ocean carbon cycle; Ocean oxygen cycle; Ocean warming; Acidification; Biogeochemistry; Biology; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Dissolved oxygen; Ecosystems; Oceanography; carbon dioxide; oxygen; sea water; article; chemistry; climate change; greenhouse effect; pH; sea; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Global Warming; Greenhouse Effect; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Oceans and Seas; Oxygen; Seawater",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957601139

Estimates of the magnitude of these effects derive largely from cross sectional comparisons of adjusted mortality rates among cities with varying pollution levels. Such estimates are potentially confounded by other differences among the populations correlated with air pollution, for example, socioeconomic factors. An alternative approach is to study covariation of particulate matter and mortality across time within a city, as has been done in investigations of short-term exposures. In either event, observational studies like these are subject to confounding by unmeasured variables. Therefore the ability to detect such confounding and to derive estimates less affected by confounding are a high priority. In this article, we describe and apply a method of decomposing the exposure variable into components with variation at distinct temporal, spatial, and time by space scales, here focusing on the components involving time. Starting from a proportional hazard model, we derive a Poisson regression model and estimate two regression coefficients: the ""global"" coefficient that measures the association between national trends in pollution and mortality; and the ""local"" coefficient, derived from space by time variation, that measures the association between location-specific trends in pollution and mortality adjusted by the national trends. Absent unmeasured confounders and given valid model assumptions, the scale-specific coefficients should be similar; substantial differences in these coefficients constitute a basis for questioning the model. We derive a backfitting algorithm to fit our model to very large spatio-temporal datasets. We apply our methods to the Medicare Cohort Air Pollution Study (MCAPS), which includes individual-level information on time of death and age on a population of 18.2 million for the period 2000-2006. Results based on the global coefficient indicate a large increase in the national life expectancy for reductions in the yearly national average of PM2.5. However, this coefficient based on national trends in PM2.5 and mortality is likely to be confounded by other variables trending on the national level. Confounding of the local coefficient by unmeasured factors is less likely, although it cannot be ruled out. Based on the local coefficient alone, we are not able to demonstrate any change in life expectancy for a reduction in PM2.5.We use additional survey data available for a subset of the data to investigate sensitivity of results to the inclusion of additional covariates, but both coefficients remain largely unchanged. © 2011 American Statistical Association.","Backfitting algorithm; Environmental epidemiology; Particulate matter; Spatio-temporal data; Specification test",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960133777

We then briefly discuss how economists think about environmental enforcement. We next consider recent empirical evidence linking regulator actions to subsequent pollution discharges and compliance behavior. Since the literature primarily studies U.S. institutions, our review focuses mainly on the effects of Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. state activities. The consistent findings from this literature review are as follows: (1) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate substantial specific deterrence, reducing future violations at the targeted firm; (2) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate substantial general deterrence, reducing future violations at facilities other than the targeted one; and (3) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate not only reductions in violations but also significant reductions in emissions.

Such largescale management interventions, however, tend to entail the risks of unintended consequences, and we propose that three conditions should be met before implementing assisted migration in reforestation programs: (1) evidence of a climate-related adaptational lag, (2) observed biological impacts, and (3) robust model projections to target assisted migration efforts. In a case study of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux.) we use reciprocal transplant experiments to study adaptation of tree populations to local environments. Second, we monitor natural aspen populations using the MODIS enhanced vegetation index as a proxy for forest health and productivity. Last, we report results from bioclimate envelope models that predict suitable habitat for locally adapted genotypes under observed and predicted climate change. The combined results support assisted migration prescriptions and indicate that the risk of inaction likely exceeds the risk associated with changing established management practices. However, uncertainty in model projections also implies that we are restricted to a relatively short 20-year planning horizon for prescribing seed movement in reforestation programs. We believe that this study exemplifies a safe and realistic climate change adaptation strategy based on multiple sources of information and some understanding of the uncertainty associated with recommendations for assisted migration. Ad hoc migration prescriptions without a similar level of supporting information should be avoided in reforestation programs. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bioclimate envelope modeling; Climate change; Ecological genetics; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Seed transfer guidelines; Seed zones","adaptive management; bioclimatology; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; deciduous tree; forest health; forestry production; guideline; MODIS; movement; reforestation; remote sensing; adaptation; article; aspen; Canada; climate change; demography; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; physiology; plant seed; remote sensing; theoretical model; tree; Adaptation, Physiological; Canada; Climate Change; Demography; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Populus; Remote Sensing Technology; Seeds; Trees; Canada; Populus tremuloides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960354227

Literature covering six main impact sectors is reviewed: sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal impacts, ocean acidification, ecosystems and biodiversity, water resources and desertification, agriculture and food security, and human health. The review focuses on studies with a global perspective to climate change impacts assessment, although in the absence of global studies for some sectors or aspects of impacts, national and regional studies are cited. The review highlights three major emerging themes which are of importance for the policy- and decision-making process: (1) a movement towards probabilistic methods of impacts assessment and/or the consideration of climate modelling uncertainty; (2) a move towards assessing potential impacts that could be avoided under different climate change mitigation scenarios relative to a business-as-usual reference scenario; and (3) uncertainties that remain in understanding the relationship between climate and natural or human systems. Whether recent impact assessments show a changed risk of damage to human or natural systems since the AR4 depends upon the impact sector; whether the assessments are robust or not (i.e. will stand the test of time) requires additional expert judgement. However, using this judgement, overall we find an increased risk to natural systems, and in some components of human systems. © The Author(s) 2011.","agriculture; climate change impacts; ecosystems; health; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); ocean acidification; sea-level rise; water resources","acidification; biodiversity; climate change; decision making; desertification; ecosystem response; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; food security; global change; global perspective; health impact; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; resource scarcity; sea level change; water resource",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958200044

Based on the dynamic global vegetation modelling, vulnerable forested regions of India have been identified to assist in planning adaptation interventions. The assessment of climate impacts showed that at the national level, about 45% of the forested grids is projected to undergo change. Vulnerability assessment showed that such vulnerable forested grids are spread across India. However, their concentration is higher in the upper Himalayan stretches, parts of Central India, northern Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats. In contrast, the northeastern forests, southern Western Ghats and the forested regions of eastern India are estimated to be the least vulnerable. Low tree density, low biodiversity status as well as higher levels of fragmentation, in addition to climate change, contribute to the vulnerability of these forests. The mountainous forests (sub-alpine and alpine forest, the Himalayan dry temperate forest and the Himalayan moist temperate forest) are susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change. This is because climate change is predicted to be larger for regions that have greater elevations.","Climate change; Forest ecosystems; Impacts; Net primary productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053295711

Twenty representative ceramic industries from the greatest ceramic production sites in Andalusia were selected. These industries produce more than 75t of building ceramic materials per day and are affected by the commercial emissions system. Raw materials, fired products, and their corresponding unfired products (""green bodies"") were studied by XRD. The overall amount of carbon content was determined by elemental microanalysis. CO2 from carbonates and organic matter was evaluated by calcimetry and the Walkley and Black (1934) method. In most of the brick industries, CO2 emissions are produced by carbonates decomposition because the raw materials they use generally contain high amounts of these minerals (up to 50%). Sometimes, raw materials such as sericitic shales and white-firing grey-black clays (""kaolinitic"" clays) are used in the production of pavements and facings. In these cases, CO2 emissions usually come from the destruction of the organic matter (up to 4%). The CO2 content obtained by elemental analysis and calcimetry, had a reasonably high correlation (r=0.98), except for the shale samples and other raw materials with organic matter.On the basis of CO2 emissions, other than those coming from fuel combustion, there are three types of ceramic factories in Andalusia: a) factories that release &lt;5% of CO2 emission. They manufacture special products and do not use raw materials containing carbonates, b) factories that release between 5-10% of CO2 emission. The content of carbonate in the raw material they use ranges between 20-30%. In this case, the amount of CO2 produced should be controlled in order to evaluate how dangerous the emissions are, c) factories releasing above 10% of CO2 emission. They are factories that use marls from Neogene sediments of the Guadalquivir Basin, containing carbonate &gt;30%, and even up to 50%. The amount of CO2 produced should be evaluated in order to avoid emissions, which could constitute a serious environmental problem.Studies like these ones applied to Andalusia may be implemented in other Spanish regions and European countries to evaluate the CO2 emissions by ceramic industries. This type of CO2 emission is not negligible in relation to the overall CO2 emission of the industries of any country. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Brick factories; CO2; CO2 determination; Emission","Andalusia; Brick industry; Building ceramics; Carbon content; Ceramic industries; Ceramic production; CO2; CO2 determination; Elemental analysis; Elemental microanalysis; Emission; European Countries; Fuel combustion; Green body; Neo genes; Organic matter; Southern Spain; XRD; Anoxic sediments; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Brick; Brickmaking; Carbonates; Fuels; Industry; Organic compounds; Rating; Shale; Ceramic materials; carbon emission; carbonate; ceramics; decomposition; organic matter; X-ray diffraction; Andalucia; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955145986

This district consumes a considerable amount of energy and wants to reduce 80% of the CO2-emissions by 2025. The easy to implement measures to reduce the CO2-emission have already taken place, meaning that more drastic measures are necessary, while the solutions are not only found within the buildings themselves. Besides reduction of the energy demand, 10 percent of the electricity production will be realised with photovoltaic cells and small wind turbines. The remaining electricity and heat demand will be generated from biomass. The plans for the energy supply of XperienceParkstad are elaborated in an energy vision for the district [2]. Further research into the possibilities for a CO2-neutral energy supply with biomass, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is done by Cauberg-Huygen Consulting Engineers in Maastricht [3]. Although we try to solve the energy supply CO2-neutral, this does not mean that it is an optimal solution from an exergetic point of view. Biomass resources are limited and should be used as effectively as possible. Exergetic considerations play an important role in the search for optimal solutions of the energy supply for the Xperience Parkstad district. The idea behind the exergy approach is to use the available energy flow as effectively as possible, by matching the quality of the required energy, as much as possible to the quality of energy available. To maximise the use of biomass i.e. apart from energy conversion, energy storage and transport is an important aspect for the design of the energy supply, as will be explained subsequently in the paper. By taking advantage of the local potentials, existing energy networks in the area and the old mine galleries can be developed, optimising the use of biomass as an energy source. The local situation provides old mine shafts that are filled with water. They could be used for cooling and storage of residual heat. This paper describes the plan and considerations invoved in the search for exergetic design solutions for a sustainable energy supply in the region Parkstad, which goes beyond solutions on the building level and the district Xperience Parkstad. © 2011 SUSB Press.

The methodology and model mainly focus on describing a complex system of LCS options and the consistency of their schedule. Other aspects such as the costs of LCS measures, stock dynamics of technologies, and effects of economic instruments are not explicitly considered. To permit quantitative treatment of various types of options, they are classified into several categories. The BCM calculates the schedule of the options under given quantitative information on the options and relationships between them. The methodology and model were applied to Kyoto City as an example. First, a quantitative snapshot of socioeconomic status and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was described. In the snapshot, a 45% reduction of GHG emissions compared with 1990 was achieved with moderate economic growth. The BCM was applied to about 130 options shown in an action plan of the Kyoto Municipal Government, and a schedule of the options was calculated.

It has also become more difficult to hide and more expensive. Globally, this has caused many enterprises to put all their efforts into seeking management instruments that allow them to reduce their negative impact on the environment as well as improving their economic efficiency. This environmental interest is either voluntary or forced by customers or by legal pressure. Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) are among the many tools that have appeared to fulfil that goal and that have drawn international researchers' attention. The most popular system and the one most often used is the ISO 14001 standard. This paper examines empirically the influence that this certification exerts on the company's pollutant emission policy. The analysis was carried out in four regions of Spain: Asturias, Cantabria, Galicia and Castilla-León and includes 126 industrial organisations. The goal of this paper is to investigate the behaviour of the companies according to their emissions policies once they have achieved the ISO 14001 certification. In the paper the Toxics Release Index of 56 certified companies is compared with the Index of 70 non-certified companies. Through a statistical analysis based on the Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test, it was concluded that ISO 14001 does not represent an environmental proactivity signal clearly enough to result in a reduction of the company's environmental polluting index. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Chemiluminescence, high-speed photography, schlieren and Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV), have been used to study the changes in the flame/vortex interactions as well as the flame flickering frequency and magnitude by the co-flow air. Four cases of methane flow rates at different co-flow air velocities are investigated. It has been observed that the flame dynamics and stability of co-flow diffusion flames are strongly affected by the co-flow air velocity. When the co-flow velocity has reached a certain value the buoyancy driven flame oscillation was completely suppressed. The schlieren and PIV imaging have revealed that the co-flow of air is able to push the initiation point of the outer toroidal vortices beyond the visible flame to create a very steady laminar flow region in the reaction zone. Then the buoyancy driven instability is only effective in the plume of hot gases above the visible flame. It is observed that a higher co-flow rate is needed in order to suppress the flame flickering at a higher fuel flow rate. Therefore the ratio of the air velocity to the fuel velocity, γ, is a stability controlling parameter. The velocity ratio, γ, was found to be 0.72 for the range of tested flow rates.

The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway consists of two branches connected by the Co/Fe-containing corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CoFeSP), which transfers a methyl group from a methyltransferase (MeTr)/methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4 folate) complex to the reduced Ni-Ni-[4Fe-4S] cluster (cluster A) of acetyl-CoA synthase. We investigated the CoFeSP and MeTr couple of the hydrogenogenic bacterium Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans and show that the two proteins are able to catalyze the methyl-group transfer reaction from CH3-H 4 folate to the Co(I) center of CoFeSP. We determined the crystal structures of both proteins. The structure of CoFeSP includes the previously unresolved N-terminal domain of the large subunit of CoFeSP, revealing a unique four-helix-bundle-like architecture in which a [4Fe-4S] cluster is shielded by hydrophobic amino acids. It further reveals that the corrinoid and the [4Fe-4S] cluster binding domains are mobile, which is mandatory for the postulated electron transfer between them. Furthermore, we solved the crystal structures of apo-MeTr, CH3-H4-folate-bound MeTr, and H 4-folate-bound MeTr, revealing a substrate-induced closure of the CH3-H4 folate binding cavity of MeTr. We observed three different conformations of Asn200 depending on the substrate bound in the active site, demonstrating its conformational modulation by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the substrate. The observed flexibility could be essential to stabilize the transition state during methyl-group transfer. The conformational space and role of Asn200 are likely conserved in homologous cobalamin-dependent MeTrs such as methionine synthase. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, satellite technological advances require time to move towards a state of operational readiness for monitoring and reporting; for example, in the case of forest cover and associated carbon stock (biomass) and their changes through time. In this article, we provide an overview of the current status of forest monitoring using satellites and we explore new technologies that are already revolutionizing the way that forest carbon is measured. In particular, we focus on the capabilities of light detection and ranging (LiDAR), noting the opportunities and also the challenges that arise in moving technologies from those flown on aircraft to earth orbiting satellites.

In particular, the high liver uptake can interfere in the interpretation of the inferior myocardial wall. Within the tricarbonyl approach, we used tris(pyrazolyl)methane 99mTc organometallic complexes as a lead structure. Herein we present the production, in vivo and in vitro metabolic studies in rats and the first in vivo biodistribution in rats for tri-methoxy-tris-pyrazolyl- 99mTc-(CO) 3 ( 99mTc-TMEOP), compared with 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc-tetrofosmin. Methods: The chemical identity of 99mTc-TMEOP was characterized by RP-HPLC. The octanol-water partition coefficient was determined under physiological conditions. In vitro stability and protein binding were determined using RP-HPLC. In vivo stability was determined in blood, heart, liver and kidney homogenates, intestine and urine using RP-HPLC. In vivo biodistribution was determined using dynamic planar acquisitions. Pinhole gated SPECT images were performed in other animals. Cardiac, liver and lung uptake were expressed as differential uptake ratios by drawing regions of interest in the organs of interest and around the total body. Heart-liver and heart-lung ratios were derived. Cardiac uptake was also expressed as percentage of injected activity. SPECT images were processed to determine the heart-liver ratio on SPECT images, to compare functional parameters between different tracers and to visualize homogeneous intracardiac tracer distribution. Results: 99mTc-TMEOP is a moderately lipophilic cation, is stable and does not undergo any transformation in vitro. 99mTc-TMEOP also shows a high in vivo stability. In vivo imaging shows liver kinetics faster than those of 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc-tetrofosmin. Cardiac uptake and functional analysis of pinhole gated SPECT data are comparable to those of 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc-tetrofosmin. Conclusion: Although 99mTc-TMEOP shows a cardiac uptake between those of 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc-tetrofosmin, a better heart-liver ratio is obtained due to the faster liver washout. These results suggest possible faster cardiac perfusion imaging using 99mTc-TMEOP without liver activity interference. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Heart-liver ratio, biodistribution; Myocardial perfusion imaging; Small animal; Tracer development","methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; octanol; technetium 99m; technetium tri methoxy tris pyrazolyl 99m; tetrofosmin; tetrofosmin tc 99m; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; drug clearance; drug distribution; drug structure; drug uptake; heart; image analysis; in vivo study; kidney; liver; liver clearance; lung; male; myocardial perfusion imaging; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; radiochemistry; rat; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; single photon emission computer tomography; Animals; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Liver; Male; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Organotechnetium Compounds; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rats, Wistar; Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051945093

The carbon balance of soils may be more sensitive to the impact of such extremes than to homogeneously distributed changes in soil temperature (Ts) or soil water content (θs). One parameter influenced by more pronounced drying/rewetting cycles or increases in Ts is the wettability of soils. Results from laboratory and field studies showed that low θs, particularly in combination with high Ts can increase soil water repellency (SWR). Recent studies have provided evidence that the stability of soil organic matter (SOM) against microbial decomposition is substantially enhanced in water repellent soils. This review hypothesizes that SWR is an important SOM stabilization mechanism that could become more important because of the increase in extreme events. We discuss wettability-induced changes in soil moisture distribution and in soil aggregate turnover as the main mechanisms explaining the reduced mineralization of SOM with increasing SWR. The creation of preferential flow paths and subsequent uneven penetration of rainwater may cause a long-term reduction of soil water availability, affecting both microorganisms and plants. We conclude that climate change-induced SWR may intensify the effects of climatic drought and thus affects ecosystem processes such as SOM decomposition and plant productivity, as well as changes in vegetation and microbial community structure. Future research on biosphere-climate interactions should consider the effects of increasing SWR on soil moisture and subsequently on both microbial activity and plant productivity, which ultimately determine the overall carbon balance. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aggregate stability; Carbon cycle; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Extreme climatic events; Hydrophobicity; Microbial respiration; Soil organic matter; Soil water repellency; Substrate availability","biosphere; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; community structure; drought; microbial activity; microbial community; microorganism; mineralization; soil moisture; soil temperature; soil water; wettability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959922311

Using logic programming we present a comprehensive and adaptative mathematical model to study the impact of folate deficiency, including folate transport and enzymes activities. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5mTHF) uptake and DNA and dUMP methylation were studied by simulating nutritional 5mTHF deficiency and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene defects. Both conditions had distinct effects on 1CM metabolite synthesis. Simulating severe 5mTHF deficiency (25% of normal levels) modulated 11 metabolites. However, simulating a severe decrease in MTHFR activity (25% of normal activity) modulated another set of metabolites. Two oscillations of varying amplitude were observed at the steady state for DNA methylation with severe 5mTHF deficiency, and the dUMP/dTMP ratio reached a steady state after 2 h, compared to 2.5 h for 100% 5mTHF. MTHFR activity with 25% of V max resulted in an increased methylated DNA pool after half an hour. We observed a deviation earlier in the profile compared to 50% and 100% V max. For dUMP methylation, the highest level was observed with 25%, suggesting a low rate of dUMP methylation into dTMP with 25% of MTHFR activity. In conclusion, using logic programming we were able to construct the 1CM for analyzing the dynamic system behavior.

Characterization of porosity was determined by N 2/77 K adsorption isotherms. Simple pyrolysis at 500 °C yields low adsorbing carbons of meso-/macroporous character, whereas steam activation of these chars at 850 °C enhances porosity, in micropores, to a limited extent. Chemical activation with H3PO4 at 500 °C exerts the best recommending influence in producing high adsorbing carbons with evenly distributed porosity within micro-mesopore ranges. It was found that phosphoric acid activation of the studied precursors enhanced the yield, surface area and pore volume; 32-46%, 437-1022 m2/g and 0.444-0.809, respectively, as compared to other treatments. The capacity to remove methylene blue, in single bottle experiments, complements the state of porosity deduced from the gas phase adsorption of N2. Peanut shells proved the best feasible raw material under all treatment processes, whereas lupine seeds and sunflower seed hulls show relatively the least affected. Dye removal capacity was enhanced by carbon mesoporosity, whereas adversely affected by its increased surface pH and ash content was observed.

Adjustment between reproductive phenology and environment is expected to be higher in arctic and alpine habitats because the growing season is considerably short. As early- and late-flowering species reproduce under very different environmental conditions, selective pressures on flowering phenology and potential effects of climate change are likely to differ between them. However, there is no agreement on the magnitude of the benefits and costs of early- vs. late-flowering species under a global warming scenario. In spite of its relevance, phenotypic selection on flowering phenology has rarely been explored in alpine plants and never in Mediterranean high mountain species, where selective pressures are very different due to the summer drought imposed over the short growth season. We hypothesized that late-flowering plants in Mediterranean mountains should present stronger selective pressures towards early onset of reproduction than early-flowering species, because less water is available in the soil as growing season progresses. We performed selection analyses on flowering onset and duration in two high mountain species of contrasting phenology. Since phenotypic selection can be highly context-dependent, we studied several populations of each species for 2 years, covering their local altitudinal ranges and their different microhabitats. Surrogates of biotic selective agents, like fruitset for pollinators and flower and fruit loss for flower and seed predators, were included in the analysis. Differences between the early- and the late-flowering species were less than expected. A consistent negative correlational selection of flowering onset and duration was found affecting plant fitness, i.e., plants that bloomed earlier flowered for longer periods improving plant fitness. Nevertheless, the late-flowering species may experience higher risks under climate warming because in extremely warm and dry years the earlier season does not bring about a longer flowering duration due to summer drought. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Alpine plants; Altitudinal gradients; Flowering phenology; Phenotypic selection","Magnoliophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862532835

Due to the hydrophilic and polar nature of nucleosides, down-scaling C18 analytical methods to a two-column nano-flow setup is inherently difficult. We present a nanochip LC/MS ion-trap strategy for routine characterization of RNA nucleosides in the fmol range. Nucleosides were analyzed in positive ion mode by reverse phase chromatography using a 75 μ×150 mm, 5 μ particle porous graphitic carbon (PGC) chip with an integrated 9 mm, 160 nL trapping column. Nucleosides were separated using a formic acid/acetonitrile gradient. The method was able to separate isobaric nucleosides as well as nucleosides with isotopic overlap to allow unambiguous MS n identification on a low resolution ion-trap. Synthesis of 5-hydroxycytidine (oh 5C) was achieved from 5-hydroxyuracil in a novel three-step enzymatic process. When operated in its native state using formic acid/acetonitrile, PGC oxidized oh 5C to its corresponding glycols and formic acid conjugates. Reduction of the PGC stationary phase was achieved by flushing the chip with 2.5 mM oxalic acid and adding 1 mM oxalic acid to the online solvents. Analyzed under reduced chromatographic conditions oh 5C was readily identified by its MH + m/z 260 and MS n fragmentation pattern. This investigation is, to our knowledge, the first instance where oxalic acid has been used as an online reducing agent for LC/MS. The method was subsequently used for complete characterization of nucleosides found in tRNAs using both PGC and C18 chips. © American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 2011.","Nano-chip ion-trap LC/MS n; Nucleosides; Porous graphitic carbon; tRNA","Analytical method; Chromatographic conditions; Down-scaling; Enzymatic process; Fragmentation patterns; Ion traps; Low resolution; Modified nucleosides; Nano-chip ion-trap LC/MS n; Native state; Nucleosides; Oxalic Acid; Porous graphitic carbon; Positive ion mode; Reverse phase chromatography; Ribonucleosides; Stationary phase; Stationary phasis; Trapping column; tRNA; Acetonitrile; Carbon; Characterization; Formic acid; Glycols; Ions; Liquid chromatography; Methanol; Organic acids; Porous materials; RNA; Silica; Biomolecules; 5 hydroxycytidine; 5 hydroxyuracil; acetonitrile; carbon; cytidine derivative; formic acid; glycol; graphitic carbon; oxalic acid; ribonucleoside; unclassified drug; uracil derivative; article; ion trap mass spectrometry; liquid chromatography; nanochip; nucleic acid analysis; online system; porosity; reversed phase liquid chromatography; Chromatography, Reverse-Phase; Graphite; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Nucleosides; Oxalic Acid; Particle Size; Porosity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959947621

These reactions are performed in a supersonic nozzle expansion characterized by a rotational temperature of 40 ± 5K. For the N 2+ + CH4 reaction, a BR of 0.83:0.17 is obtained for the dissociative charge-transfer (CT) reaction that gives rise to the formation of CH3+ and CH2+ product ions, respectively. The N2+ + C2H 2 ion-molecule reaction proceeds through a nondissociative CT process that results in the sole formation of C2H2+ product ions. The reaction of N2+ with C2H 4 leads to the formation of C2H3+ and C2H2+ product ions with a BR of 0.74:0.26, respectively. The reported BR for the N2+ + C 2H4 reaction is supportive of a nonresonant dissociative CT mechanism similar to the one that accompanies the N2+ + CH4 reaction. No dependence of the branching ratios on N 2+ rotational level was observed. In addition to providing direct insight into the dynamics of the state-prepared N2 + ion-molecule reactions with the target neutral hydrocarbon molecules, the reported low-temperature BRs are also important for accurate modeling of the nitrogen-dominated upper atmosphere of Saturn's moon, Titan. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Accurate modeling; Branching ratio; Hydrocarbon molecules; Ion imaging; Ion-molecule reaction; Low temperature reactions; Low temperatures; Nonresonant; Product branching ratios; Rotational levels; Rotational temperature; Saturn's moons; Supersonic nozzles; Acetylene; Charge transfer; Computerized tomography; Dissociation; Ethylene; High energy physics; Ions; Methane; Molecules; Nozzles; Upper atmosphere; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959560350

In this paper the effect of wood fuel properties, combustion condition, and flue gas cleaning system on variation in the amount and formation of particles in the flue gas of typical district heating wood boilers are discussed based on the literature survey. Direct measurements of particulate matter (PM) emissions from wood boilers with district heating applications are reviewed and presented. Finally, recommendations are given regarding the selection of wood fuel, combustion system condition, and flue gas cleaning system in district heating systems in order to meet stringent air quality standards. It is concluded that utilization of high quality wood fuel, such as wood pellets produced from natural, uncontaminated stem wood, would generate the least PM emissions compared to other wood fuel types. Particulate matter emissions from grate burners equipped with electrostatic precipitators when using wood pellets can be well below stringent regulatory emission limit such as particulate emission limit of Metro Vancouver, Canada. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we provide measurements of the greenhouse gas consequences of converting CRP land to continuous corn, corn-soybean, or perennial grass for biofuel production. No-till soybeans preceded the annual crops and created an initial carbon debt of 10.6 Mg CO2 equivalents (CO2e)·ha-1 that included agronomic inputs, changes in C stocks, altered N2O and CH4 fluxes, and foregone C sequestration less a fossil fuel offset credit. Total debt, which includes future debt created by additional changes in soil C stocks and the loss of substantial future soil C sequestration, can be constrained to 68 Mg CO2e·ha-1 if subsequent crops are under permanent no-till management. If tilled, however, total debt triples to 222 Mg CO2e·ha-1 on account of further soil C loss. Projected C debt repayment periods under no-till management range from 29 to 40 y for corn-soybean and continuous corn, respectively. Under conventional tillage repayment periods are three times longer, from 89 to 123 y, respectively. Alternatively, the direct use of existing CRP grasslands for cellulosic feedstock production would avoid C debt entirely and provide modest climate change mitigation immediately. Incentives for permanent no till and especially permission to harvest CRP biomass for cellulosic biofuel would help to blunt the climate impact of future CRP conversion.","Agriculture; Carbon balance; Land-use change; Nitrous oxide; Renewable energy","carbon; fossil fuel; agronomic trait; article; bioenergy; biofuel production; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation reserve program; conventional tillage; corn; crop; energy yield; environmental protection; grassland; greenhouse gas; priority journal; soybean; Animal Feed; Biofuels; Carbon; Cellulose; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Government Programs; Greenhouse Effect; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051995503

Airborne imagery has mainly been used for detection of individual trees using local maxima filtering, as point spread function and signal-to-noise ratio are smaller than with satellite-borne imagery. This led to the development of a novel approach to local maxima filtering for tree detection in plantation forests in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using satellite remote sensing imagery. Our approach is based on Gaussian smoothing for noise elimination and image classification, that is, natural break classification to determine the threshold for removing pixels of extremely bright and dark areas in the imagery. These pixels are assumed to belong to the background and hinder the search for tree peaks. A semivariogram technique was applied to determine variable window sizes for local maxima filtering within a plantation stand. A fixed window size for local maxima filtering was also applied using pre-determined tree spacing. Evaluation of the various approaches was based on aggregated assessment methods. The overall accuracy using a variable window size was 85%, root mean square error (RMSE) = 189 trees, whereas a fixed window size resulted in an accu- racy of 80%, RMSE = 258 trees. The approach worked remarkably well in mature forest stands as compared to young forest stands. These results are encouraging for temperate-warm climate plantation forest companies, who deal with even-aged, broadleaf plantations and forest inventory practices that require assessment 1 year before harvesting. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,"Mean square error; Optical transfer function; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Signal to noise ratio; Eucalyptus plantations; Gaussian smoothing; Individual tree detections; Noise elimination; Overall accuracies; Plantation forests; Root mean square errors; Satellite remote sensing; Forestry; airborne sensing; broad-leaved forest; forest inventory; IKONOS; image classification; pixel; plantation forestry; remote sensing; satellite imagery; signal-to-noise ratio; smoothing; variogram; Eucalyptus; Extractives; Forestry; Image Analysis; Noise; Optical Activity; Plants; Remote Sensing; Satellites; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051749815

Despite these important resources the uses of this renewable energy was limited to few and simple utilization as public lighting or park meter. Recently, the renewable energy sector in Oman is considered as a national priority to supply the future energy demand. This paper investigates the potential of solar water heater application in Oman through a preliminary case study in the Seeb district. The RETScreen Clean Energy Project Analysis Software is an advanced mathematical model to evaluate the energy production and savings costs, emission reductions, financial viability and risk for various types of Renewable-energy and Energy-efficient Technologies. This preliminary study shows that this renewable energy technology has eco-environmental benefits to Oman. The dissemination of the solar water heaters in Oman requires necessarily the contribution of the Government in order to make them. Instead of paying subsidies for the electricity consumed by electric water heaters, the Government can invest in sharing half of the capital cost. The clean development mechanism could help to foster the diffusion of the SWHs in Oman by providing certified emission reduction incentives to the Government. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The ecosystem service valuation is carried out by comparing the biophysical and economic values of three focal services (i.e. carbon sequestration, reduction in sedimentation, and waterfowl production) across three focal land uses in the region [i.e. native prairie grasslands, lands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve and Wetlands Reserve Programs (CRP/WRP), and cropland]. This study finds that CRP/WRP lands cannot mitigate (hectare for hectare) the loss of native prairie from a social welfare standpoint. Land use scenarios where native prairie loss was minimized, and CRP/WRP lands were increased, provided the most societal benefit. The scenario modeling projected native prairie conversion to cropland over the next 20. years would result in a social welfare loss valued at over $4 billion when considering the study's three ecosystem services, and a net loss of about $3.4 billion when reductions in commodity production are accounted for. © 2011.","Economic valuation; Ecosystem services; Grasslands; Land-use policy; Native prairie; Value transfer","biophysics; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; environmental assessment; environmental economics; land use change; land use planning; prairie; trade-off; valuation; North Dakota; Prairie Pothole Region; South Dakota; United States; Anatidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959819760

Our objectives were to assess the spatial variation in folivory on Nothofagus pumilio and understand the influence of climate on folivory patterns as mediated by changes in folivore density and leaf traits. Location Nothofagus pumilio forests, between 38 and 55°S (Argentina). Methods We studied the correlation of leaf damage with latitude on data from 47 sampling sites, and evaluated spatial patterns of autocorrelation on latitudinally detrended data with a principal coordinates of neighbour matrices method. Path analysis was used to test the association of temperature and precipitation with leaf damage, mediated by folivore density and leaf traits. We evaluated the adequacy of this ecological model by examining the spatial pattern of autocorrelation in the residuals, and combined spatial and environmental predictors of leaf damage into partial regression. Results Leaf damage decreased with latitude, which was the only significant spatial predictor. The latitudinal decrease in temperature and precipitation was correlated with a decrease in the density of folivores and leaf size, and diminished leaf damage. Our ecological model adequately explained the spatial autocorrelation in the data: 44% of the variation in leaf damage was explained by the latitudinally structured component of the environment, whereas local environmental effects accounted for another 22%. Main conclusions We conclude that N. pumilio forests show consistent latitudinal patterns of variation in folivory, folivore density and leaf traits. Our study suggests that the latitudinal variation in folivory rates is partly driven by the influence of climate on both plants and herbivores. This warns us about the potential susceptibility of folivory rates to climate warming. We emphasize the value of large-scale analyses as complementary to local experimental approaches to understanding the regulation of herbivory. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Herbivory; Nothofagus pumilio; Partial regression; Patagonia; Path analysis; Plant-insect interactions; Spatial autocorrelation; Subantarctic forests","autocorrelation; climate change; climate effect; ecological modeling; foliation; herbivory; path analysis; plant-insect interaction; spatial variation; tree; warming; Argentina; Patagonia; Hexapoda; Nothofagus pumilio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958150176

A successful bioremediation was developed by an efficient acclimatized microbial consortium. After an experimental period of 225 days, the process was shown to be highly efficient in decontaminating the wastewater. The performance of the bioaugmented reactor was demonstrated by the reduction of COD rates up to 95%. The residual total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) decreased from 320mgTPHl-1 to 8mgTPHl-1. Analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 26 hydrocarbons. The use of the mixed cultures demonstrated high degradation performance for hydrocarbons range n-alkanes (C10-C35). Six microbial isolates from the CSTR were characterized and species identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that 5 strains were closely related to Aeromonas punctata (Aeromonas caviae), Bacillus cereus, Ochrobactrum intermedium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Rhodococcus sp. The 6th isolate was affiliated to genera Achromobacter. Besides, the treated wastewater could be considered as non toxic according to the phytotoxicity test since the germination index of Lepidium sativum ranged between 57 and 95%.

To define sustainable harvest limits it is critical to understand the biological impacts of harvest. In the last decade we have improved our understanding of the demographic mechanisms driving population level responses to harvest. Our understanding of the ecophysiological underpinnings for these processes is still limited. We tested the effect of foliage harvest by indigenous Fulani people on leaf stoichiometry and economics in Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) in two vegetation types (fallows vs. forest) and in two ecological regions (dry vs. moist) in Benin, West Africa. Leaf mass per area (LMA) increased with aridity. Across sites and treatments, LMA correlated negatively with nitrogen and phosphorus per mass (Nmass and Pmass respectively), more strongly than with concentrations per area (Narea and Parea respectively) consistent with world-wide trends in leaf economics. The effect of foliage harvest on foliar nutrient concentrations was dependent on plant size and habitat. Harvesting increased Nmass and Pmass in larger trees, and altered the LMA-Nmass relationship between vegetation types and the LMA-Parea relationship between ecological regions, but it did not affect stoichiometry (N:P or C:N ratios). Synthesis and applications. The context-dependent effect of harvest on leaf economics emphasizes the importance of considering plant size and climate in predicting the biological consequences of NTFP harvest, and explains some of the ecophysiological mechanisms underlying demographic responses to harvest. The plant size- and climate-dependent effects of harvest on leaf composition suggest a different approach for assessing the impact of NTFP harvest on population dynamics. NTFP harvest should be modelled explicitly as a size dependent factor and integral projection models provide the framework for this. Our findings suggest that to reduce harvesting pressure on wild populations, it is important to encourage Fulani owned K. senegalensis plantations, especially in the dry region where harvest had greater effects. © 2011 The Authors.

The mean photic zone productivity to column respiration ratio was 0.12 ± 0.08, revealing predominance of heterotrophic processes. Community respiration was at minimum during monsoon (38.82 ± 8.63 mM C m-2 d-1) but was at maximum (173.8 ± 111.8 mM C m-2 d-1) during pre-monsoon and intermittent (125.07 ± 11.97 mM C m-2 d-1) during post-monsoon. Diurnal variations of atmospheric CO2 concentration were determined by local air circulations and atmospheric stability. Seasonal variations of atmospheric CO2 bear a significant signature of biological processes occurring in the coastal water by means of air-sea exchange, markedly affected by the net ecosystem metabolism.

However, due to spatial differences in cropping systems and in the magnitude of climatic change regional variations of climate change impact are expected. Furthermore, the recent climate projections are highly uncertain for large parts of West Africa. In particular with respect to annual precipitation and variability the projections vary between trends with decreasing precipitation and trends with slightly increasing precipitation within the next decades. On the other hand, the extensive fallow systems in this region suffer from increasing population pressure, which compromises soil fertility restoration. In the Republic of Benin, the demographic projections for the first half of this century indicate a continuous growth of the population with a narrow interval of confidence. Thus, in the absence of an adequate soil fertility management with judicious use of mineral fertilizers, the soil degradation process with decreasing crop yields is expected to continue. The objective of this paper was, therefore, to quantify the regional effect of future population growth on crop yields in West Africa and to compare it with the potential effects of climate change scenarios. Three land use scenarios (L1, L2 and L3) for the Upper Ouémé catchment where derived from different demographic projections combined with assumptions regarding future road networks and legal frameworks for forest protection using the CLUE-S modeling approach. The fallow-cropland ratio decreased in the three scenarios from 0.87 in the year 2000 to 0.66, 0.48 and 0.68 for L1, L2 and L3, respectively in 2050. Based on the projected ratio of fallow and cropland, trends of maize yield for the three land use scenarios were calculated using the EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model coupled with a spatial database. Maize yields followed the decreasing trend of the fallow-cropland ratio and estimated yield reductions amounted to up to 24% in the period 2021-2050. This trend was compared with the impact of the SRES climate scenarios A1B and B1 based on the output of the GCM ECHAM5 downscaled with the REMO model and the A1B scenario output of the GCM HADC3Q0 downscaled with the RCMs SMHIRCA and HADRM3P. The yield reductions due to the projected climate change in the three models accounted for a yield decrease of up to 18% (REMO A1B scenario) in the same period. Taking into account the smaller uncertainties in the scenario assumptions and in the model output of the land use scenarios, it is concluded that, in low input fallow systems in West Africa, land use effects will be at least as important as climate effects within the next decades. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate scenarios; Crop yield; Fallow systems; Land use change","climate change; crop production; crop yield; demographic survey; fallow; future prospect; land use change; maize; population growth; soil degradation; soil fertility; Benin [West Africa]; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957530374

Mussels were continuously exposed to increasing concentrations of the effluents for 14 days. Genotoxicity was determined by tracking changes in key enzymes for purine and pyrimidine synthesis (dehydrofolate reductase and aspartate transcarbamoylase), catabolism of purines (xanthine oxido-reductase) and DNA strand-break levels as determined by the alkaline precipitation assay. Other biomarkers related to xenobiotic biotransformation (cytochrome P4503A and glutathione S-transferase activities), metal metabolism (labile zinc and redox state of metathioneins) and oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase activity) were also determined in the mussels. The data revealed that dehydrofolate reductase activity was reduced by the initial effluent and increased by the ozonated effluent. Aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was significantly induced only with the ozonated effluent. The levels of DNA strand breaks responded in a biphasic manner in mussels exposed to the physically and chemically treated effluent where an initial decrease was observed at a low effluent concentration (3% v/v) followed by an increase in DNA strand breaks at a higher effluent concentration (20%). This response pattern was lost in the ozonated effluent, where only a decrease in DNA breaks was found. Xanthine oxidoreductase activity was not significantly affected but did correlate significantly with dehydrofolate reductase activity. Multivariate factorial and canonical analyses revealed that oxidative stress and metal/xenobiotic metabolism markers were strongly correlated with DNA strand breaks in mussels, suggesting that the presence of metals (zinc) and planar hydroxylated hydrocarbons present in these effluents were strong contributors to the observed response. We conclude that municipal effluents contain a complex mixture of pollutants that could modulate DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms in mussels. Crown Copyright © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Measurements made on both carbon and beryllium targets, having very different structures, were used to investigate the likely nature of the pickup reaction mechanism. The measurements involve thick reaction targets and γ-ray spectroscopy of the projectile-like reaction residue for final-state resolution, which permit experiments with low incident beam rates compared to traditional low-energy transfer reactions. From measured longitudinal momentum distributions we show that the 12C(22Mg,23Mg+γ)X reaction largely proceeds as a direct two-body reaction, with the neutron transfer producing bound C11 target residues. The corresponding reaction on the Be9 target seems to largely leave the Be8 residual nucleus unbound at excitation energies high in the continuum. We discuss the possible use of such fast-beam one-neutron pickup reactions to track single-particle strength in exotic nuclei and also their expected sensitivity to neutron high-ℓ (intruder) states, which are often direct indicators of shell evolution and the disappearance of magic numbers in the exotic regime. © 2011 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960938247

Simulation studies have also been completed to compare reservoir performance of natural depletion, continued water flooding, continuous CO2 flooding and water-alternate- CO2 flooding and determine an optimal water- CO2 ratio, optimal CO2 slugs and optimal CO2 injection rate. The simulation results show that water-alternate- CO2 after water flooding is an effective method of improved oil recovery for the low permeability reservoir and it can reduce water production and decrease the bottom-hole pressure of water injection well. The pilot field trial is now well implemented according to the above-mentioned study achievements. Future plans for water-alternate- CO2 optimization include continuation of performance monitoring to help optimize tapering strategy in order to enhance further oil recovery in the low permeability oil reservoir. © 2011 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Furthermore, a low-carbon economy has evolved in recent years. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential benefits and merits of these institutions, initiatives and mechanisms from the perspective of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The central questions are if and how these organizations, initiatives and finance mechanisms could support a country from MENA in its efforts to implement large-scale capacities for renewable energy production. For this purpose, Morocco was chosen as a case study. The findings in this paper indicate that the existing institutions and financial mechanisms do not sum up to a coordinated governance approach, although the main needs of a country or region appear to be addressed.

For ecosystems characterized by high fine-scale substrate heterogeneity such as grasslands on poorly developed soils, effects of climate change on plant communities may depend on substrate properties that vary at the scale of individuals (&lt;m2), leading to fine-scale shifts in community structure that may go undetected at larger scales. Here, we show in a long-running climate experiment in species-rich limestone grassland in Buxton, England (UK), that the resistance of the community to 15-year manipulations of temperature and rainfall at the plot scale (9m2) belies considerable community reorganization at the microsite (100cm2) scale. In individual models of the abundance of the 25 most common species with respect to climate treatment and microsite soil depth, 13 species exhibited significant soil depth affinities, and nine of these have shifted their position along the depth gradient in response to one or more climate treatments. Estimates of species turnover across the depth gradient reviewed in relation to measurements of water potential, nitrogen supply, pH, and community biomass suggest that communities of shallow microsites are responding directly to microenvironmental changes induced by climate manipulation, while those of the deepest microsites are shifting in response to changes in competitive interference from more nutrient-demanding species. Moreover, for several species in summer drought and winter heated treatments, climate response in deep microsites was opposite that of shallow microsites, suggesting microsite variation is contributing to community stability at the whole-plot level. Our study thus demonstrates a strong link between community dynamics and substrate properties, and suggests ecosystems typified by fine-scale substrate heterogeneity may possess a natural buffering capacity in the face of climate change. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Buxton; Calcareous grassland; Multivariate analysis; Plant competition; Species coexistence","buffering; calcareous grassland; climate effect; coexistence; community dynamics; community response; community structure; competition (ecology); heterogeneity; multivariate analysis; nutrient dynamics; plant community; rainfall; rhizosphere; soil depth; soil temperature; species richness; vegetation; water budget; Buxton; Derbyshire; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953283473

Here, it was studied whether nodule dark CO 2 fixation could participate in a mechanism for CO2 recycling through C4-type photosynthesis. Differences in the natural δ13C abundance between Lotus japonicus inoculated or not with the N-fixing Mesorhizobium loti were assessed. 13C labelling and gene expression of key enzymes of CO2 metabolism were applied in plants inoculated with wild-type or mutant fix- (deficient in N fixation) strains of M. loti, and in non-inoculated plants. Compared with non-inoculated legumes, inoculated legumes had higher natural δ13C abundance and total C in their hypergeous organs and nodules. In stems, 13C accumulation and expression of genes coding for enzymes of malate metabolism were greater in inoculated compared with non-inoculated plants. Malate-oxidizing activity was localized in stem xylem parenchyma, sieve tubes, and photosynthetic outer cortex parenchyma of inoculated plants. In stems of plants inoculated with fix- M. loti strains, 13C accumulation remained high, while accumulation of transcripts coding for malic enzyme isoforms increased. A potential mechanism is proposed for reducing carbon losses during SNF by the direct reincorporation of CO2 respired by nodules and the transport and metabolism of C-containing metabolites in hypergeous organs. © 2011 The Author(s).","δ13C abundance; 13C labelling; dark CO2 fixation; malate metabolism; symbiotic N fixation","carbon; carbon dioxide; malic acid derivative; antibody specificity; article; biological model; carbon cycle; cytology; darkness; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; Lotus; metabolism; nodulation; oxidation reduction reaction; photosynthesis; plant stem; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Darkness; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Lotus; Malates; Models, Biological; Organ Specificity; Oxidation-Reduction; Photosynthesis; Plant Root Nodulation; Plant Stems; Lotus corniculatus var. japonicus; Mesorhizobium loti",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957440146

Although liming contributes to increased rates of respiration from soil thereby potentially reducing soils ability to act as a CO2 sink, the long-term effects of liming on soil organic carbon (Corg) sequestration are largely unknown. Here, using data spanning 129 years of the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted (UK), we show net Corg sequestration measured in the 0-23cm layer at different time intervals since 1876 was 2-20 times greater in limed than in unlimed soils. The main cause of this large Corg accrual was greater biological activity in limed soils, which despite increasing soil respiration rates, led to plant C inputs being processed and incorporated into resistant soil organo-mineral pools. Limed organo-mineral soils showed: (1) greater Corg content for similar plant productivity levels (i.e. hay yields); (2) higher 14C incorporation after 1950s atomic bomb testing and (3) lower C:N ratios than unlimed organo-mineral soils, which also indicate higher microbial processing of plant C. Our results show that greater Corg sequestration in limed soils strongly reduced the global warming potential of long-term liming to permanent grassland suggesting the net contribution of agricultural liming to global warming could be lower than previously estimated. Our study demonstrates that liming might prove to be an effective mitigation strategy, especially because liming applications can be associated with a reduced use of nitrogen fertilizer which is a key cause for increased greenhouse gas emissions from agro-ecosystems. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agro-ecosystems; Climate change mitigation; Legumes; Nitrogen fertilizer; Park Grass Experiment; Soil density fractionation; Soil microbial community","agricultural ecosystem; carbon sequestration; global warming; greenhouse gas; legume; nitrogen; organic carbon; soil organic matter; soil respiration; England; Hertfordshire; Rothamsted Experimental Station; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953273806

The gaseous and aerosol distributions are used to trace atmospheric circulation and chemistry within and below Saturn's cloud decks (in the 1- to 4-bar region). Extensive testing of VIMS spectral models is used to assess and minimise the effects of degeneracies between retrieved variables and sensitivity to the choice of aerosol properties. Best fits indicate cloud opacity in two regimes: (a) a compact cloud deck centred in the 2.5-2.8bar region, symmetric between the northern and southern hemispheres, with small-scale opacity variations responsible for numerous narrow light/dark axisymmetric lanes; and (b) a hemispherically asymmetric population of aerosols at pressures less than 1.4bar (whose exact altitude and vertical structure is not constrained by nightside spectra) which is 1.5-2.0× more opaque in the summer hemisphere than in the north and shows an equatorial maximum between ±10° (planetocentric).Saturn's NH3 spatial variability shows significant enhancement by vertical advection within ±5° of the equator and in axisymmetric bands at 23-25°S and 42-47°N. The latter is consistent with extratropical upwelling in a dark band on the poleward side of the prograde jet at 41°N (planetocentric). PH3 dominates the morphology of the VIMS spectrum, and high-altitude PH3 at p&lt;1.3bar has an equatorial maximum and a mid-latitude asymmetry (elevated in the summer hemisphere), whereas deep PH3 is latitudinally-uniform with off-equatorial maxima near ±10°. The spatial distribution of AsH3 shows similar off-equatorial maxima at ±7° with a global abundance of 2-3ppb. VIMS appears to be sensitive to both (i) an upper tropospheric circulation (sensed by NH3 and upper-tropospheric PH3 and hazes) and (ii) a lower tropospheric circulation (sensed by deep PH3, AsH3 and the lower cloud deck). © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Atmospheres, Composition; Atmospheres, Structure; Saturn",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051473166

The percentage of annual global gold production by activated carbon-based processes grew from zero in the 1970s to almost 70% by the turn of the century, which represented a phenomenal rate of acceptance of a new technology by a traditionally conservative industry. The main reason for this rapid acceptance of the new technology was the fact that the first few large industrial plants in South Africa convincingly demonstrated better gold recoveries than the traditional filtration/Merrill Crowe process, with lower capital and operating costs. And as the plants developed an operating track record over their first few years of life, they proved to be remarkably robust mechanically, and highly tolerant of plant upsets, changes in feed composition and solution phase contaminants that had caused great problems in Merrill Crowe plants. These stellar attributes of the carbon-based gold plants have led to complacency and laziness in the industry, both at the new plant design stage, and with on-going optimization of existing plants. In many cases, basic ""rules of thumb"" that were developed as design criteria for the early CIP plants are still used today, with no appreciation of the factors that may cause one plant to perform quite differently from another. There seems to be little incentive to improve performance when it is well known that most CIP and CIL plants operate quite well with minimal optimization and, in many cases, minimal understanding of the factors that influence performance. Consequently, almost all CIP and CIL plants are overdesigned at the construction stage and are then operated sub-optimally. This can lead to higher gold losses and/or higher capital and operating costs than necessary. This paper examines the factors that influence CIP and CIL plant design and performance, and demonstrates a very simple methodology that can be used to arrive at something close to an optimum plant design. It can also be used as an on-going tool by plant metallurgists to transform a fairly well run plant into an exceptionally well run plant. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our main objective was to determine the sensitivity of ecosystem photosynthesis, respiration and net ecosystem production (NEP) measured by eddy covariance, to variation in temperature and water table depth associated with interannual shifts in weather during 2004-2009. Our study was conducted in a moderately rich treed fen, the most abundant peatland type in western Canada, in a region (northern Alberta) where peatland ecosystems are a significant landscape component. During the study, the average growing season (May-October) water depth declined approximately 38cm, and temperature [expressed as cumulative growing degree days (GDD, March-October)] varied approximately 370 GDD. Contrary to previous predictions, both ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration showed similar increases in response to warmer and drier conditions. The ecosystem remained a strong net sink for CO2 with an average NEP (± SD) of 189 ± 47gCm-2yr-1. The current net CO2 uptake rates were much higher than C accumulation in peat determined from analyses of the relationship between peat age and cumulative C stock. The balance between C addition to, and total loss from, the top 0-30cm depth (peat age range 0-70 years) of shallow peat cores averaged 43 ± 12gCm-2yr-1. The apparent long-term average rate of net C accumulation in basal peat samples was 19-24gCm-2yr-1. The difference between current rates of net C uptake and historical rates of peat accumulation is likely a result of vegetation succession and recent increases in tree establishment and productivity. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Boreal forest; Canadian carbon program; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Fluxnet-Canada","boreal forest; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; growing season; net ecosystem production; peatland; photosynthesis; respiration; water table; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957861571

REDD+ has potential to simultaneously deliver cost-effective climate change mitigation and human development. However, most REDD+ analysis has used coarse-scale data, overlooked important opportunity costs to tropical forest users and failed to consider how to best invest funds to limit leakage, that is, merely displacing deforestation. Here we examine these issues for Tanzania, a REDD+ country, by comparing district-scale carbon losses from deforestation with the opportunity costs of carbon conservation. Opportunity costs are estimated as rents from both agriculture and charcoal production (the most important proximate causes of regional forest conversion). As an alternative we also calculate the implementation costs of alleviating the demand for forest conversion - thereby addressing the problem of leakage - by raising agricultural yields on existing cropland and increasing charcoal fuel-use efficiency. The implementation costs exceed the opportunity costs of carbon conservation (medians of US$6.50 versus US$3.90 per Mg CO2), so effective REDD+ policies may cost more than simpler estimates suggest. However, even if agricultural yields are doubled, implementation is possible at the competitive price of ∼US$12 per Mg CO2. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"agricultural land; carbon sequestration; charcoal; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; crop yield; deforestation; environmental policy; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; human development index; international agreement; tropical forest; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82955240243

The spread of this species raises serious public health concerns. Here, we model the present distribution and the future climatic suitability of Europe for this vector in the face of climate change. In order to achieve the most realistic current prediction and future projection, we compare the performance of four different modelling approaches, differentiated by the selection of climate variables (based on expert knowledge vs. statistical criteria) and by the geographical range of presence records (native range vs. global range).First, models of the native and global range were built with MaxEnt and were either based on (1) statistically selected climatic input variables or (2) input variables selected with expert knowledge from the literature. Native models show high model performance (AUC: 0.91-0.94) for the native range, but do not predict the European distribution well (AUC: 0.70-0.72). Models based on the global distribution of the species, however, were able to identify all regions where Ae. albopictus is currently established, including Europe (AUC: 0.89-0.91).In a second step, the modelled bioclimatic envelope of the global range was projected to future climatic conditions in Europe using two emission scenarios implemented in the regional climate model COSMO-CLM for three time periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100. For both global-driven models, the results indicate that climatically suitable areas for the establishment of Ae. albopictus will increase in western and central Europe already in 2011-2040 and with a temporal delay in eastern Europe. On the other hand, a decline in climatically suitable areas in southern Europe is pronounced in the Expert knowledge based model. Our projections appear unaffected by non-analogue climate, as this is not detected by Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface analysis. The generated risk maps can aid in identifying suitable habitats for Ae. albopictus and hence support monitoring and control activities to avoid disease vector establishment. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Asian tiger mosquito; Dengue; Global change; Global warming; Invasion; Species distribution model; Vector-borne disease","Dengue; Global change; Invasion; Species distribution models; Tiger mosquito; Vector-borne disease; Disease control; Global warming; Health risks; Knowledge based systems; Surface analysis; Vectors; Climate models; biological invasion; climate change; climate modeling; dengue fever; disease control; disease spread; disease vector; geographical distribution; geographical region; global change; habitat selection; health risk; mosquito; prediction; public health; Europe; Aedes albopictus; Culicidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959842264

Thus opposed to traditional car-sharing, there are no fixed stations and in particular one-way trips of any length are possible without a booking requirement. Since this is the first free-floating system in operation, there is as yet no associated empirical research. Based on primary data from a survey, a model was developed to forecast the environmental impact of car2go. The prognosis considers the period of five years after the launch of car2go in 2009 and indicates a CO2-reduction per average car2go-user. In addition, more than a quarter of the survey respondents stated that they may forgo a car purchase if car2go was offered permanently. By reaching a greater share of citizens than traditional systems, the results indicate that free-floating car-sharing systems could contribute to reducing private vehicle ownership in cities. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Car-sharing; Environmental effect; Free-floating system; Product-service system; Public-private transportation","carbon dioxide; empirical analysis; environmental effect; environmental impact; public-private partnership; research work; transportation development; Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany; Ulm",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956094162

Calcifying marine organisms are predicted to be most vulnerable to a decline in oceanic pH (ocean acidification) based on the assumption that calcification will decrease as a result of changes in seawater carbonate chemistry, particularly reduced carbonate ion concentration (and associated saturation states). Net calcium carbonate production is dependent on an organism's ability to increase calcification sufficiently to counteract an increase in dissolution. Here, a critical appraisal of calcification in five benthic species showed, contrary to popular predictions, the deposition of calcium carbonate can be maintained or even increased in acidified seawater. This study measured changes in the concentration of calcium ions seen in shells taken from living animals exposed to acidified seawater. These data were compared with data from isolated shells that were not associated with living material to determine a species’ ability to maintain the physiological process of calcification under high carbon dioxide (CO2) conditions and characterize the importance of dissolution and abiotic influences associated with decreasing pH. Comparison with palaeoecological studies of past high CO2events presents a similar picture. This conclusion implies that calcification may not be the physiological process that suffers most from ocean acidification; particularly as all species investigated displayed physiological trade-offs including increased metabolism, reduced health, and changes in behavioural responses in association with this calcification upregulation, which poses as great a threat to survival as an inability to calcify. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Barnacle; Calcification; Echinoderm; Mollusc; Ocean acidification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862507609

Lower and Middle Devonian deposits in this area have never been investigated palynologically at such a refined scale. Samples were obtained from eleven boreholes, a trench, and a quarry representing the Upper Pragian to Eifelian interval which is recognized as a switching point from siliciclastic to carbonate deposition. In many cases, the investigated samples were obtained from transitional facies where faunal information is insufficient and only palynostratigraphical data is reliable. The oldest samples were dated as being part of the polygonalis-emsiensis Zone (Su Interval Zone in Streel et al., 1987), while the younger ones are tentatively dated to the lower part of the velata-langii spore Zone. Palynofacies observations suggest terrestrial to shallow-marine conditions during the transitional period between Early and Mid Devonian times.

In addition, environmental, social, and political pressures to limit the impacts associated with CO2 emissions are mounting rapidly. A key challenge for transportation agencies and businesses is to improve the efficiency of urban freight and commercial vehicle movements while ensuring environmental quality, livable communities, and economic growth. However, research and policy efforts to analyze and quantify the impacts of congestion and freight public policies on CO2 emissions are hindered by the complexities of vehicle routing problems with time-dependent travel times and the lack of network-wide congestion data. This research focuses on the analysis of CO2 emissions for different levels of congestion and time-definitive customer demands. Travel time data from an extensive archive of freeway sensors, time-dependent vehicle routing algorithms, and problems-instances with different types of binding constraints are used to analyze the impacts of congestion on commercial vehicle emissions. Results from the case study indicate that the impacts of congestion or speed limits on commercial vehicle emissions are significant but difficult to predict since it is shown that it is possible to construct instances where total route distance or duration increases but emissions decrease. Public agencies should carefully study the implications of policies that regulate depot locations and travel speeds as they may have unintended negative consequences in terms of CO2 emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Depot location; Time-dependent travel time speed; Urban congestion; Vehicle routing","Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Commercial vehicles; Economics; Travel time; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Vehicle routing; Environmental quality; Political pressures; Portland , Oregon; Time dependent; Transportation agencies; Urban congestion; Urban freight distribution; Vehicle Routing Problems; Traffic congestion; algorithm; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; freight transport; greenhouse gas; routing; sensor; traffic congestion; transportation policy; urban transport; distribution system; traffic emission; traffic management; transportation development; travel demand; travel time; Oregon; Portland [Oregon]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955964713

The aim of this study was to characterise biogas production in household digesters located at high altitude, operating under psychrophilic conditions. To this end, two pilot digesters were monitored and field campaigns were carried out in two representative digesters of rural communities. Digesters' useful volume ranged between 2.4 and 7.5 m3, and hydraulic residence time (HRT) between 60 and 90 days. The temperature inside the digester's greenhouse ranged between 20 and 25 °C. Treating cow manure, a specific biogas production around 0.35 m3 kgVS -1 was obtained, with some 65% CH4 in biogas. In order to fulfil daily requirements for cooking and lighting, biogas production should be enhanced without increasing implementation costs as not to impede the expansion of this technology at household scale. In this sense, HRT below 60 days and OLR above 1 kgVS m-3 day-1 should be investigated to decrease digesters' volume (i.e. costs) and increase biogas production rate. The adaptation of conventional gas burners to biogas characteristics can also contribute in improving the efficiency of the system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Anaerobic digestion; Appropriate technology; Biofuel; Biomethanation; Cookstove; Renewable energy","Anaerobic digestion; Biofuels; Biogas; Costs; Fertilizers; Appropriate technologies; Bio-methanation; Cookstove; Extreme weather conditions; Hydraulic residence time; Low-cost tubular digesters; Renewable energies; Specific biogas productions; Pulp digesters; anoxic conditions; biofuel; biogas; cooking appliance; digestibility; renewable resource; temperature gradient; volume; Andes; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953270124

Enhanced nonradiative recombination at TDs was confirmed experimentally, resulting in a reduced local PL emission intensity in the -PL intensity map performed at 390 nm (near band-edge emission). The behavior of nonradiative recombination at TDs depends on the dislocation type: the screw type of TDs shows stronger effect on the nonradiative recombination activity than the edge type, evidencing a larger local reduction of PL emission intensity. Furthermore, the contrast of TDs in the μ-PL intensity map greatly depends on the carrier lifetimes of the 4H-SiC epilayers.

Measurements obtained on 2009 August 11 UT at the impact latitude of 56°S (planetocentric), using the Goddard Heterodyne Instrument for Planetary Wind and Composition mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, reveal increased ethane abundance and the effects of aerosol opacity. An interval of reduced thermal continuum emission at 11.744μm is measured ~60-80° towards planetary east of the impact site, estimated to be at 305° longitude (System III). Retrieved stratospheric ethane mole fraction in the near vicinity of the impact site is enhanced by up to ~60% relative to quiescent regions at this latitude. Thermal continuum emission at the impact site, and somewhat west of it, is significantly enhanced in the same spectra that retrieve enhanced ethane mole fraction. Assuming that the enhanced continuum brightness near the impact site results from thermalized aerosol debris blocking contribution from the continuum formed in the upper troposphere and indicating the local temperature, then continuum emission by a haze layer can be approximated by an opaque surface inserted at the 45-60. mbar pressure level in the stratosphere in an unperturbed thermal profile, setting an upper limit on the pressure and therefore a lower limit on the altitude of the top of the impact debris at this time. The reduced continuum brightness east of the impact site can be modeled by an opaque surface near the cold tropopause, which is consistent with a lower altitude of ejecta/impactor-formed opacity. The physical extent of the observed region of reduced continuum implies a minimum average velocity of 21 m/s transporting material prograde (planetary east) from the impact. © 2011.","Atmospheres, Composition; Atmospheres, Dynamics; Impact processes; Infrared observations; Jupiter, Atmosphere",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955153794

The case study demonstrated that the MP/RB approach approximately doubled the human health benefits achieved by the traditional approach while increasing cost less than 20%-moving closer to the objective of Executive Order 12866 to maximize net benefits. Less well understood is how the distribution of health benefits from the MP/RB and traditional strategies affect the existing inequalities in air-pollution-related risks in Detroit. In this article, we identify Detroit populations that may be both most susceptible to air pollution health impacts (based on local-scale baseline health data) and most vulnerable to air pollution (based on fine-scale PM2.5 air quality modeling and socioeconomic characteristics). Using these susceptible/vulnerable subpopulation profiles, we assess the relative impacts of each control strategy on risk inequality, applying the Atkinson Index (AI) to quantify health risk inequality at baseline and with either risk management approach. We find that the MP/RB approach delivers greater air quality improvements among these subpopulations while also generating substantial benefits among lower-risk populations. Applying the AI, we confirm that the MP/RB strategy yields less PM2.5 mortality and asthma hospitalization risk inequality than the traditional approach. We demonstrate the value of this approach to policymakers as they develop cost-effective air quality management plans that maximize risk reduction while minimizing health inequality. © 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.","BenMAP; Inequality; PM2.5; Susceptible; Vulnerable","Air quality improvement; Air quality modeling; Air quality policy; BenMAP; Control strategies; Detroit; Health benefits; Health data; Health impact; Human health; Inequality; Metropolitan area; Policy makers; Relative impact; Risk reductions; Risk-based; Socioeconomic characteristics; Spatially resolved; Susceptible; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Vulnerable; Air pollution control; Air quality; Environmental Protection Agency; Health; Pollution; Population statistics; Quality control; Quality management; Risk management; Health risks; air quality; atmospheric pollution; baseline conditions; cost-benefit analysis; experimental design; health risk; health survey; metropolitan area; particle size; particulate matter; policy making; public health; vulnerability; air pollutant; article; environmental planning; human; particle size; social justice; Air Pollutants; Environmental Policy; Humans; Particle Size; Social Justice; Detroit; Michigan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959218537

That is, the wetlands are only 'wetted' from above but not from below by the high water table. Furthermore, without the knowledge of the water table position, estimates of CH4 and other gases (e.g., CO2 and N2O) are poorly constrained. We present a simple hydrologic framework for simulating wetlands based on water table depth. A synthesis of hydrologic controls on wetlands highlights the key role that groundwater plays. It directly feeds wetlands, supports surface-water fed wetlands by maintaining a saturated substrate, and links land drainage to sea level by impeding drainage in lowlands. Forced by routine climate model output (precipitation-evapotranspiration-surface runoff), land topography, and sea level, we simulate the present-day water table in North America at the 1 km scale. We validate the simulation with water table observations and compare regions of shallow water table to mapped wetlands. Our results show that the framework captures the salient features of wetland distribution and extent at regional and continental scales, a direct result of large-scale groundwater convergence that nourishes the lowlands even in arid climates. The low requirement of forcing and computation make the framework easy to adopt in climate and earth system models for simulating wetland responses to climate and sea level change for the present, paleo reconstructions, and future projections. © 2010 The Author(s).","Climate modeling; Earth system modeling; North America; Water table; Wetlands","arid region; biogeochemistry; climate modeling; drainage network; sea level change; shallow water; surface water; water table; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959784159

Adapting an all-optical scheme, modulated stimulated emission depletion (STED) generalizes such modulation schemes by eliminating the need for dark state residence by directly optically depopulating the emissive state at any externally applied frequency. Using two overlapped Gaussian laser spots with the depletion beam being intensity-modulated, fluorescence modulation is readily achieved with a depletion ratio governed by the intensity of the depleting laser. Selective image recovery of otherwise unmodulatable fluorophore signals is directly achieved through this all-optical modulation, and common STED-degrading multiphoton-excited background is readily discriminated against.

Based on presence-absence data, which modelling techniques are appropriate to determine species potential distribution for forest management planning under climate change? Do species distribution models (SDMs) agree with expert knowledge about species distribution and species traits? How can forest researcher deal with distribution data of a species whose distribution is heavily affected by human impacts? Location: Bavaria (Southern Germany). Methods: We used SDMs based on the Second National Forest Inventory from 2002 (4 × 4km grid) containing presence-absence data of tree species to identify species environment relationships ('Grinnellian niche'). As an example, the distribution of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) was modelled. Site condition data of the plots were derived from solar radiation, climate and soil maps. Models applied were boosted regression trees (BRT) and generalised additive models (GAM). Model predictions were compared with an expert based evaluation of the potential natural vegetation and were run with a climate change scenario (WETTREG B1) to project future distribution of silver fir. Results: Both models discriminated well between presence and absence of silver fir but underestimated the potential distribution. The BRT model was more sensitive to local site conditions in the present data, but the GAM showed more generality. The truncated response curves and high uncertainties of predictions at the edge of the site spectrum indicated a low data density and that the data did not cover the whole niche space of silver fir. As indicated by validation with expert knowledge, the model output approached potential distribution by optimizing true positive predictions. The classification of SDMs output into risk classes allowed model evaluation and interpretation. Predictions of GAM and BRT under the climate change scenario showed high accordance and therefore, low uncertainty. Finally, large areas of Bavaria are described to have a high risk of silver fir cultivation in future. Conclusions: SDMs are especially interesting as a decision basis for forest management because some of the general limitations of static modelling approaches are not relevant in this context. Limitations of forest inventory data can be partially overcome by using information on the potential distribution of species. The transferability of the models to future scenarios strongly depends on the spectrum and range of the training data sets and the depicted functional relationships. In order to improve the models and reduce the uncertainties, we need to improve the soil data and cover the whole niche space of silver fir. © 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Boosted regression trees; BRT; GAM; Generalised additive models; SDM; Silver fir","anthropogenic effect; classification; climate change; cultivation; data set; database; ecological modeling; evergreen forest; expert system; forest inventory; forest management; forestry modeling; model validation; niche; population distribution; regression analysis; risk assessment; site characterization; soil analysis; Bavaria; Germany; Abies; Abies alba; Grinnellia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960081814

The equivalent generation of CO2 is 1.4 tons. (An additional 0.1 to 0.3 tons of CO2 may result from the production of soda ash and the conversion of Na2CO3 to Na2O.) This is only 3% of the potential energy savings for vehicles equipped with fuel-efficient (low rolling resistance) tires with tread compounds made with one metric ton of silica, as illustrated in figure 10. There are other components of the ""green"" tire that also consume more energy than a conventional tire, such as solution-polymerized SBR in place of the emulsion polymer, the manufacture of the silane coupling agent and the requirement for more energy intensive rubber mixing procedures. However, the use of fuel-efficient tires will still generate significant energy savings and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. In the United States, the fact that the vast majority of the energy used is from domestically produced natural gas or electricity generation is also important to the goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The silicate production and spray drying steps consume the most energy in the production of precipitated silica, as shown in figure 11. As capital is expended to upgrade existing facilities and build new production facilities to meet the growing demand for amorphous precipitated silica, the efficiencies of these steps can be expected to improve. New furnaces may have two to three times the energy efficiency of the older designs. Energy may be recycled from the spray drying process, and new designs of drying systems using hybrid layouts, such as fluid bed or pulse driers in conjunction with spray driers, may increase the efficiency. Environmental factors other than energy use and CO2 generation are not addressed as part of this analysis, but need to be considered in an overall lifecycle analysis. Production of raw materials for the silica precipitation can generate by-products, which may include overburden and tailings from the mining operations or residues of the purification steps. Many steps of the overall process use large volumes of water for washing of the materials. The precipitation step generates sodium sulfate, which may be recovered for sale, but is likely to be discharged into the environment. The use of silica in tires may also have an effect on the recycling of tires as tire derived fuel (TDF), which currently consumes the largest volume of scrap tires. Replacing 1.1 kg of carbon black with non-combustible silica in an average 13.6 kg passenger tire will decrease the energy content of the TDF. The silica in any remaining tread will remain relatively unchanged, thereby increasing the by-product ash for an average passenger tire from approximately 0.7 kg to 1 kg. For TDF used to fire cement kilns, this ash will simply be a diluent to the final product. However, if TDF is used for other purposes, such as generation of steam or electricity, it will significantly increase the volume of ash that requires disposal.",,"Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon footprint; Cement kiln; Drying systems; Electricity generation; Emulsion polymers; Energy content; Energy independence and security act of 2007; Energy use; Environmental factors; Fluid-beds; Growing demand; Life cycle analysis; Mining operations; New design; New production; Precipitated silicas; Process use; Rubber mixing; Scrap tires; Silane coupling agent; Silica precipitation; Soda ash; Spray drying process; Tire-derived fuel; Tread compounds; Amorphous carbon; Brickmaking; Byproducts; Carbon black; Carbon dioxide; Coupling agents; Electric generators; Emulsification; Fluidization; Fuels; Global warming; Kilns; Life cycle; Mining; Recycling; Rubber applications; Scrap metal reprocessing; Silica; Silicates; Sodium; Sodium sulfate; Spray drying; Tires; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052649313

While previous studies have shown successful CH4-CO2 replacement in hydrates, the mechanical response of hydrate-bearing sediments during CO2 injection, CH4-CO2 replacement, and CH4 production needs to be adequately understood in order to avert production problems such as borehole instability, sand production, and buckling of the casing. We take advantage of the characteristics of elastic mechanical wave propagation in sediments to monitor CH4 hydrate-bearing sands before, during, and after CO2 injection. Results show that CH4-CO2 replacement occurs without a loss of stiffness in the granular medium. This implies that CO2-flooded sandy reservoirs can remain mechanically stable during and after CH4 gas production. On the other hand, dry CO2 dissolves hydrate, and continued sediment flushing with dry CO2 reduces the degree of hydrate saturation in the pore space, opens the pore throats, and weakens the granular skeleton. This phenomenon may cause a significant loss of strength near the injection points and regions subjected to high liquid CO2 flow rate. The results of complimentary analyses show a decrease in bulk stiffness as water is displaced by liquid CO2, a stiffening of the granular skeleton during hydrate formation at contacts (diffusion limited), and the implications of water solubility in liquid CO2. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon geological storage; Gas exchange; Geomechanics; Geophysics; Natural gas enhanced recovery; Reservoir","Borehole instability; Diffusion limited; Gas exchange; Gas productions; Geological storage; Geomechanics; Granular medium; Granular skeleton; Hydrate formation; Hydrate saturation; Liquid CO; Loss of strength; Mechanical response; Mechanically stable; Pore space; Pore throat; Production problems; Sand production; Sediment flushing; Sustainable use; Water solubilities; Air pollution control; Anoxic sediments; Bearings (machine parts); Bearings (structural); Buckling; Enhanced recovery; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas hydrates; Hydration; Liquids; Methane; Natural gas; Sedimentology; Stiffness; Water injection; Wave propagation; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; enhanced oil recovery; fossil fuel; gas exchange; gas hydrate; geomechanics; geophysics; hydrocarbon reservoir; methane; natural gas; P-wave; saturation; wave propagation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051472138

We show that iHEM decreases energy expenses, reduces the contribution of the consumers to the peak load, reduces the carbon emissions of the household, and its savings are close to OREM.

Tests are conducted to compare the biodiesel with baseline diesel fuel in terms of engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics. The results obtained showed that the addition of biodiesel to diesel fuel decreases the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and increases the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). These results are expected due to the lower energy content of biodiesel fuel. On the other hand while the NO x emissions increased with increase in biodiesel content in the fuel blends, the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), un-burnt hydrocarbon (UHC) and smoke opacity decreased. The engine performance which indicates that the biodiesel has properties and characteristics similar to diesel fuel and the reductions in exhaust emissions make shea butter biodiesel a viable additive or substitute to diesel fuel.","Biodiesel; Diesel engine; Engine performance and emission; Shea butter; Transesterification","Bio-diesel fuel; Brake specific fuel consumption; Brake thermal efficiency; Engine performance; Exhaust emission; Fuel blends; Lower energies; Methyl esters; Performance evaluation; Shea butter; Single-cylinder diesel engine; Smoke opacity; Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Brakes; Carbon monoxide; Crude oil; Diesel fuels; Engine cylinders; Engines; Fuel consumption; Hydrocarbons; Machine design; Synthetic fuels; Transesterification; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960756375

These coarse resolution studies are, however, of limited relevance for projecting risks to biodiversity in mountain systems, where pronounced microclimatic variation could allow species to persist locally, and are ill-suited for assessment of species-specific threat in particular regions. Here, we assess the impacts of climate change on 2632 plant species across all major European mountain ranges, using high-resolution (ca. 100m) species samples and data expressing four future climate scenarios. Projected habitat loss is greater for species distributed at higher elevations; depending on the climate scenario, we find 36-55% of alpine species, 31-51% of subalpine species and 19-46% of montane species lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat by 2070-2100. While our high-resolution analyses consistently indicate marked levels of threat to cold-adapted mountain florae across Europe, they also reveal unequal distribution of this threat across the various mountain ranges. Impacts on florae from regions projected to undergo increased warming accompanied by decreased precipitation, such as the Pyrenees and the Eastern Austrian Alps, will likely be greater than on florae in regions where the increase in temperature is less pronounced and rainfall increases concomitantly, such as in the Norwegian Scandes and the Scottish Highlands. This suggests that change in precipitation, not only warming, plays an important role in determining the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Alpine plants; Europe vegetation; Global change; Impact assessment; Species distribution models","biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; environmental impact assessment; global warming; habitat loss; mountain region; numerical model; twenty first century; vegetation; Alps; Highland; Pyrenees; Scandes Mountains; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957814431

By considering a polar or associating component at low concentration in a nonpolar solvent, we can neglect polar or hydrogen bonding interactions in the hydrocarbon rich phase, thus reducing the number of fitted parameters. The approach allows us to determine the intrinsic pure component equation of state parameters independent of polar and associating interactions. As an example, the nonpolar, non-associating equation of state parameters for water are determined by fitting water solubility data in liquid hydrocarbons (carbon numbers (CN) = 4-13, 16) at ambient conditions. Using the PC-SAFT equation of state, a predictive model for the solubility of water in n-alkanes is produced. Comparisons of the model are presented with binary mixture experimental data for methane to decane across a wide range of conditions. Excellent qualitative and good quantitative agreement is exhibited without fitting a binary interaction parameter. The model is then extrapolated to predict water solubility in n-alkanes as a function of temperature, pressure, and carbon number for conditions where experimental data is of questionable validity or unavailable. Implications on the potential model used in molecular simulations are also discussed. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Binary mixtures; Carbon; Equations of state of liquids; Hydrogen bonds; Solubility; Binary interaction parameter; Correlation and prediction; Hydrogen bonding interactions; Liquid hydrocarbons; Molecular simulations; Predictive modeling; Quantitative agreement; Theoretical equation; Paraffins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959859451

There is a big concern about the increasing concentration of PAHs in the environment. Researchers are trying to explore optimal methods to reduce those pollutants and improve the quality of air. Water blended fuel is one of the possible approaches to reduce emission of PAHs from the combustion of diesel in urban and domestic vehicles. In this work a modeling study was conducted using CHEMKIN-PRO software to simulate spray combustion at similar diesel engine conditions. Surrogate fuel of (80 % n-heptane and 20 % toluene) was used due to detailed kinetic and thermodynamic data needed for modeling is available for this kind of fuel but not available for diesel. An emulsified fuel with 3, 5, 8, 10 and 20 % water by volume is used as an engine feed for this study. The modeling results show that water has a significant effect on reducing engine soot and PAHs precursors formation up to certain extent.","Combustion; Diesel Engine; Emission; Emulsified Fuel; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs); Soot precursors; Surrogate Fuel","Ambient air; Blended fuels; Detailed kinetics; Diesel emission; Domestic vehicles; Emulsified fuel; Engine conditions; Incomplete combustion; Modeling results; Modeling studies; Motor vehicle; n-Heptanes; Optimal methods; Polycyclic aromatics; Soot precursors; Spray combustion; Surrogate fuels; Thermodynamic data; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs); Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Combustion; Diesel engines; Emulsification; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Heptane; Soot; Ternary systems; Toluene; Neutron emission; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052184148

The α-chlordane models for the coho salmon, channel catfish, rainbow trout, and common carp showed continuously decreasing trends during the entire 30+ year survey period (1976-2007). The γ-chlordane models demonstrated similar trends for the coho salmon, channel catfish, and common carp. These fish species had higher levels of α- and γ-chlordane in their muscle tissues. The α- and γ-chlordane levels in freshwater drum, smallmouth bass, walleye, white bass, whitefish, and yellow perch decreased until the mid-1980s and hovered at levels around the detection limits for the remaining period.

Two issues have emerged concerning hydraulic fracturing, with the first one arising out of the recent contention that the operation pollutes underground sources of drinking water. With the current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) position and changing regulatory environment, the legal environment for operators and service companies is fraught with risk. EPA has started developing guidance documents concerning the diesel fuel issue.

Using pyrosequencing, we examined the spatio-temporal dynamics of a functionally important community of rhizosphere microbes, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We sampled AM fungi from plant roots growing in a temperate grassland in a spatially explicit manner throughout a year. Ordination analysis of the AM fungal assemblages revealed significant temporal changes in composition and structure. Alpha and beta diversity tended to be negatively correlated with the climate variables temperature and sunshine hours. Higher alpha diversity during colder periods probably reflects more even competitive interactions among AM fungal species under limited carbon availability, a conclusion supported by analysis of beta diversity which highlights how resource limitation may change localized spatial dynamics. Results reveal distinct AM fungal assemblages in winter and summer at this grassland site. A seasonally changing supply of host-plant carbon, reflecting changes in temperature and sunshine hours, may be the driving force in regulating the temporal dynamics of AM fungal communities. Climate change effects on seasonal temperatures may therefore substantially alter future AM fungal community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. © 2011 The Authors.

A troubling aspect of emissions from the transport sector is that they are increasing rapidly. With the ongoing rapid increase in population, expansion of middle class in developing countries, and availability of cheaper vehicles such as Tata Nano in India, the desire to own private vehicles is within reach now than ever for millions of people in the developing world. This could have a huge implication on ongoing effort towards containment of GHG emissions. We look at the role of urban design forms - settlement density - housing and employment activities and the effects they could have in reducing travel demands, motor vehicle dependency and GHG emissions. Although urban planning has a limited effect on the reduction of GHG emissions, in the short term, due to the time needed to build up the necessary infrastructures, in the long term, it can be very effective through the shift from private vehicle dependency to public and other alternative environmentally friendly modes of transports (such as walking and cycling). A mixture of high residential and employment density could influence shorter commuter journeys and a reduction in private vehicle use if it is supported by an efficient public transport system and appropriate fiscal and regulatory instruments. Among the set of available instruments to reduce GHGs from the transport sector, urban planning, may be equally important, if not more to contain emissions from the transport sector. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Climate change mitigation; Employment density; GHG emissions; Residential density; Road transport","climate change; developing world; emission control; emission inventory; environmental planning; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; infrastructural development; public transport; transportation planning; urban planning; India",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954421250

A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is employed in the PHEV model. CVT gearboxes have a continuum of gear ratios between their upper and lower limits and their proper control can cause the engine to work optimally. The requested power from the driver and the state of charge of the battery are the controller inputs, while the CVT optimal gear ratio is the controller output. This optimal gear ratio helps the engine to work near its optimal operating points, resulting in better fuel economy and reduced emissions. The controller also attempts to enhance the vehicle performance parameters as much as possible. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, it is implemented in a PHEV simulated model. Initial results are calculated for three different drive cycles. Afterwards, in order to improve outputs, the initial controller parameters are optimized using multi-objective optimization genetic algorithms. Comparison between the initial and the optimized results showed the success of the optimized control strategy in reducing the fuel consumption, while the vehicle performance and emissions remained within their desired limits.","Continuously variable transmission; Control strategy; Fuel economy; Hybrid electric vehicle; Multi-objective optimization","Continuously variable transmission; Control strategies; Control strategy; Controller outputs; Controller parameter; Design and optimization; Drive cycles; Gear ratios; Hybrid electric vehicle; Lower limits; Multi objective; Optimal operating point; Optimization genetic algorithms; Optimized control; Parallel hybrid electric vehicles; Simulated model; State of charge; Vehicle performance; Computer simulation; Controllers; Electric vehicles; Fuels; Multiobjective optimization; Secondary batteries; Steel metallurgy; Variable speed transmissions; Vehicle transmissions; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051952868

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the timber industry have urged governments to use trade incentives to control illegalities, and this has been instrumental in the development of these laws. The Lacey Act, an American conservation law revised in 2008 to include illegal timber, requires businesses to demonstrate that their purchasing policies and mechanisms effectively avoid sourcing timber from illegal sources. Because tackling the problem depends on cooperation between importing and exporting countries, the EU has been working since 2002 on a comprehensive plan to control illegal timber imports: the EU Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT). This Action Plan has led to new legislation to control illegal timber imports and help timber-producing countries to improve forest governance. It is hoped that in this way FLEGT will also contribute to keeping forests standing, thereby mitigating climate change. However, it is feared that World Bank and United Nations initiatives on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) may undermine the FLEGT initiative if they do not recognize the need to begin with forest governance reforms. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"climate change; European Union; forest management; governance approach; nongovernmental organization; policy analysis; policy development; policy reform; timber industry; timber trade; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84555190378

Further, understanding how the ecology of species influences temporal transferability is critical yet al.most wholly lacking. This raises two questions. (1) Are SDM projections transferable in time? (2) Does temporal transferability relate to species ecological traits? To address these questions we developed SDMs for 133 vascular plant species using data from the mountain ranges of California (USA) from two time periods: the 1930s and the present day. We forecast historical models over 75 years of measured climate change and assessed their projections against current distributions. Similarly, we hindcast contemporary models and compared their projections to historical data. We quantified transferability and related it to species ecological traits including physiognomy, endemism, dispersal capacity, fire adaptation, and commonness. We found that non-endemic species with greater dispersal capacity, intermediate levels of prevalence, and little fire adaptation had higher transferability than endemic species with limited dispersal capacity that rely on fire for reproduction. We demonstrate that variability in model performance was driven principally by differences among species as compared to model algorithms or time period of model calibration.

DHNs (District heating networks) could provide an efficient method for house and space heating by utilizing residual industrial waste heat. In such systems, heat is produced and/or thermally upgraded in a central plant and then distributed to the end users through a pipeline network. The control strategies of these networks are rather difficult thanks to the non-linearity of the system and the strong interconnection between the controlled variables. That is why a NMPC (non-linear model predictive controller) could be applied to be able to fulfill the heat demand of the consumers. The main objective of this paper is to propose a tuning method for the applied NMPC to fulfill the control goal as soon as possible. The performance of the controller is characterized by an economic cost function based on pre-defined operation ranges. A methodology from the field of experiment design is applied to tune the model predictive controller to reach the best performance. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is proven throughout a case study of a simulated NMPC controlled DHN. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Controller tuning; District heating network; Experiment design; Model predictive control","Design; District heating; Experiments; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Heating equipment; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Waste heat; Control goals; Control strategies; Controlled variables; Controller tuning; District heating network; District heating networks; Economic costs; Efficient method; End users; Experiment design; Governmental policies; Heat demands; Model predictive controllers; Non-linear model; Non-Linearity; Operation range; Pipeline networks; Tuning method; Controllers; control system; emission control; energy efficiency; experimental design; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; heating; nonlinearity; numerical model; pipeline; policy approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961029830

Since CH4 has a relatively short lifetime and it is very close to a steady state, reductions in its emissions would quickly benefit climate. Sensible emission mitigation strategies require quantitative understanding of CH4's budget of emissions and sinks. Atmospheric observations of CH4 abundance and its rate of increase, combined with an estimate of the CH4 lifetime, constrain total global CH4 emissions to between 500 and 600Tg CH4 yr -1. While total global emissions are constrained reasonably well, estimates of emissions by source sector vary by up to a factor of 2. Current observation networks are suitable to constrain emissions at large scales (e.g. global) but not at the regional to national scales necessary to verify emission reductions under emissions trading schemes. Improved constraints on the global CH4 budget and its break down of emissions by source sector and country will come from an enhanced observation network for CH4 abundance and its isotopic composition (δ13C, δD (D = 2H) and δ14C). Isotopic measurements are a valuable tool in distinguishing among various sources that contribute emissions to an air parcel, once fractionation by loss processes is accounted for. Isotopic measurements are especially useful at regional scales where signals are larger. Reducing emissions from many anthropogenic source sectors is cost-effective, but these gains may be cancelled, in part, by increasing emissions related to economic development in many parts of the world. An observation network that can quantitatively assess these changing emissions, both positive and negative, is required, especially in the context of emissions trading schemes. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Biogeochemical cycles; Climate; Global methane budget; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Isotope geochemistry","Biogeochemical cycle; Climate; Global methane budget; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Isotope geochemistry; Atmospheric radiation; Biogeochemistry; Budget control; Emission control; Exploratory geochemistry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Isotopes; Measurements; Methane; Atmospheric chemistry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957601399

More evidence from local case studies emerges that document this risk. Vulnerability to climate change and variability appears most likely to negatively affect poor people, particularly women. Tendencies to widen existing inequalities have been observed. In the Lake Faguibine area in Northern Mali the social, political and ecological conditions have drastically changed in the last three decades. We conducted 6 single gender participatory workshops using PRA in two communities. The workshops assessed vulnerability and adaptive strategies to climate variability and change for livestock and forest based livelihoods. Our results show divergences in the adaptive strategies of men and women. Migration represented one of the most important strategies for men. Women perceived this strategy more as a cause of vulnerability than an adaptive strategy. Traditionally male activities have been added to the workload of women (e.g. small ruminant herding). The historical axes show that development projects targeting women have not integrated climate change and variability into their planning. Most activities have been built around small scale agriculture. With the drying out of Lake Faguibine, those water dependent activities are no longer relevant. Women have developed their own adaptive strategies based on newly emerged forest resources in the former lake area (e.g. charcoal production). However, women are hindered from realizing the potential of these new activities. This is due to loss of person power in the household, unclear access to natural resources, lack of knowledge and financial resources. Lack of power to influence decision at the household and community levels as well as limited market opportunities for women are additional factors. Even though women's vulnerability is increasing in the short term, over the long term the emerging changes in women's roles could lead to positive impacts. These impacts could be both societal (division of labor and power, new social spaces), and economic (market access, livestock wealth). Locally specific gender sensitive analysis of vulnerability is needed to understand dynamics and interaction of divergent adaptive strategies. Societal and political change at broader scales is needed to realize potential benefits for women in the long term.","adaptation; climate change; Faguibine; gender; Mali","adaptive management; climate change; climate variation; forestry production; gender role; human activity; livestock farming; migration; socioeconomic impact; strategic approach; vulnerability; womens status; Mali; Bovidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054701378

However, nutrient application may affect soil processes and cycles. These could involve increases in crop residues return to soil, changes in soil organic matter dynamic, NO3--N content and pH decrease. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of N application on: crop residue input, soil organic carbon (SOC) and N (SON), their particulate (POC and PON) and mineral associated (AOC and AON) fractions, mineralizable N (anaerobic incubations, AN), and pH on a Molisoll of the southern Buenos Aires Province under no tillage (NT). A long-term crop rotation experiment has been conducted between 2001 and 2008 on a complex of Typic Argiudoll and Petrocalcic Paleudoll soils at Balcarce, Argentina (37°45'S, 58°18'W). Three N rates (N0, N1 and N2) were evaluated, with an average N input of 0, 57 and 105kgha-1year-1, respectively. Crop sequence was integrated by maize (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/soybean double crop. Soil sampling was done in 2008, previous to maize planting. Nitrogen fertilization increased carbon (C) return to soil during 2001-2008 (11.1 and 18.7% for N1 and N2 respect to N0) but no differences in SOC, SON, AOC, and AON were observed among N rates in 0-5 and 0-20cm depth. It was only found more PON in N1 and a slight tendency to increased POC (3% and 13% for N1 and N2 respect to N0) in 0-5cm depth. At the same time, NO3--N content in 0-60cm depth was similar among N rates (89.6±8.4, 88.6±6.4, and 81.6±10.3kgNha-1 for N0, N1, and N2, respectively). By contrast, it was determined soil acidification (5.8±0.3, 5.5±0.2, and 5.3±0.2 for N0, N1, and N2, respectively) and AN reductions in 0-5cm depth as N rate increased, (76.1±3.2; 74.9±6.3 and 57.9±3.5 for N0, N1 and N2 respectively). The high frequency of soybean in the rotation could have prevented higher increases in C return to soil and, as a consequence, mitigated the changes in related soil properties. In addition, the absence of N application to soybean also could have prevented enhances in soil acidification and AN depletion. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Long-term effect; Nitrogen fertilization; No-tillage; Soil organic matter","Anaerobic incubation; Argentina; Buenos Aires; Crop residue; Crop rotation; Crop sequences; Glycine max; Grain quality; High frequency; High yield; Long-term effects; Maize (Zea mays L.); N content; Nitrogen fertilization; No tillage; Soil acidifications; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matter; Soil organic matter dynamics; Soil process; Soil property; Soil property changes; Soil sampling; Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Acidification; Agricultural machinery; Agricultural wastes; Amino acids; Biogeochemistry; Crops; Grain (agricultural product); Nitrogen; Nitrogen fixation; Organic carbon; pH effects; Rotation; Soils; acidification; agricultural soil; crop residue; crop rotation; experimental study; fertilizer application; long-term change; maize; mineral; nitrogen; particulate organic matter; pH; soil analysis; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; soil property; soybean; wheat; zero tillage; Argentina; Balcarce; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; Pampas; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959954375

As demands for usability become more prevalent for publicly accountable scientific programs, there is a need to better understand opportunities and constraints to science use in order to inform policy design and implementation. Motivated by recent critique of the decision support function of the US Global Change Research Program, this paper seeks to address this issue by specifically examining the production and use of climate science. It reviews empirical evidence from the rich scholarship focused on climate science use, particularly seasonal climate forecasts, to identify factors that constrain or foster usability. It finds, first, that climate science usability is a function both of the context of potential use and of the process of scientific knowledge production itself. Second, nearly every case of successful use of climate knowledge involved some kind of iteration between knowledge producers and users. The paper argues that, rather than an automatic outcome of the call for the production of usable science, iterativity is the result of the action of specific actors and organizations who 'own' the task of building the conditions and mechanisms fostering its creation. Several different types of institutional arrangements can accomplish this task, depending on the needs and resources available. While not all of the factors that enhance usability of science for decision making are within the realm of the scientific enterprise itself, many do offer opportunities for improvement. Science policy mechanisms such as the level of flexibility afforded to research projects and the metrics used to evaluate the outcomes of research investment can be critical to providing the necessary foundation for iterativity and production of usable science to occur. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Co-production of science and policy; Science policy; Seasonal climate forecasting; USGCRP","acid rain; climate change; climate prediction; decision making; decision support system; global change; policy implementation; resource availability; science and technology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956269132

Here we present a quantitative framework inspired by the greenhouse gas stabilization wedges of Pacala and Socolow. In our proposed framework, the damage avoided by each adaptation activity creates an 'adaptation wedge' relative to the loss that would occur without that adaptation activity. We use premium winegrape suitability in the western United States as an illustrative case study, focusing on the near-term period that covers the years 2000-39. We find that the projected warming over this period results in the loss of suitable winegrape area throughout much of California, including most counties in the high-value North Coast and Central Coast regions. However, in quantifying adaptation wedges for individual high-value counties, we find that a large adaptation wedge can be captured by increasing the severe heat tolerance, including elimination of the 50% loss projected by the end of the 2030-9 period in the North Coast region, and reduction of the projected loss in the Central Coast region from 30% to less than 15%. Increased severe heat tolerance can capture an even larger adaptation wedge in the Pacific Northwest, including conversion of a projected loss of more than 30% in the Columbia Valley region of Washington to a projected gain of more than 150%. We also find that warming projected over the near-term decades has the potential to alter the quality of winegrapes produced in the western US, and we discuss potential actions that could create adaptation wedges given these potential changes in quality. While the present effort represents an initial exploration of one aspect of one industry, the climate adaptation wedge framework could be used to quantitatively evaluate the opportunities and limits of climate adaptation within and across a broad range of natural and human systems. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptation; climate change; RegCM3; viticulture; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960294714

CH 4 is produced by anaerobic biodegradation of organic matter in landfilled MSW and constitutes a major component of landfill gas (LFG). Gas recovery is a suitable method to effectively control CH 4 emissions from landfill sites and the quantification of CH 4 emissions represents a good tool to evaluate the effectiveness of a gas recovery system in reducing LFG emissions. In particular, LFG emissions can indirectly be evaluated from mass balance equations between LFG production, recovery and oxidation in the landfill, as well as by a direct approach based on LFG emission measurements from the landfill surface. However, up to now few direct measurements of landfill CH 4 diffuse emissions have been reported in the technical literature. In the present study, both modeling and direct emission measuring methodologies have been applied to the case study of Bellolampo landfill located in Palermo, Italy. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate CH 4 diffuse emissions, based on direct measurements carried out with the flux accumulation chamber (static, non-stationary) method, as well as to obtain the CH 4 contoured flux map of the landfill. Such emissions were compared with the estimate achieved by means of CH 4 mass balance equations. The results showed that the emissions obtained by applying the flux chamber method are in good agreement with the ones derived by the application of the mass balance equation, and that the evaluated contoured flux maps represent a reliable tool to locate areas with abnormal emissions in order to optimize the gas recovery system efficiency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Anaerobic biodegradation; Anthropogenic sources; Diffuse emission; Direct approach; Direct emissions; Direct measurement; Emission measurement; Field measurement; Flux chambers; Gas recovery; Gas recovery systems; Landfill gas; Landfill site; Landfill surface; Mass balance equations; Methane emissions; Municipal landfills; Municipal solid waste landfills; Nonstationary; Technical literature; Biodegradation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Rating; Recovery; Waste disposal; methane; anthropogenic source; biodegradation; carbon emission; emission control; flux chamber; greenhouse gas; landfill; mass balance; methane; modeling; municipal solid waste; article; controlled study; intermethod comparison; Italy; landfill; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; municipal solid waste; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Cities; Environmental Pollutants; Italy; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Italy; Palermo [Sicily]; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958261171

The data studied were derived from observations performed on 192 woody species in 603 vegetation survey plots inside and outside protected areas. The species turn-over (β diversity) and the mutual information were assessed along the aridity gradient inside protected areas on one hand and outside protected areas on the other. Our study shows that the statistical links between the geographical distributions of species and the aridity gradient differ according to whether the observations are performed inside or outside the protected areas. Anthropogenic disturbances, mainly agricultural in the region of study, result in a decrease in the β diversity and in the average mutual information between the distribution of all the woody species and the climatic gradient. Moreover, the variation in mutual information differs according to the species: it diversely decreases with agricultural land-use for most of them, but increases for some. Thus, land-use leads to species-specific changes in the realised climatic niches. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Beta diversity; Climate gradient; Mutual information; Protected area; Savannah; Species distribution; West Africa","anthropogenic effect; aridity; climate change; disturbance; geographical distribution; land use change; phytogeography; protected area; savanna; Burkina Faso",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956106288

With more than US $12 billion development assistance to support the energy sector in the last 12 years, ADB was able to mobilize substantial support from 2005 onwards. The paper also shows that annual energy assistance was virtually stagnant and even lacking before 2005. Evidence suggests that some efforts are being made to fill the resource gap and to mitigate climate change especially in 2008. While analysis suggests that there has been a substantial increase in financing to lower greenhouse gas emitting energy projects, the shift tends to be fragile. ADB still favors financing large profitable projects and concentrates its portfolio mostly to selected regions and countries.

However, its inappropriate management during the last century has led to more frequent and catastrophic fires. Wildland fires are also recognized as one of the sources of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHG) that influence global climate change. As one of the techniques used to reduce the risk of destructive wildfires, prescribed burning has the potential of mitigating carbon emissions, and effectively contributes to the efforts proposed as part of the Clean Development Mechanism within the Kyoto protocol. In order to apply this concept to a real case, a simulation study was conducted in pine afforestation in the Andean region of Patagonia, Argentina, with the objective of evaluating the potential of prescribed burning for reducing GHG emissions. The scenario was established for a ten year period, in which simulated prescribed burning was compared to the traditional management scheme, which included the probability of annual average of wildfire occurrence based on available wildfire statistics. The two contrasting scenarios were: (1) managed afforestation, affected by the annual average rate of wildfires occurred in the same type of afforestation in the region, without prescribed burning, and (2) same as (1) but with the application of simulated prescribed burning. In order to estimate carbon stocks, and CO2 removals and emissions, we followed the guidelines given for GHG inventories on the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), while the terminology used was the established by IPCC (2003). Data of afforested area, thinnings, and biomass growth were taken from previous surveys in the study area. Downed dead wood and litter (forest fuel load, FFL) was estimated adjusting equations fitted to those fuels, based on field data. Results show that comparing the two scenarios, prescribed burning reduced CO2 emissions by 44% compared to the situation without prescribed burning. The prescribed burning scenario represented about 12% of the total emissions (prescribed burning plus wildfires). Furthermore, avoided wildfires by simulated prescribed burning allowed an additional 78% GHG emissions mitigation due to extra biomass growth. Simulated prescribed burning in commercial afforestation of Patagonia appears to be an effective management practice not only to prevent wildfires, but also an efficient tool to mitigate GHG emissions. However, more studies in different scenarios would be needed to generalize these benefits to other ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass growth; CO2 emissions; Emissions mitigation; Kyoto protocol; Prescribed burning","Biomass growth; CO2 emissions; Emissions mitigation; KYOTO protocol; Prescribed burning; Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Emission control; Fires; Global warming; Reforestation; Wood fuels; Greenhouse gases; afforestation; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; clean development mechanism; emission inventory; forest fire; greenhouse gas; growth rate; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; prescribed burning; wildfire; Argentina; Patagonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955885767

The data also indicate that innovation is highly concentrated in three countries-Japan, Germany, and the United States-which together account for 60 percent of total inventions. Surprisingly, the contribution of emerging economies is far from negligible as China and Brazil together account for about 10 percent of total inventions. However, inventions from emerging economies are less likely to find markets beyond their borders, suggesting that inventions from emerging economies have less value. More generally, international transfers occur mostly between developed countries (73 percent of all exported inventions).

Energy-efficient buildings, lower-emissions industrial processes, and more fuel-efficient transportation vehicles operating on cleaner fuels are among the many strategies that are being implemented. However, to attain the needed reductions, California must find additional strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, especially from the transportation sector, which is a large fraction of the total emissions problem. This paper discusses the efforts that are underway to further increase transportation efficiency, shift transportation to less CO2-intensive modes, and slow or reverse growth in vehicle-kilometers of travel (VKT). The legislative mandate is leading to a new focus on methods for quantifying travel changes and emissions reductions, ranging from spreadsheet approaches to integrated transportation-land use models. It also is renewing interest in travel-demand management and land-use policies that could reduce overall travel. While a number of cities have embraced these strategies, their success in the face of the state's continuing growth will likely depend on both federal and state policies and funding incentives. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.","California; Climate change; Environmental issues; Government policies; Planning; Transportation models; Urban development","California; Emissions reduction; Energy-efficient buildings; Environmental issues; Greenhouse-gas emissions; Industrial processs; Land-use policies; Reverse growth; State policy; Sustainable transportation; Total emissions; Transportation efficiency; Transportation models; Transportation sector; Transportation vehicles; Urban development; Use-model; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Forestry; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Land use; Laws and legislation; Transportation; climate change; emission control; environmental issue; greenhouse gas; strategic approach; transportation development; transportation planning; travel demand; urban development; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959258915

Box 52, 221 00 Lund, Sweden","With the publication of the IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS), CCS has emerged as a focal issue in international climate diplomacy and energy collaboration. This paper has two goals. The first goal is to map CCS activities in and among various types of intergovernmental organisations; the second goal is to apply International Relations (IR) theories to explain the growing diversity, overlap and fragmentation of international organisations dealing with CCS. Which international organisations embrace CCS, and which refrain from discussing it at all? What role do these institutions play in bringing CCS forward? Why is international collaboration on CCS so fragmented and weak? We utilise realism, liberal institutionalism and constructivism to provide three different interpretations of the complex global landscape of CCS governance in the context of the similarly complicated architecture of global climate policy. A realist account of CCS's fragmented international politics is power driven. International fossil fuel and energy organisations, dominated by major emitter states, take an active role in CCS. An interest-based approach, such as liberal institutionalism, claims that CCS is part of a ""regime complex"" rather than an integrated, hierarchical, comprehensive and international regime. Such a regime complex is exemplified by the plethora of international organisations with a role in CCS. Finally, constructivism moves beyond material and interest-based interpretations of the evolution of the institutionally fragmented architecture of global CCS governance. The 2005 IPCC Special Report on CCS demonstrates the pivotal role that ideas, norms and scientific knowledge have played in transforming the preferences of the international climate-change policy community. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS); Climate governance; Energy; Fossil fuels; International organisations; International Relations","carbon sequestration; environmental policy; fossil fuel; global perspective; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; international organization; international relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956287481

This assessment is based on MAC reduced forms, the generic specification of which enables simple parameterization and numerical computations. Such MAC curves are parameterized for each Member State using the outputs of a detailed model of the European agricultural supply. They are then used to compute total and marginal abatement costs involved by the BSA targets, as well as the cost-effective effort sharing, the corresponding emission price and abatement costs. The main findings are: (i) flexibility mechanisms such as a cap-and-trade system for agricultural emissions could reduce the total costs of meeting the 10% EU abatement target by a factor two to three relative to the strict implementation of each country's target, (ii) the corresponding equilibrium emission price is found to be 32-42/tCO2eq depending on the assumption regarding business-as-usual emissions, and (iii) a cap-and-trade system with allowances based on the BSA targets would involve substantial transfers from EU-15 countries to New Member States, an important share of which being made of 'hot air'. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Cap-and-trade system; European Union; Greenhouse gas emissions; Marginal abatement costs; Methane; Nitrous oxide","abatement cost; agricultural emission; cost-benefit analysis; ecological economics; emission control; emission inventory; emissions trading; European Union; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; numerical model; parameterization; quantitative analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958748163

This enabled to investigate the significance of local versus long-range sources of pollution and probe the effect of meteorological conditions (synoptic systems, ventilation rates, height of surface boundary layer, and wind speed) on level of pollution. During the Day of Atonement all traffic and most of the industrial activities cease in the Jewish populated parts of the country. We observed that in spite of this, concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) are very similar in all three urban centers during the Day of Atonement to the days before and after. Moreover, PM levels during the Day of Atonement are generally higher during Red Sea trough synoptic conditions which carry air from the Saudi and Jordanian deserts in the east and southeast relative to Persian Trough synoptic conditions which bring air from the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region in the north-west. In addition, 55% of the variation in PM values during the nine days of Atonement included in this study can be explained by changes in ventilation rates of the atmosphere, namely the product of the mixing depth and a representative boundary layer wind speed. Thus, long-range sources and local mixing conditions determine the concentrations of PM in the atmosphere of Israel as expected from their long residence time. On the other hand, NOx concentrations during the Day of Atonement are significantly lower than the days before and after, reflecting NOx short residence time in the atmosphere and the strong influence of local emission sources. Furthermore, the difference in concentrations of NOx in different Days of Atonement cannot be accounted for either by different synoptic conditions or by variations in ventilation rates, height of surface boundary layer, and wind speed. They are determined by the combination of local and regional sources of emission and the meteorological conditions which control their transport from these nearby sources to the sampling station. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Long-lived pollutants; NOx; PM; Pollution sources; Short-lived pollutants","Long-lived pollutants; NOx; PM; Pollution sources; Short-lived pollutants; Arid regions; Boundary layers; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Ventilation; Wind effects; Pollution; nitrogen oxide; air quality; atmospheric transport; boundary layer; human activity; industrialization; long range transport; Mediterranean environment; meteorology; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollutant source; traffic emission; urban region; wind velocity; air conditioning; article; environmental impact; Israel; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; priority journal; traffic; urban area; Black Sea; Indian Ocean; Israel; Red Sea [Indian Ocean]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955613230

However, concerns have been raised on the invasiveness of biofuel feedstocks. Estimating invasion potential remains a challenge because of inconsistencies and inherent limitations of using first-tier qualitative weed risk assessment (WRA) protocols singularly. We evaluated the usefulness of second-tier quantitative WRA methods using a recently introduced oilseed crop, Camelina sativa, as a model species. First, we subjected C. sativa to the qualitative Australian WRA and found that it should not be allowed entry. We then used demographic models fit with field-estimated parameters as a second-tier approach to quantitatively evaluate its invasion potential. Data on disturbance (two herbicides, mechanical, none) and seeding season (autumn, spring) relative to C. sativa demography were obtained over 2years in two rangeland ecosystems in Montana, USA. Population growth (λ) was forecast by developing population dynamics models using field data. Emergence rates were greatest when C. sativa was spring-seeded; all survivors to maturity occurred only in mechanically disturbed plots. Population growth rate never exceeded 0·03, and the maximum time to extinction was 6years. Perturbation analyses indicated that consistent propagule pressure and biologically improbable rates of seed survival are necessary to sustain C. sativa populations, indicating that the risk of invasion by this species in the studied ecosystems is low. Synthesis and applications.Although more site-years of demographic data would strengthen our conclusions about the invasion potential of C. sativa, we contend that the methods developed provide a useful contribution to WRA. If applied to proposed plant biofuel species, our second-tier quantitative refinements will elucidate important population dynamics often overlooked by qualitative WRAs and, in turn, may reduce the frequency of invasions or rejection of potentially useful species. © 2011 The Authors.

The problem encompasses comprehending variation in behavior among thousands to millions of people living in cities, as well as their contributions to the cities' GHG footprint. To help simplify this challenge, this article seeks to define and justify the partitioning of people into three categories of actors for understanding and mitigating GHGs at the city-scale. The three actor categories are policy actors, designers and operators of infrastructure and individual infrastructure users. By linking theories from across the social sciences, this article provides specific illustrations of the three actor categories and intertwines them with the goal of developing better GHG mitigation strategies. This paper concludes with a discussion of the need for meta-theoretical approaches toward describing and explaining the interactions among the social actor categories and GHG mitigation in cities. © 2011 Future Science Ltd.",,"GHG emission; GHG mitigation; Linking theory; Social actors; Social theory; Behavioral research; Greenhouse gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052079692

Geochemical analyses of the water, characterization of microbial communities by phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) and DNA sequence analyses, and calculations of free energy flux indicated thatmine-introduced microbial contaminants, dominated by β and γ Proteobacteria, Cenarchaeaceae and Candidatus Nitrososphaera, were flushedfrom the boreholes and replaced by fracture water derived microbial communities dominated by Firmicutes, Methanosarcinalesand Thermoproteaceaea. The fracture water was a mixture of paleometeoric water and 2.0 Ga old, diagenetically altered, hydrothermal fluid. The C and H isotopic data for indicated that the was primarily abiogenic in origin although ~35-50% of it might have originated from microbial methanogenesis. Noble gas analyses yielded estimated residence times of some 10 million years for the fracture water, which is estimated to represent a capture cross-section of 0.25-0.50 km2. The 16S rRNA and dsrAB gene sequences indicated that the indigenous bacterial communities were predominantly comprised of sulfate reducers belonging to the genera Desulfotomaculum, Candiditus Desulforudis and Desulfofustis. The sulfur isotopic analyses of sulfate and sulfide yielded fractionation Δ34S values ranging from 16 to 22% consistent with microbial sulfate reduction.Thermodynamic analyses indicate that methanogenic reactions are inhibited by the high partial pressure of abiogenic CH4 and that sulfate-reducing reactions are more favorable, which is consistent with the abundance of 16S rRNA genes belonging to known sulfate reducing bacteria.

We employed three different types of amine-grafted SBA-15 surfaces to quantify the effect distinct tethered amine moieties have on the chemistry of CO2 interacting with amine-grafted SBA-15. When the SBA-15 surface has a low density of amines and is ""capped"" to mitigate against interactions with surface-bound moieties, no new chemical species are observed on exposure to carbon dioxide. An ionic carbamate and a surface-bound carbamate are observed on the other SBA-15 surfaces on exposure to CO2. The formation of carbamates decreases the bond order of the carbon oxygen bond of the carbon dioxide molecule. The role of the different amine moieties and the surface silanol groups in the formation of the carbamates is discussed.

Many authors and policy practitioners consider therefore that decisions over policy, mitigation strategies and capacity for adaptation to climate change require construction and coordination over multiple levels of governance to arrive at acceptable local, regional and global management strategies. However, how such processes of coordination and decision-aiding can occur and be maintained and improved over time is a major challenge in need of investigation. We take on this challenge by proposing research-supported methods of aiding multi-level decision-making processes in this context. Four example regionally focussed multi-level case studies from diverse socio-political contexts are outlined-estuarine management in Australia's Lower Hawkesbury, flood and drought management in Bulgaria's Upper Iskar Basin, climate policy integration in Spain's Comunidad Valenciana and food security in Bangladesh's Faridpur District-from which insights are drawn. Our discussion focuses on exploring these insights including: (1) the possible advantages of informal research-supported processes and specifically those that provide individual arenas of participation for different levels of stakeholders; (2) the complexity of organisation processes required for aiding multi-level decision-making processes; and (3) to what extent progress towards integrated regional policies for climate change aware sustainable development can be achieved through research-supported processes.

Many cities and urban areas are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Local governments play an important role in implementing climate change policies. This paper explores the key factors shaping climate change policy in terms of both enabling conditions for action and the barriers that many urban centres face in taking on the challenge of mitigating and adapting to climate change. It goes beyond the analysis of single case study and captures the diversity of alternatives and contexts of cities involvement in climate action worldwide based on a meta-analysis of 38 cities worldwide. Enabling elements such as good governance, democratic and participatory institutions, and availability of different types of resources, knowledge and information on what and how to act together with the presence of a localchampion often appear supporting climate change policy making.

Our goal was to estimate types and quantities of materials used and factors related to workplace exposure reductions among companies manufacturing or using engineered carbonaceous nanomaterials (ECNs). Methods: Information was collected through phone surveys on work practices and exposure control strategies from 30 participating producers and users of ECN. The participants were classified into three groups for further examination. Results: We report here the use of exposure control strategies. Observed patterns suggest that large-scale manufacturers report greater use of nanospecific exposure control strategies particularly for respiratory protection. Conclusion: Workplaces producing or using ECN generally report using engineering and administrative controls as well as personal protective equipment to control workplace employee exposure.

Our aim was to quantify the net effect of future climate scenarios on the productivity and total GHG emissions from pasture based dairy systems in 4 regions of south-eastern Australia using the biophysical model DairyMod. In each region, a single paddock in the grazing rotation of a dairy farm was simulated. This paddock was grazed at a stocking density of 50 lactating dairy cows/ha for a period of one day each time the pasture biomass reached 2.2t dry matter (DM)/ha. In this way, the annual stocking rate (i.e., cows/ha) reflected the number of times that the paddock was grazed annually. No supplementary feed was offered to the animals. Model estimates of annual pasture intake, stocking rate, milk production, CH4 and N2O emissions were compared at each site in a baseline climate (1971-2000) and 3 future climate scenarios representing increasingly warm and dry conditions, termed the '2030', '2070 mid' and '2070 high' scenarios. At Kyabram (northern Victoria) summer irrigated perennial pastures were modelled in the baseline scenario, with supplementary irrigated annual pasture systems simulated in the baseline scenario for comparison, and in the future scenarios. At Terang (south-western Victoria), Ellinbank (south-eastern Victoria) and Elliott (north-western Tasmania) dryland perennial pastures were modelled. In dryland systems, increased pasture intake, stocking rate and milk production was modelled in all future scenarios for the cool temperate climate at Elliott, with reduced production in the '2070 mid' and '2070 high' scenarios at Ellinbank and Terang. At Kyabram, productivity of the annual system was lower than the perennial system in the baseline scenario, but increased in future climates, assuming adequate irrigation water availability. Among sites and climate scenarios, annual per cow GHG emissions were 3.4-5.5t CO2 equivalents (CO2e), with CH4 making 0.63-0.89 of total emissions. Annual emissions per unit area ranged from 2.6 to 13.1t CO2e/ha among sites and climate scenarios, and generally reflected stocking rates. However, in the future scenarios, there were changes in N2O emissions at dryland sites due to increased direct N2O losses and lower indirect N2O through volatilisation and leaching. Annual emission intensities ranged from 7.5 to 10.9t CO2e/t milk protein plus fat among sites and climate scenarios. The lowest emissions intensity was at Elliott, which also had little change in future climates. At Terang and Ellinbank, the emission intensity was 8.8t CO2e/t MS in the baseline climate, but this increased by more than 20% in the 2070 high scenario. Results suggest that pasture based production systems can continue as the basis of the dairy industry in north-western Tasmania, but lower production and higher emission intensity at Terang and Ellinbank suggest that systems adaptations are required to meet future GHG emissions reduction goals.This paper is part of the special issue entitled: Greenhouse Gases in Animal Agriculture - Finding a Balance between Food and Emissions, Guest Edited by T.A.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the determinants of urban GHG emissions in order to explain these differences. Design/methodology/approach: Seven global cities - Bangkok, Chicago, London, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan and New York City - have been included in the paper's sample. These cases have been chosen in order to represent a variety of characteristics and contexts of developed and developing countries and according to data availability. A first level of analysis regards local GHG emission inventories, which attribute emissions to activity sectors. Sectorial emissions are then evaluated to quantify the relevance of several determinants: climate conditions, urban form, economic activities in place, state of technology, mobility and housing infrastructures and costs, and income and life style. Findings: Determinants show different weights in influencing behaviours at city level, and ultimately depend on economic, technical, social and cultural factors. Beside a significant role of climate conditions, urban density appears as the main determinant in shaping residential emissions from direct fuel consumption, whereas, for electricity, consumption patterns and technological features of power generation play a major role. For ground transport, urban form affecting mobility patterns and technological features of the vehicle stock stand out as the most significant determinants. Originality/value: The paper provides a deep insight into urban GHG emission values, making use of a comprehensive set of urban data and highlighting several areas which could possibly be targeted in cities' GHG reduction policies. An enhanced and widened set of data could improve the paper's results in a significant way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cities; Climate change; Emission indicators; Urban areas; Urban emissions","climate change; comparative study; developing world; economic activity; emission control; fuel consumption; global change; greenhouse gas; lifestyle; mobility; pollution policy; world city; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Chicago; England; Federal District [Mexico]; Illinois; Italy; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Lombardy; London [England]; Madrid [Spain]; Mexico [North America]; Mexico City; Milan; Milano [Lombardy]; New York [United States]; Spain; Thailand; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864565133

We aimed to better understand how nonsucculent plants of a water-limited gradient encompassing xeric desert to mesic mountain-top may respond to changes in summer conditions. We used a species-rich 26-yr flowering record to determine species' relationships with precipitation and temperature in months coincident with and previous to flowering. The onset of summer flowering was strongly influenced by the amount and timing of July precipitation, regardless of elevation or life form, suggesting the critical importance of soil moisture in triggering summer flowering in this region. Future changes in the timing or consistency of the early monsoon will probably impact directly on the onset of flowering for many species in this region. In addition, a key implication of predicted increasing temperatures is a decrease in available soil moisture. At all elevations, many species may be expected to flower later in the summer under the decreased soil moisture conditions associated with warmer temperatures. However, impacts on summer flowering may be greater at higher elevations, because of the greater sensitivity of mesic plants to water stress. © 2011 The Authors.

We used soil physical fractionation, soil respiration kinetics, and the isotopic composition of soil respiration to investigate microbial degradation of accrued SOC in sandy loam soils along a chronosequence of C3woody plant encroachment into a C4-dominated grassland in southern Texas. Our previous work in this system demonstrated significant changes in the chemistry and abundance of lignin and aliphatic biopolymers within particulate soil fractions during the first 40 yrs of woody plant encroachment, indicating selective accrual of purportedly more recalcitrant plant chemicals. However, during the long-term soil laboratory incubation presented herein, a greater proportion of SOC was mineralized in soils from older woody stands (34-86 yrs) than in soils from younger woody stands (14-23 yrs) and grasslands, providing no evidence for greater biochemical recalcitrance as a controlling mechanism for SOC accrual. In addition, δ13C values of respired CO2 indicate that the mineralized SOC was predominately of C3 origin from all woody stands along the chronosequence, and that respired CO2 was primarily derived from the free light fraction (density &lt;1.0 g/cm3) and macroaggregate-sized soil fraction. Our data suggested that the location of SOC among soil fractions was more important than plant polymer chemistry in determining SOC turnover rates during incubation. Surprisingly, estimates of the size and turnover rate of the active SOC pool based on respiratory kinetics did not increase with woody encroachment, and the turnover rate of the slower SOC pool decreased, again supporting the notion that increases in biochemically recalcitrant biopolymers did not hinder decomposition in the lab. These data indicate environmental conditions that may allow for C accrual in the field were alleviated during the controlled incubation. Therefore, C accrual in these sandy loam soils following woody encroachment should not be assumed stable, and this factor should be taken into account when considering responses of SOC to climate change or when making management decisions regarding land cover impacts on SOC. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biochemical recalcitrance; Long-term soil incubation; Microbial respiration; Soil organic carbon accrual; Soil physical fractions; Stable carbon isotopes; Woody plant encroachment","Biochemical recalcitrance; Long-term soil incubation; Microbial respiration; Soil organic carbon accrual; Stable carbon isotopes; Woody plants; Biodegradation; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Isotopes; Lakes; Landforms; Organic carbon; Physiology; Soil conditioners; Soils; accumulation; biochemical composition; biodegradation; biogeochemical cycle; C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; decomposition; environmental conditions; estimation method; fractionation; isotopic composition; laboratory method; land cover; loam; management practice; mineralization; polymer; sandy loam; savanna; shrub; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil respiration; stand structure; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958119318

We perform a technical and economic assessment and estimate the economic costs and net GHG reductions from a national 25 percent RPS by 2025 relative to coal-based electricity. This policy would reduce GHG emissions by about 670 million metric tons per year, 11 percent of 2008 U.S. emissions. The first 100 million metric tons could be abated for less than $36/metric ton. However, marginal costs climb to $50 for 300 million metric tons and to as much as $70/metric ton to fulfill the RPS. The total economic costs of such a policy are about $35 billion annually. We also examine the cost sensitivity to favorable and unfavorable technology development assumptions. We find that a 25 percent RPS would likely be an economically efficient method for utilities to substantially reduce GHG emissions only under the favorable scenario. These estimates can be compared with other approaches, including increased R&D funding for renewables or deployment of efficiency and/or other low-carbon generation technologies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable portfolio standards; Technology development","Economic assessments; Economic costs; Efficient method; Electricity sector; Generation technologies; GHG emission; Low-carbon; Marginal costs; Renewable electricity; Renewable portfolio standard; Renewable portfolio standards; Renewable resource; Renewables; Technology development; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electricity; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Standardization; Technology; Gas emissions; carbon emission; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; energy policy; greenhouse gas; renewable resource; research and development; technological development; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953330823

During the last decade, and particularly since the mid-2000s, the development community has begun to engage seriously with the issue of climate change and its implications for the world's poor. This has led to a growing interaction with the climate research community. Recent climate literature is used to explore four research themes and identify knowledge gaps and areas with potential to adapt climate research for development needs. The first theme considers the development and use of seasonal forecasts and their portrayal by some as a relative success story, but with important skill limitations and need for much greater interaction with users. Forecast use is set within a wider context of generally low scientific understanding of the drivers of Africa's high climate variability and low research capacity. The second theme addresses the main influences on African climate variability and their response to climate change; high levels of uncertainty for future rainfall in some regions where remote influences are poorly resolved in global climate models. The third theme summarizes key elements of climate impacts research and shows a situation of rather ad hoc case studies and little engagement with decision-makers. Recent studies reveal an important move to couple more effectively impacts research with adaptation by focusing on the near future and drawing on current climate-society relationships. The fourth theme looks at the emerging evidence of anthropogenic climate change and secondary effects on African environments and, apart from widespread warming, shows an equivocal situation with evidence for anthropogenic ocean warming affecting regional rainfall. Detection is hampered by data availability and high levels of background variability. Finally, three emergent issues are discussed: (1) reflection on African climate research capacity and international collaboration suggests it is timely to review experiences from recent climate programs in Africa; (2) attempts to untangle climate signals from within complex livelihood systems face significant methodological challenges. These include the need to reconcile scientific observations and local perceptions and to clarify views that may over-simplify climate-society interactions, to avoid construction of a crisis narrative on Africa and climate change; (3) the challenge of linking climate science with decision-making to inform adaptation. Demand for information and confidence often exceeds what climate science can realistically achieve in many parts of Africa. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Climate models; Climatology; Decision making; International cooperation; Rain; Anthropogenic climate changes; Climate variability; Decision making process; Development community; Global climate model; International collaborations; Research capacities; Scientific observations; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961220425

The model comprises three types of aerobic heterotrophic cells (non-growing cells, growing cells with chromate reductase activity, and growing cells that have lost the chromate reductase activity), and five soluble compounds (organic substrate, ammonia nitrogen, non-metabolizable soluble products, dissolved oxygen, and hexavalent chromium). Two processes are considered responsible for the reduction of Cr(VI). The first one is the reduction of Cr(VI) coupled with growth, the second process is coupled with the endogenous decay of the biomass. The model was calibrated using the results obtained in batch cultures in the absence of carbon and nitrogen sources, using different initial Cr(VI) concentrations (0-100 mgCr L-1), two carbon sources (cheese whey and lactose), and different initial nitrogen to carbon ratio (0-50 mgN gCOD-1). The calibrated model was used to calculate steady-state values of TSS, soluble COD, TAN and Cr(VI) in continuous systems, obtaining a good agreement with the experimental data. The model also accurately predicted the transient concentration of Cr(VI) as a function of time in response to step changes of the inlet Cr(VI) concentration in continuous systems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Activated sludge; Chromium toxicity; Cr(VI) reduction; Kinetic parameter; Mathematical modeling; Nitrogen to carbon ratio","Ammonia; Batch cell culture; Biomass; Carbon; Cells; Chromates; Continuous time systems; Cytology; Dissolved oxygen; Kinetic parameters; Mathematical models; Nitrogen; Activated sludge; Biological reductions; Carbon ratio; Chromium toxicity; Cr reductions; Multiple substrates; Steady-state values; Transient concentration; Ecology; ammonia; carbon; chromium; dissolved oxygen; lactose; nitrogen; oxidoreductase; activated sludge; biomass; calibration; chromium; concentration (composition); dissolved oxygen; enzyme activity; experimental study; growth rate; numerical model; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; reduction; substrate; activated sludge; article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; mathematical model; microbial biomass; nonhuman; priority journal; reduction; steady state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955415559

For fluorescent imaging, in which the typical illumination sources are mercury or xenon lamps, LEDs offer the advantages of a longer lifespan, greater spatial and temporal stability, elimination of the need for mechanical shutters and neutral density filters, significantly lower cost of ownership, and reduction of photon dose at the specimen. Additionally, LEDs permit vibration-free, high-speed spectral and temporal modulation.

The grids are compared in their 2006 configuration with the addition of coal-based CO2 capture retrofits and emissions penalties from 0 to 100 US dollars per metric ton of CO 2 (USD/tCO2). CO2 capture flexibility is investigated by comparing inflexible CO2 capture systems to flexible ones that can choose between full-and zero-load CO2 capture depending on which operating mode has lower costs or higher profits. Comparing these two grids is interesting because they have similar installed capacity and peak demand, and both are isolated electricity systems with competitive wholesale electricity markets. However, differences in capacity mix, demand patterns, and fuel markets produce diverging behaviours of CO2 capture at coal-fired power plants. Coal-fired facilities are primarily base load in ERCOT for a large range of CO2 prices but are comparably later in the dispatch order in GB and consequently often supply intermediate load. As a result, the ability to capture CO2 is more important for ensuring dispatch of coal-fired facilities in GB than in ERCOT when CO2 prices are high. In GB, higher overall coal prices mean that CO2 prices must be slightly higher than in ERCOT before the emissions savings of CO 2 capture offset capture energy costs. However, once CO2 capture is economical, operating CO2 capture on half the coal fleet in each grid achieves greater emissions reductions in GB because the total coal-based capacity is 6GW greater than in ERCOT. The market characteristics studied suggest greater opportunity for flexible CO2 capture to improve operating profits in ERCOT, but profit improvements can be offset by a flexibility cost penalty. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon capture and sequestration; carbon dioxide capture; coal; electricity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960305588

PNe represent powerful astrophysical probes. They are important dynamical tracers, key sources of interstellar medium chemical enrichment, windows into late stellar evolution and potent cosmological yardsticks. However, their utility depends on separating them unequivocally from the many nebular mimics which can strongly resemble bona fide PNe in traditional optical images and spectra. We merge new PNe from the carefully evaluated, homogeneous Macquarie-AAO-Strasbourg Hα PN Project (MASH-I) and MASH-II surveys, which offer a wider evolutionary range of PNe than hitherto available, with previously known PNe classified by SIMBAD. Mid-infrared (MIR) measurements vitally complement optical data because they reveal other physical processes and morphologies via fine-structure lines, molecular bands and dust. MIR colour-colour planes, optical emission-line ratios and radio fluxes show the unambiguous classification of PNe to be complex, requiring all available evidence. Statistical trends provide predictive value and we offer quantitative MIR criteria to determine whether an emission nebula is most likely to be a PN or one of the frequent contaminants such as compact HII regions or symbiotic systems. Prerequisites have been optical images and spectra, but MIR morphology, colours, environment and a candidate's MIR-to-radio flux ratio provide a more rigorous classification. Our ultimate goal is to recognize PNe using only MIR and radio characteristics, enabling us to trawl for PNe effectively even in heavily obscured regions of the Galaxy. © 2011 The Authors.

We show that the biases caused by ignoring urban processing on the global values of total aerosol surface concentration, the total aerosol column abundance, the aerosol optical depth (AOD), the absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD), and the top of the atmosphere radiative forcing (TOA) respectively are +26 ± 23%, +51 ± 12 10%, +42 ± 108%, +8 ± 1816%, and -0.27 ± 0.100.14 W/m2.

In regard to human health, these concerns are founded upon the plethora of knowledge gained from research relating to the effects observed following exposure to environmental air pollution. It is known that increased exposure to environmental air pollution can cause reduced respiratory health, as well as exacerbate pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Such disease states have also been associated with exposure to the NP component contained within environmental air pollution, raising concerns as to the effects of NP exposure. It is not only exposure to accidentally produced NPs however, which should be approached with caution. Over the past decades, NPs have been specifically engineered for a wide range of consumer, industrial and technological applications. Due to the inevitable exposure of NPs to humans, owing to their use in such applications, it is therefore imperative that an understanding of how NPs interact with the human body is gained. In vivo research poses a beneficial model for gaining immediate and direct knowledge of human exposure to such xenobiotics. This research outlook however, has numerous limitations. Increased research using in vitro models has therefore been performed, as these models provide an inexpensive and high-throughput alternative to in vivo research strategies. Despite such advantages, there are also various restrictions in regard to in vitro research. Therefore, the aim of this review, in addition to providing a short perspective upon the field of nanotoxicology, is to discuss (1) the advantages and disadvantages of in vitro research and (2) how in vitro research may provide essential information pertaining to the human health risks posed by NP exposure. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Environmental air pollution; Human health; In vitro testing strategies; Nanoparticle; Nanotechnology; Nanotoxicology; NP exposure; Toxicity","nanoparticle; titanium dioxide; air pollution; bioaccumulation; cardiovascular disease; coculture; DNA damage; environmental exposure; environmental factor; genotoxicity; health hazard; human; in vitro study; inflammation; lung clearance; monoculture; nanotechnology; nanotoxicology; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particle size; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; review; risk assessment; tissue distribution; toxicity testing; Air Pollutants; Animal Testing Alternatives; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Cytological Techniques; Humans; Materials Testing; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Reproducibility of Results; Toxicity Tests",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958578869

This contributes to high levels of malnutrition and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). A popular approach to improvement is localization-reducing direct transport (farm to retail distance, or ""food miles""). We examined Santa Barbara County (SBC) California, which mirrors the high production, nutritional and environmental problems, and growing localization movement of California. SBC ranks in the top 1% of US counties in value of agricultural products, and >80% of this value is produce (fruits and vegetables). We calculated the amount of produce grown in and consumed in SBC and estimated that >99% of produce grown in SBC is exported from the county, and >95% of produce consumed in SBC is imported. If all produce consumed in SBC was grown in the county (100% localization), it would reduce GHGE from the agrifood system <1%, and not necessarily affect nutrition. While food miles capture only a portion of the environmental impact of agrifood systems, localization could be done in ways that promote synergies between improving nutrition and reducing GHGE, and many such efforts exist in SBC. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Agri-food system; California; Environmental problems; Fruit and vegetables; Santa Barbara; Weak links; Environmental impact; Fruits; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Nutrition; Vegetables; Gas emissions; agricultural production; emission control; environmental impact; estimation method; fruit; greenhouse gas; nutrition; vegetable; article; carbon footprint; food industry; food intake; fruit; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; nutrition; United States; vegetable; Agriculture; Air Pollution; California; Carbon Footprint; Conservation of Natural Resources; Diet; Fruit; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Nutrition Surveys; Transportation; Vegetables; California; Santa Barbara [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955993172

In this scenario, CO2-rich and 14C-depleted subsurface Antarctic-sourced water, ventilates the thermocline where it is purged to the atmosphere in the equatorial regions, a view that has been met with conflicting results. Using a novel approach (paired surface and deep-dwelling planktonic foraminifer radiocarbon analyses), we document that the equatorial Atlantic thermocline did not see old, 14C-depleted water, which would be characteristic of the proposed isolated deep ocean CO2 reservoir. Data from several studies concur that, during the deglaciation, Antarctic intermediate waters were contributing to Atlantic thermocline waters even more than today, therefore, our observations challenge the current purging hypothesis.

The chemical and isotopic compositions of the fluid discharges indicate the occurrence of two main sources: 1) relatively shallow aquifers with Ca(Na,K)-HCO3 and Ca(Mg)-HCO3 compositions when trapped in volcanic and sedimentary formations, respectively; and 2) a deep reservoir, which is hosted in the Mesozoic carbonate sequence, rich in CO2 and having a Ca-SO4(HCO3) composition. Dissolution of a CO2-rich gas phase into the shallow aquifers produces high-TDS and high-pCO2 cold waters, while oxidation of deep-derived H2S to SO42- generates low-pH (&lt;4) sulfate waters. The δ13C-CO2 values for gas emissions (from -2.8 to +2.7‰ vs. VPDB) suggest that the origin of CO2 associated with the deep fluids is mainly related to thermo-metamorphic reactions within the carbonate reservoir, although significant mantle contribution may also occur. However, R/Ra values (0.37-0.62) indicate that He is mainly produced by a crustal source, with a minor component from a crust-contaminated mantle. On the basis of the δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4 values (from -25.7 to -19.5‰ vs. VPDB and from -152 to -93.4‰ vs. VSMOW, respectively) CH4 production is associated with thermogenic processes, possibly related to abiogenic CO2 reduction within the carbonate reservoir. The δ34S-H2S values (from +9.3 to +10.4‰ vs. VCDT) are consistent with the hypothesis of a sedimentary source of sulfur from thermogenic reduction of Triassic sulfates. Geothermometric evaluations based on chemical equilibria CO2-CH4 and, separately, H2S suggest that the reservoir equilibrium temperature is up to ~300°C. The δD and δ18O data indicate that water recharging both the shallow and deep aquifers has a meteoric origin. Fluid geochemistry, coupled with gravimetric data and tectonic lineaments, supports the idea that significant contributions from a deep-seated geothermal brine are present in the Stigliano thermal fluid discharges. Exploration surveys investigated this area during 70's-90's for geothermal purposes. Nevertheless, presently the area is still under-exploited. The presence of thermal waters and anomalous heat flow together with the demographic growth of the last years, makes this site a suitable location for direct applications of the geothermal resource. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Central italy; Gas; Geochemistry; Geothermometry; Stable isotope; Water","Abiogenic; Carbonate reservoir; Central Italy; Chemical equilibriums; Cold waters; Crustal sources; Deep fluids; Deep reservoirs; Demographic growth; Equilibrium temperatures; Fluid discharge; Fluid geochemistry; Gasphase; Geothermal brines; Geothermal resources; Geothermometry; Gravimetric data; Heat flows; Isotopic composition; Mesozoic carbonates; Metamorphic reactions; Minor components; Sedimentary formation; Shallow aquifers; Stable isotope; Tectonic lineaments; Thermal fluids; Thermal waters; Triassic; Volcanic district; Aquifers; Calcium; Carbonation; Dissolution; Fluids; Gas emissions; Geochemical surveys; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Hydrogeology; Isotopes; Lakes; Sedimentology; Sodium; Sulfur; Surveys; Volcanoes; Water resources; Hydrochemistry; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; chemical composition; discharge; dissolution; geochemistry; geothermometry; gravimetry; heat flow; hydrogen sulfide; isotopic composition; lineament; methane; oxidation; stable isotope; thermal water; volcanic gas; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Sabatini Mountains; Tolfa Mountains; Viterbo; Calluna vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954612723

The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) projections, obtained by applying standard methods to the results of the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Experiment, includes estimates of ocean thermal expansion, the melting of glaciers and ice caps (G&ICs), increased melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and increased precipitation over Greenland and Antarctica, partially offsetting other contributions. The AR4 recognized the potential for a rapid dynamic ice sheet response but robust methods for quantifying it were not available. Illustrative scenarios suggested additional sea level rise on the order of 10 to 20 cm or more, giving a wide range in the global averaged projections of about 20 to 80 cm by 2100. Currently, sea level is rising at a rate near the upper end of these projections. Since publication of the AR4 in 2007, biases in historical ocean temperature observations have been identified and significantly reduced, resulting in improved estimates of ocean thermal expansion. Models that include all climate forcings are in good agreement with these improved observations and indicate the importance of stratospheric aerosol loadings from volcanic eruptions. Estimates of the volumes of G&ICs and their contributions to sea level rise have improved. Results from recent (but possibly incomplete) efforts to develop improved ice sheet models should be available for the 2013 IPCC projections. Improved understanding of sea level rise is paving the way for using observations to constrain projections. Understanding of the regional variations in sea level change as a result of changes in ocean properties, windstress patterns, and heat and freshwater inputs into the ocean is improving. Recently, estimates of sea level changes resulting from changes in Earth's gravitational field and the solid Earth response to changes in surface loading have been included in regional projections. While potentially valuable, semi-empirical models have important limitations, and their projections should be treated with caution. © 2011 by The Oceanography Society.

In order to resolve the problem of wastewater discharge from hydrogen production in green energy sustainable houses, this study proposes wastewater chemical oxygen demand (COD) treatment research, and suggests the use of two-stage anaerobic treatment to produce two types of bio-energy i.e. hydrogen and methane, while simultaneously reducing COD levels. Methane production employed a condensed molasses fermentation solubles (CMS) and hydrogen fermentation tank effluent as a substrate to test the COD reducing efficiency and overall efficiency of methane production. It was found that if CMS is used during the hydrolysis and acidogenesis stages, the maximum carbohydrate degradation rate will be approximately 70% (F/M ratio of 1.9-2.3), and the COD removal rate will increase from 15 to 20% (F/M ratio of 1.9-2.3) to 68% (F/M ratio of 0.5). This study showed that the total gas (H2 and CH4) production yield from effluent of hydrogen fermentation tank (56.2 KJ/mol substrate) is greater than the value for CMS. In this study, a 3.2 m3 anaerobic hydrogen reactor is evaluated to provide a family with 3-4 kW of power. When acclimatization is performed under conditions of 20 g COD/L substrate and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h, the COD removal rate can reach approximately 50%. If a methane-generating reactor with a 95% COD removal rate is used to degrade effluent from the hydrogen reaction tank, it will be possible to reduce the COD of organic effluent to under 500 mg/L. Since this water quality is not far from that of ordinary untreated household wastewater (approximately 300-500 mg COD/L), the effluent can be discharged into a community sewer system and treated in a community sewage treatment facility. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University Dementia Clinic. Participants: Twenty-two AD patients including 11 early-onset AD (EOAD: onset <65 years) and 11 late-onset AD (LOAD: onset 65years) cases with matched dementia severity, duration of illness, and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele number. Intervention: C-PiB positron emission tomography scans. Measurements: Both region of interest and voxel-based analyses were performed to compare C-PiB retention between EOAD and LOAD groups, and to test linear relationship between age-at-onset and C-PiB retention. Results: Both region of interest (ROI) and voxel-based analyses revealed that EOAD patients had significantly higher C-PIB retentions than LOAD patients in diffuse brain regions including frontal, lateral parietal, lateral temporal, and occipital cortex, and basal ganglia. Subgroup analyses showed that negative correlation between age-at-onset and C-PiB retention was significant in LOAD but not in EOAD. Conclusions: Our finding of a heavier Aβ burden in the brain of living EOAD patients than LOAD patients is in agreement with those from postmortem studies. The inverse relationship between age-at-onset and Aβ burden is possibly associated with aging-related decrease of brain or cognitive reserve and with aging-related increase of brain vulnerability. © 2011 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.","11C-PIB; Alzheimer disease; amyloid-beta; early-onset; late-onset","amyloid beta protein; apolipoprotein E4; Pittsburgh compound B; adult; aged; allele; Alzheimer disease; article; basal ganglion; clinical article; disease duration; disease severity; frontal cortex; human; occipital cortex; onset age; parietal cortex; positron emission tomography; temporal cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960210779

As such, the current study investigated the industrial emissions of four major and three other hazardous air pollutants in four infareas of the Yeongnam area in Korea over five years (2005 through 2009), using direct stack monitoring concentrations, which were obtained from tel-monitoring systems. Yearly variations in the industrial emissions of the target pollutants depended upon the infareas and chemical types. For example, the total suspended particulate (TSP) emissions in Geongnam increased for two consecutive years (2007 and 2008) and then, decreased in 2009, whereas the industrial CO emissions in Ulsan sharply increased since 2007. For TSP, primary metal manufacturing (PMM) and Power, electricity and gas supplying companies (PEGSC) were two major industrial emission sources. PEGSC exhibited the highest source for both SO 2 and NO x emissions, followed by PMM and petroleum and petrochemical companies in descending order. For CO emissions, PPM exhibited the highest source, followed by municipal waste treatment and intermediate waste treatment facilities in descending order. Both NH 3 and HF were emitted primarily from two infareas (Ulsan and Geongbuk), which have fertilizer production companies. Both Geongnam and Geongbuk exhibited the highest and the second highest HCl emissions, presumably due to emissions during the acid treatment processes of various metals. Most of the industry categories, which are associated with fuel combustions or waste incineration, exhibited the highest and the second highest emission proportions for NO x and SO 2, respectively. Maximum emissions were observed in the winter or summer season, while minimum emissions were observed in the spring or fall season, presumably due to increased energy utilizations for residential as well as industrial heating and cooling. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Fuel-combustion; Industrial category; Industrial source; Seasonal variation; Waste incineration","Acid treatments; Air pollutants; CO emissions; Emission inventories; Fertilizer production; Fuel-combustion; Hazardous air pollutants; Industrial category; Industrial sources; Metal manufacturing; Municipal waste; Petrochemical company; Real monitoring; Seasonal variation; Stack emissions; Stack monitoring; Summer season; Target pollutants; Tele-monitoring; Total suspended particulates; Air pollution; Fuels; Incineration; Industry; Monitoring; Particulate emissions; Refuse incinerators; Sulfur dioxide; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Industrial emissions; atmospheric pollution; combustion; cooling; electricity industry; emission inventory; gas industry; heating; incineration; industrial emission; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; telemetry; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960473840

The beam head of the Siemens Primus accelerator has been taken as the starting point for the study of the conceived beam head modifications. The direction-selective filter (DSF) system developed in this work is midway between the classical flattening filter (FF) by which homogeneous transversal dose profiles have been established, and the flattening filter-free (FFF) design, by which advantages such as increased dose rate and reduced production of leakage photons and photoneutrons per Gy in the irradiated region have been achieved, whereas dose profile flatness was abandoned. The DSF concept is based on the selective attenuation of bremsstrahlung photons depending on their direction of emission from the bremsstrahlung target, accomplished by means of newly designed small conical filters arranged close to the target. This results in the capture of large-angle scattered Compton photons from the filter in the primary collimator. Beam flatness has been obtained up to any field cross section which does not exceed a circle of 15 cm diameter at 100 cm focal distance, such as 10 × 10 cm2, 4 × 14.5 cm2 or less. This flatness offers simplicity of dosimetric verifications, online controls and plausibility estimates of the dose to the target volume. The concept can be utilized when the application of small- and medium-sized homogeneous fields is sufficient, e.g. in the treatment of prostate, brain, salivary gland, larynx and pharynx as well as pediatric tumors and for cranial or extracranial stereotactic treatments. Significant dose rate enhancement has been achieved compared with the FF system, with enhancement factors 1.67 (DSF) and 2.08 (FFF) for 6 MV, and 2.54 (DSF) and 3.96 (FFF) for 15 MV. Shortening the delivery time per fraction matters with regard to workflow in a radiotherapy department, patient comfort, reduction of errors due to patient movement and a slight, probably just noticable improvement of the treatment outcome due to radiobiological reasons. In comparison with the FF system, the number of head leakage photons per Gy in the irradiated region has been reduced at 15 MV by factors 1/2.54 (DSF) and 1/3.96 (FFF), and the source strength of photoneutrons was reduced by factors 1/2.81 (DSF) and 1/3.49 (FFF). © 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",,"COMPTON; Cross section; Delivery time; Dose profile; Dose rate; Enhancement factor; Flattening filters; Focal distances; Homogeneous field; MONTE CARLO; Monte Carlo Simulation; On-line controls; Patient comfort; Patient movement; Photon beams; Primary collimator; Reduced production; Reduction of errors; Salivary glands; Siemens; Source strength; Target volumes; Treatment outcomes; Computer simulation; High energy physics; Monte Carlo methods; Neutrons; Particle beams; Patient treatment; Photoelectrons; Photons; article; computer assisted radiotherapy; human; methodology; Monte Carlo method; neutron; photon; radiation dose; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Neutrons; Photons; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960364315

Test aerosols used for certification of particulate respirators (PRs) include sodium chloride (NaCl), dioctyl phthalate, and paraffin oil. These aerosols are generally assumed to be worst case surrogates for aerosols found in the workplace. No data have been published to date on the performance of PRs with welding fumes, a hazardous aerosol that exists in real workplace settings. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of respirators and filters against a NaCl aerosol and a welding fume aerosol and determine whether or not a correlation between the two could be made. Fifteen commercial PRs and filters (seven filtering facepiece, two replaceable single-type filters, and six replaceable dual-type filters) were chosen for investigation. Four of the filtering facepiece respirators, one of the single-type filters, and all of the dual-type filters contained carbon to help reduce exposure to ozone and other vapors generated during the welding process. For the NaCl test, a modified National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health protocol was adopted for use with the TSI Model 8130 automated filter tester. For the welding fume test, welding fumes from mild steel flux-cored arcs were generated and measured with a SIBATA filter tester (AP-634A, Japan) and a manometer in the upstream and downstream sections of the test chamber. Size distributions of the two aerosols were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Penetration and pressure drop were measured over a period of aerosol loading onto the respirator or filter. Photos and scanning electron microscope images of clean and exposed respirators were taken. The count median diameter (CMD) and mass median diameter (MMD) for the NaCl aerosol were smaller than the welding fumes (CMD: 74 versus 216 nm; MMD: 198 versus 528 nm, respectively). Initial penetration and peak penetration were higher with the NaCl aerosol. However, pressure drop increased much more rapidly in the welding fume test than the NaCl aerosol test. The data and images clearly show differences in performance trends between respirator models. Therefore, general correlations between NaCl and weld fume data could not be made. These findings suggest that respirators certified with a surrogate test aerosol such as NaCl are appropriate for filtering welding fume (based on penetration). However, some respirators may have a more rapid increase in pressure drop from the welding fume accumulating on the filter. Therefore, welders will need to choose which models are easier to breathe through for the duration of their use and replace respirators or filters according to the user instructions and local regulations. © The Author 2011.","NaCl; penetration through PPE; pressure drop; respirator testing; welding fumes","Aerosol loading; Count median diameters; Dioctyl phthalate; Filtering facepiece; Filtration efficiency; Increase in pressure; Local regulations; Mass median diameters; NaCl; National institute for occupational safety and healths; penetration through PPE; Scanning Electron Microscope; Scanning mobility particle sizer; Surrogate tests; Test chambers; welding fumes; Welding process; Worst case; Atmospheric aerosols; Carbon steel; Fumes; Occupational risks; Ozone; Paraffin oils; Paraffin waxes; Paraffins; Pressure drop; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium; Sodium chloride; Testing; Welding; Respirators; carbon; ozone; sodium chloride; aerosol; air pollutant; airway resistance; article; atmospheric pressure; comparative study; equipment design; evaluation; exposure; filtration; gas mask; human; instrumentation; manometry; materials testing; methodology; occupational health service; particle size; pressure; scanning electron microscopy; standard; statistics; United States; welding; Aerosols; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Air Pressure; Airway Resistance; Carbon; Equipment Design; Filtration; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Manometry; Materials Testing; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (U.S.); Ozone; Particle Size; Pressure; Respiratory Protective Devices; Sodium Chloride; United States; Welding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960363015

Satellite observations revealed its origins in a dust storm in Southern Ukraine, where large amounts of soil were resuspended from dried-out farmlands by wind gusts up to 30 m/s. Maximum particulate matter (PM10) mass concentrations between 200 and 1400 μg m-3 occurred in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany along the pathway of the plume from East to West. In order to achieve a better understanding of the processes involved and their interaction the numerical simulation of this event was done by using a new parameterization of dust emission under certain conditions. A simplified dust emission scheme, proposed by Shao (2004), is implemented in the EURAD -Model (European Air Pollution Dispersion Model).

While China has long strived for increasing food production capacity for its large and still growing population, the high emissions cost, especially from the over use of agro-chemicals, has been widely debated for the last decade. However, the CF of China's crop production has not yet been assessed. This paper reports a basic estimate of CF of crop production using national statistical data available for the period of 1993-2007. The dataset includes the amount of individual agricultural inputs (fertilizer, pesticide, diesel, plastic film, etc.), cultivation area and total of production whole crops. Using the emission factors estimated for China's agricultural features and available abroad, the mean overall CF of China's crop production was estimated to be 0.78±0.08tCEha-1yr-1 and 0.11±0.01tCEt-1yr-1, for land use and bulk production respectively. For the duration the data covered, the carbon intensity under cultivation land use was seen to increase since 1993. Among the total, fertilizer induced emissions exerted the largest contribution of ∼60%, being 0.45±0.04tCE per ha and 0.07±0.01tCE per ton of production, on average. Compared to the UK, the estimated overall CF of China's crop production was higher in terms of cultivation land use. While there was a significant positive correlation of carbon intensity with total production, carbon efficiency was shown in a decreasing trend during 2003-2007. Therefore, low carbon agriculture should be pursued, and the priority should be given to reducing fertilizer application in agriculture of China. However, for developing best management practices for climate change mitigation in crop production of China, further studies of crop and regional specific CFs and the variation with climate conditions and agricultural managements are needed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon efficiency; Carbon footprint; China agriculture; Climate change mitigation; Crop production","agricultural management; assessment method; carbon; climate change; correlation; cost-benefit analysis; crop production; cultivation; data set; emission; estimation method; fertilizer application; food consumption; management practice; population structure; statistical analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051585391

They differed in terms of their point of regulation and in whether in-state-to-out-of-state and out-of-state-to-in-state electricity sales are regulated. In this paper, we formulate a market equilibrium model for each of the three approaches, considering power markets, transmission limitations, and emissions trading, and making the simplifying assumption of pure bilateral markets. We analyze the properties of their solutions and show the equivalence of load-based, first-seller, and source-based approaches when in-state-to-out-of-state sales are regulated under the cap. A numeric example illustrates the emissions and economic implications of the models. In the simulated cases, ""leakage"" eliminates most of the emissions reductions that the regulations attempt to impose. Furthermore, ""contract reshuffling"" occurs to such an extent that all the apparent emissions reductions resulting from changes in sources of imported power are illusory. In reality, the three systems would not be equivalent because there will also be pool-type markets, and the three systems provide different incentives for participating in those markets. However, the equivalence results under our simplifying assumptions show that load-based trading has no inherent advantage compared to other systems in terms of costs to consumers, contrary to claims elsewhere. © 2011 INFORMS.","CO2 emissions; Electric market; Emissions trading; First-seller; Load-based; Source-based","Electric markets; Emissions Trading; First-seller; Load-based; Source-based; Carbon dioxide; Lakes; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960493505

The structure and morphology of the modified ZnO NRs were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM measurement showed that the dispersion of ZnO NRs could be dramatically improved by the surface modification of HTph-OH and further annealing treatment at its liquid crystal state temperature (150 °C). The remarkable decrease of the annealed composite film roughness is because the HTph-OH chains self-organize into more ordered structure induced by mesogens after annealing treatment, which may push the ZnO NRs to form oriented nano-dispersing structure. The optical properties of the modified ZnO NRs were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Markedly enhanced band-edge ultraviolet photoluminescence and significantly reduced defect-related emission were observed. We attribute this observation to the nearly perfect surface passivation of the ZnO NRs by the HTph-OH molecules. Meanwhile, UV emission of modified ZnO NRs could be further enhanced by increasing the concentration of HTph-OH and annealing treatment at its liquid crystal state temperature. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

How the modified urban geometry affects the urban climate and therefore human thermal comfort has become a primary concern for urban planners. The present study takes a simulation approach to analyze the influence of urban geometry on the urban climate and maps this climatic understanding from a quantitative perspective. A geographical building database is used to characterize two widely discussed aspects: urban heat island effect (UHI) and wind dynamics. The parameters of the sky view factor (SVF) and the frontal area density (FAD) are simulated using ArcGIS-embedded computer programs to link urban geometry with the UHI and wind dynamic conditions. The simulated results are synergized and classified to evaluate different urban climatic conditions based on thermal comfort consideration. A climatic map is then generated implementing the classification. The climatic map shows reasonable agreement with thermal comfort understanding, as indicated by the biometeorological index of the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) obtained in an earlier study. The proposed climate mapping approach can provide both quantitative and visual evaluation of the urban environment for urban planners with climatic concerns. The map could be used as a decision support tool in planning and policy-making processes.

The EPA revised the particle standards and FRM in 1997 to include PM2.5. In 2005, EPA proposed revisions to this NAAQS to include PM10-2.5 but only finalized revisions with a PM2.5 FRM and the development of a national monitoring network in 2006. Presently, no EPA designated reference or equivalent method sampler has the ability to directly measure the mass concentrations of PM10, PM10-2.5, and PM2.5 simultaneously. An additive approach has been used for samplers like the dichotomous monitors to calculate PM10 mass concentrations from independent measures of PM10-2.5 and PM2.5 (i.e. PM10=PM10-2.5+PM2.5). A differential approach has been used to calculate PM10-2.5 from identical collocated PM10 and PM2.5 samplers (i.e. PM10-2.5=PM10-PM2.5). Since these two approaches have been used widely for PM measurements, it is informative to evaluate their precision and comparability.EPA performed collocated tests of five different particle samplers in the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina to evaluate the comparability and to characterize the additive and differential approaches used to determine particle mass concentrations. The intra-sampler precision of MiniVol, Omni, and dichotomous samplers was less than 8.4%. The precision of PM10 measurements using the additive approach with dichotomous samplers was less than 3.5%. The poorest precision of the various PM10-2.5 differential approaches was less than 15.1%. No zero or negative PM10-2.5 concentrations were calculated using the differential approach. A coefficient of determination of 0.81 or higher was obtained for all paired comparison of PM10-2.5. The reported test results show that concentrations calculated from both the additive and differential approaches generally agree among the portable samplers, the more established dichotomous sampler and the Federal Reference Methods. © 2011.","Additive and differential approaches; PM10-2.5; PM10; PM2.5","A-coefficient; Differential approach; Equivalent method; Federal reference methods; Field evaluation; Mass concentration; Monitoring network; National Ambient Air Quality Standards; North Carolina; Paired comparison; Particle mass; Particle standards; Test results; US Environmental Protection Agency; Air pollution control; Air quality; Air quality standards; Particles (particulate matter); Environmental Protection Agency; air quality; air sampling; ambient air; concentration (composition); environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; field method; particle size; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; precision; sampler; air sampler; article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; field experiment; particle size; particulate matter; portable equipment; priority journal; United States; North Carolina; Research Triangle Park; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959898940

As the internet has increasingly become an online platform for sharing environmental information, public responses to the need for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may be assessed using available online tools. We used Google Insights for Search, Google AdWords Keyword Tool, and Google Timeline View to assess public responses in Japan based on the interest shown for five search terms that define global climate change and its mitigation policies. Data on online search interests from January 04, 2004 to July 18, 2010 were analyzed according to locations and categories. Our study suggests that the search interests for the five chosen search terms dramatically increased, especially when new mitigation policies were introduced or when climate change related events were organized. Such a rapid increase indicates that the Japanese public strongly responds to climate change mitigation policies. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Eco-point; Global warming; Google Insights for Search; Kyoto Protocol; My bag; Tool","Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Climate change mitigation; Environmental activities; Environmental information; Environmental law; Global climate changes; Mitigation measures; Mitigation policies; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Electronic assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867593824

There is a need to establish baseline GHG emission accounting protocols that provide consistent, reproducible, comparable and holistic GHG accounts that incorporate in-boundary and transboundary GHG impacts of urban activities and support policy intervention. This article provides a synthesis of previously published GHG accounts for cities by organizing them according to their in-boundary and transboundary considerations, and reviewing three broad approaches that are emerging for city-scale GHG emissions accounting: geographic accounting, transboundary infrastructure supply chain (TBIS) footprinting, and consumption-based footprinting. The TBIS and consumption-based footprints are two different approaches that result in different estimates of a community's GHG emissions, and inform policies differently, as illustrated with a case study of Denver, CO, USA. The conceptual discussions around TBIS and consumption-based footprints indicate that one single metric (e.g., GHG/person) will probably not be suitable to represent GHG emissions associated with cities, and it will take a combination of variables for defining a low-carbon city. © 2011 Future Science Ltd.",,"Footprinting; GHG emission; Low-carbon; Support policy; Trans-boundary; Supply chains; Greenhouse gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052088614

In the present study diversity of rumen methanogens in Murrah buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) from North India was evaluated by using mcr-A gene library obtained from the pooled PCR product from four animals and by using MEGA4 software. A total of 104 clones were examined, revealing 26 different mcr-A gene sequences or phylotypes. Of the 26 phylotypes, 16 (64 of 104 clones) were less than 97% similar to any of the cultured strain of methanogens. Seven clone sequences were clustered with Methanomicrobium mobile and three clone sequences were clustered with Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii during the phylogenetic analysis. Uncultured group of methanogens comes out to be the major component of the methanogens community structure in Murrah buffaloes. Methanomicrobium phylotype comes out to be major phylotype among cultured methanogens followed by Methanobrevibacter phylotype. These results help in making effective strategies to check the growth of dominant communities in the rumen of this animal which in turn help in the reduction of methane emission in the environment and ultimately helps us in fighting with the problem of global warming. © 2011 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","mcr-A gene; methanogens; Murrah buffaloes; phylogenetics","animal; archaeal gene; article; buffalo; classification; DNA sequence; Euryarchaeota; genetics; male; microbiology; molecular genetics; phylogeny; Animals; Buffaloes; Euryarchaeota; Genes, Archaeal; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Animalia; Bubalus; Bubalus bubalis; Methanobrevibacter; Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii; Methanomicrobium; Methanomicrobium mobile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052299526

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether learning climate moderates the relationship between error-producing conditions and medication errors. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was done using data from 279 nursing units in 146 randomly selected hospitals in the United States. Error-producing conditions included work environment factors (work dynamics and nurse mix), team factors (communication with physicians and nurses' expertise), personal factors (nurses' education and experience), patient factors (age, health status, and previous hospitalization), and medication-related support services. Poisson models with random effects were used with the nursing unit as the unit of analysis. Results: A significant negative relationship was found between learning climate and medication errors. It also moderated the relationship between nurse mix and medication errors: When learning climate was negative, having more registered nurses was associated with fewer medication errors. However, no relationship was found between nurse mix and medication errors at either positive or average levels of learning climate. Learning climate did not moderate the relationship between work dynamics and medication errors. Discussion: The way nurse mix affects medication errors depends on the level of learning climate. Nursing units with fewer registered nurses and frequent medication errors should examine their learning climate. Future research should be focused on the role of learning climate as related to the relationships between nurse mix and medication errors. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","learning climate; medication errors; nurse mix","adult; article; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; human; learning; medication error; middle aged; multicenter study; nonbiological model; nursing staff; organization; organization and management; personnel management; Poisson distribution; regression analysis; United States; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Learning; Medication Errors; Middle Aged; Models, Organizational; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Organizational Culture; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Poisson Distribution; Regression Analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051754074

Gas samples were taken monthly from 34 backyard composting bins from January to April 2009. Averaged over the study period, the aerobic composting bins released lower amounts of CH4 (2.2 mg m- 2 h-1) than the anaerobic digestion bins (9.5 mg m-2 h-1) and the vermicomposting bins (4.8 mg m-2 h-1). The vermicomposting bins had lower N2O emission rates (1.2 mg m-2 h- 1) than the others (1.5-1.6 mg m-2 h-1). Total GHG emissions including both N2O and CH4 were 463, 504 and 694 mg CO 2-e m- 2 h-1 for vermicomposting, aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion, respectively, with N2O contributing &gt;80% in the total budget. The GHG emissions varied substantially with time and were regulated by temperature, moisture content and the waste properties, indicating the potential to mitigate GHG emission through proper management of the composting systems. In comparison with other mainstream municipal waste management options including centralized composting and anaerobic digestion facilities, landfilling and incineration, home composting has the potential to reduce GHG emissions through both lower on-site emissions and the minimal need for transportation and processing. On account of the lower cost, the present results suggest that home composting provides an effective and feasible supplementary waste management method to a centralized facility in particular for cities with lower population density such as the Australian cities. © The Author(s) 2010.","anaerobic digestion; Greenhouse gases; home composting; organic waste; vermicomposting","Aerobic composting; Australia; Backyard composting; Brisbane; Brisbane , Australia; Composting systems; Emission rates; Gas samples; GHG emission; home composting; Household waste; Landfilling; Lower cost; Management method; Management options; Moisture contents; Municipal waste; Organic wastes; Population densities; Total budget; Treatment methods; Vermi-composting; Bins; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Sewage; Waste incineration; Waste management; Anaerobic digestion; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; chemical environmental conditions; composting; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; greenhouse gas; incineration; landfill; methane; moisture content; municipal solid waste; nitrous oxide; temperature effect; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; article; Australia; carbon footprint; composting; cost; domestic waste; environmental temperature; home aerobic composting; incineration; landfill; moisture; municipal solid waste; population density; priority journal; solid waste management; traffic and transport; vermicomposting; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Queensland; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Australia; Brisbane; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955088435

We have developed an ultra low temperature (≤450°C) process for carbonyl ligand modified NiO thin films based on the chemical solution deposition (CSD) for correlated electron random access memory (CeRAM) applications. CeRAMs form the general class of devices that use the electron-electron interaction as the primary mode of operation. These devices are fabricated in the conductive state (born-ON), thus, they do not require electroforming to enter the variable resistance state. Several process parameters such as film stoichiometry, thickness, annealing temperature and ambient have been investigated to optimize CeRAMs properties. We present the coordination number fine tuning' in NiO ultra thin films via carbonyl ligand doping that regulate the number of oxygen vacancies and the surface excess of metal ions. CeRAMs contrary to just standard NiO based resistive memories use the pure Mott-like charge transfer insulator in which an abrupt metal to insulator transition is the dominant mechanism without the aid of charge trapping vacancies. In our films the effect of the oxygen vacancies are canceled due to the stabilizing effect of the carbonyl based extrinsic ligand. In this paper, detailed process sequence and the extrinsic ligand doping scheme is described in some length. It is shown that complexes formed by the introduction of the extrinsic ligand promote Ni 2+ ions to enter the disproportionation reaction Ni2+ Ni2+→Ni1+ Ni3+ which is considered to be responsible for the memory mechanism. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.",,"Annealing temperatures; Carbonyl ligand; Charge-transfer insulators; Chemical solution deposition; Coordination number; Correlated electrons; Disproportionation reactions; Dominant mechanism; Film stoichiometry; Fine tuning; General class; Memory mechanism; Metal-to-insulator transitions; Mode of operations; NiO thin film; Process parameters; Random access memories; Resistive switching; Stabilizing effects; Surface excess; Transition-metal oxides; Ultra low temperatures; Variable resistance; Carbonylation; Charge transfer; Complexation; Deposition; Electroforming; Electron-electron interactions; Electrons; Ion exchange; Ligands; Metal insulator transition; Metal ions; Optimization; Oxygen; Oxygen vacancies; Semiconductor doping; Stoichiometry; Thin films; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Vapor deposition; Random access storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959525265

Biomass comes from trees and vegetables, so they provide a renewable type of energy. However, biomass plants location, along with their provisioning basins, are heavily regulated by economical aspects, often without careful consideration of their environmental footprint. For example, some Italian biomass plants import from overseas palm-tree oil that is economically convenient. However, the energy consumed for the oil transportation is definitely greater than the energy produced by the palm-tree oil burning. In this way biomass power plants turn out to be environmentally inefficient, even if they produce renewable energy. We propose an Integer Linear Programming approach for defining the energy and cost-efficient biomass plant location along with the corresponding provisioning basin. In addition, the model enables to evaluate existing plants and their energy and cost efficiency. Our study is based on real data gathered in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.

In order to examine the extent to which these impacts can be addressed in decision-making, the paper develops a framework for testing the effectiveness of environmental assessment practice in these two regions, and applies it to both.

We report results from the CLIMAITE experiment, where the effects of these three climate change parameters were investigated solely and in all combinations in a temperate heathland. Field measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes took place 1-2 years after the climate change manipulations were initiated. The soil was generally a net sink for atmospheric CH4. Elevated temperature (T) increased the CH4 uptake by on average 10 μg C m-2 h-1, corresponding to a rise in the uptake rate of about 20%. However, during winter elevated CO2 (CO2) reduced the CH4 uptake, which outweighed the positive effect of warming when analyzed across the study period. Emissions of N2O were generally low (&lt;10 μg N m-2 h-1). As single experimental factors, elevated CO2, temperature and summer drought (D) had no major effect on the N2O fluxes, but the combination of CO2 and warming (TCO2) stimulated N2O emission, whereas the N2O emission ceased when CO2 was combined with drought (DCO2). We suggest that these N2O responses are related to increased rhizodeposition under elevated CO2 combined with increased and reduced nitrogen turnover rates caused by warming and drought, respectively. The N2O flux in the multifactor treatment TDCO2 was not different from the ambient control treatment. Overall, our study suggests that in the future, CH4 uptake may increase slightly, while N2O emission will remain unchanged in temperate ecosystems on well-aerated soils. However, we propose that continued exposure to altered climate could potentially change the greenhouse gas flux pattern in the investigated heathland. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","CLIMAITE; Climate change; Ecosystem manipulation; Greenhouse gas; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Rewetting; Sandy soil; Shrubland; Treatment interaction","CLIMAITE; Nitrous oxide; Re-wetting; Sandy soils; Shrublands; Treatment interaction; Anesthetics; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric temperature; Drought; Ecosystems; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Carbon dioxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); drought; ecosystem response; environmental factor; experimental study; flux measurement; frequency analysis; global warming; greenhouse gas; heathland; methane; nitrous oxide; sandy soil; shrubland; summer; temperate environment; temperature effect; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958121258

As renewable resources are almost identical in the three locations, the magnitude of energy demand and schedule are the distinctive parameters of each facility. We considered how to choose the optimum angle of the PV array, the preference between the solar and wind and the desirability of whether or not the diesel generator.

It has long been recognised that public perceptions can have a fundamental effect on the market for technology and this issue raises questions about the role society will play in developing a low emissions energy future. Understanding how the public will respond to the range of low emission energy technologies as part of a climate change mitigation package is therefore critical for researchers, policy makers and industry stakeholders. In the current research, we investigated the Australian public's likely acceptance of a range of low emission energy technologies by assessing the diverse 'orientations' that have emerged in response to low emission energy technologies. In a survey of two Australian states we measured the support for, and knowledge of, a range of low emission energy technologies. Using self-organising maps, a relatively new approach for segmenting response profiles, we identified that at least four distinct 'orientations' have emerged toward the issue and are characterising the likely acceptance of these technologies: 'Disengaged', 'Nuclear Oriented', 'Renewables Oriented', and 'Engaged'. The implications of these multiple public viewpoints are described for climate change mitigation policy and for future research into the social acceptance of alternative energy technologies. © 2010 Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).",,"Alternative energy technologies; Climate change mitigation; Energy future; Industry stakeholders; Low emission; Market for technology; Policy makers; Public acceptance; Public perception; Renewables; Research and development; Response profile; Self-organising maps; Social acceptance; Sustainable energy systems; Climate change; Developing countries; Research; Technology; alternative energy; climate change; developing world; energy market; environmental issue; environmental legislation; environmental policy; future prospect; perception; policy making; research and development; self organization; stakeholder; sustainable development; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960946116

The path from current high bypass ratio (BPR) engines to ultra high BPR engines via geared turbo fans will enable a significant reduction in SFC and CO2 emissions. However, in order to reach the emission levels set by the advisory council for aeronautics research in Europe (ACARE), the introduction of more complex cycles that can operate at higher thermal efficiencies is required. Studies have shown that one possibility of achieving higher core efficiencies and hence lower SFC is through the use of an intercooled recuperated (1CR) core. The concept engine, expected to enter into service around 2020, will make use of a conventional fin plate heat exchangers (HEX) for the intercooler and a tube type HEX as the recuperator. Although the introduction of these two components promises a significant reduction in SFC levels, they will give also rise to higher engine complexity, pressure losses and additional weight. Thus, the performance of the engine relies not only on the behaviour of the usual gas turbine components, but will be heavily dependent on the two heat exchangers. This paper seeks to introduce a heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHEX) as alternative designs for the intercooler and the recuperator. The proposed HPHEX designs for application in an ICR aero engine take advantage of the convenience of the geometry of miniature heat pipes to provide a reduction in pressure losses and weight when compared to conventional HEX. The proposed HPHEX intercooler design eliminates any ducting to and from the intercooler, offering up to 32% reduction in hot pressure losses, 34% reduction in cold pressure losses and over 41% reduction in intercooler weight. On the other hand the proposed HPHEX recuperator design can offer 6% improvement in performance, while offering 36% reduction in cold pressure losses, up to 80% reduction in hot pressure losses and over 31% reduction in weight. An ICR using HPHEX for the intercooler and recueprator may offer up to 2·5% increase in net thrust, while still offering 3% reduction in SFC and up to 7·7% reduction in NOx severity parameter, when compared to the ICR using conventional HEX.",,"Aircraft engines; Bypass ratio; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Efficiency; Engines; Gas turbines; Heat exchangers; Recuperators; Advisory council; Aero engine parts; Aeronautics research; Alternative designs; Gas turbine manufacturers; Heat pipe heat exchangers; Miniature heat pipes; Thermal efficiency; Heat pipes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961143535

However, such a SAM-SWR teleconnection has been recently questioned. Using observational data in the post-1979 satellite era, it is shown that such a SAM influence does exist. This coherence is confirmed with 1150 years of modelled 20th century SWR anomalies and SAM values from 23 climate models, showing that a nonlinear impact operates: the influence from a negative SAM is greater than that from a positive SAM. This explains why a small positive shift in the SAM can cause a large SWR reduction, as has been observed. A further test shows that models with a greater positive SAM trend systematically produce a greater future SWR reduction. As all climate models project an increase in the SAM these results suggest that as global warming continues unabated, SWWA winter droughts will be more persistent as atmospheric conditions become more unfavourable for drought-breaking rains.

CMAQ simulations using SAPRC07C and the previously released version, SAPRC99, were performed and compared for an episode during July- August, 2000. Ozone (O3) predictions of the SAPRC07C simulation are generally lower than those of the SAPRC99 simulation in the key areas of central and southern California, especially in areas where modeled concentrations are greater than the federal 8-hr O3 standard of 75 parts per billion (ppb) and/or when the volatile organic compound (VOC)/nitrogen oxides (NOx) ratio is less than 13. The relative changes of ozone production efficiency (OPE) against the VOC/NOx ratio at 46 sites indicate that the OPE is reduced in SAPRC07C compared with SAPRC99 at most sites by as much as approximately 22%. The SAPRC99 and SAPRC07C mechanisms respond similarly to 20% reductions in anthropogenic VOC emissions. The response of the mechanisms to 20% NOx emissions reductions can be grouped into three cases. In case 1, in which both mechanisms show a decrease in daily maximum 8-hr O3 concentration with decreasing NOx emissions, the O3 decrease in SAPRC07C is smaller. In case 2, in which both mechanisms show an increase in O3 with decreasing NOx emissions, the O3 increase is larger in SAPRC07C. In case 3, SAPRC07C simulates an increase in O3 in response to reduced NOx emissions whereas SAPRC99 simulates a decrease in O3 for the same region. As a result, the areas where NOx controls would be disbeneficial are spatially expanded in SAPRC07C. Although the results presented here are valuable for understanding differences in predictions and model response for SAPRC99 and SAPRC07C, the study did not evaluate the impact of mechanism differences in the context of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance for using numerical models in demonstrating air quality attainment. Therefore, additional study is required to evaluate the full regulatory implications of upgrading air quality models to SAPRC07. © 2011 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Air navigation; Air quality; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality models; Community multi-scale air qualities; Emission reduction; Model inter comparisons; Photochemical modeling; Southern California; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Quality control; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air pollution; article; exhaust gas; photochemistry; priority journal; United States; air; air pollutant; chemical model; computer simulation; exposure; government; human; isolation and purification; maximum allowable concentration; photochemical smog; standard; Air; Air Pollutants; California; Computer Simulation; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Maximum Allowable Concentration; Models, Chemical; Nitrogen Oxides; Oxidants, Photochemical; Ozone; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959805375

The BA corresponds to a total area of 5×106km2 from which 4×106km2 was originally covered by the rain forest. One way to interfere with the net balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions is to increase the forest area to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. The single most important cause of depletion of the rain forest is cattle ranching. In this work, we present an effective policy to reduce the net balance of CO2 emissions using optimal control theory to obtain a compromising partition of investments in reforestation and promotion of clear technology to achieve a CO2 emission target for 2020. The simulation indicates that a CO2 emission target for 2020 of 376 million tonnes requires an estimated forest area by 2020 of 3,708,000km2, demanding a reforestation of 454,037km2.

Participants: Children with asthma, residing with a smoker, randomly assigned to interventions consisting of air cleaners only (n=41), air cleaners plus a health coach (n=41), or delayed air cleaner (control) (n=44). Main Outcome Measures: Changes in PM, air nicotine, and urine cotinine concentrations and symptomfree days during the 6-month study. Results: The overall follow-up rate was high (91.3%). Changes in mean fine and coarse PM (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10) concentrations (baseline to 6 months) were significantly lower in both air cleaner groups compared with the control group (mean differences for PM2.5 concentrations: control, 3.5 μg/m3; air cleaner only, -19.9 μg/m3; and air cleaner plus health coach, -16.1 μg/m3; P=.003; and PM 2.5-10 concentrations: control, 2.4 μg/m3; air cleaner only, -8.7 μg/m3; and air cleaner plus health coach, -10.6 μg/m3; P=.02). No differences were noted in air nicotine or urine cotinine concentrations. The health coach provided no additional reduction in PM concentrations. Symptom-free days were significantly reduced in both air cleaner groups compared with the control group (P=.03). Conclusion: Although the use of air cleaners can result in a significant reduction in indoor PM concentrations and a significant increase in symptom-free days, it is not enough to prevent exposure to secondhand smoke.

A new approach to this problem is presented here using an extensively tagged chemical mechanism, in which the direct effects of VOC on ozone are calculated using a single model run. The results of this approach are consistent with previous work, but deliver much more detailed information about the VOC intermediate oxidation products involved in the production of ozone. We show that different classes of VOC exhibit very different temporal evolution in their ozone production potential, with alkenes and reactive aromatic VOC producing ozone rapidly, while the ozone production potential of alkanes increases in the day after they are emitted. We suggest that this is related to the rate at which these different classes of compounds are able to produce very small oxidation fragments. This multi-day ozone production potential has implications for emission control strategies for the management of air quality in polluted regions. We also relate the ozone production potential of VOC to the OH reactivity of the VOC oxidation intermediates, and show that the early oxidation products of alkenes and reactive aromatics are more efficient at producing ozone in their subsequent reactions with OH than similarly reactive alkanes.

We use this framework for an empirical assessment of the 100 largest US electricity producers within three different carbon scenarios. Our results show that in a scenario without changes in the US institutional environment electricity producers will not face a severe increase of their carbon exposure and only a small improvement regarding the carbon intensity of the electricity mix is achieved. In a scenario with more carbon-constrained US energy market conditions some companies face a financial risk from using and emitting carbon that more than triples compared to today.

A multi-1D model for particular organic carbon (POC) degradation, gas hydrate formation and dissolution is presented. The novel reaction-transport model contains an open three-phase system of two solid compounds (organic carbon, gas hydrates), three dissolved species (methane, sulfates, inorganic carbon) and one gaseous phase (free methane). The model computes time-resolved concentration profiles for all compounds by accounting for chemical reactions as well as diffusive and advective transport processes. The reaction module builds upon a new kinetic model of POC degradation which considers a down-core decrease in reactivity of organic matter. Various chemical reactions such as organic carbon decay, anaerobic oxidation of methane, methanogenesis, and sulfate reduction are resolved using appropriate kinetic rate laws and constants. Gas hydrates and free gas form if the concentration of dissolved methane exceeds the pressure, temperature, and salinity-dependent solubility limits of hydrates and/or free gas, with a rate given by kinetic parameters. Global input grids have been compiled from a variety of oceanographic, geological and geophysical data sets including a new parameterization of sedimentation rates in terms of water depth. We find prominent gas hydrate provinces offshore Central America where sediments are rich in organic carbon and in the Arctic Ocean where low bottom water temperatures stabilize methane hydrates. The world's total gas hydrate inventory is estimated at 0.82×1013m3-2.10×1015m3CH4 (at STP conditions) or, equivalently, 4.18-995 Gt of methane carbon. The first value refers to present day conditions estimated using the relatively low Holocene sedimentation rates; the second value corresponds to a scenario of higher Quaternary sedimentation rates along continental margins. Our results clearly show that in-situ POC degradation is at present not an efficient hydrate forming process. Significant hydrate deposits in marine settings are more likely to have formed at times of higher sedimentation during the Quaternary or as a consequence of upward fluid transport at continental margins. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"continental margin; degradation; dissolution; gas hydrate; methane; numerical model; offshore engineering; organic carbon; oxidation; parameterization; reactive transport; sedimentation rate; solubility; Arctic Ocean; Central America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960334953

Identification of major sources contributing to PM2.5 is an important step in the formulation of effective reduction strategies. This study uses the U.S. EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system with the brute-force method (BFM) to conduct source apportionment of PM2.5 for 10 source categories over the eastern U.S. at a 12 km horizontal grid resolution for both January and July of 2002. Biomass burning is found to be the greatest contributor to domainwide PM2.5 with a monthly-mean domainwide contribution of ~14% (1.1 μg m-3). The next two largest contributors in January are miscellaneous area sources and coal combustion with contributions of ~12% (0.9 μg m-3) and ~11% (0.9 μg m-3), respectively. In July, coal combustion, miscellaneous area sources, and industrial processes are the top three contributors (by ~31% (2.3 μg m-3), ~9% (0.7 μg m-3), and ~7% (0.5 μg m-3), respectively). Site-specific source contributions indicate that industrial processes and biomass burning are the most important sources of PM2.5 at urban and rural sites, respectively, in January, while coal combustion dominates at both sites in July. While the BFM is theoretically simple and can capture indirect effects resulting from the interactions among precursor and secondary pollutants in the real atmosphere, it is computationally expensive and assumes that the source contributions to each emission category are additive. This assumption does not hold for secondary PM components because of the highly non-linear relationships between precursor emissions and all secondary PM components and, therefore, source apportionment provides no useful information whatsoever on the possible effect of emission reductions on secondary PM. © Author(s) 2011.","Brute Force Sensitivity Analysis; CMAQ; Source apportionment; Southeastern U.S",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861711460

Responses to climate change, however, are embedded in institutional procedures, technological pathways and cultural practices that are characterized by deep inertia. By paying express attention to linkages among disciplines, this paper takes steps towards contributing a richer definition of the development path concept, identifying realms of inquiry that may together be called a 'development path' literature and discussing ways in which this sheds light on effective responses to global climate change. This paper reveals the value of fundamentally inter-disciplinary approaches to climate change responses, the necessity of a deeper understanding of the context of action on climate change and the ubiquity of path dependence. Rooted in the underlying socio-technical, institutional and socio-cultural development paths, barriers to action may best be addressed through contextually specific, inter-disciplinary analyses of collective human behaviour. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.","Behaviour change; Climate change; Institutions; Path dependency; Sustainable development","climate change; environmental planning; environmental policy; interdisciplinary approach; planning theory; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957580965

In a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature, we found significantly reduced overall ecotoxicity of municipal wastewaters treated with either ozone (n=667) or activated carbon (=113), while TiO2 and UV was not yet assessed. As comparative investigations regarding the detoxification potential of these advanced treatment techniques in municipal wastewater are scarce, we assessed them in four separate Gammarus-feeding trials with 20 replicates per treatment. These bioassays indicate that ozone concentrations of approximately 0.8mg ozone/mg DOC may produce toxic transformation products. However, referred effects are removed if higher ozone concentrations are used (1.3mg ozone/mg DOC). Moreover, the application of 1g TiO2/l and ambient UV consistently reduced ecotoxicity. Although activated carbon may remove besides micropollutants also nutrients, which seemed to mask its detoxification potential, this treatment technique reduced the ecotoxicity of the wastewater following its amendment with nutrients. Hence, all three advanced treatment techniques are suitable to reduce the ecotoxicity of municipal wastewater mediated by micropollutants and may hence help to meet the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Advanced oxidation; Feeding rate; Meta-analysis; Wastewater","Advanced oxidation; Advanced treatment; Ecotoxicity; Ecotoxicological; European Water Framework Directive; Feeding rate; Gammarus; Meta-analysis; Micropollutants; Municipal wastewaters; Ozone concentration; Removal efficiencies; Tertiary wastewater treatment; TiO; Transformation products; Treatment techniques; Activated carbon; Detoxification; Feeding; Nutrients; Ozone; Titanium dioxide; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water treatment plants; Activated carbon treatment; activated carbon; ozone; titanium dioxide; activated carbon; amphipod; bioassay; concentration (composition); detoxification; dissolved organic carbon; ecotoxicology; feeding; literature review; meta-analysis; oxidation; ozone; pollutant removal; titanium; toxicity test; transformation; ultraviolet radiation; wastewater; water treatment; Amphipoda; article; bioassay; concentration (parameters); detoxification; ecotoxicity; feeding; gammarus fossarum; nonhuman; ozonation; ultraviolet radiation; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Animals; Biological Assay; Feeding Behavior; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Gammarus; Gammarus fossarum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960174325

The ability to commodify carbon reductions takes place through a socionatural-technical complex that is defined by the material nature of technology's interaction with the atmosphere, local social processes and the evolving governing systems of carbon markets. Carbon is not unproblematically commodified: some projects and technologies allow a more cooperative commodification than others. The examples of a hydroelectricity plant and an improved cookstove project in Honduras are used as empirical case studies to illustrate the difficulties and opportunities associated with the relational aspects of carbon commodification. Drawing upon select literatures from post-structural thought to complement the principal lens of a more structural, materiality of nature analysis, the paper also outlines the reasons why carbon offset reform is needed if offsets are to more progressively engage debates about climate mitigation and North-South development. © 2011 The Author Antipode © 2011 Editorial Board of Antipode.","Carbon offsets; Clean development mechanism; Commodification; Honduras; Neoliberalism; Socionature; Sustainable development","carbon emission; clean development mechanism; emission control; market system; nature-society relations; neoliberalism; sustainable development; Honduras",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955729212

The use of forests as carbon sinks is increasingly recognized as a mitigation option. Emission trading frameworks throughout the world have emerged as the chosen means to manage emissions. This is also evident within the large area, high emission countries of Australia and the United States which both incorporate the use of forest sinks within existing or proposed emission trading frameworks. This paper evaluates and compares the frameworks in each country and reviews the corresponding literature to identify knowledge gaps that currently exist regarding forest sink development. While extensive work has been carried out to understand the potential contribution of forest sinks, little has been done in a uniform manner to clarify the likely uptake and implementation of forest sinks by forest owners. Using innovation theory to understand the interactions between the relevant actors and institutions influencing the development of carbon sinks and as a means to frame the required research, this paper highlights why knowledge of the intentions of the forest owner is integral to the success of forest sinks as a mitigation option. The Theory of Planned Behavior is suggested as a means of examining and understanding the intentions of forest owners to implement forest sinks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; Carbon; Forest; Forest owner; Offset; United States","Australia; Forest; Forest owner; Offset; United States; Forestry; Australia; Carbon; Emission; Forests; USA",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957564920

The most important product of these savannas is cork, a non-timber forest product that is periodically harvested without requiring tree felling. Market devaluation of, and lower demand for, cork are causing a decline in management, or even abandonment, of southwestern Europe's cork oak savannas. Subsequent shrub encroachment into the savanna's grassland components reduces biodiversity and degrades the services provided by these ecosystems.

This is one of several major barriers to the adoption of effective mitigation policies. They would also have considerable social justice implications requiring significant welfare state responses. We assess the claim that climate change policies have regressive effects by comparing different types of mitigation policies.

The profile, constrained by several wells, targets a long-postulated shallow blind or emergent thrust called the Pede-Apenninic Thrust Fault. Despite decades of reflection seismology in this part of the Apennines, a shallow or emergent structure consistent with the surface geology has yet to be definitively identified, a problem likely caused by the topography of the Apennine front and the traditional focus on deep hydrocarbon targets where the first 0.5 km of strata is poorly imaged. Our seismic data show an ∼300 m deep high-resolution picture of the Po foreland as it meets the Apennine mountain front. All imaged reflectors are continuous at the mountain front and are foreland-dipping, showing clear growth relationships; higher-angle reflectors are interpreted as faults. Our interpretation includes a possible hinterland-dipping blind thrust and surface normal faults, which offset late Pleistocene-Holocene deposits as much as 60 m (long-term slip rates of 0.1-0.25 mm/yr) that disrupt, but do not conceal, the growth strata relationships. Vp tomographic imaging also suggests coseismic surface-faulting in Holocene colluvium.

Paradox emerges in NRM at psychological, institutional, and organisational levels. Paradoxes are also features of different forms of democracy such as neoliberal and participatory democracy. Although NRM, ESD and climate change are often conceptualised as distinct issue domains, these policy areas are fundamentally interconnected in both theory and in practice.

Forests surrounding the township of Humbo were largely destroyed by the late 1960s. In 2004, World Vision Australia and World Vision Ethiopia identified forestry-based carbon sequestration as a potential means to stimulate community development while engaging in environmental restoration. After two years of consultation, planning and negotiations, the Humbo Community-based Natural Regeneration Project began implementation-the Ethiopian organization's first carbon sequestration initiative. The Humbo Project assists communities affected by environmental degradation including loss of biodiversity, soil erosion and flooding with an opportunity to benefit from carbon markets while reducing poverty and restoring the local agroecosystem. Involving the regeneration of 2,728 ha of degraded native forests, it brings social, economic and ecological benefits-facilitating adaptation to a changing climate and generating temporary certified emissions reductions (tCERs) under the Clean Development Mechanism. A key feature of the project has been facilitating communities to embrace new techniques and take responsibility for large-scale environmental change, most importantly involving Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). This technique is low-cost, replicable, and provides direct benefits within a short time. Communities were able to harvest fodder and firewood within a year of project initiation and wild fruits and other non-timber forest products within three years. Farmers are using agroforestry for both environmental restoration and income generation. Establishment of user rights and local cooperatives has generated community ownership and enthusiasm for this project-empowering the community to more sustainably manage their communal lands. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Agroforestry; Carbon markets; Climate change; Community participation; Farmer managed natural regeneration","Agricultural land; Agro ecosystems; Agroforestry; Australia; Carbon markets; Carbon sequestration; Changing climate; Clean Development Mechanism; Community development; Community ownership; Community participation; Emissions reduction; Environmental change; Environmental restoration; Ethiopia; Forest resources; Income generation; Key feature; Local community; Native forests; Natural regeneration; Non-timber forest products; Poverty alleviation; Soil erosion; Wild fruits; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate change; Emission control; Reforestation; Restoration; Timber; Conservation; agricultural ecosystem; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; clean development mechanism; emission control; environmental restoration; exploitation; forest resource; income distribution; participatory approach; poverty alleviation; regeneration; sustainability; article; biodiversity; climate change; economic development; ecosystem restoration; environmental change; environmental sustainability; Ethiopia; evolutionary adaptation; forest management; income; poverty; productivity; responsibility; soil erosion; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ethiopia; Forestry; Geography; Humans; Poverty; Trees; Biodiversity; Carbon; Climates; Conservation; Emission; Ethiopia; Forest Management; Forestry; Market Research; Natural Reforestation; Reforestation; Restoration; Ethiopia; Humbo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960960376

Microbial methanogenesis from bitumen or petroleum generates more methane than CO2, so the carbon isotopic compositions of methane and CO2 are relatively heavy and similar to the carbon isotopic composition of thermogenic methane. Microbial methanogenesis that uses kerogen or recent organic matter as a carbon source generates relatively more CO2 than methane; therefore, methane and CO2 have the light carbon typical of shallow microbial methane. This concept was quantified and tested against three literature examples to determine if the relative amount of CO2 generation could be estimated with sufficient resolution to predict source carbon type and generation temperature in gas shales and coalbed methane. Antrim Shale (Michigan) gases are demonstrated to be derived mainly from immature bitumen in the shale at modem reservoir temperatures and cooler temperatures. Fruitland coal gases in the western San Juan Basin are derived mainly from bitumen in oil-window maturity coals at modern temperature. Southwest Indiana coal gases are derived mainly from thermally immature kerogen at modern and warmer temperatures. Identification of the methane carbon source and temperature helps delineate microbial methane resource fairways, where fairways are limited by microbial gas generation. Temperatures may help determine if microbial methane is actively generated today or a relict from earlier microbial generation. Copyright © 2011.

The Corsican Law-Ecl, consisting of omphacite+lawsonite+garnet+phengite+titanite, occurs as both single undeformed metabasaltic pillows surrounded by lawsonite blueschist (Law-Bs), and carbonate-bearing eclogitic veins. Law-Bs are found as variably deformed metabasaltic pillows locally cross-cut by eclogitic veins and consist of glaucophane + actinolite + lawsonite + garnet + phengite + titanite. Field evidence and microstructures reveal that both Law-Ecl and Law-Bs are stable at the metamorphic peak in the lawsonite-eclogite stability field. Isochemical phase diagrams (pseudosections) calculated for representative Law-Ecl and Law-Bs samples indicate that both lithologies equilibrated at the same conditions of ~520±20°C and 2.3±0.1GPa. Therefore, the coexistence at the same peak metamorphic conditions of Law-Ecl and Law-Bs implies that different portions of deeply subducted oceanic crust may store significantly different H2O contents, depending on bulk-rock chemical composition. In addition, thermodynamic modelling of phase equilibria indicates that the occurring progressive dehydration reactions, which are significantly depending on bulk-rock chemical composition, strongly influence rock densification and eclogite formation in subducting slabs. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Alpine Corsica; Dehydration processes; Lawsonite breakdown; Lawsonite-eclogite; Slab densification","Corsica; Dehydration processes; Lawsonite breakdown; Lawsonite-eclogite; Slab densification; Bearings (structural); Dehydration; Dewatering; Garnets; Metamorphic rocks; Phase diagrams; Phase equilibria; Silicate minerals; blueschist; chemical composition; dehydration; eclogite; lawsonite; metabasalt; microstructure; modeling; petrology; phase equilibrium; slab; subduction; thermodynamics; Corse; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957803198

This paper contributes to this literature by developing a new methodology to link two widely used policy models in order to provide an integrated assessment of the environmental impacts of EU biofuels mandates. By combining the CAPRI model of EU agricultural production and resource use with the GTAP model of global trade and land use, we are able to estimate both the global impacts of EU biofuels policies as well as the detailed, regional changes in land use and nutrient surplus. The applicability of this combined modeling approach extends well beyond biofuels. It could offer important insights into the global impacts of EU agricultural policy reforms, as well as analysis of the EU-regional impacts of global agreements on trade policy or climate change mitigation. In short, the methodology developed in this paper holds great promise for future, cross-scale analysis of global issues bearing on agriculture, land use and the environment. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuels; Induced land use change; Model linkage","agricultural production; biofuel; climate change; decision making; environmental assessment; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental quality; European Union; global economy; integrated approach; land use; land use change; market system; policy making; resource use; trade policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649593555

In this study, two bivalve species associated with carbonate crusts and reduced sediment are identified based on sequence analysis of their 18S and 28S rRNA-encoding genes, and associated bacterial symbioses are investigated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and microscopy-based approaches. The specimens are closely related to Myrtea spinifera and Thyasira flexuosa, two species previously documented at various depths from other regions but not yet reported from the Eastern Mediterranean. Both species harbour abundant gammaproteobacterial endosymbionts in specialized gill epithelial cells. The Myrtea-associated bacterium is closely related to lucinid symbionts from both deep-sea and coastal species, whereas the Thyasira-associated bacterium is closely related to the symbiont of a T. flexuosa from coastal waters off the U.K. An epsilonproteobacterial sequence has also been identified in Thyasira which could correspond to a helicoid-shaped morphotype observed by electron microscopy, but this was not confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Virus-like particles were observed within some symbionts in Thyasira, mostly in bacteriocytes localized close to the ciliated zone of the gill filament. Overall, results indicate that very close relatives of shallow species M. spinifera and T. flexuosa occur at cold seeps in the Eastern Mediterranean and harbour chemoautotrophic symbioses similar to those found in their coastal relatives. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Chemoautotrophy; Cold seeps; Eastern Mediterranean; Myrtea; Symbiosis; Thyasira","bivalve; chemoautotrophy; cold seep; endosymbiont; fauna; interspecific interaction; microbial activity; symbiosis; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East); Bacteria (microorganisms); Bivalvia; Gorgonacea; Helicoidea; Lucinidae; Myrtea; Myrtea spinifera; Thyasira; Thyasira flexuosa; Thyasiridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954421544

Residual gas analysis reveals a reduction of hydrocarbons by one order of magnitude and of O by a factor of 5 in the partial pressure owing to the evaporation. The evolution of wall conditions, impurity fluxes and divertor radiation have been studied in ELMy H-mode plasmas (Bt = 2.7 T, Ip = 2.5 MA, Paux = 16 MW) whereas a non-seeded reference discharge was executed prior to the evaporation. The in situ measured Be flux at the midplane increased by about a factor of 40 whereas the C flux decreased by ∼50% in the limiter phase of the first discharge with respect to the reference, but erosion of the Be layer and partial coverage with C takes place quickly. To make best use of the protective Be layer, only the first four discharges were employed for a gas balance analysis providing a D retention rate of 1.94 × 1021 D s-1 which is comparable to rates with C walls. But the Be evaporation provides a non-saturated surface with respect to D and short term retention is not negligible in the balance; the measured retention is overestimated with respect to steady-state conditions like that of the ILW. Moreover, C was only moderately reduced and co-deposition of fuel with eroded Be and C occurs. The lower C content leads to a minor reduction in divertor radiation as the reference phase prior to seeding indicates. N adds to the radiation of D and the remaining C, and the N content rises due to the legacy effect which has been quantified by gas balance to be 30% of the injected N. C radiation increases with exposure time, and both contributors cause an increase in the radiated fraction in the divertor from 50% to 70%. The radiation pattern suggests that N dominates the increase in the first discharges though C is still the dominating radiator. Therefore, the validity of a proxy of the Be first wall by a thin Be layer is limited and restricted to plasma operation directly after the Be evaporation. © 2011 IAEA, Vienna.",,"Balance analysis; Codeposition; Divertor radiation; Exposure-time; First discharge; First wall; Fuel retention; In-situ; N content; Partial coverage; Plasma operations; Residual gas analysis; Retention rate; Short term; Steady-state condition; Electric discharges; Evaporation; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Plasma simulation; Radiation; Phase transitions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960363468

In the cotton-producing regions of West and Central Africa (WCA), two genotypes have been repeatedly detected within the cotton host race, one of which (Burk1) is prevalent (>90%) and resistant to several insecticides, as opposed to the second one (Ivo). Here, we conducted whole plant and field cage experiments to test hypotheses for such low genetic diversity, including selection from insecticide treatments, interclonal competition and adaptation to host plant, or climatic conditions. To assess the genetic diversity of immigrant aphids, alatae were trapped and collected on cotton and relay host plants (okra and roselle) in the early cropping season. Individuals were genotyped at eight specific microsatellite loci and characterized by a multilocus genotype (MLG). When independently transferred from cotton (Gossypium hirustum L.) leaf discs to whole plants (G. hirsutum and G. arboreum, roselle and okra), Ivo and Burk1 performed equally well. When concurrently transferred from cotton leaf discs to the same plant species, Ivo performed better than Burk1, indicating that competition favoured Ivo. This was also the case on G. hirsutum growing outdoors. Conversely, Burk1 prevailed when cotton plants were sprayed with insecticides. In experiments where aphids were allowed to move to neighbouring plants, Burk1 was better represented than Ivo on low-populated plants, suggesting that dispersal may be a way to avoid competition on crowded plants. Most cotton aphids collected on cotton or relay host plants in the early cropping season were Burk1 (>90%), indicating high dispersal ability and, probably reflecting high frequency on host plants from which they dispersed. In the agricultural landscape of WCA, the use of broad-range insecticides on both cotton and relay host plants has led to the prevalence of one genotype of A. gossypii resistant to different classes of insecticides. Deployment of widespread and integrated pest management strategies are needed to restore cotton aphid control. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.","Aphididae; dispersal; insecticide resistance; integrated pest management; selection","insecticide; microsatellite DNA; aphid; cotton; genetic marker; genetic variation; geographical distribution; host plant; hypothesis testing; integrated pest management; pesticide application; pesticide resistance; animal; aphid; article; climate; competitive behavior; cotton; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; okra; parasitology; population growth; Abelmoschus; Animals; Aphids; Climate; Competitive Behavior; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Gossypium; Insecticides; Microsatellite Repeats; Population Growth; Selection, Genetic; Central Africa; West Africa; Abelmoschus; Aphididae; Aphis gossypii; Gossypium; Gossypium arboreum; Gossypium hirsutum; Hibiscus sabdariffa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960178459

Determining the production and transportation cost to the producer of corn stover or switchgrass and the amount available within a given distance from the plant will result in a per metric ton cost the plant will need to pay producers in order to receive sufficient quantities of biomass. This research computes up-to-date biomass production costs using recent prices for all important cost components including seed, fertilizer, herbicide, mowing/shredding, raking, baling, storage, handling, and transportation. The cost estimates also include nutrient replacement for corn stover. The total per metric ton cost is a combination of these cost components depending on whether equipment is owned or custom hired, what baling options are used, the size of the farm, and the transport distance. Total costs per dry metric ton for biomass with a transportation distance of 60 km ranges between $ 63 and $ 75 for corn stover and $ 80 and $ 96 for switchgrass. Using the county quantity data and this cost information, we then estimate biomass supply curves for three Indiana coal-fired electric utilities. This supply framework can be applied to plants of any size, location, and type, such as future cellulosic ethanol plants. Finally, greenhouse gas emissions reductions are estimated from using biomass instead of coal for part of the utility energy and also the carbon tax required to make the biomass and coal costs equivalent. Depending on the assumed CO 2 price, the use of biomass instead of coal is found to decrease overall costs in most cases. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Biomass supply; Cellulosic biomass; Corn stover; Greenhouse gas reduction; Switchgrass","Biomass supply; Cellulosic biomass; Corn stover; Greenhouse gas reduction; Switchgrass; Biomass; Cellulosic ethanol; Coal; Cost accounting; Costs; Electric utilities; Energy harvesting; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Herbicides; Transportation; Cost benefit analysis; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953722514

A number of previous macro-scale studies of residential energy consumption and energy-efficiency improvements are mainly concerned with national or international aggregate potential savings. In this paper we look into the details of how a collection of specific homes in one region might reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with particular attention given to some practical limits to what can be achieved by upgrading the existing residential building stock. Using a simple model of residential, single-family home construction characteristics, estimates are made for the efficacy of (i) changes to behavioral patterns that do not involve building shell modifications; (ii) straightforward air-infiltration mitigation measures, and (iii) insulation measures. We derive estimates of net lifetime savings resulting from these measures, in terms of energy, carbon emissions and dollars. This study points out explicitly the importance of local and regional patterns in decision-making about what fraction of necessary regional or national emissions reduction might be accomplished through energy-efficiency measures and how much might need to concentrate more heavily on renewable or other carbon-free sources of energy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gas emissions; Residential buildings","Behavioral patterns; Building shell; Carbon emissions; Efficiency improvement; Efficiency measure; Emissions reduction; Energy consumption; Macro scale; Mitigation measures; Regional pattern; Renewable energies; Residential building; Residential buildings; Residential energy consumption; Residential energy efficiency; Sources of energy; Total energy consumption; Apartment houses; Behavioral research; Buildings; Decision making; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Energy efficiency; alternative energy; carbon emission; decision making; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; renewable resource; residential energy; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953301980

Current N recommendations for hazelnuts are based on research on clonally propagated C. avellana in Oregon and may not be applicable in the Upper Midwest due to differing soils, climate, and plant genetics. We established three field plots in 2003 to test N fertilization rates on new plantings, with rates up to 33 g N plant-1 as ammonium nitrate applied annually in the spring, starting 2 wk after transplanting. We observed a strong negative linear effect of N rate on plant survival. In the second year we added trials on same-aged plants that had not previously been fertilized and found no N effect on survival. We concluded that waiting 1 yr after transplanting before fertilizing increases plant survival, but even then N requirements during establishment years are very low for hybrid hazelnuts. Standard leaf N concentrations for C. avellana in Oregon are roughly applicable to hybrid hazelnuts, except that the threshold between deficiency and sufficiency should be raised slightly to 1.9% N. The current threshold between deficient and sufficient, 2.2%, should be regarded as a target, rather than as a threshold to be exceeded.","Corylus; Filbert; Leaf analysis; Nutrient recommendations","ammonium nitrate; crop production; dicotyledon; fertilizer application; hybrid; nitrogen; seed propagation; survival; transplantation; Midwest; Oregon; United States; Corylus; Corylus americana; Corylus avellana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960446056

Evidence for this has been scarce, but has gradually begun to accumulate due to recent studies designed to constrain the high-temperature part of the emission measure distribution. However, the detected hot component is often weaker than models predict and this is due in part to the common modeling assumption that the ionization balance remains in equilibrium. The launch of the latest generation of space-based observing instrumentation on board Hinode and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has brought the matter of the ionization state of the plasma firmly to the forefront. It is timely to consider exactly what emission current instruments would detect when observing a corona heated impulsively on small scales by nanoflares. Only after we understand the full effects of nonequilibrium ionization can we draw meaningful conclusions about the plasma that is (or is not) present. We have therefore performed a series of hydrodynamic simulations for a variety of different nanoflare properties and initial conditions. Our study has led to several key conclusions. (1) Deviations from equilibrium are greatest for short-duration nanoflares at low initial coronal densities. (2) Hot emission lines are the most affected and are suppressed sometimes to the point of being invisible. (3) For the many scenarios we have considered, the emission detected in several of the SDO-AIA channels (131, 193, and 211 ) would be dominated by warm, overdense, cooling plasma. (4) It is difficult not to create coronal loops that emit strongly at 1.5MK and in the range 2-6MK, which are the most commonly observed kind, for a broad range of nanoflare scenarios. (5) The Fe XV (284.16 ) emission in most of our models is about 10 times brighter than the Ca XVII (192.82 ) emission, consistent with observations. Our overarching conclusion is that small-scale, impulsive heating inducing a nonequilibrium ionization state leads to predictions for observable quantities that are entirely consistent with what is actually observed. © 2011.

The function of this glue depends on metals, raising the possibility that metal-catalyzed oxidation plays a role. The extent and time course of protein oxidation was measured by immunoblotting to detect the resulting carbonyl groups. Several proteins, particularly one with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 165×103, were heavily oxidized. Of the proteins known to distinguish the glue from non-adhesive mucus, only specific size variants were oxidized. The oxidation appears to occur within the first few seconds of secretion. Although carbonyls were detected by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in denatured proteins, they were not easily detected in the native state. The presence of reversible cross-links derived from carbonyls was tested for by treatment with sodium borohydride, which would reduce uncross-linked carbonyls to alcohols, but stabilize imine bonds formed by carbonyls and thus lead to less soluble complexes. Consistent with imine bond formation, sodium borohydride led to a 20-35% decrease in the amount of soluble protein with a Mr of 40-165 (×103) without changing the carbonyl content per protein. In contrast, the nucleophile hydroxylamine, which would competitively disrupt imine bonds, increased protein solubility in the glue. Finally, the primary amine groups on a protein with a Mr of 15×103 were not accessible to acid anhydrides. The results suggest that cross-links between aldehydes and primary amines contribute to the cohesive strength of the glue. © 2011.","Adhesion; Arion subfuscus; Gastropod; Gel; Glue; Metal-catalyzed; Oxidation; Slug","adhesive agent; aldehyde; amine; borane derivative; cross linking reagent; dinitrophenylhydrazine; hydrazine derivative; hydroxylamine; protein; sodium borohydride; animal; article; chemistry; gastropod; gel; immunoblotting; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Adhesives; Aldehydes; Amines; Animals; Borohydrides; Cross-Linking Reagents; Gastropoda; Gels; Hydrazines; Hydroxylamine; Immunoblotting; Oxidation-Reduction; Proteins; Arion subfuscus; Gastropoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955628193

They were able to explore different zoning options, assess their respective advantages and constraints, and gradually improve their understanding of the consequences of land zoning on the environmental and economic values of the resulting landscape. The villagers also felt empowered by their newly acquired knowledge and well disposed toward negotiations to improve their current land use through more realistic plans. Long-term environmental concerns (ie biodiversity and carbon values) were fully integrated with shorter-term economic considerations in the collective decision-making process.

Such characteristics create an urban climate which is different from the climate outside of cities. An example of an urban climate effect is the so-called Urban Heat Island: cities tend to be warmer than the surrounding rural areas. The higher temperature results in an increase in energy consumption since people, especially in summer, use artificial means to cool themselves. Although means of mitigating the UHI effect exist, they are difficult to justify, as knowledge about urban climate is limited, and analysis tools are lacking. This paper presents the work carried during the 2010 MSc Geomatics Synthesis Project. A 3D spatial relational database has been implemented which is meant to act as starting point in the development of a 3D climate-enabled geographical information system. To this end, the database stores 3D geometries representing the built environment and its thematic properties. The database is also able to store measurements of climate parameters, in this case temperature, obtained through mobile sensors. Spatial analyses and queries are supported, allowing users to calculate areas, distances, buffers, add and remove geometries and thematic attributes. The database design is based on the CityGML information model which has been extended to allow the storage of climate parameters relevant to urban climate research.","Databases; GPS/INS; Measurement; Monitoring; Reconstruction; Three-dimensional; Urban","Database systems; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Image reconstruction; Information management; Measurement; Monitoring; Three dimensional computer graphics; Built environment; Climate parameters; GPS/INS; Information Modeling; Relational Database; Spatial analysis; Urban; Urban heat island; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907004238

This occurs in a single kinetic step where the transfer of a proton from Asp-243 (behaving as a general base) to the leaving group is simultaneous to the cycle formation and departure of the aglycon (an activation barrier Ea of 16.5 kcal mol-1). Even if the other component of the catalytic dyad (Asp-242) is not actually involved in a proton transfer (as commonly suggested), it plays an important role in the catalysis through a complex network of hydrogen bonds that contribute to lower the activation barrier. The transition state of the process resembles an oxocarbenium ion (half chair conformation with an approximately planar sp2 anomeric carbon). Following the lines of previous experiments aimed to demonstrate the existence of a substrate-assisted mechanism, it is found that the computed Ea increases when the hydrogen atoms of the N-acetyl group are replaced with one, two and three F atoms and that a good linear correlation exists between the activation barrier Ea and the σ* Taft electronic parameter of the fluoro-substituted N-acetyl groups. © 2011 the Owner Societies.",,"acetylglucosaminidase; article; biocatalysis; biology; chemistry; enzyme specificity; metabolism; molecular dynamics; Acetylglucosaminidase; Biocatalysis; Computational Biology; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955635207

Thus, a PET-bottled water consumer (2L per day) who changes to tap water may prevent 163.50kg CO2eq of greenhouse gas emissions per year. In monetary terms, this translates into a tradable annual verified emission reduction (VER) between US$ 0.20 and 7.67 per drinker. Analysing a mature bottled water market, such as the Italian one, may provide insights into the growing global bottled-water market and its effects on climate change. The environmental and economic benefits of changing drinking water habits are also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Bottled water; Carbon footprint; Carbon markets; Life cycle; Substitute goods; Tap water; Verified Emission Reductions (VERs)","drinking water; mineral water; tap water; article; carbon footprint; climate change; consumer; controlled study; economic development; greenhouse gas; habit; human; Italy; priority journal; water availability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955705785

Merr.) photosynthesis and vegetative mass, thus providing good opportunities for genetic traits such as longer grain filling, more rapid podset, determinancy, and increased specific leaf weight (SLW) that previously had reduced LAI and light capture. The CO2 rise along with technology has assisted genetic improvement of soybean over the past 50 years, and future genetic improvement will similarly take advantage of future CO2 rise. Optimum mean temperature for soybean yield is 23 °C, close to the current in Midwestern USA, but temperatures of 26 to 27 °C in subtropical regions are already limiting yield, with yield decrease above 23 °C mean. Rising temperature effects that shorten grain-filling duration, reduce podset, and reduce seed growth rate will be more difficult to overcome with genetics. Overall, genetic improvement under warmer temperatures will come from the same type of genetic traits as selected for in the past, although efforts to move the optimum and upper failure point temperatures for podset and seed growth rate will be beneficial. There is little genetic variability for heat tolerance among soybean germplasm, but fortunately, pollination/fertility of soybean is remarkably tolerant to elevated temperature. For climate change that includes reduced rainfall and increased temperature along with rising CO2, the most promising genetic traits include more rapid rate of root depth progression, a deeper shape of the rooting profile (maybe from tolerance to Al-saturation), adaptive partitioning to root if under water stress, slower leaf abscission under water deficit, slower N mobilization, less acceleration of maturity under water deficit, increased SLW/increased N concentration to improve water use efficiency, and cultivars with low conductance in darkness.

In the present study we analyzed the incidence of AMI in the second year of the ban. In addition, we investigated the contribution of smoking ban-unrelated factors to the reduced incidence of AMI incidence observed after enactment of the ban. METHODS: Data of all AMI patients who underwent coronary angiography at the Kantonsspital Graubünden, the only tertiary care hospital with a cardiac catheterization laboratory in Graubünden, between March 1st, 2009 and February 28th, 2010 were collected prospectively. Data were compared with those of the three preceding 12-month periods. We also estimated AMI incidence during the corresponding time period in Lucerne, a region with no smoke-free legislation, using data of the AMIS Plus registry. The influence of outdoor air pollution was analyzed with the help of official measurements of PM10- and NO 2- concentrations in Graubünden. The prescription of lipidlowering drugs was estimated by using sales figures in Graubünden and Lucerne. RESULTS: In Graubünden, the number of patients with AMI in the second year after adoption of the smoking ban was similar to that in the first year of the ban (188 vs. 183; P = ns) and significantly lower than in each of the two years preceding the ban (229 and 242, respectively; P &lt;0.05 vs. each of the 12-month periods after the ban). Overall, the number of AMI patients in the two post-ban years was 21% lower than in the two pre-ban years. The reduction in the number of patients with AMI was most pronounced in non-smokers and individuals with known coronary artery disease. During the corresponding time period, no similar decrease in the incidence of AMI was observed in Lucerne. No association was found between the magnitude of outdoor air pollution and the incidence of AMI. During the observation period, the use of lipid-lowering drugs increased similarly in Graubünden and Lucerne. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the two years preceding the implementation of a smoking ban, the incidence of AMI remained significantly reduced in the second year of the ban in Graubünden, whereas no similar reduction was seen in a comparable area without smoke-free legislation. Changes in outdoor air pollution or the use of lipid-lowering drugs did not substantially contribute to the decrease in the incidence of AMI that occurred after adoption of the ban in Graubünden.","Air pollution; Myocardial infarction; Particulate matter; Second hand smoke; Smoking ban","antilipemic agent; hypocholesterolemic agent; acute heart infarction; air pollution; air quality; angiocardiography; article; coronary artery disease; disease registry; female; follow up; heart catheterization; human; incidence; law; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; prescription; prospective study; smoking cessation; Switzerland; health care policy; heart infarction; legal aspect; passive smoking; sanitation; smoking; statistics; Switzerland; Anticholesteremic Agents; Drug Prescriptions; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Policy; Humans; Incidence; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Public Facilities; Smoking; Switzerland; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958235345

The aim of this research is to identify householders' lifestyle choices within homes that impact on energy use and their motivation to conserve energy. The results help to identify methods to increase the uptake of sustainability practices that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in residential buildings. Design/methodology/approach: A postal survey was adopted as the quickest and most cost-effective way of surveying a large sample of householders across Australia. The survey was sent to 2,500 randomly selected residents, 500 in each of the five largest Australian cities by population. Findings: The results identified that barriers to energy efficiency in households include: larger homes and smaller households; initial costs of sustainable features, and a lack of consumer information about benefits and savings from incorporating energy-efficient devices. The most common reason why people are not acting in more sustainable ways is inconvenience or laziness. Research limitations/implications: The response rate was very low and retired persons were over-represented, as they are the people with more time to answer surveys. Further research is warranted to achieve a larger, more representative sample. Practical implications: These results will be useful to Government policy makers as they help to identify methods to increase the uptake of sustainable features and energy conservation in homes. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt at a nation-wide study of residential behavior to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in homes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions; Householder perceptions; New Zealand; Residential homes; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961155566

This process, taking place in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, poses major pressure on the affected urban regions. In Asian countries, this development is combined with high economic growth rates. At the same time, the climate change is proceeding, and the energy supply is going to become an existential problem. The rapidly growing cities therefore face the issue that the supply of infrastructures and public services lag behind the rapid urbanization. The increasing energy costs and the imperative to reduce the CO2 emissions aggravate the situation. The centralized systems which started to be implemented in the industrialized countries more than 100 years ago are no longer the appropriate way to solve these problems. The semicentralized integrated approach, recently developed for rapidly growing urban regions in China, in contrast, offers with its flexibility a sustainable solution to cope with these developments. This article presents objectives and first results of an interdisciplinary R&D project aiming at the adaptation of the semicentralized integrated approach to the case of Hanoi, the rapidly growing capital of Vietnam, to contribute to the solution of the sanitation problems of both the old City Center and the urban expansions in conjunction.

Knowing how individuals or species occupy their habitat is essential to understand how species use their environment, and detecting variations that might affect this use can be determinant in species management. Hierarchical modeling is regularly used to assess for occupancy rate (i.e. proportion of patches occupied in a region), particularly when it is required to consider detectability-related issues. The present study is the first application of the conditional model presented in Dupuis et al. (Biometrics 2010), which is applied in the case of a heterogeneous area that might be divided into homogeneous sub-areas. Their approach is used to study the impact of three consecutive particularly cold winters on a selected set of bird species in a forest of southern France in the context of available prior information on birds detectability. We examined a limited range of factors that might influence the response of some bird species to climate. We considered the case of sedentary, partially migrating and migrating species. We also assessed if the biogeographical origins of the different species affect their occupancy rates. Globally, changes in occupancy rates between 1985 and 1987 indicates for the first time a continentalization of the regional forest fauna, reflected by the expansion of Palearctic and Turkestano-European faunistic type species, with depletion or extinction of European, Turkestano-Mediterranean and Mediterranean sedentary species.

Every year hurricane (cyclone) hazards cause extensive economic losses and social disruption around the world. Annual hurricane damage in the United States (US) is around $6 billion in recent years. Hurricane intensity or/and frequency may change due to the increase in sea surface temperature as a result of climate change. Implications of the changing hazard patterns on hurricane risk assessment warrants an investigation to evaluate the potential impact of climate change. The framework includes probabilistic models of hurricane occurrence and intensity and conditional damage state probabilities (vulnerability model) for typical residential construction in the US, and an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of various climate change adaptation strategies. A case study of Miami-Dade County, Florida is presented to illustrate the framework under various scenarios of change in maximum annual wind speed over 50. years. Demographic information, such as median house value and changes in house numbers, and distribution of houses on different exposure, is used to estimate the time-dependent probable damage with or without possible climate change induced change in wind speed. This study shows that climate change may have a substantial impact on the damage and loss estimation in coastal areas, and that certain adaptation strategies can cost effectively decrease the damage, even if the wind speed does not change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Damage; Decision making; Hurricane; Loss estimation; Retrofit; Risk assessment; Uncertainty; Vulnerability","Damage; Loss estimation; Retrofit; Uncertainty; Vulnerability; Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Coastal zones; Damage detection; Estimation; Houses; Hurricanes; Losses; Ocean structures; Rating; Retrofitting; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Storms; Wind effects; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957627679

Therefore, climate change impacts on habitats can be assessed by two complementary statistical approaches: either directly by modelling the climate envelope of the habitat, or indirectly by modelling the habitat in terms of its plant species. How do these approaches differ in their projected habitat distribution? What are the consequences for nature conservation? Location: Europe. Methods: Potential climate change impacts on the distribution of European protected Natura 2000 sites were modelled for five natural and semi-natural grassland habitat types, defined by the EU Habitats Directive, using data from the Atlas Florae Europaeae and reports on Natura 2000 sites. We used random forests (RF) and logistic regression (GLM) to model current and potential future distributions for 2050. Results: All habitats are projected to lose between 22% and 93% of their range in the 'no dispersal' scenario. In the 'unrestricted dispersal' scenario, almost all habitats gain suitable climate space, between 5% and 100% of their current range. In the direct habitat approach, both model algorithms have high discriminatory performance on test data and are well calibrated. In the indirect species approach, only GLM shows high model performance; RF models are overfitted. Projections of occurrence probabilities differ more strongly between model approaches ('direct' versus 'indirect') than between model algorithms (GLM versus RF). Conclusions: Habitats are complex entities. Because of their dynamic nature, particularly in the face of climate change, we suggest modelling the future distribution of habitat types not exclusively based on their current definitions and mapped distributions, but also based on their constituent elements, and in particular their characteristic plant species. © 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Ecoinformatics; Ecosystem; GLM; Grasslands; Multi-species approach; Natural habitat type of community interest; Random forest; Species distribution model; Vegetation database","algorithm; atlas; bioinformatics; calibration; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; community composition; comparative study; data set; database; dispersal; ecological modeling; European Union; forest ecosystem; grassland; habitat structure; habitat type; plant community; population distribution; regression analysis; vegetation mapping; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960104931

The vulnerability and limitations of poor countries to adapt to the emerging challenges of climate change have been highlighted in the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although the exact direction of climate change in not known however, there is a general agreement that the continent will experience a projected increase in temperature between 1.5° - 6°C by 2100, and this warming will be greatest over the interior of semiarid margins of the Sahara and central southern Africa. The impact of such a change will lead to drought, increasing poor and degraded soils, shortening of rainfall season and growing season among others. All crops therefore must adapt to this changing environment or be wiped out. Strategic and novel approach by all stakeholders' are needed to counter the numerous effects of climate change.

The demonstration that M. tuberculosis also requires ICL for survival during nutrient starvation and has a role during steady state growth in a glycerol limited chemostat indicates a function for this enzyme which extends beyond fat metabolism. As isocitrate lyase is a potential drug target elucidating the role of this enzyme is of importance; however, the role of isocitrate lyase has never been investigated at the level of in vivo fluxes. Here we show that deletion of one of the two icl genes impairs the replication of Mycobacterium bovis BCG at slow growth rate in a carbon limited chemostat. In order to further understand the role of isocitrate lyase in the central metabolism of mycobacteria the effect of growth rate on the in vivo fluxes was studied for the first time using 13C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA). Tracer experiments were performed with steady state chemostat cultures of BCG or M. tuberculosis supplied with 13C labeled glycerol or sodium bicarbonate. Through measurements of the 13C isotopomer labeling patterns in protein-derived amino acids and enzymatic activity assays we have identified the activity of a novel pathway for pyruvate dissimilation. We named this the GAS pathway because it utilizes the Glyoxylate shunt and Anapleurotic reactions for oxidation of pyruvate, and Succinyl CoA synthetase for the generation of succinyl CoA combined with a very low flux through the succinate - oxaloacetate segment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We confirm that M. tuberculosis can fix carbon from CO 2 into biomass. As the human host is abundant in CO 2 this finding requires further investigation in vivo as CO 2 fixation may provide a point of vulnerability that could be targeted with novel drugs. This study also provides a platform for further studies into the metabolism of M. tuberculosis using 13C-MFA. © 2011 Beste et al.",,"amino acid; bicarbonate; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; glycerol; glyoxylic acid; isocitrate lyase; oxaloacetic acid; pyruvic acid; succinic acid; succinyl coenzyme A synthetase; tricarboxylic acid; bacterial protein; carbon; carbon dioxide; isocitrate lyase; pyruvic acid; analytic method; anapleurotic reaction; article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; biomass; carbon metabolism; chemical reaction; chemostat; enzyme activity; gene deletion; host; in vivo study; isotope labeling; metabolic flux analysis; Mycobacterium; nonhuman; oxidation; steady state; enzymology; genetics; human; metabolism; Mycobacterium bovis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; pathogenicity; Corynebacterineae; Mycobacterium bovis BCG; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Gene Deletion; Humans; Isocitrate Lyase; Mycobacterium bovis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Pyruvic Acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960933284

It is well known that turbulence induced by in-cylinder air motion can influence efficiency. In this study, the intake-generated flow field was varied for a direct injected turbo charged concept, with the intent to evaluate if further increase in tumble potentially could lead to higher efficiency compared to the baseline. A single cylinder head with flow separating walls in the intake ports and different restriction plates was used to allow different levels of tumble to be experimentally evaluated in a single cylinder engine. The different levels of tumble were quantified by flow rig experiments. Two series of experiments were performed, one aiming to evaluate tumble in the region of low to medium load and engine speed, mainly focusing on efficiency, and one for the high load region to evaluate any negative consequences of increased tumble. The results indicate that tumble positively can influence the efficiency and emissions, however, the shape of the incoming flow dictate the level of impact significantly. Even for a relatively small change in tumble great differences in heat loss were seen. The efficiency increase seen originated mainly from lower heat loss through the exhaust gases. Additional gain came from lower in cylinder heat loss for the more favorable shape of the flow, where CFD indicates that the incoming air initially follows the cylinder head to a greater extent. Negative consequences are also associated with increased tumble. For instance, excessive pressure rise rates which can result in noise issues at higher loads. However, from a combustion perspective, the turbulence induced by the tumble positively effects the main parameters with reduced combustion duration, increased stability and increased exhaust gas recycling tolerance as well as increased combustion efficiency, features that are beneficial especially for a direct injected down sized turbo charged concept. © 2011 SAE International.",,"Air motion; Combustion duration; Combustion efficiencies; Cost effective; Efficiency increase; Emission reduction; Engine speed; Exhaust gas recycling; Flow rig; Gasoline engines; Gasoline injection; High load; Higher efficiency; Higher loads; Incoming flows; Intake port; Main parameters; Pressure rise; Single cylinder engine; Tumble flow; Automobiles; Combustion; Cylinder heads; Exhaust gases; Experiments; Heat losses; Rating; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859331883

Vegetation resistance or resilience to disturbance depends on local environmental conditions, further modifying the pool of species and traits. This paper aims to understand how disturbance and local environment combine to affect the resistance and resilience of vegetation. A functional-trait approach was used to detect traits related to vegetation resistance and resilience, and trait attributes of individual species responding to disturbance. Trait approaches enable comparison of vegetation responses across biogeographic regions containing different species pools. At 35 European forest and grassland sites, experimental disturbance (human trampling) was applied at five intensities. Indices for resistance and resilience were calculated, based on total vegetation cover, and related to climate and local site factors. Additional indices were calculated for the most common species to demonstrate traits that confer resistance and resilience to disturbance. Vegetation resistance was related to occurrence of species with traits selected by a history of intensive land use (smaller leaf size, rosette plant form) and local environmental conditions. Vegetation resilience, however, was associated with ecosystem properties that facilitate higher growth rates. Resilient vegetation occurred where irradiation was higher (grasslands, open forests) with sufficient water availability (summer precipitation, humidity) and comprised of species with traits related to enhanced growth rates (increased specific leaf area, decreased leaf dry matter content). Synthesis. This pan-European disturbance experiment demonstrates that different drivers (land use or climate) of vegetation response show different mechanistic responses to physical disturbance. Resistance depends on the functional composition of predominant species in the assemblage, which is strongly affected by land-use history; resilience is directly connected to growth rates affected by climate. We argue for the inclusion of land-use history and climate into the planning process for visitor management, especially in areas of high conservation interest. © 2011 The Authors.

Traditional approaches to energy reduction look at direct emissions savings, and recommend insulation and efficiency as more cost-effective than microgeneration. However, microgeneration has indirect, 'soft' benefits and could play a significant role in emissions reduction. Current uptake of microgeneration in the UK is low, with various barriers-economic, technical, cultural, behavioural and institutional-both to uptake and to maximising energy and emissions savings once installed. Subsidies and spreading information alone do not guarantee maximising uptake, and even if successful, this is not enough to maximise savings. The industry focuses on maximising sales, with no incentives to ensure best installations and use; householders do not have access to the best information, and user behaviour does not maximise energy and emission savings. This is related to a broader state of socio-technical 'lock-in' in domestic energy use; there's a lack of connection between personal behaviour and energy consumption, let alone global climate change. This suggests that a major cultural-behavioural shift is needed to reduce energy/emissions in the home. Transition theory and strategic niche management provide insights into possible systemic change and a suitable framework for future policies, such as supporting a variety of radically innovative niches, both technological and social. Microgeneration, properly employed, has the potential to play a part in such a transition by increasing awareness and energy literacy and empowering people to seriously engage in energy debates as producers, as well as consumers, of energy. This deeper understanding and heightened responsibility are crucial in a shift toward bottom-up emission-reducing behaviour change and better acceptance of top-down energy-saving policy measures, as part of a new domestic energy paradigm. The implications for policy are that, as well as supporting the technologies, it needs to support existing niches and to develop new niche experiments. Policy needs to consider how to promote empowerment and responsibility and support or even develop new energy sector models; this will involve a range of stakeholders and multiple governance levels, not just national incentive schemes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Behaviour; Domestic energy; Microgeneration; Niches; Socio-technical regime; Strategic niche management; Transition","Behaviour; Domestic energy; Microgeneration; Niches; Socio-technical regimes; Strategic niche management; Transition; Behavioral research; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Energy efficiency; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; energy use; governance approach; subsidy system; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957623557

To test the utility of a two-dimensional model of organizational climate for explaining variation in diabetes care between primary care clinics. Data Sources/Study Setting. Secondary data were obtained from 223 primary care clinics in the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. Study Design. Organizational climate was defined using the dimensions of task and relational climate. The association between primary care organizational climate and diabetes processes and intermediate outcomes were estimated for 4,539 patients in a cross-sectional study. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. All data were collected from administrative datasets. The climate data were drawn from the 2007 VA All Employee Survey, and the outcomes data were collected as part of the VA External Peer Review Program. Climate data were aggregated to the facility level of analysis and merged with patient-level data. Principal Findings. Relational climate was related to an increased likelihood of diabetes care process adherence, with significant but small effects for adherence to intermediate outcomes. Task climate was generally not shown to be related to adherence. Conclusions. The role of relational climate in predicting the quality of chronic care was supported. Future research should examine the mediators and moderators of relational climate and further investigate task climate. © Health Research and Educational Trust.","diabetes; Organizational climate; organizational context; primary care","article; blood glucose monitoring; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; health care organization; health care quality; health care system; health service; human; outcome assessment; patient attitude; patient care; primary medical care; treatment planning; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Organizational Culture; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); Primary Health Care; United States; Veterans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955634889

Here we show that these changes significantly affect wintertime clouds and precipitation over the East China Sea downwind of major emission sources. Satellite observations show an increase of cloud droplet number concentration from less than 200 cm-3 in the 1980s to more than 300 cm-3 in 2005. In the same time period, precipitation frequency reported by voluntary ship observers was reduced from more than 30% to less than 20% of the time. A back trajectory analysis showed the pollution in the investigation area to originate from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Jinan industrial areas. A model sensitivity study was performed, isolating the effects of changes in emissions of the aerosol precursors SO2 and NOx on clouds and precipitation using a state-of-the-art mesocale model including chemistry and aerosol indirect effects.

In this framework, Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) has revealed as one of the best options to combine both low emissions and good combustion controllability. During last years, PCCI strategy has been widely explored using high EGR levels and different early or late injection timings to extend the ignition delay. Recently, the use of lower cetane fuels is under investigation. Despite the great quantity of research work performed, there are still some aspects related to PCCI combustion that are not completely well known. In this paper an experimental and numerical study is carried out focused on understanding the mixing and auto-ignition processes in PCCI combustion conditions using Diesel and Gasoline fuels. For this purpose, a parametrical study has been performed varying EGR, injection timing, and fuel type in a High Speed Direct Injection (HSDI) Diesel engine. A detailed analysis in terms of air/fuel mixing process has been also developed by means of a 1-D in-house spray model. Results using Diesel fuel show how increasing the ignition delay by advancing the injection timing together with high EGR levels extends the mixing time between the End of Injection (EoI) and the Start of Combustion (SoC). As a consequence, lower local equivalence ratios are achieved. However, it has been confirmed how the use of gasoline has more impact on air/fuel mixing process and auto-ignition delay than any other engine setting investigated with the diesel fuel. © 2011 SAE International.",,"Auto-ignition; Auto-ignition delay; Auto-ignition process; Combustion temperatures; Compression-ignition engines; Diesel combustion; Fuel types; Fuel/air mixing; Gasoline fuels; High speed direct injections; Ignition delays; Injection timing; Local equivalence ratio; Low emission; Mixing process; Mixing time; NOx emissions; Numerical studies; PCCI combustion; Premixed charge compression ignition; Spray model; Start of combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Fuels; Gasoline; Ignition; Mixing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859316797

An area of research, sometimes termed ""accountability,"" aims to quantify these benefits, and sometimes costs, to understand the true impact of regulatory actions. We review recent studies on accountability and contrast their research designs. Key challenges to accountability research are discussed and future directions suggested. Most accountability studies investigated short-term impacts at a local scale, taking advantage of rapid changes in air quality due to policy interventions, such as for the Olympic Games. While useful, this research framework is not applicable to more extensive regulatory actions that deal with long-range transport, large spatial scales, and longer timeframes. A growing number of accountability studies investigate these issues, although the development of additional methods is needed. Challenges inherent to accountability research are vast and include the choice of baseline pollution and health response levels, transboundary pollution from outside the study area, limitations in exposure approaches (e.g., air quality modeling), and extrapolation of epidemiological studies from other populations or geographic areas. Findings from accountability research can help decision-makers design the most effective air quality policies, but in many cases such studies are hindered by large uncertainties. Given the challenges in accountability research, extensive sensitivity analyses and use of multiple methods would provide more compelling evidence than the use of any single approach. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Accountability; Air pollution; Human health; Policy","air pollution; air quality; cost; decision making; economics; game; geography; government; health; health hazard; human; policy; priority journal; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955712456

Managed permanent grasslands cover a large surface in Europe and contribute substantially to agricultural production. These managed plant communities are dominated by perennial clonal species. Their capacity to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions may be limited. We hypothesize that those plant populations that have already been exposed to conditions that are expected to occur due to future climate change, particularly conditions that would be 'extreme' in the target area, are able to cope better with these conditions. For a common-garden experiment we selected ecotypes (provenances as supported by accessions in seed banks) of important European grass species: Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca pratensis, Holcus lanatus and Alopecurus pratensis. Southern target locations of ecotypes (populations) were identified based on climate model projections for the local site in Northern Bavaria, Germany. In a controlled experiment, the plants were exposed to warming and extreme drought. Drought conditions(16-19days, depending on the species) were imposed starting from the end of May in combination with and without an increase in the average temperature from May to September 2009 (+1.5K compared with control; +2.5K compared with ambient conditions outside of the experimental units). Ecotypes and drought manipulation had significant impacts on biomass production and tissue die-back. Significant interactions between ecotype and drought indicated a different drought tolerance of the ecotypes in some cases. The warming treatment yielded a less significant response. The local ecotype generally did not perform significantly worse than the presumably better-adapted southern ecotypes. Synthesis. The selection of ecotypes that are adapted to more extreme climatic conditions could be an option for maintaining future ecosystem functioning in temperate managed grasslands, as was indicated by the clear differences between ecotypes in our experiment. Based on our data, however, performance cannot be predicted from climatic origin. Therefore, we recommend enhancing the genetic variability within populations of species in general. © 2011 The Authors.

The concept has been demonstrated using Mn 2+-doped ZnS Qdots stabilized by acetyl acetonate. Treatment of an aqueous solution of the Qdots (with Mn(OAc)2 being the source ofMn used for the synthesis of the Qdots) by potassium peroxodisulfate (KPS) led to reduction of intensity of emission due to Mn2+ (4T1- 6A1). Subsequent treatment of the solution containing KPS-treatedQdots with NaBH4 led to regaining of intensity, thus providing reversibility to the tuning, which was possible for more than one cycle. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic investigations revealed reduction of the population of Mn2+ upon treatment with KPS, whereas it went back up upon further treatment with NaBH4. Interestingly, a mixed population of oxidation states of Mn was indicated to be present in the Qdots prepared using KMnO4 as the source of Mn. The fluorescence intensity of the Qdots so prepared increased upon treatment with NaBH 4 following synthesis, which was not possible when the source of Mn was Mn(OAc)2.

Within its agency's context, each unit has its own management strategy, authority, and resources of conservation concern, many of which are migratory animals. Though some units are geographically isolated, many are nevertheless linked by paths of abiotic and biotic flows, such as rivers, air masses, flyways, and terrestrial and aquatic migration routes. Furthermore, individual land units exist within the context of a larger landscape pattern of shifting conditions, requiring managers to understand at larger spatial scales the status and trends in the synchrony and spatial concurrence of species and associated suitable habitats. Results of these changes will determine the ability of Alaska lands to continue to: provide habitat for local and migratory species; absorb species whose ranges are shifting northward; and experience mitigation or exacerbation of climate change through positive and negative atmospheric feedbacks. We discuss the geographic and statutory contexts that influence development of ecological monitoring; argue for the inclusion of significant amounts of broad-scale monitoring; discuss the importance of defining clear programmatic and monitoring objectives; and draw from lessons learned from existing long-term, broad-scale monitoring programs to apply to the specific contexts relevant to high-latitude protected areas such as those in Alaska. Such areas are distinguished by their: marked seasonality; relatively large magnitudes of contemporary change in climatic parameters; and relative inaccessibility due to broad spatial extent, very low (or zero) road density, and steep and glaciated areas. For ecological monitoring to effectively support management decisions in high-latitude areas such as Alaska, a monitoring program ideally would be structured to address the actual spatial and temporal scales of relevant processes, rather than the artificial boundaries of individual land-management units.

The present study aimed to directly unravel the active methanogens mediating methane release as well as active bacteria potentially involved in the trophic network. Therefore, the stable-isotope-labeled precursors of methane, [13C]acetate and H2-13CO2, were fed to liquid cultures from hard coal and mine timber from a coal mine in Germany. Guided by methane production rates, samples for DNA stable-isotope probing (SIP) with subsequent quantitative PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (DGGE) analyses were taken over 6 months. Surprisingly, the formation of [13C]methane was linked to acetoclastic methanogenesis in both the [13C]acetate- and the H2-13CO2-amended cultures of coal and timber.

Methane is 25 times more potent than CO2 as a GHG and is emitted into the atmosphere from enteric emissions and manure. Livestock operators can reduce CH4 emissions and may qualify for credits for its capture by utilizing manure management practices such as anaerobic digesters. Thus, livestock producers can play a role in reducing GHG emissions while also earning C offset credits. This paper has two related objectives. First, using data from Canada, we explore the economics of adoption of anaerobic digesters for Canadian dairy and hog producers. Second, using this example, we explore the institutional framework in place for livestock based GHG emissions and the sources of uncertainties facing both producers and consumers with regard to C offsets. From these two objectives we hope to better understand the potential gains for livestock producers, and consumers of CH4 based offsets, and identify potential institutional innovations needed to allow the offset market to function efficiently.This paper is part of the special issue entitled: Greenhouse Gases in Animal Agriculture - Finding a Balance between Food and Emissions, Guest Edited by T.A.

As passenger car emissions were found to be significant and rapidly increasing, their reduction was specially targeted. Following a bill passed by US Congress in 1968, requirements were set in 1970 for the vehicle manufacturers to reduce the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) with 90% by 1975, and nitrogen oxides (NO. x) with 90% by 1976. These requirements were soon adapted to the Japanese regulatory framework, and were known in both countries as the ""Muskie Act"" or ""Muskie Law"" after the senator who developed the original bill. The new requirements spurred tremendous research and development efforts. Car manufacturers and research institutions in USA, Japan and Europe investigated and developed alternative solutions, including gas turbine and steam engine vehicles. California, the USA state with the most severe air quality problems and the only state at the time allowed to establish more strict requirements than federal regulation, established requirements implying the use of oxidation catalysts in 1975 and three-way catalysts (TWC's) in 1977. Japan as a nation adopted similar requirements 1976 and 1978. Export of cars from Japan to USA increased rapidly. The rest of USA adopted emission standards similar to California's only in 1981, timing USA vehicle sales rebound after the energy crisis and grave economic downturn. Strict requirements were thus established only after more than a decade of civic and legal processes between federal authorities, the car manufacturers and NGO's. The history of vehicle development is one of cooperation and competition. This paper argues that the international cooperation on different levels of society (government, industry and science) together with commercial competition between the two countries was strong, continuous and instrumental in enabling the development of technology, appropriate regulation and infrastructural changes and thus created a market for cleaner cars and effectively reduced emissions from the growing vehicle fleet. In other words, the introduction of TWCs was reinforced by the simultaneous development of mitigating technology in two car producing countries competing for market space. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Automotive; Emission control; Environment; Innovation; International; Regulation","Air quality; Automobile engines; Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Commerce; Commercial vehicles; Competition; Emission control; Energy policy; Fleet operations; International cooperation; Nitrogen oxides; Technology transfer; Automotive; Automotive emission control; Cooperation and competitions; Environment; Environmental pollutions; International; Regulation; Research and development; Automobile manufacture; air quality; automobile; carbon monoxide; emission control; environmental protection; innovation; nongovernmental organization; pollution control; technological development; California; Japan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952757410

Recharge to the Wyodak-Anderson coal zone in the central portions of the PRB appears to be from the southern basin margin based on δ18O-H2O values and hydraulic gradients. Coal zones along the eastern margin, near the coal outcrop, represent mixing between surface water and deeper circulating groundwater. Coalbeds along the northwestern basin margin may contain high elevation recharge from the Bighorn Mountains, with flow patterns likely affected by local faults. Detectable 14C (0.39 to 4.13pmC) in coal waters throughout the PRB indicates they were recharged &lt;50,000BP. Correlation of δD-CH4 and δD-H2O values suggests that methane has accumulated since the Late Pleistocene. Nutrient concentrations (C, N and P species) are low throughout the PRB and do not correlate to groundwater flowpaths or methanogenic pathways; nutrients may be sourced from in-situ leaching of coals. Carbon isotope values of CH4 and CO2 likely indicate the extent of methanogenesis (i.e. early versus late stage), rather than the dominant metabolic pathway (i.e. acetate fermentation versus CO2 reduction). Coal gasses from the northwestern margin of the basin are isotopically depleted and suggest ""early stage"" methanogenesis, where the reactant carbon reservoir has not been significantly fractionated due to relatively rapid groundwater flow. Coal gasses from the central basin and southeastern margin are isotopically enriched and suggest ""late stage"" methanogenesis where the reactant carbon reservoir has been significantly depleted likely due to longer groundwater residence times. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Isotopes; Methane; Methanogenesis","Andersons; Carbon isotopes; Carbon reservoirs; Central Basin; Coal bed methane wells; Coalbeds; Flow path; Gas compositions; Groundwater residence; High elevation; Hydraulic gradients; In-situ; Isotopically enriched; Late Pleistocene; Late stage; Local faults; Metabolic pathways; Methanogenesis; Methanogenic pathways; Nutrient concentrations; Nutrient influx; Powder River Basin; Residence time; Surface coal mines; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Isotopes; Leaching; Natural gas wells; Nutrients; Underground reservoirs; Watersheds; Methane; coal seam; coalbed methane; flow pattern; groundwater flow; hydrocarbon reservoir; methanogenesis; recharge; residence time; Powder Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954585450

The uncertainties associated with hydrological models have traditionally been given less attention in impact assessments until relatively recently. In order to examine the role of hydrological model uncertainty (parameter and structural uncertainty) in climate change impact studies a multi-model approach based on the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) methods is presented. Six sets of regionalised climate scenarios derived from three GCMs, two emission scenarios, and four conceptual hydrological models were used within the GLUE framework to define the uncertainty envelop for future estimates of stream flow, while the GLUE output is also post processed using BMA, where the probability density function from each model at any given time is modelled by a gamma distribution with heteroscedastic variance. The investigation on four Irish catchments shows that the role of hydrological model uncertainty is remarkably high and should therefore be routinely considered in impact studies. Although, the GLUE and BMA approaches used here differ fundamentally in their underlying philosophy and representation of error, both methods show comparable performance in terms of ensemble spread and predictive coverage. Moreover, the median prediction for future stream flow shows progressive increases of winter discharge and progressive decreases in summer discharge over the coming century. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","BMA; Climate change; GLUE; Ireland; Rainfall-runoff model; Uncertainty","Bayesian model averaging; BMA; Catchment scale; Climate change impact; Climate scenarios; Emission scenario; Gamma distribution; Heteroscedastic; Hydrological impacts; Hydrological modelling; Hydrological models; Impact assessments; Impact study; Ireland; Multi-model; Rainfall-runoff model; Rainfall-runoff models; River catchment; Structural uncertainty; Uncertainty; Uncertainty estimation; Bayesian networks; Catchments; Climate models; Glues; Gluing; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Rain; Runoff; Stream flow; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change; Bayesian analysis; catchment; climate change; climate effect; general circulation model; hydrological modeling; probability density function; rainfall-runoff modeling; river discharge; river system; streamflow; uncertainty analysis; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954834257

It is well known that a performance of large-scale gas turbine is greatly affected by its inlet air temperature. However, the effect of the inlet air temperature on the performance of small-scale gas turbine (micro gas turbine) is not widely reported. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of the inlet air temperature on the performance of a micro gas turbine (MGT) with cogeneration system (CGS) arrangement. An analysis model of the MGT-CGS was set up on the basis of experimental results obtained in a previous study and a manufacturer standard data, and it was analysed under a various ambient temperature condition in a cold region. The results show that when ambient temperature increased, electrical efficiency ηele of the MGT decreased but exhaust heat recovery ηehr increased. It was also found that when ambient temperature increased, exhaust heat to mass flow rate Qexe/m e and exhaust heat recovery to mass flow rate Qehr/m e increased, with maximum ratios of 259 kJ/kg and 200 kJ/kg, respectively were found in summer peak. Furthermore, it was also found that the exhaust heat to power ratio Qexe/Pe had a similar characteristic with exhaust heat recovery to power ratio Qehr/P e. Qexe/Pe and Qehr/Pe increased with the increase of ambient temperature. Moreover, although different values of total energy efficiency, fuel energy saving and CO2 reduction for every temperature condition were found comparing with a two conventional system that were considered, the MGT-CGS could annually reduce 30,000-80,000 m3/y of fuel consumption and 35-94 t-CO2/y of CO2 emissions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Their impact on global carbon balances is less clearly understood. Increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) have been linked with global climate change. Currently there is a debate as to whether amenity turf is a net source or a net sink for atmospheric CO2. The turf grass of a natural sports pitch will sequester carbon through photosynthesis, but there are numerous emission sources associated with the management of turf which release CO2 into the atmosphere. These include the engines used to power mechanized operations such as mowing and spraying, the application of agrochemicals, including fertilizers, and the disposal of waste. In order to determine whether a real-world example of a sports facility was a source or sink of carbon a mechanistic mass balance model was developed. Analysis indicated that the areas of the golf course that received the most management attention were a net source of carbon emissions. The magnitude of these releases was significantly different on an equal-area basis (p&lt;0.01). The net carbon budget for turf grass areas across the whole golf course accounting for the sequestration by the turfgrass was 233.01MgC/year. The mature trees that formed an integral part of the landscape of the modelled course had a significant impact on the net carbon balance, resulting in overall net sequestration of 2177.3MgC/year for the whole golf course, equivalent to 21.93MgC/ha/year. The variability in the size, shape, and vegetation composition of different golf courses has a considerable impact on their net carbon balance, and the resultant environmental impact of sports facilities must be assessed on an individual basis.","Carbon budgeting; Carbon sequestration; Emissions modeling; Environmental impact; Mechanization optimization; Sustainability","Agricultural chemicals; Atmospheric chemistry; Biodiversity; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy conversion; Machinery; Recreation centers; Waste disposal; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Atmospheric CO; Carbon A; Carbon balance; Carbon emissions; Carbon sequestration; Emission sources; Emissions modeling; Global climate changes; Golf course; Integral part; Mass balance model; Mature trees; Net carbon budgets; Net sequestration; Quality of life; Significant impacts; Sports pitch; Turf-grasses; Turfgrass; Vegetation composition; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054868593

FP behaviour, while central to severe-accident evaluation, impacts: evolution of the kernel oxygen potential governing in turn carbon oxidation (amoeba effect and pressurization); particle pressurization through fission-gas release from the kernel; and coating mechanical resistance via reaction with some FPs (Pd, Cs, Sr). The HFR-Eu1bis experiment irradiated five HTR fuel pebbles containing TRISO-coated UO2 particles and went beyond current HTR specifications (e.g., central temperature of 1523 K). This study presents ceramographic and EPMA examinations of irradiated urania kernels and coatings. Significant evolutions of the kernel (grain structure, porosity, metallic-inclusion size, intergranular bubbles) as a function of temperature are shown. Results concerning FP migration are presented, e.g., significant xenon, caesium and palladium release from the kernel, molybdenum and ruthenium mainly present in metallic precipitates. The observed FP and micro-structural evolutions are interpreted and explanations proposed. The effect of high flux rate and high temperature on fission-gas behaviour, grain-size evolution and kernel swelling is discussed. Furthermore, Cs, Mo and Zr behaviour is interpreted in connection with oxygen-potential.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of CO2 on nasal allergen challenge. We conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover trial in 12 subjects with SAR outside their pollen season. Thirty minutes after a 20-second exposure to CO2 or no exposure, subjects underwent a unilateral, localized, nasal allergen challenge. Filter paper disks were placed on the nasal septum to deliver a sham challenge followed by 2 increasing doses of either grass or ragweed allergen. Secretions were collected from both sides of the septum to evaluate the nasonasal reflex and were assayed for histamine. Nasal and eye symptoms were recorded. The primary outcome measure was the contralateral, reflex, secretory response to allergen as measured by secretion weights. Secondary outcome measures included ipsilateral nasal secretion weights, nasal and eye symptoms, levels of histamine in nasal secretions, and eosinophils in nasal scrapings. Subjects reported a transient burning sensation during exposure to CO2. Compared with no treatment, active treatment resulted in a significant reduction in sneezes (p = 0.05), contralateral secretion weights (p = 0.04), and bilateral runny nose symptoms (p = 0.01). Ipsilateral secretion weights were numerically reduced. Histamine levels in ipsilateral nasal secretions increased significantly when the subjects received sham treatment but did not increase after pretreatment with CO 2. Treatment with nasal CO2 resulted in partial reduction of the acute response to allergen challenge. Reflex responses were reduced, supporting an effect on neuronal mechanisms, which predict usefulness in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Behavioural change has been promoted as a potential intervention strategy but very little evidence exists of the impact of such strategies on actual indoor air pollution indicators particularly in poor rural contexts. The aim of this study was to evaluate a community counselling intervention on stationary levels of PM10 and carbon monoxide (CO) as well as CO measured on children younger than five. Using a quasi-experimental design, baseline data was collected in an intervention (n=36) and a control (n=38) community; the intervention was implemented in the intervention community only; and follow-up data was collected one year later amongst the same households. Despite the fact that indoor air pollution was reduced in both communities, the intervention group performed significantly better than the control group when stratified by burning location. The net median reductions associated with the intervention were: PM10=57%, CO=31% and CO (child)=33% amongst households that burned indoor fires. The study provides tentative evidence that a health behaviour change is associated with reductions in child indoor air pollution exposure. The intervention is relatively inexpensive and easy to replicate. However, more powerful epidemiological studies are needed to determine the impact on health outcomes.","Child respiratory health; Health behaviour; Indoor air pollution; North West Province; South Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864804213

Given a fleet of construction equipment emitting different pollutants in the nonattainment (NA) and near -nonattainment (NNA) counties of a state and a set of emissions reduction technologies available for installation on equipment to control pollution/emissions, the model assists in determining the mix of technologies to be deployed so that maximum emissions reduction and fuel savings are achieved within a given budget. Three technologies considered for emissions reduction were designated as X, Y, and Z to keep the model formulation general so that it can be applied for any other set of technologies. Two alternative methods of deploying these technologies on a fleet of equipment were investigated with the methods differing in the technology deployment preference in the NA and NNA counties. The model having a weighted objective function containing emissions reduction benefits and fuel-saving benefits was programmed with C++ and ILOG-CPLEX. For demonstration purposes, the model was applied for a selected construction equipment fleet owned by the Texas Department of Transportation, located in NA and NNA counties of Texas, assuming the three emissions reduction technologies X, Y, and Z to represent, respectively, hydrogen enrichment, selective catalytic reduction, and fuel additive technologies. Model solutions were obtained for varying budget amounts to test the sensitivity of emissions reductions and fuel-savings benefits with increasing the budget. Different mixes of technologies producing maximum oxides of nitrogen (NOx) reductions and total combined benefits (emissions reductions plus fuel savings) were indicated at different budget ranges. The initial steep portion of the plots for NOx reductions and total combined benefits against budgets for different combinations of emissions reduction technologies indicated a high benefit-cost ratio at lower budget amounts. The rate of NOx reductions and the increase of combined benefits decreased with increasing the budget, and with the budget exceeding certain limits neither further NOx reductions nor increased combined benefits were observed. Finally, the Pareto front obtained would enable the decision-maker to achieve a noninferior optimal combination of total NOx reductions and fuel-savings benefits for a given budget. © 2011 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Budget control; C++ (programming language); Construction equipment; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Emission control; Fleet operations; Fuel additives; Fuel economy; Hydrogen fuels; Machinery; Multiobjective optimization; Nitrogen oxides; Selective catalytic reduction; Additive technology; Emissions reduction; Emissions-reduction technology; Multi-objective optimization models; Optimal combination; Technology deployment; Texas department of transportations; Weighted objective function; Cost reduction; hydrogen; nitrogen oxide; gasoline; air pollution; air pollution control; article; budget; building material; catalysis; cost effectiveness analysis; energy conservation; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; air pollution; economics; environment; environmental monitoring; equipment design; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; public health; statistical model; theoretical model; United States; Air Pollution; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Equipment Design; Gasoline; Models, Economic; Models, Theoretical; Motor Vehicles; Public Health; Texas; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961192706

Consequently, glaciers retreat and ice-covered areas become exposed. We report on a study from the Mittivakkat Gletscher forefield in Southeast Greenland with special focus on methanotrophy in relation to exposure time to the atmosphere. The Mittivakkat Gletscher has receded since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA; about AD 1850) and has left behind a series of deposits of decreasing age concurrently with its recession. Soil samples from this chronosequence were examined in order to elucidate main soil variables, as well as the activity and community structure of methanotrophs, a group of microorganisms involved in regulation of atmospheric methane. Soil variables revealed poor soil development, and incubation experiments showed methane consumption rates of 2.14 nmol CH4 day-1 gsoil-1 at 22 °C and 1.24 nmol CH4 day-1 gsoil-1 at 10 °C in the LIA terminal moraine. Methane consumption was not detected in younger samples, despite the presence of high-affinity methanotrophs in all samples. This was indicated by successful amplification of partial pmoA genes, which code for a subunit of a key enzyme involved in methane oxidation. In addition, the results of the diversity study show that the diversity of the methanotrophic community at the younger, recently deglaciated site P5 is poorer than the diversity of the community retrieved from the LIA moraine. We put forward the hypothesis that aerobic methanotrophs were at very low abundance and diversity during glaciation probably due to anoxia at the ice-sediment interface and that colonization after deglaciation is not completed yet. More detailed studies are required to explain the causes of discrepancy between activity and presence of high-affinity methanotrophs and its relation to the transit from ice-covered probably anoxic to ice-free oxic conditions. © 2011 Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research.",,"abundance; age determination; chronosequence; community structure; deglaciation; depositional environment; enzyme activity; experimental study; glaciation; glacier dynamics; glacier retreat; ice cover; ice free corridor; Little Ice Age; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; moraine; oxic conditions; oxidation; soil microorganism; soil property; spatial analysis; Ammassalik Island; Arctic; Greenland; Mittivakkat Glacier",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956049922

More specifically, using the Local Whittle estimator and its variants we examine whether relative per capita CO2 emissions are fractionally integrated, that is they are long memory processes which, although highly persistant, may revert to the mean/trend in the long run. Our results suggest that CO2 emissions within 13 out of 18 OECD countries are indeed fractionally integrated implying that they converge over time, albeit slowly. Interestingly though, the countries whose emissions are not found to be fractionally integrated are some of the highest polluters within the OECD, at least in per capita terms.

Here, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of new tailor-made BODIPY dyes with efficient absorption and emission in the blue spectral region. The major challenge is the effective management of the electron-donor strength of the substitution pattern, in order to modulate the emission of these novel dyes over a wide spectral range (430-500 nm). A direct relationship between the electron-donor character of the substituent and the extension of the spectral hypsochromic shift is seen through the energy increase of the LUMO state. However, when the electron-donor character of the substituent is high enough, an intramolecular charge-transfer process appears to decrease the fluorescence ability of these dyes, especially in polar media. Some of the reported novel BODIPY dyes provide very high fluorescence quantum yields, close to unity, and large Stokes shifts, leading to highly efficient tunable dye lasers in the blue part of the spectrum; this so far remains an unexploited region with BODIPYs. In fact, under demanding transversal pumping conditions, the new dyes lase with unexpectedly high lasing efficiencies of up to 63 %, and also show high photostabilities, outperforming the laser action of other dyes considered as benchmarks in the same spectral region. Considering the easy synthetic protocol and the wide variety of possible substituents, we are confident that this strategy could be successfully extended for the development of efficient blue-edge emitting materials and devices, impelling biophotonic and optoelectronic applications.

Longitudinal momentum distributions of the 22Mg breakup fragments, inclusive and in coincidence with γ rays de-exciting the residues, were measured. The ground-state structure of 23Al is found to be a configuration mixing of a d-orbital valence proton coupled to four core states-0gs+, 21+, 41+, 42+. We confirm the ground state spin and parity of 23Al as Jπ=5/2+. The measured exclusive momentum distributions are compared with extended Glauber model calculations to extract spectroscopic factors and asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs). The spectroscopic factors are presented in comparison with those obtained from large-scale shell model calculations. We determined the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the nuclear system 23Algs → 22Mg(0+) + p to be Cd5/22(23Algs)=(3.90±0.44) ×103fm-1, and used it to infer the stellar reaction rate of the direct radiative proton capture 22Mg(p,γ)23Al.

Overexpression of P-glycoprotein and other multidrug transporters at the blood- brain barrier is thought to play an important role in drug-refractory epilepsy. Thus, quantification of regionally different P-glycoprotein activity in the brain in vivo is essential to identify P-glycoprotein overactivity as the relevant mechanism for drug resistance in an individual patient. Using the radiolabeled P-glycoprotein substrate (R)-[11C]verapamil and different doses of coadministered tariquidar, which is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, we evaluated whether small-animal positron emission tomography can quantify regional changes in transporter function inthe rat brain at baselineand 48haftera pilocarpine-induced statusepilepticus.P-glycoprotein expression was additionally quantified by immunohistochemistry. To reveal putative seizure-induced changes in blood- brain barrier integrity, we performed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance scans on a 7.0 tesla small-animal scanner. Before P-glycoprotein modulation, brain uptake of (R)-[11C]verapamil was low in all regions investigated in control and post-status epilepticus rats. After administration of 3 mg/kg tariquidar, which inhibits P-glycoprotein only partially, we observed increased regional differentiation in brain activity uptake in post-status epilepticus versus control rats, which diminished after maximal P-glycoprotein inhibition. Regional increases in the efflux rate constant k2, but not in distribution volume VT or influx rate constant K1, correlated significantly with increases in P-glycoprotein expression measured by immunohistochemistry. This imaging protocol proves to be suitable to detect seizure-induced regional changes in P-glycoprotein activity and is readily applicable to humans, with the aim to detect relevant mechanisms of pharmacoresistance in epilepsy in vivo. © 2011 the authors.",,"carbon 11; gadolinium; glycoprotein P; tariquidar; verapamil; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; blood brain barrier; brain radiography; brain region; contrast enhancement; controlled study; epileptic state; female; immunohistochemistry; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; rat; seizure; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Area Under Curve; Blood-Brain Barrier; Calcium Channel Blockers; Carbon Isotopes; Computer Simulation; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Heterocyclic Compounds; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Chemical; Organometallic Compounds; P-Glycoprotein; Pilocarpine; Positron-Emission Tomography; Quinolines; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Scopolamine; Seizures; Time Factors; Verapamil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959292032

General, empirical allometric relationships are used to parameterize both the optimal prey size and size selectivity for each grazer class, as is rarely done. This inclusion of complex predator-prey linkages and realistic prey preferences yields a system with an emergent pattern of phytoplankton diversity consistent with global ocean observations, i.e., a parabolic relationship between diversity (as measured by the Shannon evenness) and biomass. It also yields significant long-term time evolution, which places limits on the extent to which the community response to nutrient forcing can be predicted from forcing in a pragmatic sense. When a simple annual cycle in nutrient supply is repeated exactly for many years, transient fluctuations up to a factor of two in spring bloom magnitude persist for 10-20 years before a stable seasonal biomass cycle is achieved. When the amplitude of the nutrient-supply annual cycle is given a random interannual modulation, these long-lived transients add significant noise to a 100-year correlation between annual-mean nutrient supply and annual-mean biomass. This noise is 20% of total interannual variance in the model base case, and ranges from 0% to 40% depending on the grazer size selectivity. In general, unpredictability on the bloom timescale is damped when food-web complexity is increased by making grazers less selective, while unpredictability on the interannual scale shows the opposite pattern, increasing with increasing food-web complexity up to a high threshhold, past which community structure and biomass time evolution both suddenly simplify. These results suggests a new strategy for ensemble ecosystem forecasting and uncertainty estimation, analogous to methods common in circulation and climate modeling, in which internal variability (predator-prey interactions in the biological case; eddies and climate-system oscillations in the physical case) are resolved and quantified, rather than suppressed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Coexistence; Diversity; Phytoplankton; Predictability; Size spectra; Zooplankton","Coexistence; Diversity; Predictability; Size spectra; Zooplankton; Algae control; Biomass; Blooms (metal); Phytoplankton; User interfaces; Nutrients; allometry; amplitude; annual variation; biomass; climate modeling; community response; correlation; emergence; empirical analysis; food web; global ocean; grazing; magnitude; numerical model; nutrient cycling; observational method; plankton; predator-prey interaction; prey size; size selection; size structure; species diversity; species evenness; spectral analysis; threshold; trophic interaction; uncertainty analysis; yield",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959643573

These approaches either lack a realistic chemical and physical representation of the atmosphere for secondary PM2.5 formation or in the case of photochemical models may be too resource intensive for single source assessments. A simple non-linear regression model has been developed to estimate annual average downwind primary and secondarily formed PM2.5 nitrate and sulfate from single emissions sources. The statistical model is based on single emissions sources tracked with particulate source apportionment technology in a photochemical transport model. This non-linear regression model is advantageous in that the underlying data is based on single emissions sources modeled in a realistic chemical and physical environment of a photochemical model and provides downwind PM2.5 impact information with minimal resource burden. Separate regression models are developed for primary PM2.5, PM2.5 sulfate ion, and PM2.5 nitrate ion. Regression model inputs include facility emissions rates in tons per year and the distance between the source and receptor. An additional regression model input of receptor ammonia emissions is used to account for the variability in regional ammonia availability that is important for PM2.5 nitrate ion estimates. © 2011.","Air quality modeling; Reduced form PM2.5 model; Single source PM2.5 contribution","Air quality modeling; Ammonia emissions; Annual average; Dispersion models; Eulerian; Gaussians; Grid-based; Non-linear regression; Nonlinear regression models; Particulate sources; Photochemical models; Physical environments; PM2.5 nitrate; Reduced form PM2.5 model; Regression model; Screening techniques; Single source; Single source PM2.5 contribution; Statistical models; Sulfate ion; Transport models; Air quality; Ammonia; Estimation; Ions; Linear regression; Particulate emissions; Models; ammonia; nitrate; sulfate; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); dispersion; emission inventory; Eulerian analysis; Gaussian method; nitrate; nonlinearity; numerical model; particulate matter; photochemistry; regression analysis; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; article; atmosphere; concentration (parameters); particulate matter; photochemistry; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958048247

Using recent data from the Cassini/Huygens mission on the atmospheric composition and surface and aerosol properties, we develop a multiple-scattering radiative transfer model for the Titan atmosphere. The Titan spectrum at these wavelengths is dominated by absorption due to methane with a series of strong absorption band systems separated by window regions where the surface of Titan can be seen. We use a line-by-line approach to derive the methane absorption coefficients. The methane spectrum is only accurately represented in standard line lists down to ~2.1μm. However, by making use of recent laboratory data and modeling of the methane spectrum we are able to construct a new line list that can be used down to 1.3μm. The new line list allows us to generate spectra that are a good match to the observations at all wavelengths longer than 1.3μm and allow us to model regions, such as the 1.55μm window that could not be studied usefully with previous line lists such as HITRAN 2008. We point out the importance of the far-wing line shape of strong methane lines in determining the shape of the methane windows. Line shapes with Lorentzian, and sub-Lorentzian regions are needed to match the shape of the windows, but different shape parameters are needed for the 1.55μm and 2μm windows. After the methane lines are modeled our observations are sensitive to additional absorptions, and we use the data in the 1.55μm region to determine a D/H ratio of 1.77±0.20×10-4, and a CO mixing ratio of 50±11ppmv.

Methane, methanol and glucose (with CORS -4, -2 and 0, respectively) were chosen as model organic pollutants. In the absence of external oxygen supply, microalgal photosynthesis was not capable of supporting a significant methane and methanol biodegradation due to their high oxygen demands per carbon unit, while glucose was fully oxidized by photosynthetic oxygenation. When bicarbonate was added, removal efficiencies of 37±4% (20 days), 65±4% (11 days) and 100% (2 days) were recorded for CH 4, CH3OH and C6H12O6, respectively due to the additional oxygen generated from photosynthetic bicarbonate assimilation. The use of NO 3 - instead of NH 4 + as nitrogen source (N oxidation-reduction state of +5 vs. -3) resulted in an increase in CH4 degradation from 0 to 33±3% in the absence of bicarbonate and from 37±4% to 100% in the presence of bicarbonate, likely due to a decrease in the stoichiometric oxygen requirements and the higher photosynthetic oxygen production. Hypothetically, the CORS of the substrates might affect the CORS of the microalgal biomass composition (higher lipid content).

As a result there is interest in using wetland restoration and conservation programs to mitigate the effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere. However, the same conditions which cause these systems to accumulate organic carbon also produce the conditions under which methanogenesis can occur. As a result prairie pothole wetlands are potential hotspots for methane emissions. We examined change in soil organic carbon density as well as emissions of methane and nitrous oxide in newly restored, long-term restored, and reference wetlands across the Canadian prairies to determine the net GHG mitigation potential associated with wetland restoration. Our results indicate that methane emissions from seasonal, semi-permanent, and permanent prairie pothole wetlands are quite high while nitrous oxide emissions from these sites are fairly low. Increases in soil organic carbon between newly restored and long-term restored wetlands supports the conclusion that restored wetlands sequester organic carbon. Assuming a sequestration duration of 33 years and a return to historical SOC densities we estimate a mean annual sequestration rate for restored wetlands of 2.7 Mg C ha-1year-1 or 9.9 Mg CO2 eq. ha-1 year-1. Even after accounting for increased CH4 emissions associated with restoration our research indicates that wetland restoration would sequester approximately 3.25 Mg CO2 eq. ha-1year-1. This research indicates that widescale restoration of seasonal, semi-permanent, and permanent wetlands in the Canadian prairies could help mitigate GHG emissions in the near term until a more viable long-term solution to increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can be found. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gas emissions; Methane; Prairie pothole wetlands","atmospheric pollution; carbon sequestration; conservation management; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; methane; methanogenesis; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; prairie; restoration ecology; soil organic matter; wetland management; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958810270

In order to increase the stage of macrofailure development, a special procedure of rock loading was used to reveal regularities of nucleation and evolution of electromagnetic and acoustic structures. The synchronised measurements of EMR and AE allowed the control of the stress-strain state in the rocks and the structural developments of fracturing. Nonhomogeneous distribution of the rock spatial crystalline structure subject to load leads to a mosaic distribution of EMR and AE characteristics. As a result, the crack scale effect may be observed in the EMR and AE structure behaviours. The EMR and AE following the failure at different levels behave differently according to the difference in the scale and type of cracks. Intense high-frequency EMR pulses were recorded during the initial stage of microcrack generation occurring prior to major failure of material. This was not the case for AE. The nucleation and development of the macroscopic progressive failure evolution caused an alternation in energetic and frequencial properties of electromagnetic and acoustic events. It has been detected that the tensile cracks were more efficient than shear cracks in capacity of EMR generation. The analysis of self potentials allowed reaching the maximum of registered anomalous variations in the stage of microcracking interaction. This stage showed an increase in the EMR activity, which implies the nucleation of microcracks in various regions of rock interfaces. The gradual accumulation of these defects led to weakening some parts of the rock along with a disintegration of electric anomalies, increase of AE and a significant fluctuation in the rate ofEMR. When crack concentration attains its critical value, which results in the formation of dangerous macroscopic failure of higher level, AE shows an intense activity as well as anEMRlower frequency. The hierarchical development of rock failure using the ratio of the average crack size and the mean distance between cracks as a statistical concentration criterion is used to control the boundary of the transition from small dispersed cracks accumulation to gradual crack merger and the formation of the main macrofailure. These results could be transferred into larger scale levels to forecast dynamic events in the earth crust. © The Author(s) 2010.","Defects; Heterogeneity; Physical subsystems; Space crystalline structure","Acoustic events; Acoustic structures; Biaxial compression; Crack sizes; Critical value; Crystalline structure; Dynamic events; Earth crusts; Electric anomalies; Failure process; Heterogeneity; High frequency HF; Initial stages; Macrosystems; Mean distances; Micro-crack generation; Non-homogeneous distribution; Physical subsystems; Progressive failure; Rock block; Rock failures; Rock sample; Scale effects; Self potential; Shear crack; Space crystalline structure; Stress strain state; Structural development; Synchronised measurements; Tensile crack; Crack detection; Crystalline materials; Defects; Electromagnetic waves; Electromagnetism; Microcracks; Nucleation; Rocks; Structural geology; Crystalline rocks; acoustic survey; biaxial test; crystal structure; crystallization; electromagnetic method; electromagnetic radiation; failure mechanism; fracture mechanics; heterogeneity; loading test; microcrack; nucleation; rock block; rock microstructure; stress-strain relationship; tensile stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960079364

Our geographic focus is the Willamette Valley-Puget Trough-Georgia Basin (WPG) ecoregion, comprised of valley lowlands formerly dominated by now-threatened prairies and oak savannas. We review climate model strengths and limitations, and summarize climate change projections and potential impacts on WPG prairies and oak savannas. We identify a set of six climate-smart strategies that do not require abandoning past management approaches but rather reorienting them towards a dynamic and uncertain future. These strategies focus on linking local and regional landscape characteristics to the emerging needs of species, including potentially novel species assemblages, so that prairies and savannas are maintained in locations and conditions that remain well-suited to their persistence. At the regional scale, planning should use the full range of biological and environmental variability. At the local scale, habitat heterogeneity can be used to support species persistence by identifying key refugia. Climate change may marginalize sites currently used for agriculture and forestry, which may become good candidates for restoration. Native grasslands may increasingly provide ecosystem services that may support broader societal needs exacerbated by climate change. Judicious monitoring can help identify biological thresholds and restoration opportunities. To prepare for both future challenges and opportunities brought about by climate change, land managers must incorporate climate change projections and uncertainties into their long-term planning. © 2011 by the Northwest Scientific Association.

From a capacity point of view, deep saline aquifers offer the greatest potential for CO2 storage. In this respect, well injectivity is considered a key technical and economical issue. Rock/fluid interactions - dissolution/precipitation of minerals, in particular carbonates - are currently considered as one of the principal reasons for wellbore injectivity changes in aquifers. This research investigated the mechanisms involved in injectivity losses through experimental and theoretical methods. The impact on injectivity of permeability changes occurring at various distances from the wellbore was studied using an idealised CO2 injection well flow model. A new experimental set-up was used to investigate the effect on dissolution/precipitation mechanisms of the pressure and temperature changes that the fluid is subjected to as it advances from the wellbore. Numerical modelling of the injection wellbore has shown that changes in the petrophysical properties of the reservoir several metres away from the wellbore can still have a significant impact on injectivity. As indicated by the experimental research carried out, pressure and temperature gradients that exist inside the reservoirs may lead to re-precipitation in the far field, however no significant permeability and porosity changes were detected to suggest major losses of injectivity due to these effects. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 storage; Dissolution; Injectivity; Limestone cores; Precipitation; Rock/fluid interaction","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Carbon emissions; CO2 storage; Deep saline aquifers; Experimental research; Experimental setup; Far field; Far-field region; Flow model; Injection wells; Injectivity; Medium term; Numerical investigations; Numerical modelling; Permeability change; Petrophysical properties; Porosity changes; Precipitation; Pressure and temperature; Re-precipitation; Rock/fluid interaction; Significant impacts; Wellbore; Air pollution; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Hydrogeology; Injection (oil wells); Limestone; Oil field equipment; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Pressure effects; Water injection; Oil well flooding; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolution; experimental study; flow modeling; fluid injection; limestone; numerical model; permeability; porosity; precipitation (chemistry); water-rock interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955618712

This instrument was developed specially for gravity wave investigation. The measured airglow spectra are matched to synthetic spectra calculated in advance for determination of the temperature in the mesopause region where the radiation maximum of some 2 emissions is situated. The synthetic spectra are transformed into a format which corresponds to the measured spectra in order to be matched. This transformation is based on the known values of the refractive index and the central wavelength of the interference filter used. A substantial part of the processing algorithms of the SATI images is connected with determination of these two filter parameters. The results of the original and newly-proposed algorithms for filter parameter calculation and their importance for the final results for temperature determination on the basis of the 2 (864-868 nm) emission measurements are presented. Considerable systematic differences (∼20 K) between temperatures at different points in the mesopause retrieved by the two algorithms are established. The advantage of the proposed algorithm over the original one is illustrated by retrieved rotational temperatures and by lower error values. Furthermore, the irregular errors in the nocturnal variation of the temperature retrieved by the original algorithm are absent when the proposed approach is applied. The error investigation in the calculations and the stability of the individual components of the processing algorithms and the calculation models may be helpful in achieving better results and enhancing the potentialities of the SATI instrument. © 2011 COSPAR.

Specific assessments are hence needed. This paper quantifies the dynamic evolution of carbon values for French climate and energy policy. Its time dependency over successive periods and the effects of setting intermediate targets are evaluated using a long-term optimization model. Addressing critical issues for France, we produce consistent energy, emissions and carbon value estimates with a 5-year time step. Our results are situated above the upper range of carbon value estimates of world models with an overlapping zone. We show that the official policy guideline value is only consistent with an optimistic combination of assumptions. The central estimates are 4 times greater than the guideline carbon value for 2050 and up to 14 times greater in 2020 because of short-term inertia that are costly to move. We also find that with intermediate objectives, the carbon value's dynamic is more than a simple upward curve and that its variability is itself time dependent. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon value; Long-term planning; MARKAL-TIMES models","Critical issues; Dynamic evolution; Large aggregates; Long term planning; MARKAL-TIMES models; National policies; Official policy; Optimization models; Overlapping zones; Time dependency; Time dependent; Time step; World model; Worldwide analysis; Energy policy; Estimation; carbon emission; energy planning; energy policy; environmental policy; guideline; numerical model; optimization; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957630322

Additional samples were collected in other urban sites of the Cantabria region to assess the metal content found in different urban environments within the region. To control for the mass attributed to inland regional background particulate matter, samples were also collected in Los Tojos village. The spatial variability of the major PM components shows that PM origins are different at inland and coastal sites. In the coastal city of Santander, the most important contributors are (i) the marine aerosol and (ii) the secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) and the total carbon (TC) in PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Additionally, the influence of the coastal location on the ionic balance of PM is also studied. The trace metal spatial variability is studied using the coefficient of divergence (COD), which shows that the levels of trace metals at the three studied urban sites are mainly influenced by local emission sources. The main local tracers are identified as follows: Mn in the Santander area; Mo, Cr and Pb at Reinosa; and Ni and V at Castro Urdiales. A more detailed source apportionment study of the local trace metals at Santander is conducted by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF); these two receptor models report complementary information. From these statistical analyses, the identified sources of trace metals in PM10 are urban background sources, industrial sources and traffic. The industrial factor was dominated by Mn, Cu and Pb, which are trace metals used in steel production and manganese-ferroalloy production plant. With respect to PM2.5, the identified emission sources of trace metals are combustion processes as well as traffic and industrial sources. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Major components; PM10; PM2.5; Positive Matrix Factorisation; Principal Component Analysis; Trace elements","Additional samples; Cantabria; Coastal area; Coastal cities; Coastal locations; Coastal sites; Combustion pro-cess; Emission sources; Factorisation; Industrial sources; Ionic balance; Local emissions; Major components; Marine aerosols; Metal content; Particulate Matter; PM component; PM10; PM2.5; Positive matrices; Positive Matrix Factorisation; Production plant; Receptor model; Rural environment; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Source apportionment; Spatial variability; Spatial variations; Statistical analysis; Steel production; Total carbon; Trace metal; Urban background; Urban environments; Urban site; Atmospheric aerosols; Cadmium; Chromium; Coastal zones; Factorization; Industrial emissions; Industry; Manganese; Mercury (metal); Metals; Molybdenum; Principal component analysis; Rhodium; Sodium; Steelmaking; Trace analysis; Vanadium; Trace elements; combustion; emission control; particulate matter; principal component analysis; statistical analysis; trace metal; urban pollution; Cantabria; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957949844

However, despite important achievements in this area in the last 10 years, significant levels of skill are only generally found over regions strongly connected with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. With the aim of improving the skill of regional climate predictions in tropical and extratropical regions from intraseasonal to interannual time scales, a new Met Office global seasonal forecasting system (GloSea4) has been developed. This new system has been designed to be flexible and easy to upgrade so it can be fully integrated within the Met Office model development infrastructure. Overall, the analysis here shows an improvement of GloSea4 when compared to its predecessor. However, there are exceptions, such as the increased model biases that contribute to degrade the skill of Niño-3.4 SST forecasts starting in November. Global ENSO teleconnections and Madden-Julian oscillation anomalies are well represented in GloSea4. Remote forcings of the North Atlantic Oscillation by ENSO and the quasi-biennial oscillation are captured albeit the anomalies are weaker than those found in observations.

As a result, afforestation is considered one of the key climate-change mitigation strategies available to governments by the United Nations1. However, forests are also less reflective than croplands, and the absorption of incoming solar radiation is greater over afforested areas. Afforestation can therefore result in net climate warming, particularly at high latitudes2-5. Here, we use a comprehensive Earth system model to assess the climate-change mitigation potential of five afforestation scenarios, with afforestation carried out gradually over a 50-year period. Complete (100%) and partial (50%) afforestation of the area occupied at present by crops leads to a reduced warming of around 0.45 and 0.25 °C respectively, during the period 2081-2100. Temperature benefits associated with more realistic global afforestation efforts, where less than 50% of cropland is converted, are expected to be even smaller, indicating that afforestation is not a substitute for reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. We also show that warming reductions per unit afforested area are around three times higher in the tropics than in the boreal and northern temperate regions, suggesting that avoided deforestation and continued afforestation in the tropics are effective forest-management strategies from a climate perspective. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Responses of terrestrial ecosystem processes and services - such as above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and maintenance of plant species diversity - to these extreme years for multiple years post-perturbation are poorly understood but can have significant feedback effects on net ecosystem CO2 uptake and ecosystem carbon sequestration. We exposed six 12000-kg intact natural tallgrass prairie monoliths to an extremely warm year (+4°C in 2003) in the second year of a 4-year study (2002-2005) using the EcoCELL whole-ecosystem controlled-environment, gas exchange facility. Six control monoliths were not warmed in the second year but were maintained under average field conditions. Natural diel and seasonal patterns in air temperature were maintained in both treatments throughout the study. Thus, with the exception of the second year in the 'warmed' treatment, we created 4years of nearly identical climate in all EcoCELLs. Interannual ANPP (10cm clipping height) responses of the entire plant community to the extreme year were largely determined by responses of the dominant C4 grasses. These included large decreases in ANPP in 2003 followed by complete recovery to levels observed in the control ecosystems in the year following warming. Species richness and productivity of the nitrogen-fixing plant functional group appeared to play a role in defining overall plant community ANPP, however, even though this richness and productivity could not explain the decrease in community ANPP observed in warmed ecosystems in the second year (2003) of the study or its recovery in the year after (2004). Surprisingly, very few of the 67 species present in plant communities during the 4-year study responded to the warm year at any time during or after the treatment. Synthesis. Results from this study indicate that as extreme climate years become more prevalent, their immediate and lagged impacts on collective ecosystem processes, such as whole-community ANPP, may be very pronounced, but effects on component ecosystem processes may be limited to the dominant plant functional group (ANPP). © 2011 The Authors.

Among these oxygenated fuels, biodiesel- and ethanol-diesel blends have great potential in reducing smoke opacity and, therefore, the particulate matter emitted. The smoke point is a technique used for determining the sooting tendency of kerosene and aviation fuels and it can be used as an indicator of smoke opacity. The smoke point technique can also be used with an extensive variety of fuels including automotive diesel fuels. This work proposes a new methodology for estimating the decrease in diesel engine exhaust opacity when different ethanol- and biodiesel-diesel blends are used instead of conventional diesel fuels. Different binary biodiesel-diesel and ethanol-diesel blends were tested in a smoke point lamp together with ternary ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends. The results of binary blends were compared to the opacity obtained in a light duty diesel engine operating in a steady state mode confirming that the molecular weight to smoke point ratio accurately reproduces the decreasing trend in opacity, when normalized to a conventional diesel fuel, as a function of the percentage of biodiesel or ethanol in the blend. Moreover, the new proposed methodology showed how not only the oxygen content but also its functional group plays an important role in this decreasing opacity trend. In this way, tests of ternary ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends on a smoke point lamp could predict the trend in smoke opacity when a diesel engine is fuelled with them. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Aviation fuel; Binary blends; Diesel engine exhaust; Ethanol-diesel blend; Euro-4 standards; Light-duty; Mass concentration; Oxygen content; Oxygenated fuel; Particulate Matter; Petroleum-derived fuels; Smoke opacity; Smoke point; Sooting tendency; Steady state mode; Biodiesel; Diesel fuels; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuels; Functional groups; Opacity; Particulate emissions; Smoke; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960576121

This paper deals with the methods to find mechanical properties of such nanoscale structures. First, the lattice structure method with the Poisson's ratio of 0.16 and the thickness of 3.4 is used to obtain the Young's moduli for the in-plane and out-of-plane deformation states. This method has the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations and efficiency of the finite element method. The graphene sheet is modeled as a plane grid of carbon atoms taken as the nodal points, each of which carries the mass of the carbon atom and is assigned as a six degrees of freedom. The covalent bond between two adjacent carbon atoms is treated as an extremely stiff frame element with all three axial, bending, and torsional stiffness components. Subsequently, the computed Young's moduli, approximately 0.11 TPa for bending and 1.04 TPa for the in-plane condition, are used for studying the vibrational behaviors of graphene sheets by the continuum plate theory. The natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of various shaped single layer graphene sheet), such as rectangular, skewed, and circular, are computed by the two methods which are found to yield very close results. Results of the well-established continuum plate theory are very consistent with the lattice structure method, which is based on accurate interatomic forces. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.",,"A-plane; Advanced materials; Broad spectrum; Carbon atoms; Deformation state; Free vibration; Graphene sheets; In-plane; Interatomic forces; Lattice structures; Mode shapes; Molecular dynamics simulations; Nanoscale structure; Nodal points; Out-of-plane; Plate theories; Poisson's ratio; Research fields; Single layer; Six degrees of freedom; Stiff frames; Torsional stiffness; Vibrational behavior; Young's Modulus; Atoms; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Finite element method; Molecular dynamics; Plates (structural components); Vibrations (mechanical); Graphene; carbon; graphene; analytic method; article; atom; controlled study; covalent bond; crystal structure; elasticity; finite element analysis; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; molecular dynamics; nanoanalysis; simulation; structure analysis; vibration; Young modulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863403877

The survey results identified a large number of landfills opened over the last 35 years and characterized by different kinds and amounts of waste disposed. Using the IPCC methodology, GHG emissions in the year 2008 were quantified to be 1.81 Mt CO 2-eq, which corresponds to 1.9% of overall GHG emissions in Lombardia. A dependency between collection efficiency and age of the collecting network has been established and used for the projection of GHG emission in the period 2009-2020, and for two scenarios: a business as usual (BAU) and an alternative one that implies policies to reduce biodegradable carbon content in the residual waste. The latter allows for a 45% reduction of the GHG emissions in 2020 compared to the year 2008, whereas in the BAU scenario the expected reduction is 32%. The sensitivity analysis shows that a variation of parameters that represent the carbon content of the waste category and degradation rate constant, within the range reported in the literature, could affect GHG emission level by about ±18%, whereas the uncertainty due to landfill gas (LFG) composition is less relevant. © 2011 The Author(s).","emissions estimates; greenhouse gases; Landfills; uncertainty","Business-as-usual; Carbon content; Collection efficiency; Degradation rate constants; Emission inventories; Gas extractions; GHG emission; IPCC methodology; Landfill gas; MSW landfills; Residual wastes; uncertainty; Variation of Parameters; Carbon dioxide; Collector efficiency; Degradation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Land fill; Rate constants; Sensitivity analysis; Surveys; Waste disposal; Greenhouse gases; carbon; assessment method; biodegradation; carbon; data set; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; landfill; literature review; survey; uncertainty analysis; waste disposal; biodegradation; carbon footprint; Italy; landfill; priority journal; review; sensitivity analysis; waste disposal; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; History, 20th Century; Italy; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Italy; Lombardy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052382177

Such projects could also present an important opportunity to reverse losses of biodiversity from degraded rain forests, but concern has recently been expressed that management interventions to increase carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a large-scale rain forest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we examine: (i) how intensive rehabilitation of selectively logged forests affected patterns of bird community composition and (ii) whether changes in vegetation structure explain observed shifts in avian guild structure and species composition. Bird composition differed between unlogged, naturally regenerating logged, and rehabilitated logged habitats, with the avifauna of rehabilitated forest more similar to that of naturally regenerating forest. Crucially, rehabilitation did not adversely affect either those species that declined after logging or those species that are IUCN Red Listed. Rehabilitation reduced the prevalence of vines and shrubs within regenerating forest, and across all habitats, the abundance and species richness of all birds and of obligate frugivores were positively related to vine prevalence. In contrast, the abundance and richness of frugivore-insectivore generalists and of salliers were negatively related to vines, suggesting that avifaunal responses to forest rehabilitation were attributable to liberation cutting of vines. Management intervention to increase carbon stocks had little adverse effect on avian biodiversity and we therefore argue that rain forest rehabilitation should play a strong role in future REDD+ agreements. © 2010 The Author(s).

The prognoses for traffic congestion are an important exception as they underestimated the congestion problems that would arise.

In this case, the water acts as a catalyst and this reaction can contribute to the atmospheric formation of a hydroxyl radical. Carbonyl oxides with electron withdrawing substituents and zwitterionic character have low energy barriers and react fast, whereas carbonyl oxides with electron releasing substituents have high energy barriers and react slowly. The position of the substituents plays also an important role and carbonyl oxides having a hydrogen atom substituent in syn react faster than carbonyl oxides having a hydrogen atom substituent in anti.

This study compares reduction potentials that might be achieved in 2060 for several advanced options including biofuels, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), assuming that technical and cost reduction targets are met and necessary fueling infrastructures are built. The study quantifies the extent of the reductions that can be achieved through increasing engine efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon fuels separately. Decarbonizing the fuels is essential for achieving large reductions in GHG emissions, and the study quantifies the reductions that can be achieved over a range of fuel carbon intensities. Although renewables will play a vital role, some combination of coal gasification with carbon capture and sequestration, and/or nuclear energy will likely be needed to enable very large reductions in carbon intensities for hydrogen and electricity. Biomass supply constraints do not allow major carbon emission reductions from biofuels alone; the value of biomass is that it can be combined with other solutions to help achieve significant results. Compared with gasoline, natural gas provides 20% reduction in GHG emissions in internal combustion engines and up to 50% reduction when used as a feedstock for producing hydrogen or electricity, making it a good transition fuel for electric propulsion drive trains. The material in this paper can be useful information to many other countries, including developing countries because of a common factor: the difficulty of finding sustainable, low-carbon, cost-competitive substitutes for petroleum fuels. © 2011 International Energy Initiative.","Carbon intensity; Fuel economy; Greenhouse gases; Low carbon fuels; Transportation fuels","Biofuels; Carbon capture; Coal combustion; Cost reduction; Developing countries; Emission control; Engines; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Motor transportation; Propulsion; Vehicles; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon intensity; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Low carbon fuels; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Transportation fuels; Transportation sector; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; biofuel; biomass; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; electric vehicle; emission control; energy efficiency; engine; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; sustainability; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957442079

In order to reveal whether carbonstarved bacteria also become less vulnerable to protist grazing, we compared the growth of a bac-terivorous nanoflagellate, Cafeteria roenbergensis, on different physiological states of 3 bacterial strains with well-studied starvation responses (Vibrio vulnificus, Photobacterium angustum and Sphingopyxis alaskensis). Protists achieved high growth rates on all 3 bacterial strains when they were provided in a non-starved state. However, for carbon-starved bacteria, pronounced differences in the response of the flagellates were observed. P. angustum provided similar protist growth for an equal biomass of nonstarved and starved cultures, indicating no change in food quality or grazing resistance for carbon-starved cells, despite smaller cell size. In contrast, starved V. vulnificus did not support protist growth, even resulting in a strong decrease in flagellate numbers at most concentrations tested; and starved S. alaskensis provided only reduced growth rates. Our results demonstrate that (1) feeding on bacteria of smaller cell size does not necessarily impose energy constraints on a flagellate grazer, and (2) a pronounced species-specific variability exists in the susceptibility of carbon-starved bacteria to protist grazing. © 2011 Inter-Research.","Bacteria; Carbon starvation; Grazing vulnerability; Growth rate; Protist","Bacteria (microorganisms); Cafeteria roenbergensis; Mastigophora (flagellates); Photobacterium; Photobacterium angustum; Protista; Sphingopyxis alaskensis; Vibrio vulnificus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961241647

As such, it was likely the last refugium for plants and animals that had inhabited the continent since it separated from the Gondwana supercontinent. Drill cores and seismic data acquired during two cruises (SHALDRIL I and II) in the northernmost Peninsula region yield a record that, when combined with existing data, indicates progressive cooling and associated changes in terrestrial vegetation over the course of the past 37 million years. Mountain glaciation began in the latest Eocene (approximately 37-34 Ma), contemporaneous with glaciation elsewhere on the continent and a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This climate cooling was accompanied by a decrease in diversity of the angiosperm-dominated vegetation that inhabited the northern peninsula during the Eocene. A mosaic of southern beech and conifer- dominated woodlands and tundra continued to occupy the region during the Oligocene (approximately 34-23 Ma). By the middle Miocene (approximately 16-11.6 Ma), localized pockets of limited tundra still existed at least until 12.8 Ma. The transition from temperate, alpine glaciation to a dynamic, polythermal ice sheet took place during the middle Miocene. The northernmost Peninsula was overridden by an ice sheet in the early Pliocene (approximately 5.3-3.6 Ma). The long cooling history of the peninsula is consistent with the extended timescales of tectonic evolution of the Antarctic margin, involving the opening of ocean passageways and associated establishment of circumpolar circulation.","Climate change; Cryosphere; Paleoclimate; Plant evolution; Polar biota","carbon dioxide; Antarctica; arctic climate; article; carbon footprint; Cenozoic; cold climate; Eocene; forest; glaciation; ice sheet; nonhuman; Oligocene; priority journal; species refuge; tundra; vegetation; Animalia; Coniferophyta; Fagus; Magnoliophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960985136

The average PM2.5 concentration during peak hours in the tunnel was found to be 67.6 ± 19.4 μg m-3. Analysis of carbonaceous species present (OC, EC, TC) was performed by both the NIOSH and IMPROVE thermal/optical protocols and carbonaceous species were found to make up 63-73% of the total PM in the tunnel. Comparison of TC concentrations obtained from each protocol revealed that no significant difference was present between the two protocols. Black carbon (BC), also used as a measure of EC, was determined using light reflection and BC values did not differ significantly from EC concentrations determined using the NIOSH and IMPROVE protocols. TC was also determined using EA/IRMS and it was found that TC concentrations from EA/IRMS directly correlated with TC results obtained using the NIOSH protocol. Stable isotope analysis of the PM2.5 yielded δ13C values from -24.7 to -28.3‰, typical of motor vehicles. Analysis of particle-phase PAHs by thermal desorption GC/MS revealed an average total PAH concentration of 70.0 ± 4.1 ng m-3 and PAHs were found to contribute 0.10% of total PM2.5 in the tunnel. PAH emissions in the tunnel were found to be enriched in low molecular weight PAHs, indicative of emissions from diesel-fueled vehicles.

We studied the potential effects of O3 on photosynthesis and leaf area index (LAI) as well as the feedback between vegetation and atmospheric chemistry using a land surface model (ORCHIDEE) at high spatial resolution (30km) coupled with a chemistry transport model (CHIMERE) for the whole year 2002. Our results show that the effect of tropospheric O3 on vegetation leads to a reduction in yearly gross primary production (GPP) of about 22% and a reduction in LAI of 15-20%. Larger impacts have been found during summer, when O3 reaches higher concentrations. During these months the maximum GPP decrease is up to 4gCm-2day-1, and the maximum LAI reduction is up to 0.7m2m-2. Since CHIMERE uses the LAI computed by ORCHIDEE to estimate the biogenic emissions, a LAI reduction may have severe implications on the simulated atmospheric chemistry. We found a large change in O3 precursors that however leads to small changes in tropospheric O3 concentration, while larger changes have been found for surface NO2 concentrations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biogenic emissions; Chemistry transport model; Leaf area index; Ozone; Photosynthesis; Terrestrial ecosystem model","atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; computer simulation; estimation method; leaf area index; net primary production; numerical model; ozone; photosynthesis; terrestrial ecosystem; troposphere; vegetation; Europe; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957861570

A principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the dataset provided four sources relevant for the area under investigation, that were identified as combustion processes, crustal, marine aerosol and secondary particulate matter. The integrated approach used in this work (chemical characterization of the samples, meteorological information and statistical analysis) allowed to evaluate the synergistic effect of regional secondary particulate and long-transport contributions to PM 10 concentrations at the sampling sites and to provide useful information in order to characterize the most relevant local emission sources.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051501227

However, vegetation also contains a series of trace elements which present unique narrowband spectral emission lines in the visible and near infrared wavelength range when the biomass is heated to high temperatures during the process of flaming combustion. These spectral lines can be discriminated by detector systems that are less costly than the longer wavelength, actively cooled instruments more typically used in EO-based active fire studies. The main trace element resulting in the appearance of spectral emission lines appears to be potassium (K), with features at 766.5. nm and 769.9. nm. Here we study K-emission line spectral signature in laboratory scale fires using a field spectrometer, at a series of moderately-sized woodland and shrubland fires using airborne imagery from a new compact hyperspectral imager (HYPER-SIM.GA) operating at a relatively fine spectral sampling interval (1.2. nm), and at large open wildfires using the EO-1 satellite's Hyperion sensor. We derive a metric based on band differencing of the spectral signal both close to and outside of the K-line region in order to quantify the magnitude of the K-emission signature, and find that variations in this metric appear to track quite well with the commonly used measures of fire radiometric temperature and fire radiative power (FRP). We find that substantial flaming activity is required to generate a potassium emission signature, but that once present this can be detected using airborne remote sensing even through a substantial smoke layer that apparently obscures fire across the remainder of the VIS spectral range. Being specific to flaming combustion, detection of the K-emission line signature could prove useful in refining estimates of the gases released in open wildfires, since trace gas emission factors can vary substantially between flaming and smouldering stages. Finally, we demonstrate the first identification of the K-emission line signature from space using the EO-1 Hyperion instrument, but find it detectable only in certain instances. We conclude that a finer spectral and spatial resolution than that offered by Hyperion is required for improved detection performance. Nevertheless, our results point to the potential effectiveness of airborne and spaceborne K-emission signature detection as a complement to the more common thermal remote sensing approaches to wildfire detection and analysis. Sensors targeting this application should consider careful placement of the measurement wavelengths around the location of the K-line wavelengths, in part to minimise influences from the nearby oxygen A-band features. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Fire radiative power; Potassium emission; Thermal remote sensing; Wildfires","Active fires; Airborne imagery; Airborne remote sensing; Detection performance; Detector systems; Energy emissions; Fire radiative power; Flaming combustion; High temperature; Hyperion; Hyperspectral imagers; Laboratory-scale fire; Multi-resolutions; Narrow bands; Oxygen A-band; Radiometric temperature; Shrublands; Signature detection; Smoke layer; Space-borne; Spaceborne remote sensing; Spatial resolution; Spectral analysis; Spectral emission; Spectral line; Spectral range; Spectral region; Spectral sampling; Spectral signal; Spectral signature; Thermal remote sensing; Trace gas emissions; Visible and near infrared; Wildfire detection; Wildfires; Combustion; Detectors; Electromagnetic wave emission; Gas emissions; Infrared radiation; Petroleum refining; Potassium; Remote sensing; Sampling; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Trace elements; Vegetation; Fires; airborne sensing; biomass; combustion; emission inventory; potassium; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; shrubland; smoke; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; trace element; wavelength; wildfire; woodland; Hyperion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957626714

Cities have grown rapidly in the age of cheap oil, creating a landscape of major and megacities, and emerging megaregions. In this rapidly urbanizing world, cities now consume 75% of the world's energy and emit 80% of the world's GHGs and are presently growing globally at the rate of 2% per year. Reducing oil use is both an environmental and political necessity. However, it is not without economic and social ramifications, which may be different at different locations, and at different time periods in the same location. This article discusses the need for considering carbon management in the context of local socioeconomic conditions and constraints in different countries and regions. The sustainability footprint model is presented and applied to highlight differences in the marginal costs of development with respect to carbon reduction and the implications for effective carbon management. The study findings indicate that the marginal costs of human development, with respect to carbon footprint reduction, tend to be higher as human development increases. This implies that a comprehensive approach to carbon management is necessary and that exploring different standards and targets for different typologies of countries based on their present levels of development may be helpful in developing the consensus needed for global standards for effective carbon management. © 2011 Future Science Ltd.",,"Carbon footprint; Carbon management; Carbon reduction; Global perspective; Global standards; Human development; Marginal costs; Megacities; Socio-economic conditions; Time-periods; Cost reduction; Sustainable development; Standardization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052095054

However, the low wood productivity and the presence of multi-stemmed trees restrict the use. Prosopis flexuosa woodlands are protected and inhabited by pastoralists who have land rights to use natural resources. As in other forests in the world, dead branches are the most commonly used. The factors causing the death of branches these trees are unknown. As P. flexuosa is a highly heliophilous species, branch mortality may depend on the growth habit and orientation of dry branches under the tree crown. With the participation of inhabitants, we assessed the present availability of deadwood in two Prosopis woodlands of different structure (semi-closed and open woodland), and evaluated the formation of deadwood in terms of shape and cardinal location of dry branches under the crown. We developed and compared regression models to estimate the amount of deadwood for erect, semi-erect and decumbent trees, and for the north and south areas under the crown (n=120 trees). In addition, to determine the period of growth decline and the factors determining branch mortality, we compared annual radial increment between live and dead branches (n=30 trees; 10 for each tree shape). The total amount of deadwood in adult Prosopis trees is higher in the semi-closed than in the open woodland (8.6 and 4.4Tnha-1, respectively). Only tree size determined the amount of deadwood present in each Prosopis tree, since we found no evidence related to the shape of the tree or the position of dry branches in the canopy. Branch decay was a large process of 18-20years, and branch death appears to be the result of the action of climatic factors (dry period). The results suggest that the use of deadwood by the desert inhabitants is a tool that can potentially be used; however, the use of this resource taking into account the generation rates of deadwood has not been developed in arid lands. These practices at appropriate sites can contribute to a sustainable management of these woodlands, including the removal of deadwood in a model of local management on a site where potential productivity is relatively low. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Branch decay; Deadwood; Prosopis; Radial growth; Tree shape","Branch decay; Deadwood; Prosopis; Radial growth; Tree shape; Forestry; Productivity; Regression analysis; Plant extracts; arid region; forest management; forestry production; legume; mortality; pastoralism; population decline; population growth; regression analysis; sustainable forestry; woodland; Dead Wood; Decay; Forestry; Growth; Productivity; Prosopis; Regression Analysis; Argentina; Monte; Prosopis; Prosopis flexuosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957904658

Caspase-3 activation contributes to brain tissue loss and downstream biochemical events that lead to programmed cell death after traumatic brain injury. Alleviation of symptoms following ischemic neuronal injury can be potentially achieved by either genetic disruption or pharmacological inhibition of caspases. Here, we studied whether silencing of Caspase-3 using carbon nanotube-mediated in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) could offer a therapeutic opportunity against stroke. Effective delivery of siRNA directly to the CNS has been shown to normalize phenotypes in animal models of several neurological diseases. It is shown here that peri-lesional stereotactic administration of a Caspase-3 siRNA (siCas 3) delivered by functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNT) reduced neurodegeneration and promoted functional preservation before and after focal ischemic damage of the rodent motor cortex using an endothelin-1 induced stroke model.

The inventory was developed using data derived from farm surveys and national statistical records in Saudi Arabia from 2003 to 2007, as well as Tier 1 and 2 emission factors for enteric fermentation and manure management as proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The national CH4 emission inventory, developed using Tier 1 default factors, increased from 87,069t in 2003 to 100,971t in 2007, with a CO2 equivalent of 2,176,735 and 2,524,287t, respectively. The contribution to the inventory varied considerably among provinces, ranging from 0.1% (Northern) to 40.6% (Riyadh) in 2007 when horse data were not included. Among animal species, dairy cattle and sheep were the biggest CH4 producers (37.7% and 35.5%, respectively), followed by camels (13.4%), goats (11.4%), chickens (1.6%) and horses (0.4%). National CH4 emissions consisted of 0.87 from enteric fermentation and 0.13 from manure storage. Tier 2 CH4 emission factors were developed for dairy cattle and sheep, with each species divided into two groups (i.e., specialised high genetic merit and traditional low genetic merit), and each group of cattle and sheep were further divided into subgroups according to their physiological states. These factors for enteric fermentation and manure management were all different from Tier 1 default factors, and resulted in a decrease of 2088t in CH4 emission inventories (CO2 equivalent of 52,200t) from cattle and sheep when estimated using Tier 2, rather than Tier 1, factors. In comparison with other countries, the national CH4 emission inventory from domestic animals in Saudi Arabia is relatively small in terms of CH4 emissions per unit of land area or human population. These results can be used, with data from other agricultural sectors, to develop a national greenhouse gas inventory for the entire agricultural sector of Saudi Arabia.This paper is part of the special issue entitled: Greenhouse Gases in Animal Agriculture - Finding a Balance between Food and Emissions, Guest Edited by T.A.

The available models used to evaluate the possibility of using canal water are too complicated and their applications are difficult. As such some potential opportunities for using canal water for cooling are being lost. This paper addresses current concerns to produce an interactive numerical model that will produce a three dimensional representation of the temperature distribution of heated water discharged into a still water region. The interactive model may be manipulated by non technical personnel to evaluate different discharge scenarios and ensure that the proposal does not infringe the stringent regulations imposed by the Environmental Agencies. The proposed model makes use of information gathered from real on-site testing using a thermal camera and grid measurements in addition to a laboratory experimental tank that duplicates the various on-site options. The parameters of temperature, velocity and boundaries were determined in both practical processes using a predefined grid mesh that covered the mixing zone. These practical results gave the turbulent diffusivity which was then used in the formulation of the model that was optimised to represent the real system results. It is shown that the results from the on-site testing, the laboratory results and the 3-D model all give complementary values so validating the final model.","Thermal discharge; Thermal pollution; Turbulent heat diffusion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955821446

The addition of exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) has been shown to improve the fuel consumption of gasoline engines, either port fuel injected or direct injected, by reducing pumping losses and knock and eliminating the enrichment region.In addition, the use of EGR has been shown to substantially reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and CO. A 2.4-litre multi-point injection engine and a 1.6-litre gasoline direct injection engine were run with high levels of both cooled and uncooled EGR. Unlike numerous previous publications, these engines included a modified ignition system that allows extension of the cooled EGR limit of the engine to greater than 25 per cent and improves combustion at lower EGR levels. The results showed that an improvement of between 5 and 30 per cent in fuel consumption is possible, with the largest improvement occurring in the typical enrichment region. In addition, the results showed that EGR can reduce knock, resulting in an improvement in combustion phasing. Finally, the high levels of EGR reduced the emissions of CO by 30 per cent and of NOx by up to 80 per cent. A detailed effort has been made to quantify the sources of improvement throughout the engine cycle and to demonstrate an EGR strategy (cooled EGR at high loads, internal EGR at low loads) that will maximize fuel consumption improvements. The results presented here indicate that the use of EGR in gasoline engines has the potential to reduce fuel consumption and emissions in a very cost-effective manner. © Authors 2011.","Cooled exhaust-gas recirculation; Efficiency; Fuel economy; Ignition","Combustion phasing; Cooled EGR; Fuel enrichment; Gasoline direct injection engines; Gasoline engines; High load; Inherent limitations; Internal EGR; Low load; Pumping loss; Recirculations; Uncooled; Combustion knock; Direct injection; Engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel purification; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Ignition; Ignition systems; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Pumps; Steel metallurgy; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054808645

Sixth Street, Tucson, AZ 85719, United States","1.Shifts in the spatial and temporal patterns of flowering could affect the resources available to pollinators, and such shifts might become more common as climate change progresses. 2.As mid-summer temperatures have warmed, we found that a montane meadow ecosystem in the southern Rocky Mountains of the United States exhibits a trend toward a bimodal distribution of flower abundance, characterized by a mid-season reduction in total flower number, instead of a broad, unimodal flowering peak lasting most of the summer season. 3.We examined the shapes of community-level flowering curves in this system and found that the typical unimodal peak results from a pattern of complementary peaks in flowering among three distinct meadow types (dry, mesic and wet) within the larger ecosystem. However, high mid-summer temperatures were associated with divergent shifts in the flowering curves of these individual meadow types. Specifically, warmer summers appeared to cause increasing bimodality in mesic habitats, and a longer interval between early and late flowering peaks in wet and dry habitats. 4.Together, these habitat-specific shifts produced a longer mid-season valley in floral abundance across the larger ecosystem in warmer years. Because of these warming-induced changes in flowering patterns, and the significant increase in summer temperatures in our study area, there has been a trend toward non-normality of flowering curves over the period 1974-2009. This trend reflects increasing bimodality in total community-wide flowering. 5.The resulting longer periods of low flowering abundance in the middle of the summer season could negatively affect pollinators that are active throughout the season, and shifts in flowering peaks within habitats might create mismatches between floral resources and demand by pollinators with limited foraging ranges. 6.Synthesis. Early-season climate conditions are getting warmer and drier in the high altitudes of the southern Rocky Mountains. We present evidence that this climate change is disrupting flowering phenology within and among different moisture habitats in a sub-alpine meadow ecosystem, causing a mid-season decline in floral resources that might negatively affect mutualists, especially pollinators. Our findings suggest that climate change can have complex effects on phenology at small spatial scales, depending on patch-level habitat differences. © 2011 The Authors.

A new simplified index is introduced, namely the south exposure coefficient Cfs. In fact, as far as bioclimatic architecture is concerned, the relationship between buildings and natural environment is very important both for the control of indoor comfort conditions and energy requirements. The building shape is a fundamental aspect of this relationship. Usually, in thermal behavior analysis this parameter is considered only from the point of view of compactness. This is a reductive approach, because two buildings with the same coefficient could have different shapes and so a different thermal behavior. Some aspects such as orientation, openings, exposure to atmospheric agents and natural elements must also be strictly considered. Moreover, in scientific literature no indications are given to designers who operate in mild and warm climate conditions. This is why the results of a research activity focused on heating requirements of buildings with different shapes and laid in the Italian territory are presented. Monthly calculations have been performed following the quasi-steady-state method suggested in the European standard. Outputs show that better results in the building energy performance can be achieved considering a bioclimatic (though simplified) approach since the very beginning. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioclimatic architecture; Building shape; Energy efficiency; Parametric approach; Solar exposure","Atmospheric agents; Bioclimatic architecture; Bioclimatic design; Building energy performance; Building heating; Climatic conditions; Coefficient c; Comfort conditions; Design process; Energy requirements; European Standards; Natural elements; Natural environments; Parametric approach; Quasi-steady state; Research activities; Scientific literature; Solar exposure; Thermal behaviors; Warm climates; Architecture; Energy efficiency; Heating; Solar energy; Structural design; architectural design; energy efficiency; heating; indoor air; parameterization; shape; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953173522

The latter following the transfer of another electron furnishes a ferric-peroxyanion, FeIII-O-O-, which after protonation leads to the fission of the O-O bond resulting in the formation of FeVO, the key player in the hydroxylation process. Certain members of the P-450 family, including CYP17 and CYP19, catalyze, at the same active site, not only the hydroxylation process but also an acyl-carbon bond cleavage reaction which has been interpreted to involve the nucleophilic attack of the ferric-peroxyanion, FeIII-O-O-, on the acyl carbon to furnish a tetrahedral intermediate which fragments, leading to acyl-carbon cleavage. Evidence is presented to show that in the case of CYP17 the attack of FeIII-O-O- on the target carbon is promoted by cytochrome b5, which acts as a conformational regulator of CYP17. It is this regulation of CYP17 that provides a safety mechanism which ensures that during corticoid biosynthesis, which involves 17α-hydroxylation by CYP17, androgen formation is avoided. Finally, a brief account is presented of the inhibitors, of the two enzymes, which have been designed on the basis of their mechanism of action.

In particular the importance of heating is decreasing, but the share of electricity use is increasing. When the CO2 equivalent emissions are considered, the CO2 emissions from embodied energy make up an important share of the total, indicating that the building materials have a high importance which is often ignored when only the energy efficiency of running the building is considered. This paper studies a new office building in design phase and offers different alternatives to influence building energy consumption, CO2 equivalent emissions from embodied energy from building materials and CO2 equivalent emissions from energy use and how their relationships should be treated. In addition this paper studies how we should weight the primary energy use and the CO2 equivalent emissions of different design options. The results showed that the reduction of energy use reduces both the primary energy use and CO2 equivalent emissions. Especially the reduction of electricity use has a high importance for both primary energy use and CO2 emissions when fossil fuels are used. The lowest CO2 equivalent emissions were achieved when bio-based, renewable energies or nuclear power was used to supply energy for the office building. Evidently then the share of CO2 equivalent emissions from the embodied energy of building materials and products became the dominant source of CO2 equivalent emissions. The lowest primary energy was achieved when bio-based local heating or renewable energies, in addition to district cooling, were used. The highest primary energy was for the nuclear power option. © 2011 by the authors.","Energy efficiency; Primary energy","Building materials; Buildings; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Office buildings; Building energy consumption; District cooling; Electricity use; Energy efficient; Materials and products; Primary energies; Primary energy use; Renewable energies; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052815517

The objective of this study was to compare the predicted EEP of two soils by means of the Spanish Version of the Wind Erosion Equation (EWEQ), with field-measured EEP in a semiarid environment of Argentina, loaded with different climatic C factors. Wind erosion measurements were carried out along one year in a Typic Ustipsammment and an Entic Haplustoll, both maintained bare and flat along the sampling period. Results indicated that EEP was higher in the Ustipsamment (270 Mg ha-1 yr-1) than in the Haplustoll (40 Mg ha-1 yr-1). These amounts represented 21,3 and 3,1 mm losses of the topsoil. Wind erosion of the Ustipsamment was twice in Spring-Summer than in Autumn-Winter. This effect was not observed in the Haplustoll, due to a slower drying rate after a rainfall event, which maintained the soil surface moist during a longer period of time. Storm duration explained 40% of the wind erosion variability in both soils. Wind erosion rates (Qt, EEP per unit time) correlated positively with the mean wind speed in both soils. At similar wind speeds, Qt was always higher in the Typic Ustipsamment. The EEP calculated with a C factor corresponding to the sampling period (30,3) was the most similar to field measurements, but EWEQ underestimated wind erosion by 43% for the Haplustoll and by 18% for the Ustipsamment. The EWEQ model should include different climatic C factors in order to offer the user the prediction of wind erosion under variable climatic scenarios. © 2012 Asociación Argentina de la Ciencia del Suelo.","Prediction models; Semiarid regions; Wind erosion","agricultural soil; climate effect; loess; numerical model; prediction; semiarid region; soil moisture; storm; topsoil; wind erosion; wind velocity; Argentina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865813981

The NYC waterfront plays a crucial role as a first line of flood defense and in managing flood risk and protecting the city from future climate change and sea-level rise. The city of New York has embarked on a climate adaptation program (PlaNYC) outlining the policies needed to anticipate the impacts of climate change. As part of this policy, the Department of City Planning has recently prepared Vision 2020: New York City Comprehensive Waterfront Plan for the over 500 miles of NYC waterfront (NYC-DCP, 2011). An integral part of the vision is to improve resilience to climate change and sea-level rise.

The key is a relatively large dam wall and a small but deep 40 GL lake in a catchment area that receives 6-10 m of precipitation annually (120-160 GL run off). This would secure all current and future water needs for Cairns. The lake would be coupled by a vertical shaft to a 250 MW (peak) hydro-power station 500 m below and inside the mountain. From there, a 6 km tunnel running east connects with the coastal dam service-tunnel and a 3 km tunnel running west takes the water back to the river below the falls. On average this would result in the release of 300 ML/d opening up opportunities for tourism, new industries, and irrigated farming of high yield crops. The tunnel offers the possibility of a new transport corridor from the Coast to Atherton on the central tablelands. The increased flows in the dry season could be important for the health of the river which is also a nursery-ground for the Great Barrier Reef. The CO2 savings from reduced coal fire power needs are significant. Comparative analysis with all three local dams shows that the proposed lake is smaller and many times more useful per m2. Importantly, this reliable hydro-power would allow considerable regional load-balancing of unreliable wind and solar power, representing a big step away from dependence on remotely provided power which is a key recommendation in the widely supported Tropical North Queensland - Sustainable Region Initiative. © 2011 Desalination Publications.

Charged products were measured by means of the 4π INDRA array. Kinetic-energy spectra and angular distributions of fragments with atomic number 3 ≤Z≤ 28 indicate a high degree of relaxation and are compatible with a fissionlike phenomenon. Persistence of structure effects is evidenced from elemental cross sections (σZ) as well as a strong odd-even staggering (o-e-s) of the light-fragment yields. The magnitude of the staggering does not significantly depend on the neutron content of the emitting system. Fragment-particle coincidences suggest that the light partners in very asymmetric fission are emitted either cold or at excitation energies below the particle emission thresholds. The evaporation residue cross section of the Kr78+Ca40 reaction is slightly higher than the one measured in the Kr82+Ca40 reaction. The fissionlike component is larger by ~25% for the reaction having the lowest neutron-to-proton ratio. These experimental features are confronted to the predictions of theoretical models. The Hauser-Feshbach approach including the emission of fragments up to Z = 14 in their ground states as well as excited states does not account for the main features of σZ. For both reactions, the transition-state formalism reasonably reproduces the Z distribution of the fragments with charge 12 ≤Z≤ 28. However, this model strongly overestimates the light-fragment cross sections and does not explain the o-e-s of the yields for 6 ≤Z≤ 10. The shape of the whole Z distribution and the o-e-s of the light-fragment yields are satisfactorily reproduced within the dinuclear system framework which treats the competition among evaporation, fusion-fission, and quasifission processes. The model suggests that heavy fragments come mainly from quasifission while light fragments are predominantly populated by fusion. An underestimation of the cross sections for 16 ≤Z≤ 22 could signal a mechanism in addition to the capture process. © 2011 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960935762

This transformation is unlikely without a high level of stakeholder engagement in the policy development process. This paper describes two policy development processes recently undertaken in Nova Scotia in which the inclusion of stakeholder views was central to the approach. The first delivered a new institutional framework for electricity energy efficiency involving the inception of an independent performance-based administrator. The second required the delivery of a strategy to significantly increase renewable energy generation in the Province. It involved recommendations for changes in institutional arrangements, financial incentives and technological options. This process was followed by new commitments to renewable energy developments, new infrastructure for the importation of hydro-electricity, and the announcement of FITs for ocean energy. In both cases, recommendations were made by an independent academic institution, and the Government responded directly to a majority of recommendations. The paper concludes with a discussion of lessons learned and the implications for future energy policy making in carbon-intensive jurisdictions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Participatory approach; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable energy policy","A-carbon; Academic institutions; Energy consumer; Energy strategy; Financial incentives; Fossil fuel sources; Institutional arrangement; Institutional framework; Nova Scotia; Ocean energy; Participatory approach; Policy development process; Policy makers; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy generation; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable energy; Sustainable energy policy; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Power quality; Wave power; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; fossil fuel; institutional framework; participatory approach; policy development; policy strategy; stakeholder; strategic approach; sustainable development; Canada; Nova Scotia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953323623

Because it is yet an evolving sector, the sustainability of bioenergy production in different regions is very elusive. Experiences show that bioenergy policies in one region can have impacts not only on its own but also on other regions' social, economic and ecological sustainability. It is thus important to assess development pathways for bioenergy to exploit the potential benefits and forestall any unnecessary costs. This paper frames a novel hybrid approach for assessing bioenergy potentials for regions with diverging economic, social and ecological systems. The approach is based on a conceptual framework that takes into account trade-offs decisions on sustainability goals and production options in the assessment of bioenergy pathways. It combines different empirical techniques for the systematic investigation of trade-offs and pathways including fuzzy logic, conjoint, logit, and path analyses. To show the relevance and utility of these techniques for the integrated assessment of trade-offs and pathways in bioenergy development, we illustrated their application using results and data from previous related studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Cardiac biochemical markers and electrocardiographic changes have been reported in CO intoxications. Human fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) has been recently used as a reliable marker in identifying early cardiac damage. In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate the advantages of the use of H-FABP, in evaluating the findings of myocardial ischemia in patients with CO intoxication in our region. Methods: Twenty four successive patients admitted to the emergency department with acute CO intoxication were included in our study. Serum traditional markers and H-FABP were also taken in the earliest period for evaluation of cardiac damage. Results: The creatinine kinase MB (CKMB) levels were positive in 11 of the patients; however, H-FABP and troponin T levels were positive in only 3 of them. One of these subjects had elevated level of H-FABP in the short-term and increasing troponin T level increasing level of troponin T during the follow-up period. Conclusion: The obtained data supports the use of H-FABP, a specific indicator in identifying the cardiotoxicity of CO intoxications at an early phase. © The Author(s) 2010.","CO intoxication; H-FABP","biological marker; carbon monoxide; creatine kinase; creatinine kinase mb; fatty acid binding protein; human fatty acid binding protein; troponin T; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; aged; article; carbon monoxide intoxication; cardiotoxicity; child; clinical article; controlled study; emergency ward; evaluation; female; follow up; heart injury; heart muscle ischemia; hospital admission; human; male; priority journal; prospective study; school child; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biological Markers; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Child; Creatine Kinase, MB Form; Emergency Service, Hospital; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Troponin T; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957458712

It is found that the amplitude of the northeastward-propagating mode is weaker when the air-sea interaction is suppressed in the Indian Ocean. The intraseasonal mode is not resolved clearly when the Indian Ocean SST is reduced to daily climatology. Intraseasonal composites of low-level zonal wind, latent heat flux, downward shortwave radiation, and SST provide a picture consistent with the proposed mechanisms of air- sea interaction for the northward propagation. The Pacific SST variability does not seem to be critical for the existence of this mode. The northwestward-propagating mode is obtained in the cases where the Indian Ocean was prescribed by daily mean or daily climatological SST. Intraseasonal SST composites corresponding to this mode are weak. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Indian Ocean; Intraseasonal variability; Monsoons; Pacific Ocean; Sea surface temperature; Summer/warm season","Indian ocean; Intraseasonal variability; Monsoons; Pacific Ocean; Sea surface temperatures; Summer/warm season; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Climatology; Heat flux; Spectrum analysis; Surface properties; Oceanography; air-sea interaction; climatology; general circulation model; latent heat flux; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; summer; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959352494

In this paper, a case study of a standard driving cycle in the urban area of Dublin City is presented. On-road, speed-time data was extracted by an on-board diagnostic tool, and saved into a data acquisition package. Firstly, the driving cycle was established for the urban area of the city; one car travelling different routes has been employed to implement this research and some representative results have been achieved. The second part of the project was to estimate the emissions from the same car using the driving cycle obtained and compare the results with those obtained by a gas analyzer attached to the car simultaneously in order to validate the methodology used in this paper. A representative driving cycle reflecting the real-world driving conditions is proposed and estimated vehicle emissions were compared with measured results. The method is easy to follow and the results are in a good fit to the estimated values. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Driving cycle; Gas analyzer; On-board diagnostic system; Vehicle emissions","Air quality; Research; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Car emissions; Driving conditions; Driving cycle; Gas analyzer; Gas analyzers; Measured results; On-board diagnostic systems; On-board diagnostics; Real-world; Road transports; Transportation sector; Urban areas; Vehicle emission; Vehicle emissions; Gas emissions; atmospheric pollution; data set; estimation method; research work; road transport; traffic emission; transportation; urban area; County Dublin; Dublin [County Dublin]; Ireland; Leinster",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551537885

CH 4 has a global warming potential 21 times greater than CO 2; thus, it poses a serious environmental problem. As landfills are the main method for waste disposal in Malaysia, the major aim of this study was to estimate the total CH 4 emissions from landfills in all Malaysian regions and states for the year 2009 using the IPCC, 1996 first-order decay (FOD) model focusing on clean development mechanism (CDM) project applications to initiate emission reductions. Furthermore, the authors attempted to assess, in quantitative terms, the amount of CH 4 that would be emitted from landfills in the period from 1981-2024 using the IPCC 2006 FOD model. The total CH 4 emission using the IPCC 1996 model was estimated to be 318.8 Gg in 2009. The Northern region had the highest CH 4 emission inventory, with 128.8 Gg, whereas the Borneo region had the lowest, with 24.2 Gg. It was estimated that Pulau Penang state produced the highest CH 4 emission, 77.6 Gg, followed by the remaining states with emission values ranging from 38.5 to 1.5 Gg. Based on the IPCC 1996 FOD model, the total Malaysian CH 4 emission was forecast to be 397.7 Gg by 2020. The IPCC 2006 FOD model estimated a 201 Gg CH 4 emission in 2009, and estimates ranged from 98 Gg in 1981 to 263 Gg in 2024. © 2011 The Author(s).","clean development mechanism (CDM); emission inventory; landfills; Malaysian landfills; Methane emission","Anaerobic conditions; Clean Development Mechanism; Emission inventories; emission inventory; Emission reduction; Emission values; Environmental problems; First-order; Global warming potential; Landfill gas; Malaysia; Malaysians; Methane emission; Methane emissions; Northern regions; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Global warming; Land fill; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Waste disposal; methane; anoxic conditions; carbon dioxide; clean development mechanism; decomposition; emission inventory; forecasting method; global warming; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; numerical model; quantitative analysis; volume; waste disposal; air pollution; air pollution control; article; bioremediation; landfill; Malaysia; priority journal; waste disposal; Air Pollutants; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Malaysia; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052377411

By contrast, radionuclide-based methods, including planar imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), are the most widely used methods for evaluating brain function. SPECT and PET have been evolving for a longer time than CT and MRI and have made significant contributions to understanding brain function. The pioneering work on cerebral flow early in the last century laid the foundation of measurement with radioactive gases. This was initially performed with scintillation counters, which gave way to single, then multiple scintillation and multiprobe detectors. The invention of rectilinear scanners, MARK series, Anger cameras, and SPECT imaging further advanced nuclear medicine's role in brain imaging. Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow by SPECT provides pathophysiologic information that directs patient management in a variety of central nervous disorders (CNS), with the greatest clinical impact found in cerebrovascular disease and seizure disorder. In the former, SPECT not only provides means of early detection and localization of acute strokes but can also direct thrombolysis and determine prognosis in the postcerebrovascular accident period. With respect to the latter, ictal SPECT can localize seizure foci so that patients with refractory disease can potentially undergo surgical resection of the affected area. In contrast to brain SPECT, brain PET images reflect regional cerebral metabolism. Because of neurovascular coupling, findings on SPECT and PET images are often comparable. PET, however, still has improved spatial resolution and is therefore more sensitive than SPECT, particularly in the evaluation of dementias. Brain PET instrumentation has greatly evolved from its infancy, when it was used in regional localization, to currently providing excellent resolution with imaging characteristics that can greatly impact clinical management. In addition, although ictal SPECT remains more sensitive than interictal PET for detection of seizure foci, the stringent conditions required for SPECT can be difficult to achieve, making interictal PET a very reasonable alternative. The clinical utility of PET and SPECT in neuropsychiatric and addictive disorders has not yet been defined, though a plethora of data exits. This arena of CNS disease has been the impetus for development of neurotransmitter-receptor-specific radioligands, which have already led to better understanding of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic pathways. Another functional brain imaging technique that has gained broad acceptance since its invention in the early 1990s, is functional MRI, which indirectly measures CNS neuronal activity by evaluating oxygenation levels of cerebral vessels. Despite other recent related developments, such as MR spectroscopy, arterial spin labeling, and diffusion tensor imaging, nuclear medicine-based techniques remain clinically relevant and robust modalities, especially with the ever-expanding armamentarium of radiotracers and radioligands in conjunction with industry-driven improvements in image-analysis hardware and software. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,"indium 111; iodine 123; iodine 131; neurotransmitter receptor; radioligand; technetium 99m; tracer; xenon 133; addiction; article; blood clot lysis; brain blood flow; brain blood vessel; brain function; brain oxygen consumption; central nervous system disease; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; computer assisted tomography; diffusion tensor imaging; dopaminergic system; echo planar imaging; functional magnetic resonance imaging; GABAergic system; human; image analysis; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; nuclear medicine; positron emission tomography; prognosis; scintillation; scintillation camera; seizure; serotoninergic system; single photon emission computer tomography; stroke",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953178994

The magnitude and ecological relevance of metal pollution in Lake Maryout Main Basin was investigated by applying different sediment quality assessment approaches. The aim of this study was to estimate ecological risk of trace elements (Cd, Ni, Pb, Cr, Cu and Zn) in the surficial sediments (63 m fraction) of Lake Maryout. Heavily contaminated sediments were evaluated by the Sediment Quality Guideline (SQG) of the US Environmental Protection Agency. The degree of contamination (Cd) was estimated as very high for each site. Two sets of SQGs effect range-low/effect range-median values and threshold effect concentration (TEC) and probable effect concentration (PEC) values were used in this study. Sediments from each site were judged toxic when more of the PEC values exceeded EPA guidelines. Based on the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) of target trace elements, the Main Basin of Lake Maryout has to be considered as extremely polluted with Cd (I geo≤5), strongly polluted with Zn (2≤Igeo≤3), moderately polluted with Cu (1≤Igeo≤2), unpolluted to moderately polluted with Cr and Pb (0≤Igeo≤1 for each) and unpolluted with Ni (Igeo≤0). Lake Maryout sediments had heavy accumulations of Cd, which apparently come from drains that include industrial and raw domestic wastes. Therefore, a sequential extraction technique was applied to assess the five fractions (exchangeable, metals bound to carbonate, acid-reducible, oxidizable-organic and residual) of Cd in surface sediments. The Cd concentration in most sampling stations was dominated by the non-resistant fraction (anthropogenic). The result showed that those stations located in the vicinity of municipal and mixed waste drains posed a high potential risk to fauna and flora of Maryout Lake. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Cd fractions; degree of contamination; Igeo; Lake Maryout; PEC; sediment quality guidelines; TEC; trace elements","Air pollution control; Anoxic sediments; Cadmium; Chromium; Ecology; Environmental Protection Agency; Heavy water; Lake pollution; Lakes; Land reclamation; Lead; Rating; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sedimentology; Trace elements; Wastewater reclamation; Zinc; Cd fractions; degree of contamination; Igeo; PEC; sediment quality guidelines; TEC; Surficial sediments; cadmium; chromium; copper; heavy metal; lead; nickel; zinc; coastal lagoon; guideline; heavy metal; overfishing; pollution effect; qualitative analysis; reclaimed land; risk assessment; sediment pollution; toxicity test; trace element; article; domestic waste; Egypt; extraction; industrial waste; lagoon; lake ecosystem; lake sediment; risk assessment; sediment transport; water contamination; water sampling; Egypt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959454627
