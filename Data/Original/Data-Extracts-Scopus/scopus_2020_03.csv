In some cases, changes in landscape patterns affect LST, even more than the contribution of greenhouse gases. Although much work has been done with respect to the correlations between urban development and thermal environment dynamics, the related questions regarding relationships between LST and landscape patterns in arid regions are not thoroughly considered. Understanding these questions is important in climate change and land planning. The objective of this study was to explore the spatiotemporal variations of LST by distribution index (DI) and Mann-Kendall mutation analysis method and to quantify the relationships between landscape patterns, climatic factors, topographic factors, and the land surface thermal environment (LSTE) by the ordinary linear regressions (OLS) model. The landscape patterns dataset, which was validated by a field trip, was extracted from the Land satellite (Landsat) TM/OLI images by the Random Forest methodology in ArcGIS software. The MODIS/LST product was validated by the “Monthly dataset of China's surface climate” and a field trip. Annual LST increased by 0.54 °C (23.15 °C in 2000 and 23.79 °C in 2015). In different landscape patterns, the percentage of areas with a high level of LST showed a significant difference. In barren land, the highest area proportion for the high LST level was larger than in other landscape patterns. Meanwhile, the area of low LST was mainly concentrated in water bodies. Considerable changes have occurred in landscape patterns, in which the most noteworthy was cultivated land encroaching on grass land (3708.44 km2). The composition of landscape patterns was more important than distribution in determining the region's LST. These findings provide valuable information for land planners dealing with climate change and ecosystem conservation in arid regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arid regions; High temperature center; Land surface thermal environments; Landscape composition; Landscape distribution; Landscape patterns","Arid regions; Climate change; Decision trees; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Surface measurement; Urban growth; High temperature; Landscape composition; Landscape distribution; Landscape pattern; Thermal environment; Land surface temperature; ArcGIS; climate change; greenhouse gas; high temperature; land surface; land use planning; MODIS; numerical model; satellite data; satellite imagery; semiarid region; Article; China; climate; controlled study; cultivated land; desert; environmental temperature; grassland; land surface temperature; land surface thermal environment; landscape; priority journal; random forest; river basin; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature measurement; topography; Aksu Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077430870

Unique interactions between single metal sites and their surrounding coordination environments play a significant role in modulating the electronic structure of the metal centers, leading to unusual scaling relationships, new reaction mechanisms, and improved catalytic performance. This review summarizes recent advancements in engineering of the local coordination environment of SACs for improved electrocatalytic performance for several crucial energy-convention electrochemical reactions: oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Various engineering strategies including heteroatom-doping, changing the location of SACs on their support, introducing external ligands, and constructing dual metal sites are comprehensively discussed. The controllable synthetic methods and the activity enhancement mechanism of state-of-the-art SACs are also highlighted. Recent achievements in the electronic modification of SACs will provide an understanding of the structure–activity relationship for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the chemical looping strategy can be and has been extended well beyond carbon capture. In fact, significant impacts on emission reduction, energy conservation, and value-creation can be anticipated from chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC). This article aims to demonstrate the versatility and transformational benefits of CLBC. Specifically, we focus on the use of oxygen carriers or redox catalysts for chemical production-a $4 trillion industry that consumes 40.9 quadrillion BTU of energy. Compared to state-of-the-art chemical production technologies, we illustrate that chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization. In many cases, an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emission can be realized without the needs for carbon dioxide capture. In addition to providing various CLBC examples, this article elaborates on generalized design principles for CLBC, potential benefits and pitfalls, as well as redox catalyst selection, design, optimization, and redox reaction mechanism. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Emission control; Energy utilization; Redox reactions; Carbon dioxide capture; Chemical looping combustion; Chemical production; Emission reduction; Magnitude reduction; Potential benefits; Process intensification; Reaction mechanism; Combustion; catalyst; chemical method; combustion; emission control",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082718297

Its origins and transformation in the atmosphere remain poorly understood. The concentrations of free amino acids (FAAs) and combined amino acids (CAAs) and δ15N values of free and combined Glycine (Gly) in PM2.5 and main emission sources (plant, soil, and aerosol from biomass burning) were investigated from five sampling sites in Nanchang area (Jiangxi Province, China). Our results showed that the composition profiles of CAAs and FAAs were quite different from each other in PM2.5. For CAAs, percentages of individual combined amino acids were different between biomass burning sources and plant or soil sources, and we found that the composition profiles of aerosol CAAs could reflect the contribution of the main emission sources. For FAAs, a predominance of free Gly was observed in aerosol FAAs pool because atmospheric photooxidative processes could increase free Gly and decrease other reactive FAAs. This implied that the composition of aerosol FAAs could not reflect their origins. A strong correlation between δ15NF-Gly values in aerosols or sources and the δ15NC-Gly values in their parent CAAs was observed, indicating that the isotope effect associated with Gly transformation in aerosols may be small. Additionally, we found more positive δ15NGly in aerosols emitted by biomass burning, which was likely due to 15N-depleted amino-N loss from Gly molecule. The results suggested that δ15NGly values in aerosols might be used to identify biomass burning sources. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

China is the world’s largest carbon emitter and its transportation industry is one of the fastest growing sectors for carbon emissions. However, China is a vast country with different levels of carbon emissions in the transportation industry. Therefore, it is helpful for the Chinese government to formulate a reasonable policy of regional carbon emissions control by studying the factors influencing the carbon emissions of the Chinese transportation industry at the regional level. Based on data from 1997 to 2017, this paper adopts the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) decomposition method to analyze the influencing degree of several major factors on the carbon emissions of transportation industry in different regions, puts forward some suggestions according to local conditions, and provides references for the carbon reduction of Chinese transportation industry. The results show that (1) in 2017, the total carbon emissions of the Chinese transportation industry were 714.58 million tons, being 5.59 times of those in 1997, with an average annual growth rate of 9.89%. Among them, the carbon emissions on the Eastern Coast were rising linearly and higher than those in other regions. The carbon emissions in the Great Northwest were always lower than those in other regions, with only 38.75 million tons in 2017. (2) Economic output effect is the most important factor to promote the carbon emissions of transportation industry in various regions. Among them, the contribution values of economic output effect to carbon emissions on the Eastern Coast, the Southern Coast and the Great Northwest continued to rise, while the contribution values of economic output effect to carbon emissions in the other five regions decreased in the fourth stage. (3) The population size effect promoted the carbon emissions of the transportation industry in various regions, but the population size effect of the Northeast had a significant inhibitory influence on the carbon emissions in the fourth stage. (4) The regional energy intensity effect in most stages inhibited carbon emissions of the transportation industry. Among them, the energy intensity effects of the North Coast and the Southern Coast in the two stages had obvious inhibitory influences on carbon emissions of the transportation industry, but the contribution values of the energy intensity effect in the Great Northwest and the Northeast were positive in the fourth stage. (5) Except for the Great Southwest, the industry-scale effects of other regions had inhibited the carbon emissions of transportation industry in all regions. (6) The influences of the carbon emissions coefficient effect on carbon emissions in different regions were not significant and their inhibitory effects were relatively small. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Influencing factor; LMDI; Regional; Transportation industry","Carbon; Coastal engineering; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Growth rate; Population statistics; Carbon emissions; Influencing factor; LMDI; Regional; Transportation industry; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081122645

The emission trading scheme (ETS) has become one of China’s most important instruments to address climate change through a market mechanism. In the wake of the evolution from regional pilots to a nationwide scheme, it is inevitable to be confronted with tremendous political–economic–institutional challenges. To facilitate a smooth start-up of the upcoming nationwide ETS, this study provides a systematic overview of seven ETS pilots, involving the detailed comparison of ETS design and the in-depth evaluation of market performance, both internal and external performance, based on trading data. Then, the achievements and deficiencies of seven ETS pilots are summarized, several challenges for the current time are discussed, and policy proposals for China’s national-level ETS are navigated further coupled with international experience. This study finds that China’s ETS pilots, from the short-term perspective, are successful, especially in the reinforcement of China’s capacity to develop a market-based scheme in an economy that still cherishes many non-market endowments. However, deficiencies lie in both the internal and external market performance, such as the carbon price lacking a signal function, insufficient incentives for compliance, too low market liquidity, and much too high market fragmentation. Moreover, the retrospective examination of China’s ETS pilots suggests that a nationwide ETS should at least be based on an extension of the cap duration from single year to several years, uniform rules on monitoring/reporting/verification and allowance allocation, and the improvement of institutional foundation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Cap-and-trade; China; Emission trading scheme pilots; Market performance; Mechanism design","climate change; comparative study; compliance; emissions trading; environmental economics; policy approach; pollution tax; China; carbon; China; climate change; comparative study; cost; economics; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; pilot study; retrospective study; Carbon; China; Climate Change; Costs and Cost Analysis; Environmental Policy; Greenhouse Gases; Pilot Projects; Retrospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061671132

However, whether the uncertainty of precipitation time series is highly related to the intensity of these interactions has not been deeply considered before. Thus, sample entropy (SE), the measure of uncertainty based on self-similarity of the time series instead of a probability distribution, is employed to uncover the relationship between them. The spatial distribution of SE is based on the results calculated from 675 daily precipitation time series (1961–2011) in China. Then, the transfer of SE is extracted following the route of water vapour, water vapour source (WVS), obtained from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set. Finally, the relationship between substantial changes of SE along the WVS route and the underlying conditions are discussed, including the digital elevation model (DEM), plant cover and climatic factors. The results reveal that the SE spatial distribution is closely related to the WV source and its interaction with local climatic regions and underlying conditions, which are manifested by the following aspects: (a) SE exhibits lower values in WVS source regions and increases following the WV transfer route because of diverse continental water vapour composition sources, which makes the system more complicated and increases the system entropy. (b) The pronounced SE increases and decreases indicate WV convergence and substantial topographic uplift, respectively. (c) The spatial distribution of SE is comprehensively dominated by climatic conditions since the boundaries of climatic regions correspond well with the specific SE contours. Therefore, SE spatial distribution indicates where WV originates and how WV interacts with local land surfaces along the WV transfer routes, which offers a new information mechanism perspective to understand the hydrological cycle from precipitation time series. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","China; daily precipitation time series; land surface hydrological interactions; sample entropy; spatial patterns","Entropy; Probability distributions; Surface measurement; Surveying; Time series; Water vapor; China; Daily precipitations; Land surface; Sample entropy; Spatial patterns; Spatial distribution; hydrology; land surface; precipitation assessment; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis; water vapor; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073792404

Recently, a black to gray carbonaceous mudstone unit containing abundant plant fossils was discovered just below the lowest part of Thitspin Limestone Formation from the Linwe Area, eastern Myanmar. Although only five taxa were identified, the plant assemblage provides the first evidence of the occurrence of Cathaysian elements in eastern Myanmar and potentially indicates the presence of a highly diverse Permian flora. Among the five species, Cordaites principalis and Annularia mucronata were cosmopolitan species; while Callipteridum cf. koraiense, Taeniopteris crassinervis Mo and Rhipidopsis lobata were mostly recorded in the Cathaysia Flora. Therefore, the present assemblage generally indicates a palaeobiogeographical affinity to the Cathaysian Province. Stratigraphically, Callipteridum cf. koraiense was mainly reported from Cisuralian to Wordian; whereas Taeniopteris crasssnervis Mo and Rhipidopsis lobata were recorded from Capitanian to Changhsingian, which suggests a general Permian age based on the plant assemblage itself only. However, the carbonaceous mudstone at the outcrop is overlain by the Thitspin Limestone Formation containing middle Guadalupian fusulinids. Based on previous faunal analyses, the Sibumasu terrane contains typical Gondwanan cold-water faunas during the early Cisuralian, warm-water faunas occurred after Sakmarian. Thus, age of the fossil-plant-containing carbonaceous mudstone is very likely between late Cisuralian and early Guadalupian as constrained by its overlying fusulinids and its warm Cathaysian palaeobiogeographical affinity. © 2019","Eastern Myanmar; Palaeophytogeography; Permian; Plant assemblage; Thitspin Limestone Formation","fossil assemblage; fossil record; geographical distribution; Guadalupian; morphology; mudstone; new record; outcrop; paleogeography; Permian; phytogeography; terrane; Myanmar; Plateau [Nigeria]; Shan; Annularia mucronata; Cordaites principalis; Fusulinida; Lobata; Taeniopteris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068004829

Treatments were (1) control, 0 mg/L of OEO (CON); 13 mg/L (OEO1); 52 mg/L (OEO2); 91 mg/L (OEO3); and 130 mg/L (OEO4), each incubated with 150 mL of buffered rumen fluid and 1,200 mg of substrate for 24 h using the Ankom in vitro gas production system (Ankom Technology Corp., Fairport, NY). Treatment responses were statistically analyzed using polynomial contrasts. Digestibility of DM, NDF, and ADF increased quadratically with increasing OEO inclusion rates. Digestibility of DM and NDF were highest for OEO2, whereas ADF digestibility was highest for OEO3, compared with CON, with the remaining treatments being intermediate and similar. Ammonia nitrogen concentrations decreased from CON at a quadratic rate with increasing OEO inclusion rates, and OEO2 had the lowest concentration compared with the other groups. Total VFA, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and isovalerate concentrations linearly decreased with increasing OEO inclusion rates. Total gas production levels by CON and OEO4 were greater than those of OEO1, OEO2, and OEO3 in a quadratic response, and methane production linearly decreased from CON, compared with OEO4, at a decreasing rate with OEO inclusion rates. As determined by 16S rRNA sequencing, the α biodiversity of ruminal bacteria was similar among OEO inclusion rates. Increasing OEO inclusion rates linearly increased the relative abundance of Prevotella and Dialister bacteria. Several bacteria demonstrated different polynomial responses, whereas several bacteria were similar among increasing OEO inclusion rates. These results suggested that OEO supplementation can modify ruminal fermentation to alter VFA concentrations and reduce methane emissions by extensively altering the ruminal bacterial community, suggesting an optimal feeding rate for future animal studies of approximately 52 mg/L for mature ruminants. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","16S rRNA; bacterial composition; methane production; oregano essential oil; rumen fermentation","ammonia; essential oil; methane; nitrogen; RNA 16S; vegetable oil; animal; animal food; bacterium; bovine; chemistry; classification; diet; digestion; drug effect; female; fermentation; genetics; intestine flora; male; metabolism; Origanum; physiology; rumen; sheep; veterinary medicine; Ammonia; Animal Feed; Animals; Bacteria; Cattle; Diet; Digestion; Female; Fermentation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Male; Methane; Nitrogen; Oils, Volatile; Origanum; Plant Oils; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rumen; Sheep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077986219

However, the structure and functions of microbiome have not been clarified during the tobacco aging process. In this study, 16S rDNA and ITS amplicon sequencing techniques were used to analyze the core microbiome of 15 tobacco samples from five different aging stages. The whole bacterial microbiome was classified into 29 microbial phyla and 132 orders. Enterobacteriales (63%), Pseudomonadales (16%), Sphingomonadales (8%), Xanthomonadales (4%), Burkholderiales (4%), Rhizobiales (3%), and Bacillales (2%) comprised the core bacterial microbiome. The whole fungal microbiome was classified into five microbial phyla and 52 orders. Incertae_sedis_Eurotiomycetes (27%), Wallemiales (25%), Sporidiobolales (17%), Capnodiales (5%), Eurotiales (2%), an unclassified Ascomycota (12%), and an unidentified Eurotiomycetes (4%) comprised the core fungal microbiome. FAPROTAX function prediction suggested that the core microbiome has a substantial potential for the carbon cycle, nitrate metabolism, aromatic compound degradation, chitinolysis, cellulolysis, and xylanolysis, but simultaneously, the core microbiome is also a source of human pathogens. The dynamics of the bacterial community were primarily determined by the total nitrogen in tobacco leaves during the aging process, while those of the fungal microbiome were primarily determined by total organic carbon. This study indicated that the core microbiome activities may play an important role in regulating the loss of carbon organic compounds and enhancing the secondary metabolites during tobacco leaves aging process. © 2020 The Authors.

Effective measures to mitigate CH4 emissions while guaranteeing grain yields are urgently needed. A 2-year mesocosm experiment was conducted. Six management systems, i.e., no residue (traditional management, CF), 100% rice straw (a popular practice among farmers, FR), 50% rice straw (F1/2R), leguminous green manure (FM), mixture of leguminous green manure and 100% rice straw (FMR), and a mixture of leguminous green manure and 50% rice straw (FM1/2R), were used. Compared with the CF, the organic residue returns could effectively improve rice productivity but increase the CH4 emissions. Notably, when compared with the FR, both F1/2R and FM could reduce the CH4 emissions, with equal crop yields, and FM1/2R not only increased the rice yields but also reduced the CH4 emissions, whereas FMR increased the rice yields and the CH4 emissions. Applications of organic residues significantly increased the soil methane production potentials (MPPs), methane oxidation potentials (MOPs), the abundances of methanogens and methanotrophs, and changed methanogenic and methanotrophic community structures in comparison with the CF. The partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) results showed that the MPPs had a strong direct effect on CH4 emissions, whereas an abundance of methanogens could serve as a proxy for predicting CH4 emissions. Moreover, relatively high MOPs associated with high Type I/Type II methanotroph ratios and relatively low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were found to be central in lowering CH4 emission fractions under the F1/2R and FM1/2R treatments. Above all, the combined utilization of leguminous green manure and rice straw exhibited potential prospects for the enhancement of rice yields and for the mitigation of CH4 emissions, and the practice of mixing leguminous green manure with 50% rice straw performed the best of the treatments tested. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Co-incorporation of rice straw and green manure; Greenhouse gas; Microbial mechanism; Paddy soil","Agriculture; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Least squares approximations; Methane; Methanogens; Mixtures; Organic carbon; Petroleum prospecting; Soils; Community structures; Dissolved organic carbon; Effective measures; Methane production; Paddy soils; Partial least square (PLS); Rice straws; Traditional management; Manures; agricultural emission; agricultural soil; community structure; concentration (composition); crop yield; dissolved organic carbon; greenhouse gas; management practice; manure; mesocosm; methane; microbial activity; microbial community; mitigation; soil fertility; straw; Mops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075998758

The objective is to evaluate the potential of biomass co-combustion with methane for NOX abatement. NOX model involving three major gaseous N-species: NO, NH3 and HCN is incorporated into the dynamic fuel bed model, in which the dependency of species release on the local oxygen is accounted for. Coupling with freeboard simulation, the NOX emission from a real scale grate boiler is predicted with good accuracy and details. Waste wood and methane co-combustion with fuel-staging is investigated. The methane co-combustion ratio is on an energy basis, and three values are chosen, 10%, 20%, and 30%. In the fuel-staging setup, it is found that a higher co-combustion fraction produces a better NOX reduction effect. This reduction is a result of less nitrogen input and NO reburning from hydrocarbon and other N-species. Moreover, while cutting down the total excess air, the reduction effect is enhanced from lower stoichiometry but accompanied by a diminished dilution for the NOX emission at stack. The results show that the reduction efficiency can achieve up to 45.3%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass combustion; Emission control; Fuel staging; Grate boiler; NOx reduction; Reburning","Ammonia; Biomass; Boilers; Emission control; Fuels; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Biomass combustion; Fuel staging; Grate boiler; Nox reduction; Reburning; Waste incineration; biomass; combustion; emission control; equipment; hydrocarbon; methane; nitric oxide; numerical method; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077385561

The alpine ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are highly sensitive to climate changes. However, systematic analyses on the seasonal and annual responses of NPP to climatic factors in different grassland types on the TP are still lacking. In this study, the spatial and temporal patterns of NPP and their responses to temperature, precipitation and solar radiation during 2001–2015 at seasonal and annual temporal scales were investigated based on outputs of an improved Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach (CASA) model. The improved CASA model showed solid performances in simulating NPP in reference to field observations (R2 = 0.79, P &lt; 0.001), resulting in mean error (ME) of −16.68, root mean square error (RMSE) of 87.59 g C·m−2·yr−1, and mean relative error (MRE) of −4.29%, respectively. The annual NPP displayed different altitude dependences between the regions below and above 3500 m, which could be attributed to the altitude associated precipitation variations. The temporal trends of the seasonal and annual NPP exhibited high spatial heterogeneity. For the entire alpine grasslands, solar radiation exerted stronger influences on annual NPP than temperature and precipitation did. The responses of NPP to climatic factors also varied among grassland types and seasons. For alpine meadow, solar radiation and temperature were the dominant climatic factors in controlling the NPP variability in spring and summer, respectively, while the effect of precipitation was weak in all seasons. On the contrary, precipitation played a more crucial role in influencing NPP than temperature and solar radiation in both summer and autumn for alpine steppe. Our results shed further lights on the mechanism underlying the responses of alpine ecosystem to climate changes. The improved understanding can provide guidelines for alpine grassland management. © 2019 The Authors","Alpine grasslands; Altitude dependence; Climatic effects; Net primary productivity; Seasonal variations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073677274

These temperature effects may be beneficial but are almost certainly overwhelmed by aerosols’ negative health impacts3. Recent analyses of economic impacts have concluded that warming harms economies in warm climates, but provides economic benefits in cold climates4. Here we investigate whether aerosol-induced cooling would have a positive effect on less wealthy economies in hotter regions and a negative effect on wealthier economies in colder regions. Climate simulations over the historical period both with and without anthropogenic aerosol emissions, using a fully coupled ocean and atmosphere climate model, indicate that in year 2010 anthropogenic aerosol emissions were cooling the Earth by 0.72 ± 0.02 °C relative to a scenario without such emissions. Due to opposing economic impacts in different regions, the net economic impact of aerosol-induced cooling is likely to be small at the global scale. However, these results suggest that the cooling effects of anthropogenic aerosols benefit developing tropical economies while harming developed high-latitude economies, and thus the temperature effects of past aerosol emissions have probably diminished global economic inequality. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079727437

By constructing a panel threshold model between China's air pollution and the industrial structure, this study analyzes and explores how industrial transformation influences air pollution as well as its provincial heterogeneity characteristics evolution. The results show that industrial structure has a three-stage influential mechanism on NOx pollution and PM2.5 pollution, and a two-stage influential mechanism on SO2 pollution. A decrease in proportion of the secondary industry output in GDP can significantly reduce NOx pollution and SO2 pollution. Industrial structure can change the effects of economic development on air pollution. China’ s industrial structure has been continuously upgraded in the past decade. In the process of industrial structure transformation, energy consumption has always been a major factor in aggravating air pollution, whereas technological innovation has been an important way to reduce air pollution. Urbanization is another major factor exacerbating air pollution in the provinces where the service industry has always dominated the local economy. Based on the above research, the government should formulate corresponding industrial structure adjustment policies to reduce air pollution according to the provincial heterogeneity of industrial structure affecting different pollutants. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Industrial structure; Provincial heterogeneity; Threshold effect",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076838881

China has emerged as the global largest EV market with 1.2 million EVs sold in 2018. This study established a novel life cycle energy use and emission inventory collecting up-to-date data including the electricity generation mix, emission controls in the power and industrial sectors, and the energy use in the fuel transport to estimate the well-to-wheels (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG), and air pollutant emissions for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and gasoline passenger vehicles in China. The results show that an average BEV has 35% lower WTW GHG emissions than an average gasoline car. BEVs reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions by 98% and 34%, respectively, but have comparable or slightly higher primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Compact and small-size vehicles generally have lower GHG and air pollutant emissions than mid- and large-size vehicles. Class A vehicles contribute the most in the absolute amount of GHG and air pollutant emissions and therefore have the biggest potential for emission reduction. Our results suggest that global policymakers should continue to promote the transition to clean power sources, emission control, and fuel economy regulations, which are critical to enhancing emission mitigation benefits of BEVs. We also suggest EV development strategies should be formulated targeting vehicle class with the biggest emission mitigation potentials. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollutant emissions; Battery electric vehicles; Greenhouse gas; Well-to-wheels analysis","air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; electric vehicle; electricity generation; emission control; emission inventory; energy use; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; mitigation; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075390110

In order to investigate the aerosol-cloud interactions, a total of 16 low-level stratus cloud cases under daytime coupled boundary-layer conditions are selected over the southern Great Plains (SGP) region of the United States. The physicochemical properties of aerosols and their impacts on cloud microphysical properties are examined using data collected from the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facility at the SGP site. The aerosol-cloud interaction index (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ACIr</span>) is used to quantify the aerosol impacts with respect to cloud-droplet effective radius. The mean value of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ACIr</span> calculated from all selected samples is <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">0.145±0.05</span> and ranges from 0.09 to 0.24 at a range of cloud liquid water paths (LWPs; <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">LWPCombining double low line20</span>-300&thinsp;g&thinsp;m<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-2</span>). The magnitude of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ACIr</span> decreases with an increasing LWP, which suggests a diminished cloud microphysical response to aerosol loading, presumably due to enhanced condensational growth processes and enlarged particle sizes. The impact of aerosols with different light-absorbing abilities on the sensitivity of cloud microphysical responses is also investigated. In the presence of weak light-absorbing aerosols, the low-level clouds feature a higher number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>N</i>CCN</span>) and smaller effective radii (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>r</i>e</span>), while the opposite is true for strong light-absorbing aerosols. Furthermore, the mean activation ratio of aerosols to CCN (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>N</i>CCNĝ&circ;•<i>N</i>a</span>) for weakly (strongly) absorbing aerosols is 0.54 (0.45), owing to the aerosol microphysical effects, particularly the different aerosol compositions inferred by their absorptive properties. In terms of the sensitivity of cloud-droplet number concentration (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>N</i>d</span>) to <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>N</i>CCN</span>, the fraction of CCN that converted to cloud droplets (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>N</i>dĝ&circ;•<i>N</i>CCN</span>) for the weakly (strongly) absorptive regime is 0.69 (0.54). The measured <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ACIr</span> values in the weakly absorptive regime are relatively higher, indicating that clouds have greater microphysical responses to aerosols, owing to the favorable thermodynamic condition. The reduced <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ACIr</span> values in the strongly absorptive regime are due to the cloud-layer heating effect induced by strong light-absorbing aerosols. Consequently, we expect larger shortwave radiative cooling effects from clouds in the weakly absorptive regime than those in the strongly absorptive regime.. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

In despite of the substantial production, rice productivity is gravely affected by ongoing climate change and reduction of available water resources. Thus, assessing the responses of rice water consumption and productivity to more pronounced climate change is of great significance to water resources management in terms of relieving the resources shortage and meeting the food demand. In this study, the yield and water resources utilization during 1961–2010 in two typical rice plantation regions of China were evaluated using validated rice model ORYZA2000. Subsequently, their responses to future climate scenarios of 21 century were investigated through driving ORYZA2000 with downscaling climatic projections from GCMs under four RCPs emission scenarios. To quantify the water resources utilization in rice production from multiple perspectives, the water footprint (WF) and three water productivity indices (WPI, WPU and WPET) were integrated for assessing the regional agricultural water stress in this paper. The results revealed that the annual average linear inclining rates of WF in two stations (Kaifeng and Kunshan) were 3.86 m3/ t and 2.62 m3/ t, respectively. Moreover, compared with the green water footprint (WFg), the blue water footprint (WFb) is projected to significantly increase in future. The water productivity (WP) would decrease in two stations under four RCPs scenarios except that the WPu and WPET of Kunshan under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenario in 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Hence, this study provides insights into comprehensively understand the influences of climate change on food security and sheds lights on the regional strategy for future water resource management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; GCMs; ORYZA2000 model; Rice production; Water footprint; Water resources management","Climate models; Food supply; Plutonium alloys; Productivity; Water management; GCMs; ORYZA2000; Rice production; Water footprint; Water resources management; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; food security; historical perspective; productivity; rice; water footprint; water management; Article; China; climate change; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; food industry; green chemistry; nonhuman; plantation; priority journal; rice; simulation; validation process; water and water related phenomena; water stress; water supply; agriculture; Oryza; China; Henan; Jiangsu; Kaifeng; Kunshan; water; Agriculture; China; Climate Change; Oryza; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076956152

However, physical modeling of NOx emission in the rotary kiln is too complicated because of the difficulties with determining model parameters. To address this challenge, the present study proposes the use of data-driven modeling and model-based real-time cement calcination process optimization (RTO) for reducing NOx emission. The Gaussian mixture regression model based on an improved just-in-time learning is introduced for modeling NOx in the kiln tail. Data preprocessing based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition is used, and an improved similarity strategy taking into account time-space information is utilized for local learning relevant sample selection to address problems associated with nonlinear and time-varying characteristics. The RTO problem is solved by a particle swarm optimization algorithm, and optimized set values of decision variables are obtained. Finally, the proposed modeling and optimization approach are applied to practical cement calcination process data. The result shows that the proposed modeling strategy has better performance than the traditional strategy, and the optimization approach performs better than previous conditions in calcination NOx emission reduction. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Calcination; Cements; Emission control; Just in time production; Nitrogen oxides; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Regression analysis; Data preprocessing; Decision variables; Just-in-time learning; Modeling and optimization; Multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD); Optimization approach; Pollutant emission; Time-varying characteristics; Indium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082533202

The results showed that, Methanothrix species were the dominant and metabolically active methanogens in the methanogenic sludge fed with the ethanol-type fermentation products, and the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in the reduction of carbon dioxide was significantly higher than that fed with the other products, such as propionate and butyrate. Conversely, the abundance of genes that encoded the key enzymes involved in acetate decarboxylation among all the methanogenic sludge were nearly same. In the presence of ethanol, the abundance of gene for pilA significantly increased. The gene for pliA was primarily derived from Sphaerochaeta, Sedimentibacter and Pseudomonas species that were specially abundant and metabolically active. Further analysis showed that, the abundance of genes that encoded V/A-type ATPase in the methanogenic digesters fed with the ethanol-type fermentation products was 1.3–1.5 folds higher than that fed with the other products. As a result, the concentration of total ATP in the cells was increased by 1.8–2.3 folds.

We thus assessed this expectation for a global invasive pest, the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis), by determining whether climate variation and transportation activities affect invasion dynamics of this epidemic in California. We found that both temperature fluctuation (growing degree days) and transportation activities (passenger volume) have significant effects on interannual fluctuations of the oriental fruit fly detection events and infested areas. In addition, both detection events and infested areas of the oriental fruit fly were significantly higher in warmer years, while annual precipitation had no significant effects on invasion dynamics of the oriental fruit fly. The growing degree days contributed much more to the invasion dynamics than passenger volume, while passenger volume facilitated an increase in infested area more than growing degree days. Then, we introduced a conceptual framework of synergy model of climate change and transportation activities to illustrate invasion dynamics of the oriental fruit fly, revealing both the invasion dynamics in a fixed cell according to growing degree days and the spatial transmission of invasive alien species by passenger volume. Our findings shed light on the spatial invasion dynamics of alien species, with potential implications for understanding the trajectories of biological invasions under changing future climates and transportation activities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Alien species; Biological invasion; Climatic change; Global warming; Population; Transportation activities","biological invasion; climate change; epidemiology; fly; global warming; invasive species; transportation; California; United States; Bactrocera dorsalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077215019

This study combines temporal decomposition and scenario analysis to identify the key drivers and provinces with increasing carbon intensity of electricity generation (CIE) and designs four scenarios by integrating efficiency improvement and structural adjustment in 30 provinces of China, and estimates the possible reduction of CIE by 2020 and 2030. Results show that 1) CIE in China decreases by 7.25% during 2001–2015. The estimated CIE during 12th FYP in this study is 25% lower than the estimation using IPCC emission factors, which is closer to China's reality. 2) Driving forces of CIE changes in 30 provinces vary greatly across provinces. The increasing CIE in four worse-performance regions (i.e. Northeast, South Coast, Southwest, Northwest) is mainly caused by energy mix effect and geographic distribution effect. The CIE growth in South Coast is also related to thermal power share effect. 3) Both 2020/2030 targets can be achieved by regulating the drivers for CIE growth in 30 provinces (i.e., RAK scenario). CIE decline is concentrated in three types of provinces, namely provinces with large economic size, strong policy support and clean energy implementation.

While there has been an ever-increasing focus on agricultural greenhouse gas (AGHG) emissions, limited attention has been paid to their economic drivers in the globalized world economy and related mitigation potentials. This paper makes a first attempt to trace AGHG emissions via global trade networks using a multiregional input-output model and a complex network model. Over one third of global AGHG emissions in 2012 can be linked with products traded internationally, of which intermediate trade and final trade contribute 64.2% and 35.8%, respectively. Japan, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong are the world's five largest net importers of embodied emissions, while Ethiopia, Australia, Pakistan, India, and Argentina are the five largest net exporters. Some hunger-afflicted developing countries in Asia and Africa are important embodied emission exporters, due to their large-scale exports of agricultural products. Trade-related virtual AGHG emission transfers shape a highly heterogenous network, due to the coexistence of numerous peripheral economies and a few highly connected hub economies. The network clustering structure is revealed by the regional integration of several trading communities, while hub economies are collectors and distributors in the global trade network, with important implications for emission mitigation. Achieving AGHG emission reduction calls for a combination of supply- and demand-side policies covering the global trade network. ©2020.

Nonetheless, knowledge about soil microbial diversity, community composition, turnover and microbial functional structure in sub-and tropical broadleaf forests is scarce. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to profile soil microbial community composition, and a micro-array GeoChip 5.0 was used to profile microbial functional gene distribution in four sub-and tropical broadleaf forests (HS, MES, HP and JFL) in southern China. The results showed that soil microbial community compositions differed dramatically among all of four forests. Soil microbial diversities in JFL were the lowest (5.81-5.99) and significantly different from those in the other three forests (6.22-6.39). Furthermore, microbial functional gene interactions were the most complex and closest, likely in reflection to stress associated with the lowest nitrogen and phosphorus contents in JFL. In support of the importance of environmental selection, we found selection (78-96%) dominated microbial community assembly, which was verified by partial Mantel tests showing significant correlations between soil phosphorus and nitrogen content and microbial community composition. Taken together, these results indicate that nitrogen and phosphorus are pivotal in shaping soil microbial communities in sub-and tropical broadleaf forests in southern China. Changes in soil nitrogen and phosphorus, in response to plant growth and decomposition, will therefore have significant changes in both microbial community assembly and interaction. © 2020 by the authors.

To empirically investigate whether environmental regulation improves the greenhouse gas benefits of natural gas use in China, this study investigates the causal relationships among CO2 emissions, natural gas consumption, and environmental regulation in China, based on panel data of China's 30 provinces covering 2005–2015. Fully considering the potential cross-sectional dependence, the system general method of moments (SYS-GMM) estimation method is utilized. The empirical results reveal that: (1) Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for CO2 emissions is valid in China; (2) environmental regulation will not only directly affect CO2 emissions, but also indirectly affect CO2 emissions by influencing the energy consumption structure; (3) environmental regulation cannot significantly improve the greenhouse gas benefits of natural gas use, as environmental regulation in China can indirectly reduce CO2 emissions by decreasing coal consumption rather than increasing natural gas consumption; and (4) the causality analysis for three regions confirms the existence of significant regional differences. These findings offer several targeted policies for reducing CO2 emissions and promoting growth in the natural gas industry in China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Direct and indirect effects; Energy consumption structure; Environment regulation; Natural gas consumption","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Method of moments; Natural gas; CO2 emissions; Energy consumption structure; Environment regulations; Indirect effects; Natural gas consumption; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079903274

Fermentation characteristics, CH4 and total gas production, and coenzyme contents were determined at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h incubation time, and the populations of ruminal microbiota were analyzed by real-time PCR at 72 h incubation time. The addition of NE, NEOH, and NPOH slowed down in vitro rumen fermentation and reduced the proportion of molar CH4 by 96.7%, 96.7%, and 41.7%, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). The content of coenzymes F420 and F430 and the relative expression of the mcrA gene declined with the supplementation of NE, NEOH, and NPOH in comparison with the control (p &lt; 0.01). The addition of NE, NEOH, and NPOH decreased total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and acetate (p &lt; 0.05), but had no effect on propionate concentration (p &gt; 0.05). Real-time PCR results showed that the relative abundance of total methanogens, Methanobacteriales, Methanococcales, and Fibrobacter succinogenes were reduced by NE, NEOH, and NPOH (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the nitro-degradation rates in culture fluids were ranked as NEOH (−0.088) &gt; NE (−0.069) &gt; NPOH (−0.054). In brief, the results firstly provided evidence that NE, NEOH, and NPOH were able to decrease methanogen abundance and dramatically decrease mcrA gene expression and coenzyme F420 and F430 contents with different magnitudes to reduce ruminal CH4 production. © 2020 by the authors.

Here we report new environmental magnetic records from the foreland basin of southern Tian Shan. Our new magnetic records, together with the results of color parameters, suggest that the paleoenvironment in the study area changed abruptly since ~5.3 Ma. This result is consistent with other paleoclimatic records from different parts of the Tarim Basin, suggesting a basin-wide extreme aridification prevailed in the Tarim Basin since the beginning of the Pliocene. The long-term cooling trend of the climate in the Tarim Basin since the late Miocene was generally controlled by first-order global climate. However, the extreme aridification since ~5.3 Ma was dominantly controlled by decreased moisture transport caused by the final collision between Pamir and Tian Shan as a response to the northward displacement of the Pamir salient. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Enhanced aridification; Environmental magnetism; Late Neogene; Tarim Basin","aridification; climate variation; foreland basin; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; paleomagnetism; Pliocene; China; Tarim Basin; Tien Shan; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076602401

Conversely, ecosystem services also impose certain constraints on human. In this paper, we employed the model of ecosystem service value (ESV) assessment and grey relational degree, to reveal the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of ecosystem service value in Xinjiang and its interaction with human activities. The results showed that, during 2000–2015 the value of food production services (FPV) showed an upward trend, while the value of climate regulation services (CRV), gas regulation services (GRV), raw material production services (RMPV) and recreation services (RSV) showed a downward trend. The value of hydrological regulation services (HRV) showed a trend of first decreasing and then rising, while the value of waste disposal services (WDV) showed a trend of first increasing, then decreasing and then increasing. Spatial change showed that the services value of Kashi and Aksu Prefecture declined significantly, while Altay and Tacheng Prefecture increased significantly. In Xinjiang, human activities had a strong interaction with ecosystem services. Agricultural activities (0.989) and social development activities (0.844) had the greatest impact on changes in ecosystem services, especially agricultural water consumption (0.984) and total population at year-end (0.965). Hydrological regulation services (0.8179) had the greatest restriction on social and economic development. Combining the spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem service value and their variation with human activities are significant to formulate ecological policy and coordinate sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem service value; Grey correlation degree; Human activities; Xinjiang","Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Waste disposal; Ecosystem service values; Grey correlation degrees; Human activities; Raw material production; Social and economic development; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Xinjiang; Ecosystems; coordinate; ecological approach; ecosystem service; environmental planning; food production; human activity; social development; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; waste disposal; Aksu; Altay [Xinjiang Uygur]; China; Kashi; Tacheng; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075953135

However, the difficulty of the shift among different national carbon accounting schemes has rarely been quantitatively evaluated in the literature. Spatial production fragmentation over the recent decades has led to geographical separation among the primary inputs supplying regions, carbon emitting regions, and final consuming regions. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the effects of spatial production fragmentation on the shift from production-based to consumption-based and income-based national carbon accounting. Based on both demand- and supply-driven input-output analytical frameworks, this paper analyses the allocation of carbon responsibility for embodied and enabled emissions along production chains over the period 1995–2009. It was found that as much as 25% of embodied emissions and 20% of enabled emissions crossed national borders more than once in 2009. The shift among different carbon accounting schemes is not only related to the magnitude of trade related emissions but also related to border-crossing frequency associated with emissions embodied in or enabled by international trade. The increasingly fragmented production networks complicate the shift from production-based to consumption-based or income-based accounting and weaken the effectiveness of consumption-based or income-based accounting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Border-crossing frequency; Embodied emissions; Enabled emissions; National carbon accounting; Spatial production fragmentation","Emission control; Geographical regions; International trade; Border crossings; Carbon accounting; Demand and supply; Embodied emissions; Geographical separation; Production chain; Production network; Spatial production fragmentation; Carbon; abatement cost; biomass allocation; carbon emission; income; international trade",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075394081

Figuring out the convergence and persistence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions matters much for environmental policymakers in China. This study mainly utilizes the Fourier quantile unit root test to survey the convergence of the SO2 emissions per capita in 74 cities of China during the period of December 2014 to June 2019, by conducting five traditional unit root tests and a quantile root unit test as a comparative analysis. The empirical results indicate that the SO2 emissions per capita in 72 out of 74 cities in China are convergent in the sample period. The results also suggest that the unit root behavior of the SO2 emissions per capita in these cities is asymmetrically persistent at different quantiles. For the cities with the convergent SO2 emissions, the government should consider the asymmetric mean-reverting pattern of SO2 emissions when implementing environmental protection policies at different stages. For Hefei and Nanjing, the local governments need to enact stricter environmental protection policies to control the emission of sulfur dioxide. © 2020 by the authors.

At the same time, the new round of power system reform has higher requirements for the development of power grid in all aspects. One of the key points of the reform is to achieve accurate investment in power grid, improve the efficiency of power grid construction and meet the demand of power grid construction. In this paper, the classic Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used, combined with the development situation of the power grid under the new requirements, the index system and model for the calculation of the construction efficiency and demand of the local and municipal power grid under the background of the highly complex development of the power grid are put forward. The model takes the time line of the power grid construction as the axis, through the pre-evaluation and post-evaluation of the power grid construction, the calculation of the construction situation of the regional power grid is completed. The efficiency and demand of power grid construction in different cities are analyzed. The example shows that the model can effectively identify the construction attributes of each region, reflect the construction requirements of the provincial power company system through different judgment matrix, and verify the final calculation results, optimize the construction and demand of the power grid system. The model effectively improves the operation efficiency of the power grid system, and realizes the ultimate goal of energy conservation and emission reduction. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","calculation; Grid; investment demand; investment efficiency","Analytic hierarchy process; Calculations; Complex networks; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Investments; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Construction efficiency; Construction requirements; Development situations; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Grid; Investment efficiency; Operation efficiencies; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082597859

Water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) were measured hourly in addition to PM2.5 mass concentration and black carbon (BC) and gaseous pollutants in Ningbo located in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China. Three distinct cases, i.e., a control case, a normal case, and a typhoon case, were investigated during the study period. PM2.5 was higher in the control case (37.5 μg m−3) than in the normal case (29.8 μg m−3), whereas the lowest PM2.5 (14.2 μg m−3) was observed in the typhoon case. The analyses of meteorology and backward trajectory suggested that stable weather and regional transport from inland regions accounted for the high PM2.5 under strict control. Only the concentrations of Ca2+ and NO3− decreased in the control case, while those of all water-soluble inorganic components (except Na+ and Mg2+) decreased substantially in the typhoon case. SO42− dominated the WSII, with the highest contribution, 62%, in the control case. This result was attributed to a stagnant atmosphere with a high relative humidity (RH), which was beneficial for the transformation of SO2 to SO42−. The control and typhoon cases both resulted in extremely low NO2, but the contribution of NO3− to PM2.5 was reduced in the control case and increased in the typhoon case. The close correlation of the NOR (nitrate oxidation ratio) with Na+ and Mg2+ in the typhoon case was indicative of sea salt associated with the typhoon which provided a surface for the heterogeneous formation of NO3−. The presented results facilitate a better understanding of the characteristics and formation of PM2.5 under the influence of artificial control and natural intervention. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Control measures; Formation mechanism; G20; Regional transport; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Typhoon","Atmospheric movements; Emission control; Fog; River pollution; Storms; Control measures; Formation mechanism; Heterogeneous formation; High relative humidities; Inorganic components; Regional transport; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Water soluble inorganic ions; Hurricanes; black carbon; calcium; ion; magnesium; nitrate; sodium; aerosol; black carbon; emission control; oxidation; particulate matter; relative humidity; sea salt; transformation; typhoon; air pollution control; Article; atmosphere; China; concentration (parameter); control strategy; controlled study; humidity; hurricane; meteorology; oxidation; particulate matter; priority journal; China; Ningbo; Yangtze River; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079180812

The relationships between AV and the wind speed (WS) from the near surface to the troposphere (850 hPa to 200 hPa) are analysed. The mean visibility at 582 qualified stations in China is 22.03 km, with the highest in summer (25.37 km) and lowest in winter (18.92 km). The annual mean AV has decreased at most stations and all seasons across China since the 1980s. Most regions show a decreasing AV trend mainly before 2005 and an increasing trend in recent years, possibly related to the emission reduction policies in China. The AV has a significant positive correlation with the near-surface WS in all seasons, with the largest correlation coefficient of 0.84 in summer and the smallest in winter. The AV also has a positive correlation with the WS in the lower troposphere in most of China, except in some inland desert regions. Additionally, the long-term trends of WS, surface temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and surface pressure (Ps) were analysed at each station across China. The results show that both decreasing WS and increasing T could well account for the decreasing trend in AV. The changes in RH and Ps are at least not the main drivers. Overall, the “best” (“worst”) visibility corresponds to the largest (smallest) WS near the ground and in the lower troposphere, but such correspondence tends to overturn towards the upper troposphere. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric visibility; Observation data adjustment; Radiosonde wind profile; Wind speed","Atmospheric humidity; Emission control; Troposphere; Wind; Atmospheric visibility; Correlation coefficient; Emission reduction policies; Observation data; Positive correlations; Radiosonde winds; Surface temperatures; Wind speed; Visibility; climatology; emission control; pollution policy; relative humidity; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; troposphere; wind velocity; article; China; climate; correlation coefficient; desert; human; humidity; summer; troposphere; visibility; wind speed; winter; writing; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078668148

The results show that: (1) the unified efficiency of Chinese CME is extremely low, with most values ranging between 0.1 and 0.3. Although there is heterogeneity among the unified efficiencies of CME under different benchmark frontiers, all of the efficiency values are small and there is much room for improvement.

Clean coal briquettes can be used for pollution emission control. In this study, red mud (RM), a high alkalinity byproduct generated from the Bayer process, was employed as additive in coal briquettes. Combustion tests of briquettes and raw coal were conducted to evaluate the emission reduction effects on PM2.5 and carbonaceous aerosols. The highest emission reduction rates of PM2.5, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC) for bituminous were 37.5%, 13.2%, 82.6% and for anthracite were 31.2%, 11.1%, 30.0%. Total carbon (TC)/PM2.5 remained stable between raw coal and briquettes while EC/OC was altered significantly (from 0.32 to 0.08 and 0.08 to 0.03 for bituminous and anthracite). Subfractions (in both OC, EC) showed a similar decreasing trend with the increase of RM content, while OC3 and OC4 reduction was not significantly compared to raw coal emission.

In this study, genome-guided analysis of Planktothrix spp. first divided these strains into six distinct groups, and comparisons of Planktothrix genomes revealed the inter- and intra-species variation. Prediction of central metabolism showed the functional diversity with regard to uptake of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur sources. As the carbon-fixing microorganisms, Planktothrix isolates played a critical role in transforming the atmospheric carbon into organic carbon-the waterbodies' pool of available carbon. Diazotrophic lifestyle in certain Planktothrix strains may provide valuable avenues for supporting the equilibrium community. Furthermore, genome mining supported the exploration of biosynthetic gene clusters dedicated to cyanobacterial natural products, mainly including non-ribosomal peptide, polyketide, cyanobactin, and microviridin. Notably, some Planktothrix strains had the potential to non-ribosomally synthesize the microcystin (MC), a potent cyclic heptapeptide toxin, and MC-mediated cycling might strengthen the association between MC-producing and MC-degrading microorganisms.

The rule of the carbon source saving effect was also clarified. The study adopted the programmable logic controller automatic control system and the feedback control structure using the inner circulation flow of nitrate as the controlled variable. The ORPan setting values of control parameters were -140, -125, -110, -95, -70, and -60 mV, respectively. The results showed that when the ORPan setting value was -95 mV, COD distribution ratios of phosphorus-accumulating bacteria reached the highest in the anaerobic stage and preanoxic stage, with the values of 51.74 and 7.70%, respectively. The COD was distributed between heterotrophic bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the main anoxic stage, and the distribution ratios were 4.40 and 7.19%, respectively, when the ORPan setting value was -95 mV. The study also showed the distribution of nitrate-nitrogen between denitrifying bacteria and denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating bacteria in the main anoxic stage, and when ORPan increased from -140 to -60 mV, the distribution ratios of denitrifying phosphate-accumulating bacteria increased from 76.46 to 86.32%. When there was no denitrification and phosphorus absorption, the acetic acid dosage increased from 20.33 g/d at -140 mV to 24.76 g/d at -95 mV, and the carbon source saving rate increased from 23.19 to 26.56% under similar conditions. Therefore, in the MUCT process, the regulation of ORPan changed the material flow direction and mass quality distribution of COD and nitrate nitrogen.

The results showed that: First, there is a significant inverted “U”-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and carbon emissions. With improved environmental regulation, the positive effects of environmental regulation in reducing the amount and intensity of carbon emissions are more obvious. Next, foreign investment behavior under environmental regulations can reduce the amount and intensity of carbon emissions. Finally, In terms of regional heterogeneity, foreign investment behavior in the eastern and central regions can curb carbon emissions, the opposite effect is seen in the western region. With improved environmental regulations for relatively high–emission intensity regions, foreign direct investment (FDI) in low–emission intensity regions can significantly reduce carbon emissions. It is necessary to formulate differentiated environmental regulation based on regional development.

The results indicate that the increase in runoff caused by climate change in the next decade will be accompanied by an increase in the loss of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Planting sweet potato under historical meteorological conditions had the best effect on controlling nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the Lizixi watershed, while large losses of nitrogen and phosphorus were produced when planting wheat and corn.

With the vast majority of tea demand being met by importation, the United States became the third largest tea importer worldwide after Russia and Pakistan. As demand for domestically produced tea increases and growers expressing increasing interest in growing and producing tea, tea production became an emerging industry in the United States. Compared to major tea producing countries with centuries of growing history, tea production in the United States is limited and requires research support in many aspect of tea production including selecting suitable cultivars adapted to local climatic conditions. This study evaluated nine tea cultivars, including ‘BL1,’ ‘BL2,’ ‘Black Sea,’ ‘Christine’s Choice,’ ‘Dave’s Fave,’ ‘Large Leaf,’ ‘Small Leaf,’ ‘Sochi,’ and ‘var. assamica,’ for plant growth, leaf morphological characteristics, cold tolerance, and leaf biochemical compositions when grown in Mississippi United States with a subtropical climate. The nine tested cultivars had varying plant growth indices (PGI) and varying degrees of cold tolerance to freezing temperatures in winter, but resumed healthy growth the following spring. ‘BL2’ showed the highest PGI of 104.53 cm by February 2019, which might be helpful toward suppressing weed and early establishment of tea plantation. The nine cultivars also showed varying leaf characteristics in terms of leaf length, width, area, fresh and dry weights, and new shoot weight. There existed a diversity in leaf biochemical composition including soluble solids, carbohydrates, total polyphenols (TP), free amino acids (AA), L-theanine and caffeine among the nine cultivars and among different harvesting seasons of spring, summer, and fall within a certain cultivar. The nine cultivars in this study generally grow well in local environment. All tea samples collected from nine cultivars and three seasons were considered suitable for green tea processing with low TP/AA ratios ranging from 1.72 to 3.71 in this study. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Li, Wang, LeCompte, Harkess and Bi.","amino acids; caffeine; Camellia sinensis; cold tolerance; leaf quality; plant growth; polyphenols; tea",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082652246

The Chinese government has expended much effort in addressing environmental issues. An important question for China is how much air pollution it can reduce and at what cost. Using streaming city-level data, this paper examines the feasibility of the Chinese government's policies to regulate its efficiency and promotion using its shadow price for three major urban agglomerations, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Pearl River Delta (PRD), from 2013 to 2016. The non-radial direction distance function and its dual model show that the average atmospheric environmental efficiencies of the BTH, YRD and PRD are 0.2673, 0.3312 and 0.4711, respectively. The efficiencies tend to increase over time, which is promising, but the absolute annual growth rate is relatively low, implying the need for stronger regulations. We also find that the three regions achieve improved air quality through different technologies. The BTH takes stronger environmental action at a lower cost for pollutant emission reduction compared to the other districts. The shadow prices of the three main air pollutants, that is, PM2.5, SO2, and NO2, present an upward trend in the BTH, YRD, and PRD agglomerations, but with a large difference, implying the need for customized regulation and/or promotion by region. More specifically, a reduction of PM2.5 by 1 mg/m3 would cost BTH 2.717 million yuan, whereas the cost for PRD would be 7.31 million. Therefore, policymakers must implement different policies depending on the regional heterogeneity when trying to enhance air quality. High-efficiency regions such as PRD should have a smaller emission reduction target, whereas low-efficiency regions such as BTH should gradually increase their emission reduction targets. © 2018","Atmospheric environmental efficiency (AEE); Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH); Mitigation shadow price; Non-radial directional distance function (NDDF); Particulate material 2.5 (PM2.5); Streaming data","Agglomeration; Air quality; Economics; Efficiency; Emission control; River pollution; Directional distance function; Environmental efficiency; Particulate materials; Shadow price; Streaming data; Tianjin; Cost reduction; air quality; atmospheric pollution; efficiency measurement; environmental policy; mitigation; particulate matter; policy making; pollution monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; cost; feasibility study; government regulation; particulate matter; policy; priority journal; urban area; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076847996

In the urban environment, and depending on local climatic conditions, air conditioning units attribute to these high energy demands. This study analyzes the use of residential air conditioning units and their associated global warming potential (GWP) between 2005 and 2030 for the city of Shenzhen, a fast-growing megacity located in Southern China. A life cycle assessment approach was adopted to quantify the GWP impacts which arise from both direct (refrigerant release) and indirect (energy consumption) sources, in combination with a materials flow analysis approach. The results show that the total GWP (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2 eq.) from residential air conditioning systems increased from 2.2 ± 0.2 to 5.1 ± 0.4 million tonnes (Mt) CO2 eq. between 2005 and 2017, with energy consumption and refrigerant release contributing to 72.5% and 27.5% of the total demands, respectively. Immediate measures are required to restrict refrigerant release and reduce the energy consumption of air conditioning units, to help mitigate the predicted additional total emissions of 36.4 Mt. CO2 eq. potentially released between 2018 and 2030. This amount equals to approximately New Zealand's national CO2 emissions in 2017. The findings proposed in this study targets air conditioning units to reduce the GWP emissions in cities, and provide useful data references and insights for local authorities to incentivise measures for improving building energy efficiency management and performance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air conditioning; Energy consumption; Global warming potential; Refrigerant release; Residential building","Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Life cycle; Refrigerants; Air conditioning units; Building energy efficiency; Climatic conditions; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Materials flow analysis; Residential air conditioning; Residential building; Air conditioning; air conditioning; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate conditions; empirical analysis; global warming; greenhouse gas; megacity; urban area; China; Guangdong; New Zealand; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077775861

Accordingly, a large amount of subway-related excavated soil and rock (ESR) are generated and disposed mainly through dumping sites every year, which threatens the natural environment and poses high landslide risks. This study is therefore designed to characterize the generation, composition, flows and potential impacts of ESR in China. The results show that with the promotion of subway and increasing public awareness of recycle ESR, the generation of ESR has increased from 0.2 million m3 in 1965 to 79 million m3 in 2018 with a cumulative CO2 mitigation of 417.2 million tonnes by 2018 and will keep increase in coming decades (e.g., approximately exceed 200 million m3 by 2030). South and East China account for 60% of the total ESR which aligns well with their growing population and economic activities. Besides backfilling and landscaping, ESR were mainly sent to dumping site or unregulated landfill sites, which accounts for 87% of total generation. It was estimated and predicted that the dumping disposal of ESR has cumulatively occupied a land area of 212 ± 25 km2 from 2004 to 2030. Moreover, this study compared the management of ESR between China and developed countries, and recommendations for environmentally sound management of ESR were proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Excavated soil and rock; Flow; Generation; Subway","Construction industry; Economics; Railroads; Soils; Subways; China; Developed countries; Economic activities; Environmentally sound management; Flow; Generation; Natural environments; Subway constructions; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075418111

However, the drivers and the sustainable development process of the district heating system of the building sector have not been investigated to understand the management of energy conservation and emissions reduction in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration. This study investigates the drivers of the district heating energy consumption of the building sector (DHEB) in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration between 2004 and 2016 by developing a decomposition framework. The decoupling status between the DHEB and gross domestic product (GDP) is then analyzed based on the Tapio decoupling index. The results show that a weak decoupling effect is mainly found between the DHEB and GDP in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration from 2004 to 2016. The increase in the DHEB in 2004-2016 is largely driven by the growth of the district heating area and population, while the heating energy intensity negatively contributes to the increase.

Experimental observations of the charge-order induced transport and electrically polar behaviors have been insufficient. In this work, we synthesize the La(Ca0.8Sr0.2)2Mn2O7 (LCSMO) single crystal and investigate its structural, magnetic, and dielectric properties. It is revealed that LCSMO undergoes two consecutive charge-ordering transitions upon decreasing temperature T before entering an antiferromagnetic state in the low-T range. The first charge-order transition occurs at temperature TCO1∼314 K from the high-T paramagnetic state. This charge-order state (CO1 state) is transferred into another charge-order state (CO2 state) by a sequence starting from ∼290 K, and the resultant CO2 state is dynamic and polar-like. The dynamic behaviors of this polar-like CO2 state is confirmed by the remarkable dielectric relaxation associated with this state. The present work provides a connection between the charge-ordering and electrically polar response in LCSMO, while ferroelectricity remains yet to be an issue. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Carbon dioxide; Dielectric relaxation; Ferroelectricity; Manganites; Rare earths; Single crystals; Antiferromagnetic state; Charge order state; Charge ordering; Charge ordering transition; Dynamic behaviors; Electronic and magnetic properties; Layered manganite; Paramagnetic state; Antiferromagnetism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081968183

For example, during CO2 reduction, production of CO often requires balancing a trade-off between the adsorption strength of the reactant and product states: weak binding of CO is desirable from a selectivity perspective, but weak binding of CO2 leads to low activity. Here, we demonstrate a new method of controlling both CO2 adsorption and CO desorption over supported metal catalysts by employing a single self-assembly step where organic monolayer films were deposited on the catalyst support. Binding of phosphonic acid monolayers on supported Pt and Pd catalysts weakened CO binding via a through-support effect. The weakened CO adsorption was generally accompanied by decreased adsorption and reactivity of CO2. However, by the incorporation of basic amine functions at controlled positions in the modifying film, strong CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation reactivity could be restored. Thus, both through-surface and through-space interactions could be manipulated by design of the organic modifiers. After surface modification, the catalysts exhibited significantly improved selectivity (up to 99% at conversions near 50%) and activity toward CO production.

In this context, China's local authorities and industry circles are particularly concerned about the impact of emissions trading scheme (ETS), China's first major market-based approach to control greenhouse gas emissions, on competitiveness. This paper contributes to the thin empirical studies on this issue from the perspective of China's provincial industrial sub-sectors. We divide the industry of each province into 37 sub-sectors and screen the actual industrial sub-sector coverage of China's pilot ETSs. Taking advantage of the rich information of sub-sector characteristics and the longitudinal structure of our dataset over 2005–2015, we use a combination of propensity score matching technique and difference-in-difference models to analyze the impact of China's pilot ETSs on gross industrial output value (GIOV) and employment. Empirical results indicate that China's pilot ETSs have exerted a negative impact on the GIOV, and production cut is still the major approach to achieve carbon emission reductions. We also find China's pilot ETSs have led to a significant decrease in employment of the covered industrial sub-sectors. Several robustness checks confirm our findings. Further, our discussions suggest that in the short term, China's pilot ETSs have not promoted the “decoupling” of carbon emissions and economic outputs in industrial sub-sectors. While achieving carbon emission reductions, the pilot ETSs have failed to avoid a negative impact on competitiveness. Lastly, we suggest that competent authorities should prudently tailor the quota allocation methods according to sectorial conditions and consider setting up compensation measures, and covered enterprises should incorporate low-carbon development concept and address the challenges proactively from the long run. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Competitiveness; Emissions trading scheme; Employment; Industrial sub-sectors","carbon; competitiveness; economic development; economic growth; emissions trading; empirical analysis; employment; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; industrial development; air pollution control; algorithm; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; economic development; employment; environmental policy; exhaust gas; market; propensity score; greenhouse gas; industry; China; Carbon; China; Economic Development; Greenhouse Gases; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077388204

The contiguous area of Shanxi and Shaanxi Provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (SSIM) is one of the most important national energy bases in China. Its development pattern, dominated by the coal industry, has led to increasingly prominent structural problems along with difficult low-carbon transition. Taking energy-rich cities in the contiguous area of SSIM as examples, this study analyzes the main drivers of CO2 emissions and explores the role of economic structure transformation in carbon emission reduction during 2002-2012 based on structural decomposition analysis (SDA). The results show that CO2 emissions increase significantly with the coal industry expansion in energy-rich cities. Economic growth and structure are the main drivers of CO2 emission increments. An energy structure dominated by coal and improper product allocation structure can also cause CO2 emission increases. Energy consumption intensity is the main factor curbing CO2 emission growth in energy-rich cities. The decline of agriculture and services contributes to carbon emission reduction, while the expansion of mining and primary energy processing industries has far greater effects on CO2 emission growth. Finally, we propose that energy-rich cities must make more efforts to transform energy-driven economic growth patterns, cultivate new pillar industries by developing high-end manufacturing, improve energy efficiency through more investment in key technologies and the market-oriented reform of energy pricing and develop natural gas and renewable energy to accelerate low-carbon transition. © 2020 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Economic structure; Energy-rich cities; Structural decomposition analysis","carbon emission; coal industry; decomposition analysis; economic growth; economic structure; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082605654

Marine anoxia has been cited as the proximate kill mechanism for this event. However, the detailed timing, duration, and extent of global marine redox chemistry changes across this critical interval remain controversial because most of the studies to date only constrain changes in local or regional redox chemistry. Thus, opinions on the significance of anoxia as a kill mechanism are variable—from anoxia being a primary driver to being relatively unimportant. In this study, we explore the evolution of global marine redox chemistry using U isotopes of marine limestones. The δ238U trends at Long'an section in South China document systematic oscillations with three negative shifts punctuated by two positive events in between. The magnitude of the δ238U oscillations implies that the sediments do not record contemporaneous seawater with a constant offset at all times. The lack of covariation between δ238U data and diagenetic indicators (e.g., Mn and Sr contents, Mn/Sr ratio, δ18O) suggests that the δ238U trends are not produced by the same post-depositional diagenetic processes. Instead, trace-metal enrichments suggest that more reducing conditions prevailed during the deposition of the two positive events. We present plausible model scenarios that fit the observed δ238U trends in the context of redox-sensitive trace metal data suggesting marine anoxia expanded in the latest Devonian oceans to cover &gt;5% of the continental shelf seafloor area. The rapid expansion of marine anoxia coincident with the onset of the Hangenberg Crisis supports marine anoxia as an important kill mechanism. Biogeochemical modeling of the coupled C-P-U cycles suggests that intensified continental weathering, for example, assisted by the spread of seed plants with deeper root systems at this time, could have triggered expansion of marine anoxia and other global changes (e.g., positive excursion in δ13Ccarb and decrease in sea surface temperature) in the latest Devonian. The anoxic event is inferred to have been transient as climatic cooling would have reduced weathering fluxes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","biogeochemical model; Devonian-Carboniferous; Hangenberg Crisis; marine anoxia; mass extinction; uranium isotopes","Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Deposition; Expansion; Isotopes; Lime; Nuclear fuels; Oceanography; Seed; Surface waters; Weathering; Biogeochemical modeling; Devonians; Hangenberg Crisis; marine anoxia; Mass extinction; Uranium isotopes; Trace elements; anoxia; Carboniferous; chemical weathering; chemostratigraphy; Devonian; isotopic composition; limestone; mass extinction; paleoenvironment; redox conditions; trend analysis; uranium isotope; China; Spermatophyta; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077314626

High pesticide loadings can potentially pollute the water resource. However, little is known about the usage, environmental emission and fate of pesticides in river basins. Here, we firstly established a pesticide emission estimation method, and investigated the environmental fate of three commonly used pesticides (chlorpyrifos, triazophos, and isoprothiolane) in Dongjiang River basin, southern China using mathematical modelling approach in combination with field monitoring. The distributed hydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was applied to model the emission of the target pesticides from farmland to stream water, and their fate in the basin. A satisfactory model calibration for flow and suspended sediment was obtained based on eight-year observation data of four hydrological monitoring stations in Dongjiang River basin. The differences between the simulation and observation of pesticides were almost within an order of magnitude, including more than 53% differences within 0.5 order of magnitude. In the river basin, 78860 kg of chlorpyrifos, 54990 kg of triazophos and 35320 kg of isoprothiolane were sprayed onto the crops, the estimated annual emissions of the basin come up to 1801 kg, 3779 kg, and 2330 kg under the conditions of rainfall, surface runoff and percolation. After a series of environmental processes including settlement and degradation within the channels, the predicted export masses for chlorpyrifos, triazophos and isoprothiolane were reduced to 266 kg, 1858 kg, 1350 kg, respectively. Successful prediction suggests that the reliable estimation method combing the SWAT modelling can help us understand the source, concentration levels and fate of pesticides in river basin in different scales. Combing the method of emission and fate modelling method we proposed, countries and regions lacking pesticide-application database can facilitate better management of pesticides. Reliable emission estimation method combing the SWAT modelling helps us understand the source, concentration levels and fate of pesticides in a large river basin. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Contamination; Emission; Fate; Modelling; Pesticides; River basin","Contamination; Crops; Estimation; Models; Neutron emission; Pesticides; Rivers; Soil pollution; Solvents; Suspended sediments; Watersheds; Distributed hydrological model; Environmental emissions; Fate; Hydrological monitoring stations; Pesticide applications; River basins; Satisfactory modeling; Soil and Water assessment tools; River pollution; chlorpyrifos; malotilate; pesticide; triazophos; concentration (composition); emission control; estimation method; pesticide residue; river basin; water pollution; water quality; water resource; calibration; catchment area (hydrology); China; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; environmental monitoring; prediction; river basin; sediment; simulation; stream (river); surface runoff; river; water pollutant; water pollution; China; Dong River [China]; China; Environmental Monitoring; Pesticides; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076618677

Low resolution carbon isotope records prior to this event also limit the construction of a Middle Permian chemostratigraphic framework and global or local stratigraphic correlation, and hence limit our understanding of carbon cycle and environmental changes. To investigate these issues, we analyzed the 13Corg values from the Middle Permian chert-mudstone sequence (Gufeng Formation) in the Lower Yangtze deep-water basin (South China) and compared them with published records to build a chemostratigraphic scheme and discuss the underlying environmental events. The records show increased δ13Corg values from late Kungurian to early Guadalupian, followed by a decrease to the late Wordian/early Capitanian. The early-mid Capitanian was characterized by elevated δ13Corg values suggesting the presence of the “Kamura Event”: an interval of heavy positive values seen in the δ13Ccarb record. We propose that these heavy Capitanian δ13C values may be a response to a marked decline in chemical weathering rates on Pangea and associated reduction in carbonate burial, which we show using a biogeochemical model. The subsequent negative δ13C excursion seen in some carbonate records, especially in shallower-water sections (and in a muted expression in organic carbon) coincide with the Capitanian mass extinction may be caused by the input of isotopically-light carbon sourced from the terrestrial decomposition of organic matter. © 2019 International Association for Gondwana Research","Capitanian mass extinction; Carbon cycle; Chemostratigraphy; Emeishan volcanism; Guadalupian","carbon cycle; carbon isotope; chemostratigraphy; chert; mudstone; organic carbon; paleoenvironment; Permian; stratigraphic correlation; stratigraphy; China; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075207289

Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control.

However, the photocatalytic H2O2 generation activity of the pristine C3N4 in pure H2O is poor due to unpropitious rapid charge recombination and unfavorable selectivity. Herein, we report a facile method to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 production by grafting cationic polyethylenimine (PEI) molecules onto C3N4. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate PEI can tune the local electronic environment of C3N4. The unique intermolecular electronic interaction in PEI/C3N4 not only improves the electron-hole separation but also promotes the two-electron O2 reduction to H2O2 via the sequential two-step single-electron reduction route. With the synergy of improved charge separation and high selectivity of two-electron O2 reduction, PEI/C3N4 exhibits an unexpectedly high H2O2 generation activity of 208.1 μmol g-1 h-1, which is 25-fold higher than that of pristine C3N4. This study establishes a paradigm of tuning the electronic property of C3N4 via functional molecules for boosted photocatalysis activity and selectivity. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","artificial photosynthesis; graphitic carbon nitride; hydrogen peroxide; intermolecular electron transfer; polyethylenimine","Artificial photosynthesis; Chemical plants; Density functional theory; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic properties; Electrons; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Hydrogen peroxide; Molecules; Oxidation; Oxygen; Peroxides; Photocatalytic activity; Separation; Cationic polyethylenimine; Electron-hole separation; Electronic environments; Electronic interactions; Intermolecular electron transfer; Photocatalytic hydrogen; Polyethylenimines; Single electron reduction; Tuning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082815601

It argues that in times of meteorological insecurity, we can explore diverse sites in China's state environmental political apparatus as attempts at coordinating diverse physical, natural, and social processes into components of manipulable weather systems. Through considering two programs of state environmental intervention, the article explores “infrastructure” as a political practice and opportunity. First, in considering aerial seeding and ecological migration programs in the context of anti-dust storm programs spearheaded by state forestry agencies, I show how environmental engineering involves the continual retooling of wind flows, local ecologies, and ex-herder precarity into a variegated strategy of atmospheric control for downwind places in the path of dust storms. Then, I explore how the recent ascendance of the Chinese state in international climate accords builds on a decade-long theorization of “socialist ecological civilization” by Party theorists. In aligning the longevity of state socialism with the sustaining of planetary climate systems, I argue that Chinese international politics increasingly rely on a vision of China as infrastructural to the political and climatic apparatus of the planet as such.

Tiepolo 11, Trieste, 34143, Italy","Hyper-luminous quasars (Lbol 1047 erg s-1) are ideal laboratories to study the interaction and impact of the extreme radiative field and the most powerful winds in the active galactic nuclei (AGN) nuclear regions. They typically exhibit low coronal X-ray luminosity (LX) compared to the ultraviolet (UV) and mid-infrared (MIR) radiative outputs (LUV and LUV); a non-negligible fraction of them report even ∼1 dex weaker LX compared to the prediction of the well established LX-LUV and LX-LUV relations followed by the bulk of the AGN population. In our WISE/SDSS-selected Hyper-luminous (WISSH) z = 2-4 broad-line quasar sample, we report on the discovery of a dependence between the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity (L2-10) and the blueshifted velocity of the CIV emission line (vCIV) that is indicative of accretion disc winds. In particular, sources with the fastest winds (vCIV 3000 km s-1) possess ∼0.5-1 dex lower L2-10 than sources with negligible vCIV. No similar dependence is found on LUV, LUV, Lbol, the photon index, or the absorption column density. We interpret these findings in the context of accretion disc wind models. Both magnetohydrodynamic and line-driven models can qualitatively explain the reported relations as a consequence of X-ray shielding from the inner wind regions. In case of line-driven winds, the launch of fast winds is favoured by a reduced X-ray emission, and we speculate that these winds may play a role in directly limiting the coronal hard X-ray production. © ESO 2020.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: high-redshift; Quasars: emission lines; Quasars: supermassive black holes; X-rays: galaxies","Electromagnetic wave emission; Luminance; Magnetohydrodynamics; X ray production; Absorption column density; Accretion discs; Active galactic nuclei; Emission lines; Line-driven winds; Radiative fields; X-ray emission; X-ray luminosity; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088288805

The Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) is endowed with clean electricity and rich biomass resources, which are essential for developing a low-carbon wood pellet industry. This work aims to quantify the life cycle Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of torrefied wood pellets in comparison with conventional pellets, derived from forest residues in BC and transported to replace coal at power plants in Europe, the Asia Pacific region and elsewhere in Canada. The GHG reduction costs in different markets are also quantified. Five possible production configurations are analysed with uncertainties taken into consideration. Torrefied wood pellets are found to have better environmental performance than conventional pellets. The best production process, which follows the sequence drying-torrefaction-grinding-pelletization, can reduce primary energy consumption and carbon footprint by about 30% compared to conventional pellets. Over the life cycle, transportation contributes most GHG emissions (>50%), while electricity use, including sawmilling and pellet production, represents the greatest energy consumption (~50%). Life cycle analysis reveals that GHG emissions from the supply chain offset at most 15% of the savings from using BC torrefied wood pellets to replace coal. GHG reductions are greatest when the pellets are used in overseas markets, especially the Asia Pacific region and the EU, rather than domestic Canadian markets. The current carbon taxation level cannot cover the abatement cost of BC pellets; other mechanisms are still needed to support the sustainable development of the industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","GHG abatement costs; GHG emission reduction; Life cycle analysis; Supply chain analysis; Torrefaction; Torrefied wood pellets","Carbon footprint; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Pelletizing; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Taxation; Uncertainty analysis; Wood; GHG abatements; GHG emission; Life cycle analysis; Supply chain analysis; Torrefaction; Torrefied woods; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079413523

The strong dependency on the synoptic weather conditions, rather than on city-specific, constant features, hinders the identification of recurrent patterns, leading conventional predicting algorithms to fail. In this paper, an advanced artificial intelligence technique based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model is applied to gain insight and predict the highly fluctuating heat island intensity (UHII) in the city of Sydney, Australia, governed by the dualistic system of cool sea breeze from the ocean and hot western winds from the vast desert biome inlands. Hourly measurements of temperature, collected for a period of 18 years (1999–2017) from 8 different sites in a 50 km radius from the coastline, were used to train (80%) and test (20%) the model. Other inputs included date, time, and previously computed UHII, feedbacked to the model with an optimized time step of six hours. A second set of models integrated wind speed at the reference station to account for the sea breeze effect. The R2 ranged between 0.770 and 0.932 for the training dataset and between 0.841 and 0.924 for the testing dataset, with the best performance attained right in correspondence of the city hot spots. Unexpectedly, very little benefit (0.06–0.43%) was achieved by including the sea breeze among the input variables. Overall, this study is insightful of a rather rare climatological case at the watershed between maritime and desertic typicality. We proved that accurate UHII predictions can be achieved by learning from long-term air temperature records, provided that an appropriate predicting architecture is utilized. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Desert winds, A.I. forecasting models; LSTM; Regional climate change; Sea breeze; Synoptic conditions; Urban heat island","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climate models; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Statistical tests; Thermal pollution; Wind; Forecasting models; LSTM; Regional climate changes; Sea breeze; Synoptic conditions; Urban heat island; Landforms; air temperature; climate change; coastal zone; desert; heat island; regional climate; sea breeze; synoptic meteorology; air temperature; article; artificial intelligence; Australia; city; climate change; desert; forecasting; heat; learning; prediction; sea; short term memory; watershed; wind speed; writing; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076845963

This paper aims to present the latest progress and controversies on the studies of the cooling effects of waterbodies, greenspaces, and parks. In order to do this research, international search engines were employed to systematically search peer-reviewed articles, including the cooling effect of blue-green space and threshold-size-based UHI mitigation studies. After that, the inductive analysis is used to analyze the relevant literature. We found that previous studies concentrated on the correlations between different landscape types, temperature variations and the quantification of cooling intensity, etc. However, threshold-size-based research has received less attention, which limits the ability to make specific recommendations for actionable planning and management – usingthe smallest blue-green space for the best cooling effect. The review also revealed the controversies over the effects of blue-green space size, shape, landscape composition and configuration on cooling effect. Besides, we pointed out that the uncertainties (i.e., the optimal proportion of blue-green space in a park) and the reasons of controversial results of the cooling effect need to be further investigated.

The proposed model considered three linked but independent subsystems of the economy–society–environment cyclic system. Additionally, to allocate the weights of the NDEA model among the three subsystems (environment, economy, and society) of the eco-environment, a new relative reduction of the input-based method was proposed. The results show that, from 2003 to 2016, the average eco-efficiency of China’s 30 provinces was low, ranging in [0.59, 0.73]. Qinghai and Hainan ranked first and second, respectively, in average eco-efficiencies, while both Shaanxi and Xinjiang had the lowest average eco-efficiencies. Affected by the low social subsystem efficiency, the eco-efficiency of 18 provinces decreased, but the range of the decrease was smaller than that of the increase in 11 other provinces in which the eco-efficiency improved. The average efficiency of the environmental subsystem is the highest among the three subsystems benefiting from reducing the emissions of “three industrial wastes,” while economic subsystem owns the lowest average efficiency due to the input redundancy of total fixed assets and energy consumption. Compared with variables’ projection, for most provinces, the undesirable output of the three industrial wastes should be reduced by more than 88.0%, while the positive outputs of atmospheric quality and per capita years of education should be increased by at least 61.0%. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Eco-efficiency; Efficiency evaluation; Network data envelopment analysis; Undesirable output; Weight allocation","data envelopment analysis; efficiency measurement; emission inventory; energy efficiency; environmental economics; network analysis; qualitative analysis; China; Hainan; Qinghai; Shaanxi; China; environmental monitoring; industrial waste; procedures; productivity; statistical model; China; Efficiency; Environmental Monitoring; Industrial Waste; Models, Statistical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077155629

The results show the following. (1) Total carbon emissions fluctuate on an overall upward trend, but the level of oil consumption per revenue tonne-kilometers (RTK) shows a steady downward trend. (2) Among the four main factors, the “transportation amount growth” factor contributed most to CO2 emissions increases; followed by transport structure adjustment effects and alternative fuel effects. The “energy consumption intensity” factor plays a major role in inhibiting CO2 emissions. (3) The decoupling state of civil aviation predominantly stayed in a weak decoupling prior to 1988, expansive coupling and expansive negative decoupling during 1988–2000, and expansive coupling post-2000, which implies that the government should take comprehensive measures to reduce CO2 emissions. (4) Based on eight scenarios, China's civil aviation sector is predicted to be responsible for 0.13 Gt of CO2 emissions by 2020.

This approach is much faster and easier than using GC or NMR, but conventional linear multivariate analysis is not suitable due to the poor resolution of FT-IR. The conventional PLS regression also exhibits bad performance due to its inability to reflect the nonlinear behavior like peak shift, which is a common characteristic of the systems involving reactions. This paper proposes the artificial neural networks (ANNs) as an alternative nonlinear regression method. Two feature extraction methods, PCA and POD, are applied to reduce the redundancy and dimension of the input data as a preprocessing step. The neural network approach displayed higher accuracies in cross-validation and also in in-situ experiments compared to the PLS regression in a performance test involving three models. In particular, the POD-ANN method showed outstanding results with under 5 % relative error. This model can fulfill the function of an online monitoring system for CO2 capture processes and can provide information on water and solvent loss from evaporation or degradation. Furthermore, it can be utilized for control and fault detection techniques to maintain long-term operational stability of the system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 capture; Feature extraction; In-situ FT-IR; Mixture absorbent; Multivariate quantitative analysis; Reduced order neural network","Adsorbents; Carbon dioxide; Extraction; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Mixtures; Multivariant analysis; Neural networks; Partial discharges; Regression analysis; Solvents; System stability; CO2 capture; Fault detection techniques; Feature extraction methods; In-situ FT-IR; Non-linear regression method; On-line monitoring system; Quantitative analysis model; Reduced order; Indium compounds; ammonia; artificial neural network; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); FTIR spectroscopy; multivariate analysis; quantitative analysis; solvent",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076024632

In this work, to make up for the limitations of laboratory testing conditions, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to systematically study the mechanism of CH4 adsorption on dry and moist coals under reservoir temperature and pressure conditions. A novel strategy, named the diamond-filling method, was proposed for the construction of macromolecular pores with specific diameter and morphology. The simulation results demonstrated that the state of CH4 molecules constrained in pores changes from homogeneous filling to multilayer adsorption with the increase of pore size. During the variation of the state of CH4 molecules, the interaction between CH4 and coals gradually weakened, resulting in a significant reduction in CH4 concentration, which stabilized after the pore size reached 5 nm. In addition, it was found that the spherical pore showed the highest adsorption capacity, followed by cylindrical pore and flat pore. In the case where the moisture content ranged from 1 to 3 wt%, the results showed that H2O molecules kept gathering towards the walls. Meanwhile, the CH4 molecules gradually moved towards the bulk interior part along with the declining concentration due to the deeper adsorption potential of H2O molecules in nanopores. The molecular simulation was shown to be a valuable and efficient tool for revealing the mechanism of CH4 adsorption in coal and producing results that have practical applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anthracite coal; Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC); Heterogeneous pore structure; Moisture content; Molecular dynamics (MD)","Anthracite; Coal deposits; Gas adsorption; Macromolecules; Methane; Moisture; Moisture determination; Molecular dynamics; Molecular structure; Monte Carlo methods; Pore size; Pore structure; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption potential; Grand canonical Monte carlo; Microscopic analysis; Molecular dynamics simulations; Molecular simulations; Multilayer adsorption; Reservoir temperatures; Nanopores; adsorption; anthracite; canonical analysis; coalbed methane; moisture content; molecular analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; porosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078975721

Over the past several decades, regulations on these facility emissions have become more stringent and have therefore caused industry to look toward new pre- and post-combustion control technologies. In more recent years, there has been a “push” toward renewable and cleaner burning alternative fuels as replacements for traditional fossil fuels. Part of this “push” has been accomplished by States and Regions offering incentives and options for renewable portfolios, which over half of the states now have in some form. The current study investigates the potential changes in both gaseous and particulate emissions from the use of a variety of woody biomass materials as a drop-in replacement for coal as compared to use of 100% bituminous coal. Four different biomass materials are blended individually with coal at 20% and 40% by mass for testing on the U.S. EPA's Multi-Pollutant Control Research Facility, a pilot-scale coal-fired facility located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Emissions are calculated based on measurements from the flue gas to characterize gaseous species (CO, CO2, NOX, SO2, other acid gases, and several organic hazardous air pollutants) as well as fine and ultrafine particulate (mass, size distribution, number count, elemental carbon, organic carbon, and black carbon) and compared among each combination of fuels and 100% bituminous coal. © 2019","Coal combustion; Emissions characterization; Woody biomass","Alternative fuels; Biomass; Bituminous coal; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Biomass materials; Combustion of coal; Elemental carbon; Hazardous air pollutants; Multi-pollutant control; Research facilities; United States environmental protection agency; Woody biomass; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076275803

Yet, there is clearly a need for integration of policy adoption literature since there is not a comprehensive synthesis currently available, and the average effect of any associations between local conditions and different policy formulations is unknown. The objective of this study is to present such a synthesis of frequently quantified associations described in the body of empirical research on climate policy adoption. We use average elasticities (i.e., the ratio of the percentage change in the dependent variable associated with the percentage change in an independent variable) to explore the magnitude of associations between various characteristics of local environments and the adoption of climate policies in US cities. Elasticities are best “estimates” as currently possible and should be refined as more individual studies become available. This study finds that public support for climate policy has the largest positive impact on policy adoption. Differences in policy benefits (e.g., local versus global) and approach (e.g., mitigation versus adaptation) should be distinguished when encouraging local governments to confront climate change.

This can help identify the attitudes and practical action of Chinese local governments and enterprises towards carbon dioxide emission reduction, and find out the important factors that influence their attitudes towards carbon dioxide emission reduction. The results show that an overwhelming majority of local governments have a greater influence on carbon dioxide emission intensity reduction than enterprises do, with the reduction being driven by the local government, and enterprises generally facing the resulting pressure.

Our study aimed to investigate the effects of several major air pollutants on HFMD in the warm and cold seasons in central China. A Poisson Generalized additive model (GAM) was used to assess the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and the incidence of HFMD at Wuhan, China during 20152016. Daily cases of HFMD were extracted from the infectious disease surveillance systems of Hubei provincial center for disease control and prevention (Hubei CDC). Data on air pollution, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 μm (PM10), and PM with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) were obtained from 10 national air quality monitoring stations in Wuhan. We found that the association between air pollution and HFMD was most pronounced at lag days 10 and 11. The results of the single-pollutant model show that the associations of SO2, NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 with HFMD were all statistically significant. The results of the multi-pollutant model showed that NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 are reduced after excluding the confounding of co-pollutants. The seasonal analysis showed that the effect of air pollution in the cold season was higher than in the warm season.

Aerobic methane oxidation, carried out by methane-oxidizing bacteria, is a key process regulating methane emission. And ammonium is believed to greatly influence aerobic methane oxidation activity. To date, disagreement exists in the threshold of ammonium effect. Moreover, knowledge about how aerobic methanotrophic community composition and functional gene transcription respond to ammonium is still lacking. In the present study, microcosms with freshwater lake sediment were constructed to explore the effect of ammonium level on aerobic methanotrophs. Methane oxidation potential, and the density, diversity and composition of pmoA gene and its transcripts were examined during 2-week incubation. A negative impact of ammonium on aerobic methane oxidation potential and a positive impact on pmoA gene density were observed only at a very high level of ammonium. However, pmoA gene transcription increased notably at all ammonium levels. The composition of functional pmoA gene and transcripts were also influenced by ammonium. But a great shift was only observed in pmoA transcripts at the highest ammonium level. © Copyright © 2020 Yang, Tong, Chen, Liu and Xie.","ammonium; freshwater lake; methane oxidation; methanotroph; pmoA gene; pmoA transcripts","Aerobic bacteria; Greenhouse gases; Oxidation; Transcription; Water; Community composition; Freshwater sediment; Gene transcriptions; Lacustrine ecosystems; Methane emissions; Methane oxidation; Methane oxidation activity; Methane oxidizing bacterium; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083485964

We conducted three experiments of different field scales, including small-plots, multi-location trial, and large-scale field samplings of rice grown in a major production region of southern China, to investigate whether liming could sustainably limit the Cd phytoavailability to rice. Forty-eight physical, chemical, and biological attributes associated with paired soils and plants were collectively analyzed. Rice Cd uptake was significantly reduced when moderate dosage (2.25–3 t ha− 1) of liming was present in the soils. The limes decreased rice Cd uptake by reducing the Cd concentrations of soil solution phase and regulating Ca2+ and Cd2+ competitions for absorption sites at root surfaces. Soil Zn hardly any effect on rice Cd uptake. Rice Cd uptake was suppressed at the higher rates of liming (4.5–9 t ha− 1) due to the heavy loss of soil labile Mn. The tendencies of over compensating were soil-, plant-, and climate-dependent and were estimated by a transfer function and the risks were characterized using probabilistic analysis.

Aerosol concentrations have been declining since the 1980s in Europe, mainly owing to a reduction of local aerosol and precursor emissions. Emissions from other source regions of the world, which have been changing rapidly as well, may also perturb the historical and future trends of aerosols and change their radiative impact in Europe. This study examines trends of aerosols in Europe during 1980-2018 and quantifies contributions from 16 source regions using the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 with Explicit Aerosol Source Tagging (CAM5-EAST). The simulated near-surface total mass concentration of sulfate, black carbon, and primary organic carbon had a 62 % decrease during 1980-2018. The majority of which was contributed to reductions of local emissions in Europe, and 8 %-9 % was induced by a decrease in emissions from Russia-Belarus-Ukraine. With the decreases in the fractional contribution of local emissions, aerosols transported from other source regions are increasingly important for air quality in Europe. During 1980-2018, the decrease in sulfate loading led to a warming effect of 2.0 W m-2 in Europe, with 12 % coming from changes in non-European sources, especially from North America and Russia-Belarus-Ukraine. According to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, contributions to the sulfate radiative forcing over Europe from both local European emissions and non-European emissions should decrease at a comparable rate in the next 3 decades, suggesting that future changes in non-European emissions are as important as European emissions for causing possible regional climate change associated with aerosols in Europe. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric modeling; concentration (composition); emission inventory; radiative forcing; source apportionment; spatial distribution; trend analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081261338

However, little attention has been paid to reducing the residential CO2 emissions of China's less developed or undeveloped regions. Taking Jiangxi as a case study, this paper thus aims at fully analyzing the difference of the residential energy-related CO2 emissions between urban and rural regions based on the Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) and Tapio decoupling model. The main results are showed as follows: (1) Since 2008, residential energy-related CO2 emissions have increased rapidly in both urban and rural Jiangxi. From 2000 to 2017, the residential energy-related CO2 emissions per capita in rural regions rapidly increased and exceeded that in urban regions after 2015. Furthermore, the residential energy structures had become multiple in both urban and rural regions, but rural regions still had room to optimize its energy structure. (2) Over the study period, consumption expenditure per capita played the dominant role in increasing the residential energy-related CO2 emissions in both urban and rural regions, followed by energy demand and energy structure. Energy price had the most important effect on decreasing the urban and rural residential energy-related CO2 emissions, followed by the carbon emission coefficient. However, urbanization increased the urban residential energy-related CO2 emissions but decreased the CO2 emissions in rural regions. Population made marginal and the most stable contribution to increase the residential energy-related CO2 emissions both in urban and rural regions. (3) Overall, the decoupling status showed the weak decoupling (0.1) and expansive negative decoupling (1.21) in urban and rural regions, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.","Jiangxi province; Less developed regions; LMDI; Residential energy-related CO2 emissions; Tapio decoupling; Urban and rural regions","carbon emission; environmental economics; residential energy; rural area; spatiotemporal analysis; urban region; urbanization; China; Jiangxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082718695

The rise in the carbon footprint (CF) corresponding to increasing populations and energy consumption in national key towns has not been underestimated. This paper aims to explore the impact of local resident energy consumption on the degree of coordination between ecology and the economy. To achieve this objective, the carbon pressure index (CPI), carbon occupancy index (COI) and eco-economic coordination index (EECI) are constructed by applying the CF, carbon carrying capacity (CC) and carbon deficit (CD) of Caijiapo Town from 2012 to 2017. Furthermore, the relationship between the CF, economic growth and per capita disposable income is described based on the decoupling index (DI). The results reveal that, apart from a decline in 2014, the per capita CF of Caijiapo Town has increased, with an average annual growth rate of 16.80%. The CF of different energy sources shows that the CF of natural gas is much larger than those of raw coal, oil and electricity. The DI between GDP, the per capita disposable income of urban and rural residents and the resident energy CF first decreases and then increases. The DI between GDP, the per capita disposable income of urban residents and the resident energy CF is 1.09 and 1.72, and urban residents are the main contributors to the resident energy CF from 2015 to 2017. The CPI and COI show an upward trend, and the eco-economic coordination index (EECI) of Caijiapo Town undergoes a change from poor coordination (grade II) to worst coordination (grade I) from 2012 to 2017. Therefore, the following suggestions are proposed: the CC should be treated as a constraint, energy utilisation should be improved, residents’ consumption structure should be optimised, differentiated policies should be implemented for the energy consumption of urban and rural residents and a spatial planning system and operational mechanism should be established that combines multiple regulations into a single regulation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Caijiapo Town; Carbon footprint; Decoupling index; Eco-economic coordination index; National key towns; Western China","carbon footprint; carrying capacity; ecological economics; economic growth; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; index method; mitigation; modernization; planning system; residential energy; urbanization; Caijiamiao Basin; China; Gansu; carbon footprint; China; city; economic development; human; urbanization; Carbon Footprint; China; Cities; Economic Development; Humans; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077376298

However, the nature of high pressure rise rate prevents PPC from operating range extension and further practical use. This paper aims to optimize mixture preparation to achieve the benefits of PPC with the constraints of engine states through injection strategy during transient operation. A control-oriented model (COM) is developed based on double-Wiebe function to predict combustion process, where a new linear algorithm is proposed to identify the model parameters. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the predicted cylinder pressure is less than 2.58 bar and peak error is less than 5% against experimental measurements of steady states. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed and implemented in a PPC engine. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed controller manipulates injection events to optimize premixing period and fuel distribution towards more benefits of PPC concept. In the testing scenario, soot, NOx and pressure rise rate are regulated within 0.15 mg/m3, 400 ppm and 8 bar/deg, respectively. Consequently, cumulative soot and NOx emissions are reduced by 43.2% and 6.8% in the whole transient cycle. © 2020","Combustion optimization; Control-oriented model; Model predictive control; Partially premixed combustion","Combustion; Controllers; Engines; Mean square error; Nitrogen oxides; Predictive control systems; Soot; Combustion optimization; Combustion pro-cess; Control oriented models; Mixture preparations; Partially premixed combustion; Pressure rise rates; Root mean square errors; Transient operation; Model predictive control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078278078

Faced with major pollution issues, China is committed to vigorously promoting electric vehicles. China has made active efforts in subsidies, policies, charging facilities, business models, etc., so that the annual growth rate of electric vehicle sales has accelerated. State subsidies have greatly promoted the use of electric vehicles, but the government is gradually reducing subsidies. In the case of government subsidy decline or even zero subsidy, ""separation of vehicle and battery"" is considered to be a good mode for solving the development of private EVs. The battery of an electric vehicle does not form a whole with the chassis, but they could be physically separated, replacing the battery with one which is fully charged instead of charging by users themselves, substituting battery leases for battery purchases, called separation of vehicle and battery. However, a series of issues such as whether this mode is beneficial to consumers, whether it has competitive advantages for vehicle companies, and what difficulties exist need to be further studied. This paper firstly analyzes whether it is necessary to implement ""separation of vehicle and battery"" for private electric vehicles (SEPARATION) in China. Based on this, it sums up the attempts of two companies to implement SEPARATION and extracts the key factors involved in SEPARATION. Then, such key factors are analyzed, and the customer delivered value model of SEPARATION is established. Finally, this article discusses the predicament of SEPARATION and makes some recommendations for the implementation of SEPARATION in China. The innovations in this paper include: (1) Analyzing the issue of SEPARATION from the perspective of customer delivered value. (2) Proposing a customer delivered value model of SEPARATION for the first time. (3) Proposing a two-level battery replacement network in the SEPARATION mode. © 2020 by the authors.","Customer delivered value; Private electric vehicles; Separation of vehicle and battery","electric vehicle; emission control; equipment; government; growth rate; road transport; traffic emission; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082552672

Only consider the effects of the calculation method itself, the δ-4DDA reduces the negative shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) in the areas with a significant fraction of low cloud, while enhances the negative shortwave CRE in the areas with the large fraction of high cloud. For the longwave CRE, the δ-4DDA enhances the longwave CRE drastically in the regions with a significant fraction of the high cloud. The feedback of clouds results in more interesting results. The δ-4DDA produces more accurate shortwave CRE in the region over the land and ocean in the middle and high latitude areas. The longwave CRE simulated by δ-4DDA is better than that affected by δ-2DDA over the ground in Africa, South America, and Atlantic. The change of radiation scheme affects the simulation of other meteorological variables. The simulation of global humidity by δ-4DDA is improved obviously. The δ-4DDA simulates more accurate temperature in continents of the northern hemisphere and precipitation in North America, Africa, northern Indian Ocean and western Pacific.

Jiangsu Province on China's east coast is a major contributor to grain production and therefore the region's climate has particular relevance to research on the nation's food security. This study explores the link between spatiotemporal climate patterns and grain production, which include rice output, summer grain output, and average grain output of those two seasons, using temperature and rainfall data from a study area in southern Jiangsu Province. Meteorological data covering about 40 years (1976–2013) were collected from 13 meteorological stations around the study region. Grain output was acquired from the same year's statistical report from the local government. Based on the thin plate spline method, meteorological data and grain output were interpolated to the same geographic grid. Several statistical methods-regression analysis, moving average, Mann-Kendall, moving t-test, and wavelet analysis—were used to estimate the changing trends of metrological factors and grain output. The result showed that annual mean temperature, mean maximum temperature, and mean minimum temperature fluctuated and increased, and those changes were more abrupt in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with obvious periodic variation in three time scales: 25–32 years, 15–25 years, and 10–15 years. For abnormal annual rainfall, rainfall showed significant inter-annual difference in the region from 1976 to 2013. The results indicated that abrupt changes occurred from 1979 to 1980 and again from 2006 to 2007. Annual and seasonal rainfall also showed obvious periodic variation at the three time scales. The growth variation of average grain output increased with some fluctuation and was different in different periods. It gradually decreased from southeast to northwest, and had a very different spatial pattern. The annual mean temperature played an important role in agricultural production, but the annual rainfall had little effect on agriculture for annual and seasonal fluctuation from 1976 to 2013. Temperature indexes in spring, summer, and autumn had a significant effect on average rice output. For autumn grain output, temperature indexes also played an important role in summer and autumn. Moreover, correlation coefficients and p-values for temperature indexes and grain output were weak in summer, but also passed a significance test at the 95% confidence interval. The study helps understand the effect of climate change on grain production, and also provides a scientific foundation and theoretical support for formulating policy and measures on climatic adaptability for agricultural production in eastern China. © 2019 The Authors","Abrupt analysis; Climate change; Spatial interpolation; Trend analysis; Wavelet analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073742362

To date, only several studies have explored the contribution of N2O emission from aquaculture systems to global emission, but with large uncertainty. In this study, the spatiotemporal distribution of dissolved N2O concentrations along the water column within ponds, and the N2O fluxes over the whole annual cycle were determined in the shrimp ponds in the Min River Estuary, Southeast China. Our results showed that N2O concentrations did not differ among sampling depths, but varied significantly among sampling dates. The temporal variation of N2O concentration was significantly correlated with the concentrations of N-NH4 + and total dissolved nitrogen. The one year study found an annual mean N2O emission of 57.63 μg N2O m−2 h−1 that was equivalent to an annual emission of 504.9 mg N2O m−2 yr−1, demonstrating the aquaculture ponds as an important source of atmospheric N2O. The N2O fluxes during the non-aquaculture period were one to three orders larger than those in the aquaculture period, and accounted for approximately 97% of the annual total emissions from aquaculture ponds. Our results showed that the N2O emission during the non-aquaculture period should not be overlooked owing to its marked contribution to the annual N2O budget in mariculture ponds. Further studies on N2O production dynamics including the abundance and activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in coastal aquaculture ponds are needed to improve our understanding of N2O biogeochemical cycle and facilitate strategies to reduce N2O emission. © 2020","Annual emissions; Mariculture ponds; Nitrous oxide; Non-aquaculture period; Subtropical estuary","Aquaculture; Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Denitrification; Global warming; Lakes; Marine biology; Nitrogen oxides; Ponds; Atmospheric greenhouse; Biogeochemical cycle; Denitrifying bacteria; Global warming potential; Nitrous oxide; Non-aquaculture period; Spatiotemporal distributions; Sub-tropical estuary; Greenhouse gases; aquaculture industry; estuarine ecosystem; mariculture; nitrous oxide; pond culture; subtropical region; Decapoda (Crustacea)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077808786

Based on the model results, we forecast future residents’ urban transport CO2 emissions under several scenarios of different urban and transport policies and new energy technologies. We find nonlinear quadratic growth relationship between commuting CO2 emissions and per capita GDP, and the elasticities of household and individual commuting CO2 emission to per capita GDP are 1.90% and 1.45%, respectively. Developing job-housing balanced satellite cities and self-contained polycentric city can greatly decrease emissions from high emitters and can contribute to about 51–82% of the emission reductions by 2050 compared with the scenario of business as usual (BAU). Promotion of electric vehicles, electric public buses, metros, and improvement of traditional energy efficiency contributes to about 48–57% of the emission reductions by 2050 compared with the BAU. When these policies and technologies are combined, about 90% of the emissions could be reduced by 2050 compared with the BAU, and the emissions will be about 1.2–4.9 times of the present. The findings suggest that fostering polycentric urban form and job-housing balanced satellite cities is the key step for future transport CO2 emission reductions.

Materials and methods: The soil was collected from a typical farmer’s field in Quzhou, Hebei province, China, classified as calcareous Cambisols (FAO classification system) and characterized with high pH (7.72), low organic C (9.1 g kg−1), and a strong ammonia oxidation potential. Two microcosm incubations were conducted in laboratory under 20 °C and 70% WFPS (water-filled pore space), and the soils were amended with different glucose rates (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 mg C kg−1) in Exp I, and with different C sources (glucose, pectin, starch, cellulose, lignin, straw) in Exp II, meanwhile with NH4 + or NO3 −-based fertilizer addition. 480 g (equivalent to oven-dried weight) of pre-incubated soil was placed in a glass jar (1165 mL volume) and adjusted to a field bulk density of 1.34 g cm−3 . All the glass jars were placed randomly and incubated for 15 days under aerobic condition. Results and discussion: Alone application of NH4 + released more N2O (peak at 16.27 μg N kg−1) than alone NO3 − application. However, combined application of glucose with NO3 − could emit more N2O than when combined with NH4 +, and the highest N2O peak value was found in 0.5 g kg−1of glucose. When pectin is combined with NH4 +, resulted in higher accumulated N2O emissions than other C sources, while applying straw and cellulose had negligible effects on N2O emissions but enhanced CO2 emissions under the incubation conditions. Glucose and pectin were identified as two labile C sources, significantly enhanced N2O emissions. As expected, C addition could stimulate mineral N immobilization. Conclusions: Combined application of C and N enhanced N2O and CO2 emissions albeit to different extents. A higher accumulated N2O emission was found when C/N ratio was lower (12.5). The stimulating effect of glucose and pectin as labile C sources with N addition on N2O production should be considered, especially in soils with high pH, low organic C, and a strong ammonia oxidation potential. Therefore, it may have the potential to mitigate N2O emissions from the field when avoiding applying both N and C especially rich in glucose and pectin together. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ammonium; C/N ratio; Carbon rate and type; Nitrate; Nitrous oxide emission","ammonium; carbon; carbon emission; nitrate; nitrous oxide; oxidation; soil emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076206870

The average mass concentration ratio of NO3 − to SO4 2− was 1.9 ± 0.8 throughout the entire observation period, which initially increased and then decreased with the increased pollution level. The average ratio of the molar equivalent concentration of [NH4 +] to that of [NO3 − + SO4 2−] was 1.14 ± 0.27, which decreased with the increased pollution level. Homogeneous reactions played an important role in the formation of nitrate, while, the heterogeneous reactions were important in the formation of sulfate. Both of the values of sulfur oxidation ratios (SOR) and nitrogen oxidation ratios increased with relative high humidity (RH) condition; especially, the SOR values sharply increased when the RH was above 50%. The results of potential source contribution function model demonstrated that the western and northeastern regions of Zhengzhou had a greater influence on PM2.5 pollution in Zhengzhou. All these results suggested that reducing the emission of precursors of secondary inorganic ions was highly important in controlling PM2.5 pollution in Zhengzhou. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Nitrate; PM2.5; Potential source contribution function; Secondary formation; Sulfate","Atmospheric humidity; Ions; Molar ratio; Nitrates; Pollution; Sulfur compounds; Mean and standard deviations; PM2.5; Potential source contribution function; Potential source contribution function models; Secondary formation; Sulfate; Time resolved measurement; Water soluble inorganic ions; Molar concentration; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); formation mechanism; ionic composition; nitrate; oxidation; particulate matter; point source; sulfate; winter; China; Henan; Zhengzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074051400

Previous study indicated that South Asian anthropogenic emissions primarily contributed to atmospheric loading of BC over the TP, it is essential to further identify the major sector in South Asia and provide guidance for potential mitigation strategies. In this study, the regional atmospheric chemistry model WRF-Chem was run for an entire year. The results suggested that residential BC emissions from South Asia contributed the largest (25.8% in summer and 44.8% in winter) to BC concentrations over the TP compared to other anthropogenic emission sectors in the region. Furthermore, significant seasonal variability existed in the transport process of residential BC from South Asia to the TP. The South Asia monsoon during summer and the mountain-valley wind system during spring could transport South Asian residential BC across the Himalayas to the TP. However, the higher transportation flux along 30°N indicated that the transport was mainly influenced by westerly winds, implying that residential emissions from northern India were the critical source of BC aerosols over the TP. A further assessment of emission control strategies suggested that reducing emissions from South Asian residential sources can effectively reduce BC concentrations over the TP, which may potentially alleviate the TP's accelerating glacier melting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; Contribution; Residential emissions; South Asia; Tibetan plateau","Atmospheric movements; Carbon; Emission control; Housing; Landforms; Particulate emissions; Black carbon; Contribution; Residential emissions; South Asia; Tibetan Plateau; Atmospheric chemistry; black carbon; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; black carbon; concentration (composition); domestic waste; seasonal variation; source apportionment; weather forecasting; aerosol; air pollution; air pollution control; airflow; Article; concentration (parameter); deglaciation; India; monsoon climate; pollution transport; priority journal; residential area; seasonal variation; South Asia; spring; summer; Tibet; winter; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076976426

Compared to Zn sites synthesized by the solution-phase method, VPI samples revealed approximately 2.8 % internal strain. Faradaic efficiency towards conversion of CO2 to CO was enhanced by up to a factor of four, and the initial potential was positively shifted by 200–300 mV. Using element-specific X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the local coordination environment of the Zn center was determined to have square-pyramidal geometry with four Zn−N bonds in the equatorial plane and one Zn-OH2 bond in the axial plane. The fine-tuned internal strain was further supported by monitoring changes in XRD and UV/Visible absorption spectra across a range of infiltration cycles. The ability to use internal strain to increase catalytic activity of MOFs suggests that applying this strategy will enhance intrinsic catalytic capabilities of a variety of porous materials. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Especially salt marshes of the East China Sea coast covered by invasive Spartina alterniflora have shown controversial results. To analyse seasonal patterns of N2O fluxes and their relationship with environmental factors, three plots dominated by S. alterniflora, and differing in sediment salinity and vegetation history (P1, P2, P3), and one bare mudflat (P0) in a salt marsh of Nanhui shore in the southern fringe of Yangtze River estuary have been established. Monthly studies from March 2017 to January 2018 using a chamber technique showed that average N2O fluxes from all four plots ranged from −41.9 to 39.3 μg N2O·m−2·h−1, whereas average flux (4.2 μgN2O·m−2·h−1) in P1, P2 and P3 was not significantly different from that measured in P0 (1.3 μgN2O·m−2·h−1). There was a clear seasonal difference: in spring and summer, all the sites showed slight emission while consumption prevailed in autumn and winter. In vegetated sites this trend was more remarkable than in the bare mudflat. N2O flux showed positive correlation (p &lt; .05) with air and sediment temperature, and plant development (height of vegetation). Nitrate was not the limiting factor of N2O emission in the Yangtze estuary. In the salt marsh where vegetation community was mature, higher sediment salinity reduced N2O emission (P1 &lt; P2) by influencing other environmental factors such as total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) content and sediment texture. In comparison with other tidal macrophytes S. alterniflora showed relatively low N2O emission. Therefore, it can be considered as a species for tidal zone stabilisation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia nitrogen; Atlantic cordgrass; Denitrification; Nitrate nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; Tidal salt marsh","Ammonia; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Sediments; Textures; Vegetation; Ammonia nitrogen; Atlantic cordgrass; Nitrate nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; Salt marshes; Wetlands; denitrification; environmental factor; greenhouse gas; limiting factor; mudflat; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; saltmarsh; seagrass; spatial variation; vegetation history; China; East China Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yangtze River; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080986462

This study proposed a strategy to boost the CH4 production by adding granular activated carbon (GAC)-MnO2 nanocomposites into an anaerobic methanogenic system. The associated mechanisms and the microbial community structure during anaerobic digestion were investigated systematically. Compared with a control with GAC only, after adding GAC-MnO2 composite the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency and CH4 yield were increased by 77% and 36%, respectively. The addition of GAC-MnO2 stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), while the secretion of humic substances was inhibited. The spatial distribution of EPS in the anaerobic sludge affects the extracellular electron transfer efficiency as well. Manganese ions concentrated in the EPS layer facilitated the electron flow and, thus, accelerated the extracellular electron transfer. The enhancement of anaerobic methanogenesis can be mainly attributed to the reduction/oxidation cycle of Mn4+/Mn2+. Electron transfer system activity and Cytochrome C content reached up to 341 and 38 nmol/L, respectively, under optimal conditions. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis indicated that Spirochaetaceae, Cloacibacterium, and Treponema were the dominant bacteria. The abundance of the methanogenic archaea Methanobacterium and Methanosaeta were increased with the addition of GAC-MnO2. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CH4 production; Extracellular electron transfer; Extracellular polymeric substances; GAC-MnO2 catalyst; Syntrophic methanogenesis","Activated carbon; Catalysts; Chemical oxygen demand; Conductive materials; Efficiency; Electron transitions; Manganese oxide; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Microorganisms; Polymers; RNA; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Chemical oxygen demand removals; Extra-cellular polymeric substances; Extracellular electron transfer; Granular activated carbons; Metal oxide nanoparticles; Methanogenesis; Microbial community structures; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074437216

This study verifies the rationality of the element design of China's Emissions Trading System pilot from the perspective of environmental effects. The results indicate that the China's Emissions Trading System pilot does have a significant ‘reduction effect’ on haze pollution concentration level, which is probably achieved by ‘boosting the application and transformation of green technologies among enterprises’ and ‘transferring heavily polluted industries’. Moreover, the total quota allocation, total number of incorporated enterprises and the entry of institutional and individual investors were not the significant influencing factors for reducing haze pollution, while the transaction volume of China Certified Emission Reduction and the total penalty amounts incurred play significant roles. The heterogeneity test shows that only Guangdong province's policy has a significantly negative effect on haze pollution concentration. This study provides a new way of thinking for the coordinated governance mode by combining environmental governance and carbon trading scheme. The experiential evidence strongly supports the establishment and improvement of China's Emissions Trading System pilots and the implementation of a unified national carbon market. © 2020","China'S emissions trading system pilots; Collaborative governance; Difference-in-differences (DID) method; Haze pollution","Air pollution; Carbon; Certified emission reductions; Collaborative governances; Difference-in-differences; Emissions trading system; Environmental governances; Guangdong Province; Haze pollutions; Reduction effects; Emission control; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; emissions trading; governance approach; haze; panel data; policy implementation; pollution tax; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078219487

The lake of reliable emission inventories for primary WSIs from RCC in China with measured emission factors (EFs) adopted is a major obstacle. With simulating burning test and dilution sampling method, this study detected the emission factors of nine size-segregated aerosols (0.43–10 μm) and associated WSIs emission factors from residential honeycomb briquettes and chunk coal burning, considering smoldering and flaming combustion status. Then a 1 km × 1 km grid cell-based emission inventory of RCC, including size-segregated particles and associated WSIs in China was established. The contributions of RCC to ambient fine particles were estimated by GEOS-Chem model. Results indicated that compared with anthracite coal combustion emission, bituminous coal burning emission can reduce the EFs of particles, while may increase the EFs of WSIs. The averaged EF of WSIs from honeycomb coal combustion was found 1.15 times higher than those for chunk coal burning. The total emission amounts of NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl−, NO3− and SO42− in PM2.1 from residential coal combustion in 2015 were 1915.3, 101.8, 1180.8, 50.1, 96.8, 4956.1, 552.4 and 7430.3 t, respectively, totally accounting for 2.03% of PM2.1. SO42− was the most important WSIs in fine particles released from RCC, occupied by 45.6% of the total WSIs. GEOS-Chem simulation indicated that RCC emission in China averagely accounted for 25.7% of ambient PM2.5 and 7.1% for sulfate. Our results show that RCC emission is an important source for primary PM2.5 and sulfate, suggesting the primary emission of WSI should be included in air quality modeling. More EFs monitoring of RCC of different types and regions in China should be conducted, for updating emission inventory and optimizing modeling results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality modeling; Emission factor; Emission inventory; Particle size; Residential coal combustion; Water soluble ions","Aerosols; Air quality; Anthracite; Bituminous coal; Briquets; Honeycomb structures; Housing; Ions; Particle size; Sulfur compounds; Uncertainty analysis; Air quality modeling; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Residential coal combustions; Water-soluble ions; Coal combustion; calcium ion; carbon monoxide; carbonic acid; charcoal; chloride; coal; ion; nitrogen oxide; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; unclassified drug; water soluble ion; air quality; anthracite; atmospheric pollution; bituminous coal; coal combustion; dilution; emission inventory; particle size; solubility; aerosol; air quality; Article; burn; China; climate change; combustion; comparative study; computer simulation; controlled study; dilution; exhaust gas; grid cell; human; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; residential area; residential coal combustion; sampling; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079897277

Although studies have shown that regionally disaggregated model and model that distinguishes processing exports at the national level are necessary to estimate the embodied emissions in China's exports, no study evaluates this issue by simultaneously taking both regional and trade heterogeneity into account. To fill this gap, we re-estimate the CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports at both regional and industrial level, by using the newly-developed inter-regional input-output (IRIOP) model that distinguishes processing trade from other trade at the regional level. Results show that compared to the IRIOP model, the traditional multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model has overestimated the environmental loss from exports by 14%–25% in 2002 and 7%–20% in 2012 for different regions. The largest bias is found in regions and industries with the highest processing export shares. Therefore, the IRIOP model gives more accurate accounting on the regional environmental loss due to national exports and thus is important for establishing effective emission mitigation policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bipartite inter-regional input-output table; Emissions embodied in exports; Environmental loss; Processing exports","Commerce; CO2 emissions; Embodied emissions; Emission mitigation; Input-output; Input-output table; National level; Regional levels; Industrial emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emissions trading; export; input-output analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076862739

This study aims to advise local governments about the danger of greenhouse gas emissions of waste management technologies. Three waste management scenarios were proposed and assessed based on greenhouse gas emissions and energy recovery for the city of Kocaeli, Turkey, for the reference years 2018–2028. The first scenario entailed recycling a fraction of materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metals and disposing of the remaining waste in a landfill with landfill gas recovery (current practice), while the second scenario included recycling of all the recyclable materials and producing compost from the remaining organic waste. The third scenario included incinerating all the waste to recover energy. The analysis indicated that, scenarios 1, 2 and 3 saved total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of 275,449 tCO2 e y−1, 287,868 tCO2 e y−1, and 652,626 tCO2 e y−1, respectively. Global warming factors (GWF) for scenarios 1, 2 and 3 were calculated as −1.760, −0.972, −0.940 tCO2 e t−1 waste, respectively. As a separate process, the materials recovery facility in scenario 1 had the lowest GWF (−1.486 tCO2 e t−1), whereas the highest GWF was from composting in scenario 2 (0.106 tCO2 e t−1). Also, the incineration plant would generate on average about 2.09 E+10 kWh y−1 energy, which could reduce coal use by 2.58 E+06 ton per year and natural gas use by 2.37 E+09 m3 per year. The analysis showed that thermal conversion and material recycling are the best options to reduce climate change impacts in the study area. This study will help the local authorities to consider greenhouse gas emissions and energy recovery potentials in the study region, as well as in other parts of Turkey, when long term waste management plans are considered. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Landfill gas; Material recovery facility; Municipal solid waste; Waste-to-Energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076235727

This method is applied to a case study involving all buildings and the adjacent pavements in Boston, MA. Results from the case study indicate that increasing pavement albedo reduces average temperature and usually reduces carbon emissions from BED for densely-built and medium-density neighborhoods while results from low-density neighborhoods were mixed. Model results suggest that increasing pavement albedo would lead to BED GHG benefits in 88% of Boston neighborhoods. Increasing the albedo of the 1100 miles of roads in those communities would yield nearly 91,720 metric tons of reduced carbon emissions over the next fifty years. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Building energy demand; Pavement albedo; Urban morphology","Atmospheric temperature; Carbon; Energy management; Greenhouse gases; Morphology; Pavements; Air temperature; Building energy demands; Carbon emissions; Computationally efficient; Greenhouse gas (GHG); High resolution; Integrated modeling; Urban morphology; Solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078731357

It is essential to establish efficient approaches for seeking reasonable and practical mitigation pathways. In this paper, a NOx mitigation simulation (NMS) model is developed to facilitate the development of mitigation policies. Through constructing the NOx metabolic network, all sectors are classified according to their interactions. With production-side and consumption-side mitigation strategies adopted for different categories respectively, the changes of sectoral and system-wide indirect emissions are accounted for under the framework of urban metabolism. The results of the case study for Guangdong Province, China, illustrate that the mitigation strategies aimed at the specific sectors of the economy might not be as practical as expected. Both the type of mitigation strategies and the sector category it interferes with have a decisive influence on reduction performance. In Guangdong Province, regulating electricity, heat power generation and smelting, pressing of metals can achieve substantial reduction performance through production-based ways, and supervising the sectors with weak control and strong dependence (e.g., Construction and Other social services) is the most effective measure on the consumption side. The comprehensive mitigation strategies made from production and consumption perspectives are capable of acquiring the most efficient reduction performance. Considering cities as an ecosystem, the mitigation simulation framework established in this study has the potential to assess and formulate reduction policies of NOx emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Mitigation simulations; NOx emissions; Sector classification; Urban metabolism","Acid rain; Air pollution; Global warming; Metabolism; Heat-power generation; Input output analysis; Mitigation simulations; NOx emissions; Production and consumption; Simulation framework; Substantial reduction; Urban metabolisms; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076569133

The results show that: population and development level factors have the effect of increasing emissions, industrial structure and energy structure factors have less impact, while energy consumption intensity, energy pollution intensity and end treatment factors have the obvious effect of reducing emissions. Combined with the current situation of development, it is suggested that Shenzhen should promote the upgrading of industrial structure and energy structure, promote the progress of production technology, and strengthen the end treatment.

To understand the photoelectrocatalytic mechanism, knowledge of the GaP surface atomic structure in contact with water under relevant electrochemical conditions is essential. However, there remains a debate about the oxidation state of GaP, i.e., whether oxide species are present at the surface. To address this issue, we use density functional theory to investigate the adsorption of oxide species on GaP(110), a stable and active facet for CO2 reduction. We predict that GaP(110) indeed could be oxidized at the standard reduction potential for CO2 to CH3OH. However, we find that unoxidized GaP(110) is stable under illumination, as it corresponds to a highly reducing condition induced by photoexcited electrons. We conclude that an oxidized GaP electrode is very likely unstable thermodynamically under photoelectrochemical conditions for CO2 reduction, and therefore, the relevant GaP/water interface for catalysis is indeed the unoxidized one.

The occurrence of emerging pollutants in high-altitude rivers will inevitably affect the dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes. In this study, sediment slurry experiments combined with15N tracer techniques were conducted to investigate the influence of pharmaceutical and personal care products (alone and in combination) on denitrification and the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process and the resulting N2O release in the sediments of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The results showed that the denitrification rates were inhibited by sulfamethoxazole (SMX) treatments (1–100 μg L−1) and the anammox rates decreased as the SMX concentrations increased, which may be due to the inhibitory effect of this antibiotic on nitrate reducing microbes. 2-Ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) impacted nitrogen transformation mainly though the inhibition of the anammox processes. SMX and EHMC showed a superposition effect on the denitrification processes. The expression levels of the denitrifying functional genes nirS and nosZ were decreased and N2O release was stimulated due to the presence of SMX and/or EHMC in the sediments. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the effects of EHMC and its mixtures on the dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes and N2O releases in river sediments.

In this study, the response of the PM2.5 concentration in the air to multiple factors reflecting the meteorological, underlying surface and socioeconomic conditions in the Yangtze River Delta region from 2001 to 2010 was investigated by Spearman correlation analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and lasso regression. In consideration of the characteristics of natural conditions and intensity of human activities in the Yangtze River Delta region, we designed six spatial scales to explore finely the effects of each factor on PM2.5 concentration. The results may provide decision support for the cross-regional air pollution risk identification. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) In different buffer zones, the dominant factors affecting the PM2.5 concentration are different. The buffer zones of 30, 40 and 50 km are the most effective areas for socioeconomic factors to affect the PM2.5 concentration. (2) The physical properties of underlying surfaces have significant effects on the PM2.5 concentration. Forestland can reduce PM2.5 concentrations in air to a certain extent, while land for construction has the opposite effect. (3) The influence of natural factors on the PM2.5 concentration in air is greater than that of socioeconomic factors in the Yangtze River Delta region, but the influence of socioeconomic factors on the PM2.5 concentration in buffer zones of 30, 40 and 50 km can not be ignored. The WS (the wind speed), PF (the proportion of forestland), PLC (the proportion of land for construction), P (the precipitation), NLI (the night light index), and PD (the population density) are the six main factors affecting the PM2.5 concentration in air. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Meteorological conditions; PM2.5; Socioeconomic conditions; The Yangtze River Delta; Underlying surface","Air pollution; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Factor analysis; Forestry; Multivariant analysis; Population statistics; Rivers; Wind; Meteorological condition; PM2.5; Socio-economic conditions; Underlying surface; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); meteorology; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; socioeconomic conditions; urban area; urban pollution; variance analysis; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074713782

However, spatially-dependent correlations between microbial community composition and geochemical zonation along groundwater flow paths are not fully understood, especially with respect to arsenic mobility. The western Hetao Basin was selected as the study area to address this limitation, where groundwater flows from a proximal fan (geochemical-group I: low As, oxidizing), through a transition area (geochemical-group II: moderate As, moderately-reducing) and then to a flat plain (geochemical-group III: high As, reducing). High-throughput Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the microbial community structure in the proximal fan included bacteria affiliated with organic carbon degradation and nitrate-reduction or even nitrate-dependant Fe(II)-oxidation, mainly resulting in As immobilization. In contrast, for the flat plain, high As groundwater contained Fe(III)- and As(V)-reducing bacteria, consistent with current models on As mobilization driven via reductive dissolution of Fe(III)/As(V) mineral assemblages. However, Spearman correlations between hydrogeochemical data and microbial community compositions indicated that ammonium as a possible electron donor induced reduction of Fe oxide minerals, suggesting a wider range of metabolic pathways (including ammonium oxidation coupled with Fe(III) reduction) driving As mobilization in high As groundwater systems. © 2020 The Authors","As mobilization; Feammox; Geochemical zonation; Groundwater microbial community; High As groundwater","Bacteria; Biodegradation; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Iron oxides; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Oxide minerals; Rare earths; RNA; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Biogeochemical process; Feammox; Geochemical zonation; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Microbial community structures; Reductive dissolution; Hydrochemistry; ammonia; arsenic; ground water; iron; nitrate; organic carbon; RNA 16S; ammonium derivative; arsenic; ferric ion; ground water; ammonium; arsenic; community composition; electron; groundwater flow; hydrogeochemistry; microbial community; mobilization; arsenic mobilization; arsenic poisoning; Article; China; controlled study; dissolution; gene sequence; geochemistry; hydrogeochemistry; microbial community; microbial diversity; nitrate reducer; nonhuman; organisms by electron donor; oxidation; priority journal; river basin; RNA gene; water flow; electron; microflora; sediment; water pollutant; China; Hetao Basin; Nei Monggol; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ammonium Compounds; Arsenic; Electrons; Ferric Compounds; Geologic Sediments; Groundwater; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078074838

Limited information is available on the spatiotemporal variation, sources, and health risks of VOCs in the coastal cities of Canada, where the population density is much higher than inland areas. In this study, we investigated ambient VOCs levels, their potential sources and associated health risks in two coastal cities in Metro Vancouver during 2012–2016. Levels of the total measured VOCs were relatively higher in an industrial region in Port Moody (56.7 μg/m3) than an urban area of Burnaby south (38.0 μg/m3). A clear seasonality was observed for VOCs species with significantly higher levels in winter than in summer except for isoprene. Alkanes were the most dominant compounds at both sites accounting for up to 59.4% of the total measured VOCs, followed by halocarbons, aromatics, and alkenes. Industrial-related emissions (30.5%) and traffic-related emissions (35.8%) were the major sources contributing to ambient VOCs in Port Moody and Burnaby south, respectively, as calculated by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. A hybrid health risk assessment strategy using deterministic and stochastic approaches revealed that non-cancer risks of ambient VOCs exposure were all below the safe level of 1 at both cities, while the cumulative cancer risks of toxic VOCs exposure in Port Moody (9.2 × 10−5) and Burnaby south (7.6 × 10−5) were significantly higher than the provincial acceptable risk level (1.0 × 10−5). Surprisingly, the probabilities for cumulative cancer risks of VOCs exceeding the US EPA tolerable risk level (1.0 × 10−4) were 33.7% and 18.6% in Port Moody and Burnaby south, respectively. From a risk management perspective, greater emphasis on the reduction of emissions of carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene is highly recommended in both cities of Metro Vancouver. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer risk; Health risk assessment; Metro Vancouver; Source apportionment; VOCs","Diseases; Factorization; Health risks; Hydrocarbons; Industrial emissions; Population statistics; Risk management; Stochastic systems; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric photochemistry; Cancer risk; Metro Vancouver; Positive matrix factorization models; Reduction of emissions; Source apportionment; Spatio-temporal variation; Traffic-related emissions; Risk assessment; 1,3 butadiene; alkene; benzene; carbon tetrachloride; halocarbon; isoprene; volatile organic compound; volatile organic compound; ambient air; cancer; coastal zone; health risk; risk assessment; source apportionment; spatial variation; temporal variation; volatile organic compound; ambient air; Article; Canada; cancer risk; geographic distribution; health hazard; industrial area; outcome assessment; photochemistry; population risk; priority journal; risk assessment; risk management; seashore; seasonal variation; stochastic model; summer; urban area; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; risk assessment; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia]; Air Pollutants; Canada; China; Environmental Monitoring; Risk Assessment; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076852811

However, the volatility of renewable energy output affects the stable operation of microgrid. In order to ensure the reliability of power supply and improve the economy and environmental protection, this paper studied the short-term economic-environmental (EED) problem of the microgrid. Based on the dispatching model, this paper introduced the differential evolution (DE) into quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and used the improved QPSO to solve problem. Through Friedman test, the performance is compared. The results show that: First, renewable energy should be preferred for generation, micro gas turbine take priority to meet thermal load, fuel cell, and storage battery are used for power supplement and power transaction. This plan can optimize the units output and reduce the emission of pollution gas on the premise of satisfying the regular operation of the microgrid. Second, in the later stage of improved QPSO, the ability to jump out of local optimal solution is stronger. Then, the improved QPSO can obtain better results.

Improving the efficiency of electricity use is an effective method to reduce the consumption of electricity, but the rebound effect (RE) also emerges. Is it still conducive to saving electricity? In response to this question, this article selects the relevant data in China during 2010–2016 to construct the panel linear model and the panel threshold model respectively to analyze the direct RE of residential electricity consumption. The results show that: (1) The average RE of China's residential electricity use is 84.94%. It indicates that energy efficiency improvement can lower residents’ electricity use, but only 15.06% of the expected target can be achieved. (2) The direct RE in high-income regime (PGDP>76023.67) and low-income regime (PGDP≤76023.67) is 59.15% and 80.79% respectively, meaning that energy efficiency measures in the high-income regime are more effective. (3) The direct RE in the high-population regime (POP>6083.28) and low-population regime (POP≤6083.68) is 120.09% and 83.91% respectively, indicating that energy efficiency improvement in the high-population regime has intensified residents’ electricity consumption. Therefore, to maximum energy saving effect, the government should take the inter-provincial heterogeneity of the RE into consideration and introduce market-oriented measures such as price and tax to restrain it. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Direct rebound effect; Energy efficiency; Panel threshold model; Residential electricity consumption","Economic analysis; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Housing; Consumption structure; Electricity-consumption; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Energy efficiency improvements; Rebound effect; Residential electricity; Residential electricity consumption; Threshold model; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077893664

However, these electric vehicles tend to have lower energy efficiency and higher purchase and operation costs. Vehicle with larger batteries can also be less equitable because the subsidies are often provided to more expensive vehicles and wealthier owners. This study takes advantage of a novel dataset of daily driving data from 39,854 conventional gasoline vehicles in Beijing and 4999 PHEVs in Shanghai to determine the optimal range of BEVs and PHEVs within their respective cities. We simulate a model to explore ranges with which PEVs emit less GHGs than that of a baseline hybrid and conventional gasoline vehicle while ensuring that all daily travel demands are met. Our findings indicate that in both cities, the optimal ranges to balance cost and travel demand for BEVs are 350 km or less and for PHEVs are 60 km or less in Beijing and 80 km or less in Shanghai. We also find that to minimize carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the ranges are even lower 10 km in Beijing and 30 km in Shanghai. Our study suggests that instead of encouraging long-range PEVs, governments should subsidize PEV models with shorter ranges. Parallel efforts should also be made to both increase renewable energy over fossil fuels and expand charging facilities. Although individual mobility demand varies, the government could reduce occasional long-distance driving by subsidizing alternative transportation choices. Providing week-long driving trials to consumers before their purchases may help decrease the demand of very long range PEVs by alleviating the range anxiety through a learning process. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon emission reduction; China’s national subsidy policy; Optimal range; Plug-in electric vehicles; Travel demand","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy storage; fuel consumption; optimization; state role; subsidy system; Beijing [China]; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079787111

The results show that an emission reduction benefit of 70.82% could be achieved under Scenario 5 in which kitchen waste and recyclables are sorted and recycled and the residue is incinerated, and the selection of the optimal strategy was not affected by changes in the separation rate. In addition, landfill would emit more GHG than incineration and composting. The results of this study are helpful for the government to make a decision on MSW management considering the goal of GHG emission reduction. © 2020 by the authors.","Emissions calculation; GHG emissions; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Optimal strategy; Source separation; Waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081946867

Using ground-based measurements from the literature, this study investigated the yearly time series of PM2.5 and its chemical composition over Beijing from 1999 to 2016 to identify the driving forces underlying these changes. The PM2.5 concentration declined slightly, due to the organic carbon, elemental carbon, and dust rather than to either sulfate–nitrate–ammonium (SNA) aerosols. Before 2013, the trend of SNA aerosols was opposite to that of PM2.5; however, subsequently, SNA aerosols have represented the major contribution to the reduction of PM2.5, coinciding with a large decline of regional precursor gases. The yearly time series of SNA aerosols can be explained better by regional precursor gases than by local ones. Generally, precursor gases emissions over the region of North China Plain can be controlled if Beijing’s air quality is to be improved. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beijing; Haze; Long-term trend; PM2.5; SNA","aerosol; air quality; ammonium; chemical composition; ground-based measurement; haze; long-term change; nitrate; particulate matter; sulfate; trend analysis; Beijing [China]; China; North China Plain; ammonium derivative; sulfate; thiol derivative; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; China; particulate matter; season; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ammonium Compounds; Beijing; China; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Sulfates; Sulfhydryl Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077266391

The identification of the impact of FDI on CO2 emissions plays a prominent role in utilizing FDI to propel cleaner production and reduce pollutant emissions. Numerous studies have been devoted to clarifying the direct impact of FDI on CO2 emissions. However, little work has focused on the spillover effect of FDI on CO2 emissions through economic growth. To address this gap in the literature, this paper introduces an extension of the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model with nonlinear and dynamic features to simultaneously investigate the direct and spillover influences at work in FDI inflows and CO2 discharges. The results manifest that FDI can directly result in an ascent in CO2 concentrations. In contrast, the results of spillover effect through economic growth suggest that FDI can decrease CO2 concentrations. With the increase in FDI inflows, the total effect of FDI on CO2 leakages is smoothly shifted from positive to negative, thereby corroborating the pollution haven and pollution halo hypotheses. Moreover, the connection between inward FDI and CO2 emissions exhibits two transition regimes, and the transition is realized when FDI reaches 24.340. The results of a nonlinear marginal analysis show that the influence of FDI on CO2 emissions has significant regional heterogeneity and reveals “W+V-shaped” temporal characteristics. The findings set out in this study provide new evidence for the evaluation of the pollution risk caused by FDI inflows and insights into the choice of a sustainable development path in emerging markets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Emerging markets; Foreign direct investment; PSTR model; Threshold effect","Commerce; Investments; Pollution control; Carbon emissions; Cleaner production; Emerging countries; Emerging markets; Foreign direct investments; Smooth transition regressions; Temporal characteristics; Threshold effect; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075818749

In Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the surrounding areas (denoted as BTH&amp;SA), although recently the particulate matter pollution appeared to be under control due to stringent pollution mitigation measures, ozone pollution rebounded rapidly, especially during summers. Thus, the exploration of strategies for efficiently lowering both ground-level ozone and PM2.5 concentrations is urgently needed. In this study, we target on the precursors contributing to both ozone and PM2.5 formation (i.e., NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) and adopt a Combined Empirical Kinetics Modeling Approach (CEKMA) to synthetically evaluate the cost-effective mitigation strategies for air quality control. We find that over the BTH&amp;SA region, the choice of mitigation strategy in the initial stage (e.g., within 20% reductions on NOx or VOCs emissions) is critical because NOx-focused strategies may exacerbate O3 pollution. In addition, equally reducing NOx and VOCs emissions may have the least benefit for air pollution improvement. From a long-term perspective, we suggest reducing VOCs emissions by ~60% and NOx emissions by ~20% in the first stage, thereby avoiding the potential increase in ambient O3. Then in the second stage, the remaining VOCs and NOx emissions should be phased out to reach a deep mitigation of PM2.5 and O3. With those steps, both PM2.5 and ozone can be mitigated efficiently over the BTH&amp;SA region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Co-mitigation; Empirical kinetics modeling; Mitigation pathway; Ozone; Particulate matter","Air quality; Cost effectiveness; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution control; Volatile organic compounds; Aerodynamic diameters; Empirical kinetics model; Long-term perspective; Mitigation pathway; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter pollution; PM2.5 concentration; Pollution mitigation; Quality control; ozone; volatile organic compound; aerodynamics; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); empirical analysis; haze; mitigation; nitrous oxide; ozone; particle size; particulate matter; reaction kinetics; strategic approach; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; air quality control; Article; atmosphere; China; haze; human; industrialization; kinetics; model; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; urbanization; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078732094

However, extant research primarily focuses on the design of carbon regulation under complete information, neither the feature of carbon regulation under asymmetric information nor the role of private information in the government-firm relationship has been explored. In this paper, we investigate the issue of government-firm contracting for CFR in the context of carbon-reducing information asymmetry. Two cases are considered: The single asymmetric information case where the firm's carbon-reducing effort is privately known to himself, and the dual asymmetric information case in which neither the firm's carbon-reducing capacity nor his effort is visible to the government. Carbon contracting model in each case is developed by mechanism design and game theory. To examine the effectiveness of these carbon contracts, the benchmark with complete information is further studied. Comparative statics and sensitive analysis show that the carbon contracts under information asymmetry can efficiently motivate the firm to reduce carbon footprint. In particular, under single asymmetric information, the government appropriately adjusts the optimal contractual configurations to maximize the expected welfare, leaving the firm to get the reservation profit. Under dual asymmetric information, the government's best choice is to offer a menu of carbon contracts which enables the firm to obtain extra information rent that is increasing in his carbon-reducing capacity. We explicitly identify conditions under which the screening mechanism works and reveal that the menu of carbon contracts not only induces the firm to reveal his true carbon-reducing capacity but also motivates him to make the best effort to reduce carbon footprint. Our findings provide the government with a theoretical basis regarding carbon regulation under information asymmetry, as well as help firms make appropriate selections when signing low-carbon contracts with the government. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint reduction; Carbon regulation; Government-firm contracting; Information asymmetry; Low-carbon economy","Emission control; Game theory; Machine design; Renewable energy resources; Carbon footprint reductions; Carbon regulations; Government-firm contracting; Information asymmetry; Low carbon economy; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077901813

CO2 arising from energy consumption during industrial processes makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions in China. It is the key for the Chinese government to achieve its goal of emission reduction in 2030 by identifying key industries with CO2 emissions and probing into their potential for EC&amp;ER. We used Xinjiang Province of China as a research area. Next, we proposed a method for identifying key industries with CO2 emissions in Xinjiang's industrial sector and analyzed their energy consumption and CO2 emission characteristics. Finally, the average energy efficiency index of national industries was used to explore the potential for EC&amp;ER of key industries. Results indicated that (1) the CO2 emissions in industrial sector were 463.35 million tons in 2016, making up 90.72% of its total CO2 emissions from energy consumption, considerably higher than the global and national averages; (2) In 2016, the 8 key industries with energy-related CO2 emissions determined in this study are all heavy industries whose energy consumption and CO2 emissions were 119.65 million tce (tons carbon equivalent) and 445.36 million tons respectively, taken up 62.51% and 87.2% of the total amount in Xinjiang. These 8 key industries play a critical role in realizing EC&amp;ER in Xinjiang; (3) In 2016, the eight key industries had the potential to save 74.65 million tce, accounted for 45.79% of the total EC. Their potential for ER were 272.07 million tons of CO2, equal to 53.27% of the total CO2 emissions.

However, it is not well understood whether the health benefit attributed to PM2.5 reductions has been similar across strata of socioeconomic deprivation (SED). Using mixed effect regression models, we estimated the PM2.5-related change in the CMR across 2,132 US counties in five SED strata between 1990 and 2010. The analysis included annual county CMR (deaths/100,000 person-year), annual county PM2.5 (μg/m3), and an index of county SED based on socioeconomic factors from the 1990 US Census. The contribution of PM2.5 reductions to decreased CMR varied by SED strata and over time. Yearly differences resulted from varying rates of PM2.5 reduction and because of the non-linear relationship between CMR and PM2.5 concentration. In early years, PM2.5-related CMR reductions were smallest in the most deprived counties compared to all other counties (range: 0.4–0.6 vs 0.7–1.6 fewer deaths/100,000 person-year), due to slower rates of PM2.5 reduction in these counties. However, in later years, PM2.5-related CMR reductions were highest counties with moderate to high deprivation, compared to counties with the least deprivation (range: 1.0–2.2 vs 0.5–0.9 fewer deaths/100,000 person-year) due to larger CMR reductions per decrease in PM2.5. We identified that CMR reductions related to air quality improvements have become more similar over time between socioeconomic strata. © 2019 The Authors","Air pollution; Cardiovascular; Mortality; Particulate matter; Socioeconomic status","Air pollution; Air quality; Particles (particulate matter); Regression analysis; Air quality improvement; Cardiovascular; Cardiovascular mortality; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Mortality; Non-linear relationships; Particulate Matter; Socio-economic status; Population statistics; air quality; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; census; health risk; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; socioeconomic status; adult; air pollution; air quality; article; cardiovascular mortality; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; social status; socioeconomics; air pollutant; cardiovascular disease; economics; environmental exposure; mortality; particulate matter; socioeconomics; toxicity; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076963145

These influences in turn will impose continuous impacts on forest production and carbon (C) storage potential. Forests in the subtropical China that are experiencing rapid regeneration and recovery may suffer multiple threats in the face of future climate change. Understanding how climate change may affect forest C sequestration and species dynamics over time will help formulate better management strategies for maintaining forest productivity and biodiversity. Here, we used a forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) to evaluate the long-term effects of current business-as-usual (BAU) management and climate projections (current, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 climate scenarios; IPCC representative concentration pathways [RCPs] scenarios) on above- and belowground forest C storage and tree species dynamics in the Sangzhi County in the subtropical China. Our simulations showed a fast-growing period of forest total C in the first 70 yr, regardless of climate regime. Moderate climate change (RCP4.5 climate scenario) increased soil organic carbon (SOC) (12%) and detrital C (16%) but reduced live C (5%), contributing to a slight augment of 3% in forest C storage compared to the control climate, while severe climate change (RCP8.5 climate scenario) decreased SOC (16%), detrital C (27%), and live C (12%), resulting in a dramatic reduction of 14% in forest C storage, primarily because severe warming-induced water stress restrained species establishment and regeneration in temperature-sensitive areas like the lower elevations. Meanwhile, nature reserves in the higher elevations could act as “safe islands” by providing suitable conditions for most tree species, but the logging ban caused higher canopy closure, which in turn inhibit the growth and establishment of shade-intolerant species. The results also highlighted the positive responses of native “warm species” to climate warming and suggest that using them to replace some conventional coniferous plantation tree species would better mitigate the future climate change. Poor performance of the current BAU management in maintaining forest productivity and diversity suggests that new climate-adapted management strategies should be designed accordingly. © 2020 The Authors.","aboveground biomass; climate warming; forest landscape model; forest management; LANDIS-II; soil organic carbon; species distribution; subtropical forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083792027

The mixed Cu group effectively reduced total ARGs abundance by 26.94%, suggesting mixed Cu salts did not promote the potential ARGs risk. The positive effects of mixed Cu salts on AD performance and ARGs removal might be ascribed to the low bioavailability. Microbial community analysis indicated the highest abundances of Clostridia_MBA03 and Methanobacterium in the mixed Cu group might cause the increased methane production.

And nearly thirty kinds of greenhouse gases have been found in the atmosphere, of which the carbon dioxide plays a crucial role. In this paper, the carbon dioxide emissions of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries are investigated by using a conformable fractional non-homogeneous grey model. The grey model is systematically studied based on the new definitions of the conformable fractional accumulation and difference. The closed-form solutions of the new model are derived by applying mathematical tools and grey theory. And the meta-heuristic algorithm ant lion optimizer is adopted to search optimal fractional order. With raw data during the period from 2000 to 2018 announced by British Petroleum, the new model is established to forecast the carbon dioxide emissions of BRICS nations from 2019 to 2025. The results show that the trend of the carbon dioxide emissions of Brazil and India is growing year by year, the pattern of Russia is fluctuant but remains stable generally, while China and South Africa reach its peak value in 2019, and then decrease in the next several years. It also demonstrates that the governments of Brazil and India should take more measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, while the governments of China and South Africa should keep up their crucial work on carbon dioxide emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ant lion optimizer; BRICS countries; Carbon dioxide emissions; CFNGM(1,1,k,c) model; Conformable fractional operator","Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; BRICS countries; Carbon dioxide emissions; Closed form solutions; Fractional operators; International community; Mathematical tools; Meta heuristic algorithm; Optimizers; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; forecasting method; numerical model; algorithm; Article; Brazil; carbon footprint; China; conformable fractional non homogeneous grey model; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; environmental planning; India; mathematical computing; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; prediction; priority journal; Russian Federation; South Africa; trend study; Brazil; China; India; Russian Federation; South Africa; Myrmeleontidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076632811

To identify the variation in VOCs emission sources, simultaneous VOCs measurements were conducted for one year at a suburban site (Xianlin Campus of Nanjing University (NJU)) in Nanjing, a highly polluted city of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in China. The annual average concentration of VOCs at NJU was observed to be 18.95 ± 14.95 ppbv, with alkanes, alkenes and aromatics contributing 67.5%, 13.6% and 18.9%, respectively, of the total mass concentration. The ratios for i-pentane/n-pentane and m,p-xylene/ethylbenzene showed that the ambient VOCs at NJU were affected by fuel evaporation and long-distance transport. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was applied for source apportionment of the VOCs, and seven factors were identified. Vehicle exhaust, evaporation, natural gas (NG) and aged air masses, combustion and synthetic industries, solvents and painting, petrochemical plants and mixed industrial sources were estimated to contribute 23.5%, 16.3%, 15.9%, 14.6%, 13.2%, 10.8% and 5.6%, respectively. The contribution from traffic emissions (i.e., vehicle exhaust) exceeded that suggested by a local emission inventory (9.7%). The concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) model revealed that the highly polluted air masses arriving at NJU originated in the industrial areas of northeastern Nanjing and the YRD. The contributions from petrochemical plants, solvents and painting, and aged air masses were found to be increased during O3 and PM2.5 pollution days in suburban areas, indicating the importance of reducing industrial emissions and jointly controlling VOCs on a regional scale. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Pollution episodes; Positive matrix factorization; Source apportionment; VOCs","Evaporation; Factorization; Gas plants; Hydrocarbons; Industrial emissions; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gasoline plants; Paraffins; Petrochemical plants; Petrochemicals; River pollution; Volatile organic compounds; Annual average concentration; Long-distance transport; On-line measurement; Pollution episodes; Positive Matrix Factorization; Positive matrix factorization models; Secondary organic aerosols; Source apportionment; Matrix algebra; aerosol; concentration (composition); emission inventory; measurement method; natural gas; pollutant source; source apportionment; suburban area; volatile organic compound; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080896081

Then the input-output looseness is used for exploring the reasons for the efficiency difference in different regions and their improvement direction. The results show that the efficiency in east is high and stable, and that in central and west is low.

Building on a literature that has sought to develop and apply methods for retrospective benefit-to-cost evaluation for federal research programs, this study provides a quantitative analysis of the economic social return on these historical wind energy research investments. Importantly, the study applies multiple innovative methods and varies important input parameters to test the sensitivity of the results. The analysis considers public wind research expenditures and U.S. wind power deployment over the period 1976–2017, while also accounting for the full useful lifetime of wind projects built over this period. Assessed benefits include energy cost savings and health benefits due to reductions in air pollution. Overall, this analysis demonstrates sizable, positive economic returns on past wind energy research. Under the core analysis and with a 3% real discount rate, the net benefits from historical federal wind energy research investments are found to equal $31.4 billion, leading to an 18 to 1 benefit-to-cost ratio and an internal rate of return of 15.4%. Avoided carbon dioxide emissions are not valued in monetary terms, but are estimated at 1510 million metric tons. Alternative methods and input assumptions yield benefit-to-cost ratios that fall within a relatively narrow range from 7-to-1 to 21-to-1, reinforcing in broad terms the general finding of a sizable positive return on investment. Unsurprisingly, results are sensitive to the chosen discount rate, with higher discount rates leading to lower benefit-to-cost ratios, and lower discount rates yielding higher benefit-to-cost ratios. © 2019 The Authors","Benefit-cost analysis; Learning curve; Levelized cost of energy; Research and development; U.S. Department of Energy; Wind power","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Earnings; Economic analysis; Global warming; Investments; Wind power; Benefit-cost analysis; Learning curves; Levelized costs; Research and development; U.S. Department of Energy; Cost benefit analysis; accountability; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; economic analysis; federal system; investment; quantitative analysis; research work; wind power; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077206402

It can explicitly distinguish between regional-background and local-urban air pollution, allowing for fully consistent downscaling schemes. The method can be implemented in existing Eulerian chemical transport models and can be used to distinguish the contribution of a large number of emission sources to air pollution in every receptor grid cell within one single model simulation and thus to provide detailed maps of the origin of the pollutants. Hence, it can be used for time-critical operational services by providing scientific information as input for local policy decisions on air pollution abatement. The main limitation in its current version is that nonlinear chemical processes are not accounted for and only primary pollutants can be addressed.

As feedstock composition vary widely based on regional characteristics, clarifying the relationship between gas and tar generation behaviors and feedstock is useful for the design of the GE generation process to predict gas and tar yields and compositions. To understand the synergistic effect of feedstock characteristics in fluidized bed gasification, flash pyrolysis of wood pellet, polyethylene, and polypropylene at 900 °C was conducted. Yields and compositions of gasses and tar from single and co-pyrolysis were investigated. The results reveal that co-pyrolysis increases the gas yield because of oxygenates and moisture present in the wood pellet.

The agricultural sector produces about a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), and meat production, especially beef, is an important contributor to global GHGE. Our study aimed to address a fundamental gap in the diet-climate literature: identifying consumers who are receptive to making dietary changes, and the effect of their potential changes on GHGE, diet healthfulness, and diet costs. Methods: Dietary data on US individuals from a nationally representative survey were linked to food-related GHGE. We identified individuals receptive to changing their diets (potential changers) as those who reported trying US dietary guidance and were likely to agree that humans contribute to climate change. We assessed GHGE, diet healthfulness measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and diet costs before and after hypothetical changes replacing either beef or meats with poultry or plant-protein foods. Findings: Our sample comprised 7188 individuals, of whom 16% were potential changers. These were disproportionately women, highly educated, or had higher income compared with individuals deemed not likely to change. Replacing 100% of beef intake in potential changers with poultry reduced mean dietary GHGE by 1·38 kg CO2-equivalents per person per day (95% CI 1·19–1·58), a 35·7% decrease. This replacement also increased mean HEI by 1·7% and reduced mean diet costs by 1·7%. We observed the largest changes when replacing all beef, pork, or poultry intake with plant-protein foods (GHGE decreased by 49·6%, mean HEI increased by 8·7%, and dietary costs decreased by 10·5%). Hypothetical replacements in the potential changers alone resulted in whole population reductions in 1-day dietary GHGE of 1·2% to 6·7%, equivalent to 22–126 million fewer passenger vehicle km. Interpretation: Individual-level diet studies that include a variation in response by consumers can improve our understanding of the effects of climate policies such as those that include sustainability information in national dietary guidance. In our study, we found that changes by a small percentage of motivated individuals can modestly reduce the national dietary GHGE. Moreover, these substitutions can modestly improve diet healthfulness and reduce diet costs for individuals who make these changes. Funding: Wellcome Trust. © 2020 The Author(s).

We interpreted this result as indicating that both emissions are governed by the same detrapping mechanisms. In the present study we develop a common configurational coordinate model to describe the mechanisms. Within our model we identify the energy associated with the thermal assistance effect as the vibrational energy of the ground state of the dimer that represents the trap. Further, we model the OSL stimulation process as an optical transition between a vibrationally-excited ground state level and a dimer excited state. By introducing additional luminescence parameters, we reveal that the processes that underlie thermal quenching and the room temperature OSL response to pulsed stimulation can be represented by competing modes which empty the excited state. In particular, we find that the room temperature pulse response can be modelled in terms of an optical transition from the excited state to a lower antibonding level from which a hole is ejected. In contrast, thermal quenching is explained by excited state vibrational dissociation at large dimer component separations. © 2020","Configurational coordinate diagrams; Hole untrapping mechanisms; Pulsed optically stimulated luminescence in quartz; Room temperature pulse time constants; Thermal assistance; Thermal quenching","Ground state; Luminescence; Optical transitions; Quartz; Quenching; Configurational coordinate diagrams; Optically stimulated luminescence; Temperature pulse; Thermal assistance; Thermal quenching; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079217914

However, the broad application has not yet been realized for production engines, mainly owing to low combustion stability at the edges of the operating range and high sensitivity to changing boundary conditions. Owing to strong cycle-to-cycle coupling by negative valve overlap, the cylinder state of the last combustion has an enormous influence on the subsequent combustion. Therefore, the condition of the previous combustion must be taken into account to control the following combustion event. For this purpose, the interactions between feedback variables and cycle individual control interventions need to be measured in a wide operating range. Against this backdrop, a new measurement methodology is presented in this article, which sets up the transient limitations for Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition combustion, while maintaining the limits of stability, maximum pressure gradient, and other factors automatically. Hence, an algorithm has been developed that sets the manipulated variables on a cyclic basis, dependent on the previous cycle in several dimensions. The new algorithm was then used to gain dynamic measurement data that were used to train artificial neural networks. It is demonstrated that the models are able to predict misfires under certain conditions. Additionally, a feasibility study regarding the usability of the newly gained models was performed based on a data-driven control algorithm, which was carried out and validated on a single-cylinder test engine. © 2019","Artificial neural network (ANN); Control; Cylinder-pressure-indication; Field-programmable gate array (FPGA); Gasoline controlled auto ignition (GCAI); Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI)","Control engineering; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Internal combustion engines; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; Combustion stability; Controlled auto ignition; Cylinder pressures; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Homogeneous charge compression ignition combustions; Manipulated variables; Measurement methodology; Negative valve overlap; Ignition; algorithm; artificial diet; artificial neural network; boundary condition; combustion; engine; feasibility study; measurement method; methodology; performance assessment; pressure gradient",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078161132

Herein we present the first application of such a model (GEM-MACH-PAH) to examine the contribution of motor vehicles to benzene and PAHs in ambient air. We have applied the model over a region that is centred on Toronto, Canada, and includes much of southern Ontario and the northeastern United States. The resolution (2.5 km) was the highest ever employed by a model for these compounds in North America, and the model domain was the largest at this resolution in the world to date. Using paired model simulations that were run with vehicle emissions turned on and off (while all other emissions were left on), we estimated the absolute and relative contributions of motor vehicles to ambient pollutant concentrations. Our results provide estimates of motor vehicle contributions that are realistic as a result of the inclusion of atmospheric processing, whereas assessing changes in benzene and PAH emissions alone would neglect effects caused by shifts in atmospheric oxidation and particle-gas partitioning. A secondary benefit of our scenario approach is in its utility in representing a fleet of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), whose adoption is being encouraged in a variety of jurisdictions. Our simulations predicted domain-average on-road vehicle contributions to benzene and PAH concentrations of 4 %-21 % and 14 %-24 % in the spring-summer and fall-winter periods, respectively, depending on the aromatic compound. Contributions to PAH concentrations up to 50 % were predicted for the Greater Toronto Area, and the domain maximum was simulated to be 91 %. Such contributions are substantially higher than those reported at the national level in Canadian emissions inventories, and they also differ from inventory estimates at the subnational scale in the US. Our model has been run at a finer spatial scale than reported in those inventories, and furthermore includes physico-chemical processing that alters pollutant concentrations after their release. The removal of onroad vehicle emissions generally led to decreases in benzene and PAH concentrations during both periods that were studied, though atmospheric processing (such as chemical reactions and changes to particle-gas partitioning) contributed to non-linear behaviour at some locations or times of year. Such results demonstrate the added value associated with regional air quality modelling relative to examinations of emissions inventories alone. We also found that removing on-road vehicle emissions reduced spring-summertime surface O3 volume mixing ratios and fall-wintertime PM10 concentrations each by ∼ 10 % in the model domain, providing further air quality benefits. Toxic equivalents contributed by vehicle emissions of PAHs were found to be substantial (20 %-60 % depending on location), and this finding is particularly relevant to the study of public health in the urban areas of our model domain where human population, ambient concentrations, and traffic volumes tend to be high. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air quality; ambient air; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; benzene; PAH; traffic emission; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081901336

Our approach contrasts a long present-day control simulation from each model (up to 400 years with perpetual year 2000 or 2005 emissions) with 14 individual aerosol emissions perturbation simulations (160-240 years each).

Effects of ship types, operating modes, discharge equipment, time and location on ship emissions are also examined in this study. Results reveal that the annual ship emissions for CO2, CO, HC, NOx and SO2 in 2014 are 1.818 × 106 tons, 2.593 × 103 tons, 1.949 × 103 tons, 3.394 × 104 tons and 1.584 × 104 tons, respectively. Findings highlight that the majority of ship emissions are generated under the slow-steaming and normal cruising states. There exist strong temporal and spatial effects on ship emissions. Ship emissions are mainly distributed at the port areas, intersection areas and the north channel of the Yangtze River estuary. This study concludes with some future efforts and directions to mitigate ship emissions in this water area effectively (e.g., encouraging cargo ships to use the lower carbon fuels for propulsion, optimizing ship routes in the north channel and interactions of the Yangtze River estuary). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AIS; Estimation distribution; Ship emissions; STEAM model","Artificial intelligence; Estuaries; River pollution; Rivers; Ships; Comprehensive analysis; High resolution; Intersection areas; Operating modes; Ship emissions; Spatial temporals; Temporal and spatial; Yangtze River estuary; Ship propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075876583

Dissolved organic matter (DOC) and light-absorbing characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were monitored in different tributaries of China within the Haihe River basin during spring and autumn. The concentration of DOC during spring was higher than during autumn (p &lt; 0.01), and the evaporation was an important factor affecting the concentration of DOC in the basin. By contrast, the proportion of inputs due to terrigenous plants during autumn was higher than during spring. Carbon stable isotope analysis δ13C and C: N ratio of DOC, evidenced the inputs of DOC in the Haihe River basin from different sources including sewage, terrestrial plants, soil, and plankton. Isotopic analysis of δ13C and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) with fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analysis supported the hypothesis that allochthonous inputs contributed substantially to the inputs of DOC in the Haihe River basin, coming largely from sewage (9.8%–81.2%) and terrestrial plants (13.3%–65.8%). Depending on the source of DOC and contribution, four types with different EEM spectra were set. Type I, river water from sewage (81.2%); Type II, river water with input from terrestrial plants (65.8%); Type III, river water with plankton (36.4%), and Type IV, river water with soil-derived DOC (33.9%).

The empirical results show that there were significant spatial dependence and clustering characteristics in provincial CCE. The net value of machinery and equipment, labor productivity, technical renovation input, construction gross domestic product, and the total construction profit prohibit greater emission reductions. Specifically, the economy related performance indicators cause smaller positive impacts on emission growth than the machinery- and labor-related factors. In addition, it is also noted that proportion of technical personnel and the ratio of technical equipment have significantly positive effects on CCE abatement.

We test the nutrient dilution (ND) hypothesis-the decreasing concentration of essential dietary minerals with increasing plant productivity-that particularly targets insect herbivores. Nutrient dilution can result from increased plant biomass due to climate or CO2 enrichment. Additionally, when considering long-term trends driven by climate, one must account for large-scale oscillations including El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We combine long-term datasets of grasshopper abundance, climate, plant biomass, and end-of-season foliar elemental content to examine potential drivers of abundance cycles and trends of this dominant herbivore. Annual grasshopper abundances in 16- and 22-y time series from a Kansas prairie revealed both 5-y cycles and declines of 2.1-2.7%/y. Climate cycle indices of spring ENSO, summer NAO, and winter or spring PDO accounted for 40-54% of the variation in grasshopper abundance, mediated by effects of weather and host plants. Consistent with ND, grass biomass doubled and foliar concentrations of N, P, K, and Na-nutrients which limit grasshopper abundance-declined over the same period. The decline in plant nutrients accounted for 25% of the variation in grasshopper abundance over two decades. Thus a warming, wetter, more CO2-enriched world will likely contribute to declines in insect herbivores by depleting nutrients from their already nutrient-poor diet. Unlike other potential drivers of insect declines-habitat loss, light and chemical pollution-ND may be widespread in remaining natural areas. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

To do so, we conduct a life-cycle environmental impact assessment, quantifying greenhouse gas emissions associated with building construction and seismic performance, accounting for potential earthquake damage and subsequent repairs. The unit of analysis is a modern code-designed reinforced concrete frame building, designed with seven different types of concrete: a conventional concrete mix, 3 concrete mixes in which varying quantities of fly ash replace cement, and 3 concrete mixes in which varying quantities of recycled concrete replace virgin coarse aggregate. The findings suggest that replacing cement with fly ash can be an effective tool to improve building sustainability over the entire life cycle, reducing greenhouse gas emissions during both construction and service life (seismic) life-cycle stages, without compromising seismic performance (i.e., resilience). However, replacing virgin coarse aggregate with recycled concrete aggregate can have unintended consequences in terms of worsening seismic performance and hence making the overall life-cycle sustainability calculus unfavorable in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper is one of the first to link life-cycle seismic and environmental performance of buildings designed with alternative (and potentially green) concretes and to demonstrate the importance of considering tradeoffs between resilience and sustainability in design and selection of alternative structural materials. In addition, this study illustrates a framework that can be applied for life-cycle assessment and evaluation of structural concrete material choices. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Aggregates; Artificial life; Calculations; Cements; Concrete buildings; Concrete mixers; Concrete mixtures; Construction; Damage detection; Earthquakes; Ecodesign; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental management; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Recycling; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Seismic waves; Service life; Sustainable development; Building construction; Conventional concrete; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Recycled concrete aggregates; Reinforced concrete frame buildings; Unintended consequences; Concrete aggregates; building; carbon emission; concrete structure; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; recycling; reinforced concrete; seismic response; seismic zone; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076675610

Both instruments are measured against the above-mentioned environmental objectives, taking into account findings from behavioural sciences and typical governance problems. Both approaches are generally suitable as quantity governance in animal husbandry if they are properly designed. In the end, a combination of both approaches proved to be particularly effective ecologically.

One of the challenges in its successful implementation has been community involvement in its design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of this study is to assess what REDD + can learn from the experience of Community-Based Ecotourism (CBET), which operates under many of the same conditions. A critical review of the related literature using the Scopus database was undertaken using three search strings including “REDD+” (2,913 listings), “community-based ecotourism” (113 listings) and “REDD + and tourism” (6 listings) to identify the variables and themes related to each. Despite the significant increase in the number of publications on REDD + since 2008, only one was specifically related to ecotourism. We argue that CBET understood as a form of social capital can function as an enabling platform for REDD+, in particular its implementation of international conservation policy by working with local communities/indigenous peoples and business stakeholders, referred to here as the “tripartite praxis”. We demonstrate how CBET can act as a basis from which to guide internationally driven incentive-based conservation policy and community entrepreneurship within a social capital framework. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; community-based ecotourism; local communities; Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation; social capital; tripartite praxis","climate change; conceptual framework; deforestation; ecotourism; emission control; local participation; nature conservation; social capital; Scopus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074617815

Commitments include providing national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘UNFCCC’) secretariat, reporting their contributions towards the collective target. GHG emissions from upstream oil and gas (O&G) facilities, including those in offshore areas under coastal State jurisdiction (where current activity is occurring in over 50 countries), are to be included within the scope of these reports. Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (‘UNCLOS’) are obligated to adopt and enforce laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control pollution arising from seabed exploration and exploitation activities under their jurisdiction. These are to be no less effective than international rules and standards as established through competent international organisations. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), via the Regional Seas Programmes (RSP), are two such organisations that develop international rules and standards covering certain aspects of offshore O&G activities. IMO treaties, rules, and standards cover GHG emissions arising from vessel-related offshore O&G activities, but emissions from O&G industry-specific activities, such as the venting and flaring of reservoir hydrocarbons, are excluded. The only other source of international law, implementing UNCLOS′ requirement, providing international rules and standards for coastal States to benchmark their laws against for the prevention of marine pollution in the form of GHG emissions from offshore O&G activities are the regional instruments of the RSP. However, as this article will show, current RSP coverage is minimal and insufficient, particularly in light of Parties' Paris Agreement and UNCLOS obligations. Examples are provided showing inconsistencies in the reporting of offshore O&G GHG emissions across national inventory reports, as well as examples of applicable requirements prescribed under various RSP instruments, or lack thereof, highlighting the deficiency of a relevant international pollution prevention rule and/or standard across all marine regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change law; Greenhouse gas emissions; Law of the sea; Offshore energy sector; Regional seas","Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; International law; Marine pollution; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Pollution control; International maritime organizations; Law of the seas; National inventory report; Offshore energy; Pollution prevention; Regional seas; United Nations Environment Programme; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Greenhouse gases; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; Law of the Sea; marine pollution; offshore structure; pollution control; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075527692

Efforts to control invasive lianas are widespread, yet forests are often reinvaded following management. Changes in soil nutrient availability could help explain why some forests are susceptible to reinvasion. Specifically, invasive lianas could be “drivers” of altered nutrient dynamics that persist in the soil and favor their re-establishment, or they could be “passengers” of conditions created by prior site disturbances. We test these alternative models by analyzing soils across gradients of liana cover and forest disturbance in mature hardwood forests in New York City. Overall, total non-native liana cover was linked to elevated soil pH, reduced labile carbon, and altered net potential nitrification—three conditions indicative of increased soil nutrient availability. However, the effects of lianas varied substantially by species. Non-native lianas had a positive, negative, neutral, or non-linear effect on a single soil variable depending on the species. Aggregation of total non-native liana cover can therefore obscure the direction and magnitude of species-level effects. We also found positive relationships between forest disturbance, non-native liana cover, and soil pH, but we found no relationships between disturbance and net nitrification or labile carbon. These results suggest that non-native lianas are passengers to elevated levels of disturbance and soil pH but drivers of altered carbon and nitrogen dynamics. As such, management efforts aimed at reducing soil nutrient availability and removing invasive lianas may be required to limit reinvasion and promote ecosystem recovery. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aboveground-belowground interactions; Disturbance; Forest ecology; Nitrogen; Plant-soil feedbacks; Restoration","aboveground production; belowground production; biological control; disturbance; forest ecosystem; forest management; growth rate; invasive species; nutrient availability; reintroduction; restoration ecology; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; soil-vegetation interaction; survival; urban forestry; vine; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076014953

As an important emitter of carbon dioxide, China has put forward “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan” (TFYP) outline that carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) will be 18% lower in 2020 than that in 2015. To measure the policy effects on CO2 emission reduction and abatement costs, the directional distance function model is introduced in this paper, and the sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the rationality of our index formulation. The results show the areas with the highest carbon emission control target level have significantly higher marginal abatement costs than that of other areas. In the short term, the reduction targets policy effect on decreasing carbon abatement cost is not significant. Through sensitivity analysis, we further discovered that the carbon emission reduction cost is less sensitive to the carbon emission reduction target, and the impact in the short term is smaller. However, as time goes by, the impact increases. We suggest that the government should guide interregional enterprises to cooperate and play a synergistic role. Implementing the multilevel emission reduction targets and expanding the scope of trading in the national carbon trading market are especially important to optimize the allocation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Directional distance function; Emission reduction target; Marginal abatement cost","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission reductions; CO2 emission reduction; Directional distance function; Emission reduction targets; Gross domestic products; Low-carbon development; Marginal abatement costs; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077889721

However, there is a lack of accurate ice particle effective radius (Rei) observation on the global scale to constrain its representation in climate models. In support of future mission design, here we present a modeling assessment of the sensitivity of climate simulations to Rei and quantify the impact of the proposed mission concept on reducing the uncertainty in climate sensitivity. We perturb the parameters pertaining to ice fall speed parameter and Rei in radiation scheme, respectively, in National Center for Atmospheric Research CESM1 model with a slab ocean configuration. The model sensitivity experiments show that a settling velocity increase due to a larger Rei results in a longwave cooling dominating over a shortwave warming, a global mean surface temperature decrease, and precipitation suppression. A similar competition between longwave and shortwave cloud forcing changes also exists when perturbing Rei in the radiation scheme. Linearity generally holds for the climate response for Rei related parameters. When perturbing falling snow particle size (Res) in a similar way, we find much less sensitivity of climate responses. Our quadrupling CO2 experiments with different parameter settings reveal that Rei and Res can account for changes in climate sensitivity significantly from +12.3% to −6.2%. By reducing the uncertainty ranges of Rei and Res from a factor of 2 to ±25%, a future satellite mission under design is expected to improve the climate state simulations and reduce the climate sensitivity uncertainty pertaining to ice particle size by approximately 60%. Our results highlight the importance of better observational constraints on Rei by satellite missions. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

However, current studies have only focused on the efficiency evaluation in national, regional, or enterprise level, lacking the analysis of different processes. Therefore, the objective of this research is to conduct a process-level data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate the environmental efficiency of China's iron and steel industry. Totally, 54 enterprises are contained, as the input-output structure of 5 processes: sintering, coking, ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling are set specifically in this study. In addition, to compare the effects to the efficiency results of different DEA methods, Banker, Charnes & Cooper (BCC) model, Slack-based Measure (SBM) model, and Bootstrap-DEA methods are adopted. Finally, a regression model is used to investigate the key environmental protection strategies influencing the environmental efficiency. The results show that: (1) Within different methods, the average efficiency scores from SBM model are lower than the ones from BCC model, and the Bootstrap-DEA method also has a negative modification. (2) Regional efficiency difference exists, as the enterprises in South China perform best in sintering and coking processes but have the lowest overall efficiency scores. (3) Most enterprises have one or more short board processes. 12 enterprises are the enterprises with individual low environmental efficiency process, while other 25 are the enterprises with imbalanced environmental performances. (4) The coefficient factor between environmental protection investment and the efficiency scores are positive, but the factors of proportion of environmental protection staffs, and whether the enterprise has environmental protection research are negative. In sum, this study is hoped to contribute to formulating more precise environmental management measures in China's iron and steel industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bootstrap-DEA method; Data envelopment analysis; Environmental efficiency; Iron and steel industry; Regression analysis","Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Environmental management; Investments; Iron research; Regression analysis; Sintering; Steelmaking; Average efficiencies; Dea methods; Efficiency evaluation; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Environmental efficiency; Environmental performance; Environmental pressures; Slack-based measures; Iron and steel industry; bootstrapping; data envelopment analysis; efficiency measurement; emission control; energy conservation; environmental economics; environmental protection; input-output analysis; iron and steel industry; regression analysis; air pollution control; Article; bootstrapping; China; coking industry; controlled study; data envelopment analysis; energy conservation; environmental efficiency; environmental management; environmental parameters; environmental protection; investigative procedures; iron and steel industry; ironmaking; nonparametric test; priority journal; regression analysis; sintering; steel rolling; steelmaking; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076836294

By applying an electric field from 0 up to 0.3 V/Å, the effective and local work functions can be determined for comparison after employing five different pseudopotentials. It is found that as the electric field increases, the work functions of tungsten surfaces reduce accordingly. A reduction of work function can be as large as ∼0.35 eV. Based on these calculations, a new scaling law of work function reduction due to the charge transfer near the metal/vacuum interface caused by an external electric field is obtained. In addition, the local work function is found to be closely related to the charge density distribution.

Here, we show that the radiative forcing due to geospatially redistributed anthropogenic aerosols mainly determined the spatial variations of winter extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere during 1970–2005, a unique transition period for global aerosol forcing4. Over this period, the local Rossby wave activity and extreme events (top 10% in wave amplitude) exhibited marked declining trends at high latitudes, mainly in northern Eurasia. The combination of long-term observational data and a state-of-the-art climate model revealed the unambiguous signature of anthropogenic aerosols on the wintertime jet stream, planetary wave activity and surface temperature variability on interdecadal timescales. In particular, warming due to aerosol reductions in Europe enhanced the meridional temperature gradient on the jet’s poleward flank and strengthened the zonal wind, resulting in significant suppression in extreme events over northern Eurasia. These results exemplify how aerosol forcing can impact large-scale extratropical atmospheric dynamics, and illustrate the importance of anthropogenic aerosols and their spatiotemporal variability in assessing the drivers of extreme weather in historical and future climate. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081068662

Objectives: To investigate high temperature–EDVs relationship in various regions with different climatic characteristics, to explore the regional differences, to identify vulnerable populations, and to provide scientific evidence for climate change adaptation strategies in China. Methods: Daily data on weather, air pollution and EDVs were collected from 18 sites in China from June to August during 2014–2017. A quasi–Poisson generalized additive regression model was applied to examine the high temperature–EDVs relationship in each site. Site–specific risks of EDVs were pooled using a random effect meta–analysis model. Stratified analyses were performed by gender, age–groups, cause–specific EDVs and regions. Attributable fractions of EDVs due to high temperatures were calculated in different regions. Results: 1 °C increase in daily mean temperature was associated with 1.07% (95% CI, 0.46–1.67%) increase in EDVs across all study regions. The negative health effects from high temperatures were worse for the people living in southern China, in subtropical monsoon climate zone or in counties, with percentage change of 1.96% (95% CI, 0.92–3.02%), 1.35% (95% CI, 0.95–1.76%) and 1.41% (95% CI, 0.48–2.34%), respectively. People under 18 were more vulnerable to high temperatures. Exposure to high temperatures increased EDVs risks from endocrine, respiratory, and digestive diseases and injury. The attributable fraction due to high temperatures was 8.64% for overall EDVs, 11.70% for the people living in southern China, 10.80% for people living in subtropical monsoon climate zone and 12.65% for the county population. Conclusions: Exposure to high temperatures resulted in extra burden to China's already overloaded hospital emergency departments. More resources are needed to meet increasing demands and effective preventative measurements are warranted to tackle such a challenge. Further studies should pay more attention to both heat and cold-related EDVs risks and socioeconomic cost for better climate change adaptation. © 2020 The Authors","Attributable fraction; China; Emergency department visits; High temperatures; Regional difference","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Developing countries; Emergency rooms; Random processes; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Tropics; Attributable fraction; China; Emergency departments; High temperature; Regional differences; Climate change; climate change; developing world; health impact; high temperature; risk assessment; temperature effect; adaptation; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollution; Article; China; climate change; controlled study; emergency care; environmental exposure; female; health care cost; health care need; health care planning; health care system; health hazard; health impact assessment; high temperature; human; infant; major clinical study; male; monsoon climate; newborn; priority journal; resource allocation; risk assessment; socioeconomics; temperature measurement; tropics; vulnerable population; cold; heat; hospital emergency service; meta analysis; risk assessment; temperature; China; China; Cold Temperature; Emergency Service, Hospital; Hot Temperature; Humans; Risk Assessment; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078162861

However, geographical variation in proportions of different sexual systems (dioecy, monoecy and hermaphroditism) in response to changes in climate, life-history traits and evolutionary age remains poorly understood. Here, we map the geographical variation in proportions of different sexual systems and hypothesize that the prevalence of hermaphrodites increases with aridity owing to their advantages in colonizing harsh environments, whereas dioecy is most successful in humid regions with tall-canopy vegetation and old floras.

Methods: Using data on sexual systems and distributions of 10,449 woody species in China, we estimated the proportions of different sexual systems in local floras (50 km × 50 km grid cells). Spatial linear models, phylogenetic general linear models and structural equation models were used to compare the relative influences of climate, plant height and evolutionary age on geographical variation in proportions of different sexual systems. Results: We found contrasting geographical patterns in the proportions of different sexual systems. The proportions of dioecy and monoecy increased with plant height and were highest in humid regions with older floras, whereas that of hermaphroditism decreased with plant height and was highest in arid regions with younger floras. Plant height was the strongest correlate of sexual system frequency. Climate influenced sexual system frequency both directly and indirectly via its effects on plant height. Main conclusions: Our study provides the first continuous map of sexual system composition in woody floras over a large spatial scale. Our findings suggest that mature plant height, reflecting plant longevity, dominates geographical variation in sexual systems and that the proportions of different sexual systems in local floras might reflect their correlated evolution with traits in response to climate changes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","angiosperms; China; climate change; evolutionary history; geographical pattern; macro evo-devo; plant height; plant reproduction; sexual systems","angiosperm; climate change; forest canopy; global change; height; reproduction; vegetation dynamics; woody plant; China; Magnoliophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077146467

Based on 20 types of energy consumption data at the prefecture level in China, this paper re-estimates the CO2 emissions of 198 prefecture-level cities in 2016 by using the method of carbon emission coefficient. The spatial pattern and scale characteristics are analyzed, and the conclusions are as follows: (1) Overall, China's urban CO2 emissions show a certain degree of spatial separation in terms of the total amount, per capita emissions, and emission intensity. Cities with the highest CO2 emissions in China are mainly concentrated in North China, East China and Chongqing, while cities with the highest per capita CO2 emissions and emission intensity are mainly concentrated in Northwest and North China. (2) Different types of cities have different CO2 emission characteristics. Resource-based cities have a higher total amount and emission intensity; tourism and underdeveloped cities both have lower values; while super-large-sized cities and many very-large-sized cities have higher CO2 emissions, but their emission intensities are usually lower; and no obvious rules are found in other cities. (3) Spatial analysis shows that cities with higher CO2 emissions are clustered. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta region, Shandong Province, and Shanxi-Henan-Anhui resource-producing areas are the agglomeration areas of high-emission cities. (4) Scale analysis shows that the characteristics of CO2 emissions at different scales are different. Provincial-level research can help to identify the environmental impact and total effect of carbon emissions, while urban-scale research is helpful to explore the diversity and phases of cities. Finally, based on the main conclusions of this study, the corresponding urban low-carbon policy implications are drawn. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","CO2emissions; industrial transfer; prefecture-level cities; scale effect; spatial pattern",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093516428

Shanghai, one of the world's first metropolises to utilize effective urban heat island (UHI) mitigation strategies, is investigated by analyzing meteorological and land use observations over the past 144 years. The UHI decreased by ~0.58 °C between 2005 and 2016 due to urban renewal characterized by an increase in vegetation cover and the closure of the high-energy consumption industries in urban areas. Simulation results also indicate that future mitigation strategies should strive to increase vegetation cover, as a 10–20% increase in vegetation cover is anticipated to reduce the UHI by 0.38–0.78 °C, resulting in potential electricity savings of 3.05–5.79 × 108 kWh/year, which correspond to a carbon emissions reduction of 2.47–4.68 × 105 tCO2/year. The results will contribute to improve urban climate associated with large-scale urbanization and will provide guidance for urban renewal in other metropolises worldwide. © 2020.

However, urban vegetation cover is vulnerable to urbanization. This study attempts to detect the change in vegetation cover and to quantify its impact on aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks in Auckland, New Zealand, between 1989 and 2014. Field-measured vegetation parameters were used to calculate the amount of carbon stored in plants at the plot-level. Plot-level AGC stocks were linked with vegetation spectral/structural features derived from Landsat images and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. These data were also used to map vegetation cover and to estimate AGC stock. Vegetation cover decreased from 394.0 km2 in 1989 to 379.4 km2 in 2014. AGC stock in 1989 was estimated at 1,001,184 Mg C from Landsat 4 data. The total AGC in 2014 was estimated at 1,459,530 Mg C from Landsat 8 data. Thus, total AGC stock increased by 458,346 Mg C (45.8%) in spite of a 3.7% decrease in vegetation cover (14.6 km2) during the same period. The increase in AGC stock was derived partly from tree growth and tree plantings. Vegetation growth contributed more to the increase in AGC stock than its gain from non-vegetation to vegetation changes. The AGC stored in trees and shrubs estimated at 1,333,011 Mg C from the 2014 Landsat data is 5.7% lower than 1,414,607 Mg C estimated from the 2013 LiDAR data, due to the inability of optical imagery to capture the sub-canopy structure of forests and the saturation effect. Thus, LiDAR data provided a more accurate estimate of AGC stock, especially when the stock density is high (e.g. &gt;97.9 Mg C ha–1). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Carbon; Forestry; Optical radar; Above-ground carbons; Light detection and ranging; Saturation effects; Trees and shrubs; Vegetation change; Vegetation cover; Vegetation growth; Vegetation parameters; Vegetation; aboveground production; assessment method; canopy architecture; image analysis; Landsat; lidar; urban area; vegetation cover; Auckland [Auckland (RGA)]; Auckland [North Island]; New Zealand; North Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074781905

However, the emissions resulting from intermediate products are significantly increasing every year. This study analyzes the intermediate carbon emission transfer effort of 140 countries/regions in the global production network based on data from the Global Trade Analysis Project database. Since China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, we further analyze China's carbon transfer from the regional and sectoral perspectives. To this end, we use the structural decomposition analysis method to divide the factors influencing China's emission transfer into five parts: emission intensity, export per capita, export structure, population, and production structure. The results show that the net inflow of emissions in China results from the trade process between China and developed regions, including regions in North America and Western Europe, particularly in the sectors of mechanical and electronic equipment and chemical, rubber, and plastic products. Further, the main destinations of China's emission outflow are Latin America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the mineral, oil, and oilseed sectors. Moreover, emission intensity plays a crucial role in emission reduction, and production structure reversals negatively affect the growth of embodied emission. Finally, our analysis suggests that China should optimize its trade structure and promote low-carbon-emission technology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","GTAP database; Low-carbon-emission technology; Structural decomposition analysis","Carbon dioxide; Chemical equipment; Emission control; International trade; Oscillators (electronic); Plastic products; Rubber products; Embodied emissions; Emission intensity; Emission reduction; Global production networks; Intermediate product; Low-carbon emissions; Production structures; Structural decomposition analysis; Chemical analysis; carbon dioxide; mineral; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; database; decomposition analysis; emissions trading; environmental technology; international trade; Africa south of the Sahara; analysis; Article; carbon emission transfer; chemical industry; China; commercial phenomena; controlled study; data base; developed country; Global Trade Analysis Project database; industry; low carbon emission technology; machine; North America; oil industry; plastic industry; pollution transport; population; priority journal; rubber industry; South and Central America; South Asia; structural decomposition analysis; technology; Western Europe; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076884647

As an important part of aquatic ecosystems, macrophytes have many advantages in controlling eutrophication and algal blooms. In recent years, micro-nanobubble (MNB) aeration has increasingly been used for restoring natural waters suffering from eutrophication, which may affect the growth of macrophytes and thereby affect ecological restoration, but the effect of MNBs on macrophytes has not drawn great attention. In this study, three common species of macrophytes (Echinodorus amazonicus or EA, Echinodorus quadricostatus or EQ and Microsorum pteropus or MP) were grown for 60 days in water aerated with MNBs and their growth was compared to that of the same plants grown with standard macrobubble aeration. The growth of EA and EQ was significantly inhibited by MNB aeration, and was accompanied by various symptoms of senescence (yellowing and chlorophyll degradation, the decrease of photosynthesis rate, carbon fixation and plant growth, and the decline of respiration rate). However, the growth of MP plants was not significantly affected under the same conditions. The final fresh weights (FFWs) of EA, EQ and MP in the presence of high MNB levels were 0.75, 0.83 and 1.05 times those in the macrobubble aeration system; we designate this parameter ratioFFW. We found the initial total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of EA and EQ to be 48.00 and 64.67 U mL-1, respectively, markedly lower than that of MP (617.33 U mL-1). The ratioFFW values and other growth indexes of the three plant species were positively correlated with their T-AOC. Macrophytes use their antioxidant defense mechanisms to prevent oxidative damage by ROS, while still allowing exogenous ROS to function as signalling molecules to regulate plant growth and senescence. Premature senescence is a protective mechanism employed when plants are stressed and their growth is consequently inhibited. Our results suggest that instead of positively promoting the growth of dense macrophytes, the MNBs potentially induce damage to water ecosystem. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Antioxidants; Aquatic ecosystems; Eutrophication; Hydrogeology; Plants (botany); Antioxidant defense; Chlorophyll degradation; Ecological restoration; Photosynthesis rate; Signalling molecules; Submerged macrophytes; Total antioxidant capacity; Urban landscape waters; Water aeration; antioxidant; eutrophication; experimental study; macrophyte; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; water quality; China; algae; Echinodorus; Microsorum pteropus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081116227

In order to computationally study diesel/gasoline blends for their autoignition characteristics, a five-component diesel surrogate (21.6% n-hexadecane, 15.5% n-octadecane, 26.0% isocetane, 20.7% 1-methylnaphthalene, 16.2% decalin, by mol.) and a five-component gasoline surrogate (11.0% n-heptane, 30.8% isooctane, 38.2% toluene, 10.3% diisobutylene, 9.7% cyclohexane, by mol.) are blended in three volume ratios of 30%/70%, 50%/50%, and 70%/30% (denoted as SD30, SD50, and SD70) to compare measured ignition delay with published data of diesel/gasoline blends. A heated shock tube and a heated rapid compression machine (RCM) are used to measure the ignition delay of three surrogate blends under compressed pressures of 6, 10, and 20 bar for fuel-lean (ϕ = 0.5), fuel-rich (ϕ = 1.5), and stoichiometric mixtures. Experimental results indicate that surrogate blends match well with fuel-lean and stoichiometric diesel/gasoline/air mixtures while get longer ignition delays for the fuel-rich case, which is thought of as the consequence of fitting the surrogate to fuel-lean conditions in the engine. The kinetic simulation for ignition delays is performed with a comprehensive mechanism. Due to the mechanism overpredicting ignition delays in the intermediate-to-high temperature region, proper refinement is done to the original mechanism based on sensitivity analyses at 1000 and 660 K. A further comparison of ignition delay predictive ability for two mechanisms is conducted subsequently. The modified mechanism not only simulates ignition delays in the intermediate-to-high temperature region successfully but also maintains the good performance of the original mechanism in the negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC) and low-temperature region. Besides, species and temperature profiles after the compression stroke in RCM are simulated using the modified mechanism for three surrogate blends at equal equivalence ratio, compressed pressure, and compressed temperature. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to identify reactions dominating the system reactivity. © 2019 The Combustion Institute","Diesel surrogate; Diesel/gasoline blends; Gasoline surrogate; Ignition delay; Kinetic mechanism","Blending; Diesel engines; Gasoline; Heptane; Kinetics; Mixtures; Organic solvents; Paraffins; Sensitivity analysis; Shock tubes; Temperature; Diesel surrogates; Homogeneous charge compression ignition engines; Ignition delays; Kinetic mechanism; Low temperature regions; Rapid compression machine; Stoichiometric mixtures; Temperature and pressures; Ignition; 1 methylnaphthalene; cyclohexane; decalin; diesel fuel; gasoline; heptane; hexadecane; toluene; Article; experimental study; high temperature; kinetics; pressure; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; simulation; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076708554

The replacement of natural grassland with cropland has resulted in massive loss of soil organic carbon (SOC), causing serious degradation in this region. Therefore, long-term field experiments combined with modelling approaches were used to examine and project effects of different soil management practices on SOC sequestration. Materials and methods: The RothC model was used to simulate SOC stocks, and the straw retention factor was adjusted in our study. Strategies for improving carbon sequestration were evaluated over 30 years under four carbon input scenarios: straw return at the current rate (with a straw retention factor of 40%), complete straw retention (with a straw retention factor of 100%), manuring at the current rate (0.43 Mg C ha−1 yr−1), and manuring at double the current rate (0.86 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). Results and discussion: Simulations with the RothC model indicated that the SOC stock in the 0–20-cm soil profile at the experimental sites has decreased by 64.1% since the 1980s. Moreover, SOC levels appear to have declined rapidly during the first 10 years after site reclamation, with losses ranging from 3.51 to 5.89 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Straw return at the current rate was predicted to reduce the SOC sequestration rate by 0.07 Mg ha−1 yr−1 in the northern black soils over the 30-year simulation period but cause SOC levels to slowly increase toward equilibrium in the southern black soil region. In simulations with the higher rate of straw retention, SOC stocks rapidly increased (by 0.36–0.53 Mg ha−1 yr−1) across the black soil region over the 30-year period. SOC stocks also increased under the higher rate of manuring, by 0.01–0.19 Mg ha−1 per year. Conclusions: The results suggest that increasing inputs of carbon sources such as straw and manure, together with appropriate tillage, could substantially improve SOC sequestration in the black soil region of northeastern China. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Black soils; Long-term experiments; RothC model; Scenario analysis of future SOC stocks; SOC degradation; Straw return","carbon sequestration; estimation method; model; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil degradation; soil management; straw; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076205326

However, governments are hesitant to take aggressive actions to cut carbon emissions without breakthroughs in decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions if they have to pay the economic loss price. Thus developing and implementing more aggressive and efficient Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of the Paris Agreement requires a better understanding of the possibility to decouple carbon emissions from economic growth. This study explores global and regional decoupling trends and further investigates the decoupling effects using the upgraded data. The results demonstrate that decoupling states of developed countries mostly converged on stable weak decoupling and switching to the strong decoupling status. Most developing countries did not show a clear decoupling state. Affluence level was the key offsetting effect of decoupling process, while energy intensity was the most significant effect to promote the decoupling process. Also, declines of energy intensity drove developed countries to strong decoupling state. Nonetheless, economic growth level dominated the decoupling process in developing countries, by contrast, there was no significant decreasing trend of energy intensity in these countries. These findings have feasible policy implications for implementing the INDCs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Decoupling; Developed countries; Developing countries; Extended LMDI technique; Intended nationally determined contributions; Tapio indicator","Developing countries; Global warming; Losses; Public policy; Decomposition methods; Decoupling; Developed countries; Economic development; Empirical analysis; Extended LMDI technique; Intended nationally determined contributions; Policy implications; Carbon; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; developing world; economic development; economic growth; empirical analysis; global warming; governance approach; international agreement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076428697

Objectives: Exploring the relationship between seven years long-term PM2.5 exposure and FPGLs in Chinese children and adolescents aged 6–17 years. Methods: Between September 2013 and December 2013, 16,489 participants aged 6–17 years were recruited using a four-staged, stratified, cluster sampling strategy from 7 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities of mainland China. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to estimate the relationship between annual PM2.5 exposure (2007–2013) and FPGLs stratified by sex and one-year age increments. Sociodemographic characteristics, living with both parents, early-life factors, behaviours, and infection symptoms were gradually adjusted from the crude model to regression model 6, and BMI was adjusted for in model 7. Results: The annual concentration of PM2.5 was 56.23 (±12.99) μg/m3. The mean FPGLs in the 8551 boys (4.75 mmol/L ± 0.52) was significantly higher than that in the 8194 girls (4.63 mmol/L ± 0.48) (P &lt; 0.0001). In model 6, for every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure, the FPGLs in boys and girls increased by 0.048 (95% CIs 0.031 to 0.065) mmol/L (P &lt; 0.0001) and 0.054 (95% CIs 0.039 to 0.069) mmol/L (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively. The FPGLs were significantly positively associated with long-term PM2.5 exposure at the ages of 12, 15 and 16 years in both the boys and girls and exhibited age differences in model 7. The prevalence of impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFP) and diabetes decreased by 0.8% when the exposure concentration of PM2.5 was reduced by 10 μg/m3 in model 6, which assessed the negative effects of PM2.5 exposure and revealed that 1,298,920 children and adolescents could have been protected from IFP and diabetes in 2013 in China. Conclusions: Long-term PM2.5 exposure may be an independent risk factor of elevated FPGLs. The adverse effect of PM2.5 exposure on FPGLs in children and adolescents could appear after 10 years of cumulative exposure. The precise intervention time was revealed as approximately 12 and 11 years in boys and girls, respectively. There are great public health implications associated with early prevention strategies for the eradication of the negative effects of long-term exposure to PM2.5 on FPGLs. © 2019","Adolescents; Air pollution; Diabetes; Fasting plasma glucose; PM2.5; Prevention time clues","Air pollution; Medical problems; Regression analysis; Adolescents; Children and adolescents; Exposure concentration; Generalized linear mixed models; Plasma glucose; PM2.5; Prevention time clues; Socio-demographic characteristics; Glucose; glucose; atmospheric pollution; child health; diabetes; glucose; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; risk factor; young population; adolescent; age; air pollution; Article; body mass; child; child behavior; China; Chinese; cluster analysis; concentration (parameter); cross-sectional study; demography; diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; family life; fasting; female; glucose blood level; human; impaired glucose tolerance; infection; long term exposure; male; particulate matter; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; regression analysis; risk factor; school child; sex difference; social status; statistical model; air pollutant; diet restriction; glucose blood level; particulate matter; China; Adolescent; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Blood Glucose; Child; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Fasting; Female; Humans; Male; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077650523

Studies suggest that diffuse radiation induces a higher LUE than direct radiation in short-term and site-scale experiments. The clearness index (CI), described as the fraction of solar incident radiation on the surface of the earth to the extraterrestrial radiation at the top of the atmosphere, is added to the parameterization approach to explain the conditions of diffuse and direct radiation in this study. Machine learning methods-such as the Cubist regression tree approach-are also popular approaches for studying vegetation carbon uptake. This paper aims to compare and analyze the performances of three different approaches for estimating global LUE and GPP. The methods for collecting LUE were based on the following: (1) parameterization approach without CI; (2) parameterization approach with CI; and (3) Cubist regression tree approach. We collected GPP and meteorological data from 180 FLUXNET sites as calibration and validation data and the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products and ERA-interim data as input data to estimate the global LUE and GPP in 2014. Site-scale validation with FLUXNET measurements indicated that the Cubist regression approach performed better than the parameterization approaches. However, when applying the approaches to global LUE and GPP, the parameterization approach with the CI became the most reliable approach, then closely followed by the parameterization approach without the CI. Spatial analysis showed that the addition of the CI improved the LUE and GPP, especially in high-value zones. The results of the Cubist regression tree approach illustrate more fluctuations than the parameterization approaches. Although the distributions of LUE presented variations over different seasons, vegetation had the highest LUE, at approximately 1.5 gC/MJ, during the whole year in equatorial regions (e.g., South America, middle Africa and Southeast Asia). The three approaches produced roughly consistent global annual GPPs ranging from 109.23 to 120.65 Pg/yr. Our results suggest the parameterization approaches are robust when extrapolating to the global scale, of which the parameterization approach with CI performs slightly better than that without CI. By contrast, the Cubist regression tree produced LUE and GPP with lower accuracy even though it performed the best for model validation at the site scale. © 2020 by the authors.

The solid-state fan (SSF) based on corona discharge is a good candidate. The SSF shows advantages in energy consumption, size, cost, and operability et al. compared to traditional cooling systems. In this paper, a high performance SSF was proposed and developed for heat transfer enhancement. The generation of corona wind in SSF was explored theoretically, and a velocity correction method was proposed. The operating durability was improved under the action of carbon nanotube and manganese dioxide. The structure and electrical parameters of SSF can be optimized to obtain higher corona wind velocity. A 3.96 m/s corona wind velocity was obtained for the optimized SSF. The prototype of SSF shows better cooling performance for both uniform heat flux and hot spot heat flux. A temperature drop of 22.3 °C can be obtained for a light-emitting diode (LED) at the applied voltage of 6 kV, and the luminous flux decreased by only 1.5%, which is a satisfactory result. A coated SSF can increase the corona wind velocity at the same voltage and minimize the ozone generation to prolong the service life. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corona wind; Electronics cooling; Heat transfer enhancement; Light-emitting diode; Solid-state fan","Carbon nanotubes; Cooling systems; Electric corona; Electronic cooling; Energy utilization; Heat flux; Heat transfer coefficients; Light emitting diodes; Manganese oxide; Thermoelectric equipment; Velocity; Wind; Cooling performance; Corona winds; Development and applications; Electrical parameter; Electronics cooling; Heat Transfer enhancement; Uniform heat flux; Velocity correction method; Heat transfer performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077734576

However, our understanding of the soil nitrogen (N) process through insights into the no-till effect on soil denitrification remains elusive. Here, we compiled data from 323 observations in 57 studies and quantified the responses of soil denitrification and the size and activity of the denitrifying community to no-till vs. conventional tillage. Across all studies, no-till significantly increased soil denitrification (85%) compared to conventional tillage. The no-till effect on soil denitrification was significantly dependent upon N fertilizer management, with a greater increase with N fertilization than without (101 vs. 46%). The increased soil denitrification under no-till was attributed to increases in the size and activity of the denitrifying community. On average, the potential denitrification activity, the total number of denitrifiers, and the abundance of denitrifying genes were increased by 66, 116, and 14–70%, respectively, in response to no-till. Our results demonstrate that soil denitrification under no-till leads to increased soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. This is supported by a larger response of soil N2O emission compared to the total denitrification, together with a significant increase (33%) in the (nirK + nirS)/nosZ ratio under no-till conditions. Therefore, the increased soil denitrification under no-till conditions may have negative impacts on soil N cycling and mitigation of N2O emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation tillage; Denitrifying genes; Microbial diversity; Nitrous oxide; Nutrient management","Forestry; Genes; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Soil conservation; Soils; Conservation tillage; Conventional tillage; Crop productivity; Microbial diversity; Nitrous oxide; Nutrient management; Potential denitrification; Soil carbon sequestration; Denitrification; abundance estimation; carbon sequestration; denitrification; fertilizer application; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrifying bacterium; nitrous oxide; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077974097

Three agricultural wastes (Wheat straw, peanut shell, and rice husk) were slowly pyrolyzed into biochar, which was subsequently added to the soil to reduce CO2 emissions from the soil, and to improve soil fertility as well as microbial community structure. The biochar and raw materials were added to the soil and cultured under controlled conditions, and then the CO2 emissions produced from the mixing. At the same time, this study used pot experiments to determine the effects of biochar on tobacco soil physical and chemical properties and, therefore, the microbial communities of the soil. This study suggests that (1) biochar can effectively reduce soil CO2 emission rate. Compared with the control, peanut shell biochar could reduce the total CO2 emissions of soil by 33.41%, and the total CO2 emissions of wheat straw biochar treatment was 90.25% lower than that of wheat straw treatment. (2) The soil's physical and chemical properties were improved. The soil bulk density of wheat straw biochar treatment kept 34.57% lower than that of the control as well as 21.15% lower than that of wheat straw treatment. The soil's organic carbon of peanut shell biochar treatment was 87.62% more than that of peanut shell treatment. (3) Biochar changed soil microbial community structure. (4) Biochar is suitable for tobacco growth. Peanut husk biochar significantly increased the total biomass of tobacco, and wheat straw biochar significantly increased tobacco root vigor. This study concluded that processing Chinese agricultural waste into biochar and adding it to the soil instead of burning it directly would be an effective means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to improve soil, and to promote crop growth. © 2020 by the authors.","agricultural waste; Biochar; CO2 emission; Fertility; soil; Tobacco","biochar; bulk density; carbon emission; community structure; microbial community; organic carbon; physicochemical property; soil fauna; soil fertility; soil microorganism; straw; tobacco; waste; China; Arachis hypogaea; Nicotiana tabacum; Triticum aestivum; Valeriana edulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082558916

We have examined the potential contribution of bioenergy to reducing BC's GHG emissions. The approach of combining life cycle assessment and economic evaluation to prioritize options should be applicable generally. Biomass availability, including forestry resources, agricultural waste and municipal solid waste, is estimated. Through simplified Life Cycle Assessment, GHG reduction potential of biogas, bioethanol, biofuels from hydrothermal liquefaction, and district heating are quantified, along with the associated GHG reduction costs. The analysis shows that existing biomass resources could yield 110–176 PJ per year, reducing GHG emissions by 13.0–15.7%. Bioenergy from waste streams is already cost-effective and should be prioritized in the short term. However, bioenergy from forestry resources, especially conversion to liquid biofuels, is prohibitively expensive, with GHG reduction cost exceeding CAD $300/t CO2-eq. The total extra cost required to achieve full utilization of BC's biomass resources is estimated as 0.8–2.4 billion dollars. To close the cost gaps between bioenergy and fossil fuels, both technological improvement and external cost adjustment through measures like carbon taxation will be needed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Economic assessment; GHG abatement costs; Greenhouse gas reduction; Life cycle assessment","Agricultural wastes; Bioethanol; Biomass; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Natural resources; Taxation; Timber; Bio-energy; Economic assessments; GHG abatements; Greenhouse gas reductions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Cost reduction; abatement cost; bioenergy; economic analysis; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078185871

Understanding of the acclimation responses of Anet and Gs under elevated [CO2] and/or temperature is limited. A field experiment of double rice (early rice-late rice rotation) was conducted using open-top chambers from 2013 to 2016 in Hubei Province, Central China, with two levels of [CO2] (ambient, ambient + 60 μmol mol−1) and two levels of temperature (ambient, ambient + 2°C). Averaging across the four-year experiment, elevated [CO2] and elevated temperature increased Anet by 2.4 %–9.4 % and 2.4 %–10.7 %, respectively at pre-heading stages. A positive interaction was observed between elevated [CO2] and temperature in early rice which further increased Anet, while the interaction was not additive in late rice. Elevated [CO2] caused lower Gs and partly offset the stimulation of elevated temperature on Gs at tillering and jointing. At post-heading stages, photosynthetic acclimation to elevated [CO2] was observed as the stimulation of Anet was not continued. Elevated temperature decreased Anet by 1.7 %–16.6 % and further accelerated photosynthetic down-regulation by elevated [CO2]. Warming reduced Gs at milking and maturity in early rice because of high ambient temperature, which resulted in stomatal limitation to photosynthesis, but its effects on Gs in late rice were positive because the ambient temperature was low. Generally, Gs acclimated to warming and CO2 enrichment in parallel with Anet when there were no environmental constraints. Earlier leaf senescence, decreased leaf SPAD, lower seed-setting rate or larger sink capacity caused by elevated [CO2] and/or temperature might directly or indirectly explain the down-regulation on photosynthesis after heading. Our results show that warming alters the acclimation of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to CO2 enrichment and the combined effects differ between growth stages, and indicate that co-elevation of [CO2] and temperature may increase dry matter productivity in the Chinese double rice cropping system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acclimation; Elevated temperature; Elevated [CO2]; Leaf photosynthesis; Stomatal conductance","acclimation; carbon dioxide; crop production; double cropping; dry matter; leaf; photosynthesis; rice; stomatal conductance; temperature effect; China; Hubei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078019966

At present, limited information is available to understand how plant N uptake and N use efficiency respond to elevated [CO2] and/or temperature in Chinese double rice cropping systems. A four-year field experiment was therefore conducted using open-top chambers with varying [CO2] (ambient, ambient +60 μmol mol− 1) and varying temperature (ambient, ambient +2 °C) in Hubei Province, Central China. Compared with ambient conditions, elevated [CO2] increased plant N uptake and N use efficiency, as measured by fertilizer N recovery efficiency (NRE), N agronomic efficiency (NAE), N physiological efficiency (NPE) and apparent system N use efficiency (NUEsys), in both early rice and late rice. CO2 enrichment tended to decrease soil mineral N concentration since more N was assimilated by plants. Elevated temperature led to lower plant N uptake and decreased NRE and NAE in early rice, due to a reduction in grain yield induced by heat injury. In contrast, warming increased plant N uptake and N use efficiency in late rice as no heat stress existed. Warming tended to increase soil mineral N concentration in early rice but had negligible effects in late rice. When elevated [CO2] and temperature were combined, the positive effects of CO2 enrichment for N utilization were able to compensate for the negative effects of warming in early rice, while the interaction was synergetic in late rice. Hence, co-elevation of [CO2] and temperature led to higher N use efficiency (64.6% for NUEsys across four years) and decreased annual N surplus by 28.6–36.5 kg N ha− 1 compared with ambient conditions. Our findings confirm that CO2 enrichment and air warming can improve N use efficiency at both crop level and system level in Chinese double rice cultivation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 enrichment; N surplus; N translocation; N uptake; N use efficiency; Warming","Climate change; Efficiency; CO2 enrichment; Elevated temperature; Limited information; N uptakes; N use efficiency; Rice cropping systems; Varying temperature; Warming; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; carbon dioxide; air temperature; biological uptake; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); crop production; cropping practice; cultivation; efficiency measurement; nitrogen; rice; translocation; warming; Article; China; climate change; climate warming; concentration (parameter); cropping system; environmental enrichment; grain yield; priority journal; rice; species cultivation; temperature; Oryza; soil; China; Hubei; Carbon Dioxide; China; Oryza; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076370040

Their role as “blue carbon” and their capacity to mitigate climate change, by means of Natural mechanism of Carbon Dioxide Removal (NCDR) from the atmosphere, has recently gained increased attention. However, available scientific methods such as guidelines and manuals to measure carbon stock and sequestration still rely heavily on field sampling activities and laboratory analyses. Despite their accuracy, neither of these methods are applicable for large-scale carbon inventories nor are they practical in areas with limited carbon-related data and laboratory resources. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether any of the seagrass-related variables (e.g., coverage, density and biomass) may be treated as a proxy that are both robust and practical to assess the capacity of seagrass to store and sequester carbon. We developed formulas, assessed their robustness, and used both the formulas and the proxy to estimate carbon stock and the sequestration potential of the seagrasses. Furthermore, this study aims to elucidate the carbon stock and sequestration potential capacity of the seagrass ecosystems in Indonesia. We used the data of seagrass- and carbon-related variables obtained from eleven study sites and developed several candidate formulas using the Robust Linear Mixed Models (rL MMs). We found that the best formulas are comprised of multiple seagrass-related variables that consistently include biomass and coverage. This suggests that a combination of biomass and coverage is the best proxy to estimate carbon stock; however, a single proxy of seagrass coverage is recommended for practical seagrass monitoring purposes by the local government.

Beaches are the interface between land and ocean, providing coastal protection from marine storms and cyclones3. However the presence of sandy beaches cannot be taken for granted, as they are under constant change, driven by meteorological4,5, geological6 and anthropogenic factors1,7. A substantial proportion of the world’s sandy coastline is already eroding1,7, a situation that could be exacerbated by climate change8,9. Here, we show that ambient trends in shoreline dynamics, combined with coastal recession driven by sea level rise, could result in the near extinction of almost half of the world’s sandy beaches by the end of the century. Moderate GHG emission mitigation could prevent 40% of shoreline retreat. Projected shoreline dynamics are dominated by sea level rise for the majority of sandy beaches, but in certain regions the erosive trend is counteracted by accretive ambient shoreline changes; for example, in the Amazon, East and Southeast Asia and the north tropical Pacific. A substantial proportion of the threatened sandy shorelines are in densely populated areas, underlining the need for the design and implementation of effective adaptive measures. © 2020, European Commission under exclusive license to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080886511

However, dung beetles have received little attention as consumers of large cadavers. In this study, we trapped copronecrophagous dung beetles on above-ground exposed piglet cadavers in 61 forest plots distributed over three geographically distinct regions in Germany, Central Europe. We examined the effects of land use intensity, forest stand, soil characteristics, vascular plant diversity and climatic conditions on dung beetle abundance, species richness and diversity. In all three regions, dung beetles, represented mainly by the geotrupid species Anoplotrupes stercorosus and Trypocopris vernalis, were attracted to the cadavers. High beetle abundance was associated with higher mean ambient temperature. Furthermore, A. stercorosus and T. vernalis were more abundant in areas where soil contained higher proportions of fine sand. Additionally, an increased proportion of forest understorey vegetation and vascular plant diversity positively affected the species richness and diversity of dung beetles. Thus, even in warm dry monocultured forest stands exploited for timber, we found thriving dung beetle populations when a diverse understorey was present. Therefore, forestry practices that preserve the understorey can sustain stable dung beetle populations and ensure their important contribution to nutrient cycles. © 2020 The Authors.

Cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) is a perennial biogas crop that provides more environmental services than maize. This study investigated (i) how to replace maize with cup plant as a biogas substrate in a large-scale biogas plant located in southwest Germany, and (ii) how to optimize the energy and material cycles of such a biogas plant given the new feedstock. The biogas plant produces 1000 m3 biogas per hour with plans for it to be combined with a large dairy farm (1000 dairy units). It was found that the substitution of maize with cup plant as a biogas substrate results in a methane yield reduction of 10% to 20% due to lower biomass yields. However, there exists a strong potential to increase both biomass yields and biogas substrate quality of cup plant by optimizing establishment procedures and better genotypes. Furthermore, cup plant provides food and shelter for open land animals, including birds and insects, and could hence be a suitable alternative to maize for large biogas plants, being more environmentally beneficial. Extracting proteins from cup-plant biomass could also help replace soy with locally produced protein for feeding cattle. Hydrothermal carbonization is a promising tool for closing nutrient cycles and for extracting phosphate from digestate, but more research is needed before it can be put into practice. © 2020 The Authors.

A framework for ecological risk assessments (ERAs) within the APPLICERA — APPLICable site-specific Environmental Risk Assessment research project promotes assessments that consider other soil quality parameters than only contaminant concentrations. The developed framework is: (i) able to differentiate the effects of contamination on SFs from the effects of other soil qualities essential for soil biota; and (ii) provides a robust basis for improved soil quality management in remediation projects. This study evaluates the socio-economic consequences of remediation alternatives stemming from a Tier 1 ERA that focusses on total contaminant concentrations and soil quality standards and a detailed, site-specific Tier 3 Triad approach that is based on the APPLICERA framework. The present study demonstrates how Tier 1 and Tier 3 ERAs differ in terms of the socio-economic consequences of their remediation actions, as well as presents a novel method for the semi-quantitative assessment of on-site ES. Although the presented Tier 3 ERA is more expensive and time-consuming than the more traditional Tier 1 ERA approach, it has the potential to lower the costs of remediation actions, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, reduce other environmental impacts, and minimise socio-economic losses. Furthermore, the remediation actions stemming from the Tier 3 ERA were predicted to exert far less negative ES effects than the actions proposed based on the results of the Tier 1 ERA. © 2019","Contaminated sites; Cost-benefit analysis; Ecological risk assessment; Ecosystem services; Remediation; Soil quality","Contamination; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Losses; Quality control; Quality management; Remediation; Risk assessment; Soil pollution; Soils; Urban growth; Contaminant concentrations; Contaminated sites; Ecological risk assessment; Ecosystem services; Environmental risk assessment; Quantitative assessments; Socio-economic consequences; Soil quality; Land reclamation; cost-benefit analysis; ecosystem service; PAH; risk assessment; soil pollution; soil quality; soil remediation; urban area; article; carbon footprint; cost benefit analysis; ecosystem; environmental impact; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; soil quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075966863

Desiccant coated heat exchangers (DCHEs) are the next-generation technologies that can improve the efficiency of the air-conditioning process by decoupling sensible and latent loads. Existing literature on DCHEs is primarily directed towards material development and performance evaluation from the first law of thermodynamics standpoint. However, to have an insight into the operation of DCHEs concerning its process irreversibility, performing the second law of thermodynamics analysis is necessary. This analysis will pinpoint the causes of irreversibility in the DCHE system and evaluate the useful work destroyed during its cyclic operation. In this paper, we have developed a general steady-state thermodynamic framework to study the performance of DCHEs from a combined first and second law perspective. Experiments were carried out to obtain the thermodynamic state properties of air, water, and desiccant that are necessary to perform energy and exergy analyses. Further, fundamental parametric studies were conducted to understand the influence of different desiccant type, varying operating parameters, and ambient conditions. Key results revealed that the regeneration process contributed to significant entropy generation rates and by reducing the hot water temperature by 10 °C, the second law efficiency illustrates improvement of almost two times. Additionally, by selecting to coat the heat exchanger with a composite polymer material instead of silica gel, the second law efficiency of DCHEs is enhanced by around 2.6 times. Lastly, a hybrid air-conditioning system comprising vapor-compression chiller and DCHE records 50% savings in energy consumption and yields two-times higher second law efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Desiccant coated heat exchangers; Energy analysis; Entropy generation; Exergy analysis; Experiments; Second law of thermodynamics","Driers (materials); Energy utilization; Entropy; Exergy; Experiments; Heat exchangers; Silica; Silica gel; Coated heat exchanger; Energy analysis; Entropy generation; Exergy Analysis; Second Law of Thermodynamics; Air conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078280956

Amongst the different pathways towards them, one alternative is the radical transition to a democratic low‐carbon energy system where the local scale has a key leading role. Under this scope, this research is framed within the mPOWER project, financed by the European Commission's H2020 programme, which promotes collaboration among different European municipalities in order to boost the transition to a renewable‐based participatory energy system. This paper presents the starting point of the mPOWER project, where the main energy features of 27 selected European municipalities are collected and analysed for the year 2016. An open public tender and selection process was carried out among European cities in order to choose the candidates to participate in mPOWER project. A view of this situation will be taken by the mPOWER project as a diagnostic baseline for the following steps: a peer‐to‐peer knowledge‐sharing process among these European municipalities, and subsequently, among a more extensive group. The first finding of the paper is that, even if those municipalities are trying to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they are highly dependent on fossil fuels, even in cases where renewable energies have significant presence. Second, their energy consumption is logarithmically related to the human development index and gross domestic product but not to the size of the cities and their climate characteristics. Finally, despite the work that these cities are making towards energy transition in general and within the mPOWER project in particular, the paper shows a high difficulty mapping their energy systems. The lack of accurate and unified data by the municipalities is a sign of disempowerment at a local and public level in the energy sphere and makes difficult any strategy to advance towards a bottom‐up energy transition. Among other goals, the mPOWER project aims to reveal these kinds of difficulties and help local authorities in managing their transition paths. © 2020 by the authors.

Researchers, city managers, and entrepreneurs have shown great interest in Smart Mobility, and several approaches have been proposed to reduce these non-desired effects. In this work, we focus on using the existing infrastructure (traffic lights) to tackle these negative issues, instead of investing in an expensive new one. The adequate planning of traffic lights (the configuration of the red-yellow-green cycles) improves vehicle flow (reducing jams, emissions, economic losses, etc.) and, at the same time, this improvement is obtained without any additional cost and without requiring the use of specialized applications by the drivers. We propose two versions of a Cellular Genetic Algorithm (cGA): synchronous and asynchronous. This method has previously shown very accurate results in real-world problems. Our approaches are evaluated with two closer-to-reality scenarios from urban areas located in the cities of Málaga (Spain) and Paris (France) using the popular micro-simulator Simulator of Urban Mobility (SUMO). A complex simulation of the city is mixed with an advanced (though light) algorithm to address a major problem in all cities.

As a leading country in the transition to low-emission transport, Norway must work to reduce their emissions while providing a safe level of service through winter maintenance operations. This article investigates the environmental impacts of winter road maintenance (WRM) in Norway both today and under a climate change scenario predicted for 2050. Methods: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental impact of the functional unit “average winter road maintenance in Norway on national and county roads per km.lane.” The ReCiPe (hierarchy) method was used to identify and categorize emissions related to WRM to show how different factors affect the system and to reveal hidden emissions hotspots. Real-time data from WRM vehicles were used to determine how fuel consumption is affected by gradient and weather. Producers and operators provided other relevant information on WRM vehicles. Official reports supplied information on deicer quantities used and the total distance driven by WRM vehicles in Norway. Results and discussion: The quantity of deicer used is the main source of emissions contributing toward all impact categories. The effect of deicer is likely to be even higher in certain impact categories. The environmental impact of the deicer after application is not included. The representation of WRM in existing emissions data is limited despite the considerable amount of deicer applied and the long distances that WRM vehicles travel. The results document how energy use throughout the system is another important source of emissions. Various parameters, such as road gradient, vehicle properties, driver behavior, and weather, affect the fuel consumption of WRM vehicles, with weather being the most important of these. Conclusions: Significant potential for emissions reductions from WRM was found, and WRM operations should be included in cold-climate road LCA studies. The environmental impacts of deicer application are especially high compared to the mechanical clearing of roads and contribute strongly to impact categories such as terrestrial, freshwater, and human toxicity and to the formation of particulate matter. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","De-icer; Deicer; Global warming; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle emission; NaCl; Toxicity; Winter road","chemical compound; deicer; fuel; unclassified drug; acidification; Article; carcinogenicity; climate change; cold climate; driving ability; ecotoxicity; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; human; ionizing radiation; land use; life cycle assessment; Norway; ozone depletion; particulate matter; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; traffic and transport; weather; winter road maintenance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079809663

Within the SE Asia region, areas of deeper peat present the greatest carbon stocks, and therefore the greatest potential for future carbon emissions from degradation and fire. They also support most of the remaining lowland swamp forest and its associated biodiversity. Accurate maps of deep peat are central to providing correct estimates of peat carbon stocks and to facilitating appropriate management interventions. We present a rapid and cost-effective approach to peat thickness mapping in raised peat bogs that applies a model of peat bottom elevation based on field measurements subtracted from a surface elevation model created from airborne LiDAR data. Results: In two raised peat bog test areas in Indonesia, we find that field peat thickness measurements correlate well with surface elevation derived from airborne LiDAR based DTMs (R2 0.83-0.88), confirming that the peat bottom is often relatively flat. On this basis, we created a map of extent and depth of deep peat (&gt; 3 m) from a new DTM that covers two-thirds of Sumatran peatlands, applying a flat peat bottom of 0.61 m +MSL determined from the average of 2446 field measurements. A deep peat area coverage of 2.6 Mha or 60.1% of the total peat area in eastern Sumatra is mapped, suggesting that deep peat in this region is more common than shallow peat and its extent was underestimated in earlier maps. The associated deep peat carbon stock range is 9.0-11.5 Pg C in eastern Sumatra alone. Conclusion: We discuss how the deep peat map may be used to identify priority areas for peat and forest conservation and thereby help prevent major potential future carbon emissions and support the safeguarding of the remaining forest and biodiversity. We propose rapid application of this method to other coastal raised bog peatland areas in SE Asia in support of improved peatland zoning and management. We demonstrate that the upcoming global ICESat-2 and GEDI satellite LiDAR coverage will likely result in a global DTM that, within a few years, will be sufficiently accurate for this application. © 2020 The Author(s).","Below-ground carbon stock; ICESat-2 DTM; LiDAR; Lowland; Peat; Peat thickness; Sumatra","biodiversity; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation status; field method; hydrocarbon exploration; ICESat; lidar; mapping method; peat; peatland; Greater Sunda Islands; Sumatra; Sunda Isles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082313398

In this study, we assess how the so called “rainforestation” approach, attempts to implement close-to-nature restoration strategies in humid tropic areas. One of the main objectives of the “rainforestation” approach as a form of a mixed-species plantation is the rehabilitation of structural and floristic integrity similar to natural conditions. We compared study areas located in the provinces of Leyte and Southern Leyte composed of logged forests (temporary plots), with logged forests on a permanent research plot and with mixed-species plantations. Basal area, carbon stocks, volume and biological diversity between study areas were calculated and compared, both for static and dynamic data. Results from the static data indicate that carbon stocks (89.30 t ha−1) and volume (262.56 m3 ha−1) of the mixed-species plantations (“rainforestation” approach) is significantly lower than that of the logged forests. However, when it comes to the capacity of the study areas for potential increments, the mixed-species plantations are not significantly different on basal area increment (0.99 m2 ha−1 yr−1), carbon stock increment (3.67 t ha−1 yr−1) and total volume increment (10.47 m3 ha−1 yr−1) as compared to the logged forests’ capacity (basal area—1.08 m2 ha−1 yr−1, carbon—4.06 t ha−1 yr−1 and total volume—11.98 m3 ha−1 yr−1). The species composition was only partly comparable to logged forests of the region, but overall tree species richness is high in comparison to classical plantation approaches. Previously logged forests are able to recover fast reaching surprisingly high values of carbon stocks and potential commercial timber volume. Our study indicates that “rainforestation” cannot fully replace the functionality of natural forests, but can provide a surprisingly multifunctional tool for landscape restoration, providing both timber and non-timber ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

While orbital properties, radii, and masses of the planets are nowadays well constrained, one of the fascinating open issues is the possibility that an environment hospitable to life could develop on some of these planets. Here, we use a simple formulation of an energy balance model that includes vegetation coverage to investigate the possibility of life affecting the climate of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Results confirm that planet TRAPPIST-1e has the best chance to be a habitable world and indicate that vegetation coverage significantly affects the resulting temperatures and habitability properties. The influence of vegetation has been evaluated in different scenarios characterized by different vegetation types, land-sea distributions and levels of greenhouse effect. While changes in vegetation type produce small changes, about 0.1%, in the habitable surface fraction, different land-sea distributions, by also affecting the vegetation growth, produce different temperature distributions. Finally, at latitudes where vegetation grows, the lowering of local albedo still represents a relevant contribution in settling the planetary temperature profiles even when levels of greenhouse effect higher than the Earth-like case are considered. © 2020.

The monthly integrated CO2 and total carbon (CO2+hydrocarbons (CnHm)) samples were collected to determine the excess 14C activity at the vicinity of the NPP. The measurements providing the 14C/12C ratio of the monthly integrated samples were carried out on a MICADAS type AMS at HEKAL. Due to the relatively low 14CO2 emission of PWR type Paks reactors and the local Suess effect, there was negligible excess 14C activity at the investigated stations in the pure CO2 fraction during the investigated 2 years period (2015–2016). On the contrary, there was a detectable (although minor) excess at every station in the CnHm fraction. In case of CO2, the average Δ14C excess was 3.8‰ and the highest measured value was 91.2‰ at the A3 station in February 2015. In case of CnHm, the average excess was 31.1‰ and the highest measured value was 319.1‰ at the A4 station in February 2016. We applied PC-CREAM 08 modelling to investigate the observed excess 14C activity at the environmental sampling stations, which depends on the distance from the NPP and the meteorological conditions, such as wind direction and wind speed. Meteorology data was collected at the operating area of the Paks NPP in a meteorology tower. The direct C-14 emission through the 120 m high stacks was measured in the NPP by liquid scintillation counting. These emission data and our model calculations explain the excess activity in the CnHm fraction at the A4 station, which is located only 915 m far from the NPP's stacks in the prevailing wind direction.

The recently observed average excess and highest excess data is similar to the published data in former studies (Molnár et al., 2007; Veres et al., 1995) on Paks NPP, the highest 14CO2 and 14CnHm excess are just a little higher than it was in the earlier studies, but in these former studies, the A3 station was not equipped with a radiocarbon monitoring unit and the level of radiocarbon emission was almost invisible from the wastewater discharge point. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2; Hydrocarbon; Modelling; Monitoring; Nuclear power plant; Radiocarbon","Carbon dioxide; Hydrocarbons; Meteorology; Models; Monitoring; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Sampling; Wind; Environmental sampling; Liquid Scintillation counting; Meteorological condition; Model calculations; Monitoring stations; Prevailing wind directions; Radiocarbon; Wastewater discharge; Pressurized water reactors; carbon; carbon 14; carbon dioxide; hydrocarbon; air sampling; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; background level; carbon isotope; emission; hydrocarbon; nuclear power plant; pollution monitoring; radiocarbon dating; air sampling; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric deposition; calculation; computer model; cosmic radiation; environmental monitoring; Hungary; liquid scintillation counting; meteorology; nuclear power plant; waste water; wind speed; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; radiation monitoring; wind; Hungary; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Hungary; Nuclear Power Plants; Radiation Monitoring; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076410830

Emission of nutrients and plant protection products (PPPs) from agricultural activity contributes to this. The Dutch government issued emission standards for nitrogen, evolving to zero discharge in 2027 for all greenhouse crops. However, to reduce the leaching of PPPs to surface and ground waters on the short-term, additional legislation came into force January 1, 2018. This regulation obliges Dutch growers to use purification equipment for the removal of 95% plant protection products (PPPs) when discharging drain water to sewage or surface water. This stimulates growers to look critically at opportunities to reduce the amount of discharge water, thus lowering the investment and operational costs of purification equipment. In this article, we describe the implementation of the obligated purification for different types of cultivation systems, including the development of an approval protocol for purification equipment. Depending on the amount of discharged water and company size, growers will choose between either applying an installation at the company level or cleaning the water cooperatively with a group of locally located companies. Another option, especially suitable for infrequent small amounts of discharge water, is rental of a mobile purification unit. In any of these three cases, the growers must use an approved installation. The installation and the applied technical specifications (for example ozone dosage) need to be tested with so-called Standardised Water following a strict protocol. An installation is approved by a governmental committee if tested correctly with a purification efficacy of 95% for each of the 11 active ingredients of PPPs in Standardised Water. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

It is squeezed between the revolution in unconventionals, which has increased the global supply of hydrocarbons and lowered their price, and the prospect of a global peak in oil demand, stemming from climate policies and the falling costs of alternative energy technologies. In the face of these challenges, media commentators have declared the death of OPEC as a cartel. This perspective argues that the claims about OPEC's demise are misguided for four reasons: (1) OPEC never acted as a cartel, let alone a powerful one; (2) thanks to its cheap production costs, OPEC's oil will remain competitive in a low-cost environment; (3) the group has always proved to be flexible; and (4) OPEC is still attractive to its member states, most notably as a source of prestige, as is illustrated by the recent re-entries of Indonesia and Gabon. That said, over the longer term OPEC will inevitably need to adapt to a changing external environment. A likely possibility would be for the club to gradually morph from an output-setting cartel into a forum for deliberation and information sharing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Nonetheless, there are several barriers toward widespread adoption of EVs. Moreover, as EV penetration increases in urban areas, uncoordinated charging may cause power outage. Deployment of EV charging network can allow EVs to communicate with the service provider to coordinate charging activities. Taking into account, increased growth of EVs, number of charging facilities will be inadequate in urban areas, so efficient EV charging management is required for managing and allocating scarce charging station (CS) resources. In this study, the authors have designed and implemented a smart EV charging management system utilizing charging strategy that includes effective reservation management and efficient slot allocation of CSs. Considering composite cost that includes waiting time, estimated charging time, estimated charging cost, user discontent factor and CS congestion impact in such a method, their scheduling scheme shall furnish a set of optimal solutions.

We studied the effect of eCO2 on wheat-root microbiome composition and plant development, with an emphasis on denitrifying communities. Wheat plants were grown in a greenhouse with continuous fertigation for 6 weeks under ambient CO2 (400 ppm) or eCO2 (850 ppm). The total bacterial community was quantified using qPCR with universal 16S rRNA gene primers, and denitrifying genes (nirK, nirS, nosZ) were measured. In addition, total (16S-based) and N2O-reducing (nosZ-based) bacterial community compositions in the soil and roots were analyzed by amplicon sequencing during plant growth. eCO2 had a significant impact on abundance of the studied denitrifying genes, particularly during the late stages of wheat growth before spike formation. Moreover, eCO2 had a significant impact on N2O-reducing community structure in roots. This effect was more pronounced on Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales, with a minor effect on Pseudomonadales. In addition, as expected, bacterial community structure (total and N2O-reducing bacteria), and denitrifying gene abundance, were primary influenced by habitat (soil vs. roots), and secondarily by plant developmental stage. In summary, it is suggested that eCO2 may change root microbiome, enhance wheat development and N demand without an increase in N2O emission. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","16S; CO2; N2O; nirK; nirS; nosZ; qPCR; Wheat","Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Genes; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; nirK; nirS; nosZ; qPCR; Wheat; Denitrification; bacterium; carbon dioxide; community composition; community structure; denitrification; developmental stage; gene; gene expression; microbial community; nitrous oxide; polymerase chain reaction; root; wheat; Bacteria (microorganisms); Burkholderiales; Pseudomonadales; Rhizobiales; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077661207

Higienópolis, 901, São Paulo, SP, Brazil","Over the last few decades, numerous initiatives have advanced forest landscape restoration in the Amazon, and in 2015 the Brazilian government set an ambitious, still-valid, target to restore 4.8 million hectares of degraded Amazonian land by 2030. This has contributed to an emergent global restoration network that connects multiple stakeholders and processes for funding, implementing and monitoring restoration actions in such a way that prepares various ecosystem services for market integration. The network arose in tandem with the evolution of an institutional framework that includes regulatory requirements within Brazil, global commitments linked to climate change mitigation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the growth of crowd-sourcing activism. This paper presents restoration activities as embedded within a Global Production Network (GPN) for an ecosystem service, which we use as a heuristic device to inform our understanding of emergent environmental governance structures. The resulting multi-scalar, networked mode of environmental governance is presented as a web-like structure co-created by institutional evolution, actor-specific strategies, and interactions between firms and non-firm actors. The article pays particular attention to a case study of how the restoration network manifests territorially in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the strong North-South orientation of dominant funding relationships, network governance is also seen to be relational. This is evident from the dissemination of ideas, supply models and seeding techniques from Upper Xingu to other regions of Brazil. These insights could be applied to improve landscape restoration outcomes, and indeed the provisioning of ecosystem services more broadly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Amazon; Climate change; Ecological restoration; Environmental governance; Global production networks; Payments for ecosystem services","climate change; ecosystem service; governance approach; institutional framework; orientation; restoration ecology; sustainability; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081549690

Climate change has negative impact on cotton production in major parts of the cotton-growing regions. It hampers not only the yield but also quality of fiber and has negative impact on socioeconomic conditions of farmers. Climate, crop, and economic multidisciplinary modeling approach are being used to assess the impact of climate change and development of adaptation strategies for sustainable cotton production. Climate change scenarios revealed the increase in both maximum and minimum temperature and uncertain rainfall patterns throughout the world and especially in dry and arid areas of the world like Pakistan. Rainfall would increase and decrease as projected by multi-GCMs and RCPs, and it is fact that these changes in climate would lead to negative effect on cotton crop production, and sustainable cotton production in the future is under threat due to climate variablity. Generally, mostly general circulation model (GCM) scenario projected the reduction in cotton yield as compared with the baseline during both timer periods and RCPs tested. Adaptation strategies can minimize the negative impact of climate change. So, changes in crop management practices (sowing, planting density, irrigation, and plant protection) may be good adaptation strategies for sustainable cotton production under changing climate scenarios of the world. Climate resilient cotton production system has potential to minimize the negative impacts of climate change on cotton crop by developing heat and drought resilient germplasm, mitigation technology to reduce GHG emission, and application of decision support system (DSS) and use of ICT-based technologies for sustainable cotton crop production. It is time to adopt climate, energy, and water smart cotton production technologies and practices for sustainable cotton production in the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

Weatherization retrofits, such as air sealing and insulation, lower residential energy consumption, resulting in reduced fuel and electricity-related emissions, improved ambient air quality, and avoided climate and health impacts. However, retrofits without adequate ventilation may worsen indoor air quality (IAQ) and lead to adverse health effects and costs that offset anticipated economic benefits. Building energy management and climate action plans often omit these potential consequences. This study presents a novel framework that quantifies health and energy costs and benefits related to residential energy-efficient retrofits. Energy savings from reduced consumption were estimated using historical energy prices. Reductions in ambient emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) precursors were translated to avoided health impacts using health damage functions. Indoor PM2.5-related health impacts were estimated by applying PM2.5 concentration-response functions to changes in IAQ. Health impacts were monetized using health impact assessment techniques and compared to retrofit-related savings. For a modeled gas-heated midrise multifamily building in Boston, MA, weatherization retrofits without ventilation or filtration retrofits led to household health costs that far exceeded energy savings and population-level health savings, given increases in indoor PM2.5 concentrations (3.1 μg/m3 and 20.4 μg/m3 for standard and high-performance retrofits, respectively).

As a result, current rural policy is no longer keeping pace with these changes. We propose an advanced rural policy development framework in order to deliver more accurate foresight for rural regions, contributing to new and enhanced policy interventions. The proposed framework combines new quantitative and qualitative epistemological approaches, previously unused unstructured data with traditional research information, grassroot perspective with expert knowledge, current situation analysis with forward looking activities. We argue that by using the proposed methods, policy teams will be able to enhance the effectiveness of their policy making processes, while rural stakeholders will be given the opportunity to become valuable policy influencers and solution co-creators. The ability to quickly experiment and understand the impact of a variety of policy solutions will result in saved time and costs. The framework is part of an ongoing experimental verification and testing in twelve pilot regions across Europe and Israel. © 2020 Faculty of Economics and Management.","European Union; Foresight; Policy; Rural areas; System dynamics modelling; Text mining","collective action; future prospect; rural area; rural policy; rural population; stakeholder; Europe; Israel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085626496

Recent evidence has shown that ecological intensification (EI) of agriculture can safeguard the environment from negative impacts of agricultural practices and simultaneously produce substantially higher crop productivity. Here, we employed the concept of EI and compared it with conventional agriculture or farmer's practice (FP). We explored the effects of EI and FP treatments on maize yield, N losses via potential nitrification activity (PNA), potential denitrification activity (PDA), N2O emissions, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen (N) cycling microbial populations associated with nitrification and denitrification in fluvo-aquic soil and black soil of North China. There were four treatments, i.e., EI N-, FP N-, EI N+, FP N + at each site, - and + indicate no N addition and N addition, respectively. The results revealed that across the two soils, N addition increased PNA and PDA; however, compared with the FP N + treatment, lower PNA and PDA were observed in the EI N + treatment. Similarly, the abundance of N cycling genes, including AOA amoA and AOB amoA, for nitrification and nirS, nirK, and nosZ for denitrification were significantly increased under N addition, and compared with the FP N + treatment, reduced abundance was noted in the EI N + treatment. N2O and GHG emissions were quantified, and it was observed that, in comparison to the FP treatment, reduced N2O and GHG emissions occurred in EI treatments in the two locations. EI with best management practices also increased crop yield relative to FP. Owing to higher N rates in FP treatments, substantial soil acidification was noted in FP plots but not in EI plots. In addition, PNA and PDA were significantly positively linked with soil nitrifying and denitrifying communities, particularly in the black soil. Moreover, the N availability pathway rather than soil acidification mainly regulated N cycling microbial communities. Our results suggest that EI could be a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach due to higher crop productivity and lower N losses via PNA, PDA, N2O, and GHG emissions, thus preventing the negative impact of agricultural practices, especially N fertilization, on the environment. © 2019 The Authors","Ecological intensification; GHG emissions; N cycling genes; N2O emissions; Potential denitrification activity; Potential nitrification activity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074389588

This share is continuously growing, mainly due to a general urbanization trend. This makes cities one of the major addressees with regards to CO2 reduction policies. A potential framework to deal with the challenges of radically reducing energy demand while grounding it mainly on renewable energy sources is the smart energy city (SEC) concept. This work provides an overview of the SEC concept by comparing three SEC models regarding their central characteristics and synthesizing them into a common approach. This comparison finds that all three models regard infrastructure, buildings, and transport as the main areas of intervention, such as upgrading the legacy grid into a smart grid or substituting vehicle fuels. Extending these findings, a unified smart energy city model (USECM) is proposed, which can serve for decision-makers as a basis for the conceptualization of SEC initiatives and directing their attention to critical aspects of SEC development. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Fuels; Renewable energy resources; Smart city; CO2 emissions; CO2 reduction; Decision makers; Energy demands; Renewable energy source; Smart energies; Three models; Vehicle fuels; Ubiquitous computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091967648

The present study aims to determine the changes in the essential oil composition and specific phenolic acid contents of purple basil in response to the increased temperature and CO2 levels. The plants were grown at two temperature levels (26/16 °C and 29/19 °C) and four different CO2 concentrations (400, 600, 800, and 1000 ppm). The essential oils were obtained by Clevenger apparatus and the essential oil compositions were determined using GC and GC/MS. Moreover, the concentrations of three important phenolic acid contents (mg/kg) were determined using HPLC. In the present study, it was determined that the main components of local Arapgir landrace of Turkish’s purple basil were methyl (Z)-cinnamate and linalool, and it is classified in the methyl (Z)-cinnamate/linalool group of Turkish Basil. Comparing different temperatures and CO2 concentrations, it was determined that the temperature increased total phenylpropanoid content. However, whereas the methylcinnamate didn’t change significantly with temperature, the linalool content was found to be higher at lower temperatures. In both temperature conditions, total phenylpropanoid content was found to be the highest in control CO2 concentration (400 ppm), and it showed regular decrease until 800 ppm. However, linalool increased regularly until 800 ppm. The highest data in rosmarinic and caffeic acids yields were obtained at lower temperatures, while there weren’t regular trends in CO2 concentrations.

However, there is still no unified opinion on the relationship between the type of diaspore dispersal and the processes of extinction and colonization. Here, descriptions of vegetation performed in the zone of impact from the Middle Ural Copper Smelter in the periods of high and low emission levels (1995–1998 and 2014–2016, respectively) have been analyzed to test two hypotheses: (1) the type of diaspore dispersal has an effect on plant vulnerability, with the species whose diaspores are dispersed farther being less vulnerable to habitat transformation; and (2) irrespective of the type of dispersal, recolonization is less intense under high than under low pollution levels. It has been found that the species richness of all plant groups highly varies in space: it decreases sharply in the zone of heavy toxic loads, but localities with high species richness occur even under conditions of heavy pollution. With the increasing pollution level, the species diversity within plant groups on a mesoscale (hundreds of meters) decreases more strongly than that on a macroscale (kilometers). Species with different types of diaspore dispersal differ from each other both in sensitivity to pollution and in the capacity for recolonization after reduction of emissions, but the relationship between vulnerability and the distance of diaspore dispersal is ambiguous. High sensitivity to pollution and low recolonization capacity have been revealed in species characterized by either the lowest (autochores) or the highest dispersal distance (epi- and endozoochores), with anemochores being the least vulnerable. The diversity of most groups in the zone of heavy pollution has remained low over the past 20 years; some positive shifts have occurred in myrmecochores and typical anemochores, with the dynamics of the latter being independent of pollution level. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","diversity; heavy metals; loss of species; plant dispersal; recolonization; reduction of emissions; temporal dynamics","anthropogenic effect; colonization; dispersal; emission control; habitat type; herb; perception; shrub; species diversity; species richness; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085001610

This includes both routine and severe weather events. For example, with precipitation events, local topography and weather influence water runoff and infiltration, which directly affect flooding as well as drinking water quality and availability. The impact of such events creates issues of public safety. Thus, the availability of highly localized weather model predictions focused on public safety and operations of infrastructure can mitigate the impact of severe weather. This is especially true if the lead time for the availability of such predictions enables proactive allocation and deployment of resources to minimize recovery time from severe events. Typically, information at such a scale is simply not available. Hence, the ability of municipalities to proactively respond to these events is limited. Available continental- or regional-scale weather models are not appropriately matched to the temporal or spatial scale of such operations. While near-real-time assessment of observations of current weather conditions may have the appropriate geographic locality, by its very nature it is only directly suitable for reactive response. To address this gap, we use state-of-the-art physical weather models at the spatial scale of the city's infrastructure to avoid this mismatch in predictability. Model results are coupled to data-driven stochastic models to represent the actionable prediction of weather (business) impacts. In some cases, an intermediate physical model may be required to translate predicted weather into the phenomena that lead to such impacts. We have applied these ideas to several cities with a diversity of impacts and weather concerns and show how this coupled model methodology enables prediction of storm impacts on local infrastructure. We also discuss how this concept can be extended to a climate scale in order to evaluate the potential localized impacts of a warming planet and the effectiveness of strategies being used to mitigate such impacts. © 1957-2012 IBM.",,"Meteorology; Potable water; Stochastic systems; Topography; Water distribution systems; Water quality; Weather forecasting; Coupled modeling; Local topography; Local weather conditions; Precipitation events; Severe weather events; State of the art; Urban infrastructure; Weather modeling; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081578872

While renewable portfolio standards and distributed generation policies were driven primarily by Democratic partisanship in state electorates, energy efficiency policies were less responsive to Democratic partisanship but marginally responsive to unified Democratic control of state government. Finally, these political factors did not measurably influence state severance taxes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; Renewable; State policy; Subnational","Digital storage; Distributed power generation; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Climate; Empirical analysis; Energy efficiency policies; Political factors; Renewable; Renewable portfolio standard; State policy; Subnational; Climate change; alternative energy; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; energy efficiency; energy policy; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078133335

Because microbial communities regulate nitrogen (N) fate in soils, some agrochemicals inhibit specific transformations to reduce N losses. Our study aimed to describe short-term dynamics of N-cycling genes and transcripts and N2O emissions after fertilization with urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) with or without the addition of nitrification plus urease inhibitors (NUI). The experiment consisted of 4-ha corn plots located in SE Ontario, Canada, where field-scale N2O emissions were monitored continuously using micro-meteorological techniques. Soil samples (0–10 cm) were taken 10 days before (baseline) and 2, 6, 9, 13 and 16 days after fertilization, and immediately flash-frozen. We co-extracted DNA and RNA and, using real-time PCR, quantified genes/transcripts targeting total bacteria (16S rRNA) and key N-cycling groups: ureolytic (ureC), ammonia-oxidizers (bacterial/archaeal amoA), nitrite-reducers (nirK/nirS) and N2O-reducers (clade I/II nosZ). The addition of NUI did not prevent an N2O flux event but reduced its duration and magnitude by more than 50%, and net cumulative N2O emissions for the sampling period by ~68%. NUI effects on N-cycling microorganisms were evident on day 9, as a transient reduction (40–56%) of ammonia-oxidizers and denitrifiers. Changes in transcripts were minor and only detectable on ureC (day 2), nirS and clade II nosZ (day 9). NUI did not interfere with temporal fluctuations in nirK and nirS, but it differentially affected nosZ response to a later rainfall event. Unexpectedly, N2O emissions were negatively associated with the ratio between nitrite-reducers and N2O-reducers. NUI effects on N-cycling microorganisms were minor and transient but resulted in a field-scale reduction in N2O emissions, possibly due to a combination of environmental factors and legacy effects from previous years of treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","DCD; Denitrification; NBPT; Nitrous oxide; RT-qPCR; Transcripts","Agricultural chemicals; Ammonia; Bacteria; Denitrification; Genes; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Soils; Urea; Environmental factors; Microbial communities; NBPT; Nitrous oxide; RT-qPCR; Temporal fluctuation; Transcripts; Urea ammonium nitrates; Soil pollution; DNA; emission; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; polymerase chain reaction; rainfall; RNA; soil nitrogen; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Bacteria (microorganisms); Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077656998

We performed comparative analysis of biomimetic scaffolds with poly‐L‐lactic acid (PLLA) matrix and three different p‐ methoxyphenyl functionalized carbon nanofillers, namely, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanohorns (CNHs), and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), dispersed at varying concentrations. qRT‐ PCR analysis of the modulation of neuronal markers in human circulating multipotent cells cultured on nanocomposite scaffolds showed high variability in their expression patterns depending on the scaffolds’ inhomogeneities. Local stimuli variation could result in a multi‐ to oligopotency shift and commitment towards multiple cell lineages, which was assessed by the qRT‐PCR profiling of markers for neural, adipogenic, and myogenic cell lineages. Less conductive scaffolds, i.e., bare poly‐L‐lactic acid (PLLA)‐, CNH‐, and RGO‐based nanocomposites, appeared to boost the expression of myogenic‐lineage marker genes. Moreover, scaffolds are much more effective on early commitment than in subsequent differentiation. This work suggests that biomimetic PLLA carbonnanomaterial (PLLA‐CNM) scaffolds combined with multipotent autologous cells can represent a powerful tool in the regenerative medicine of multiple tissue types, opening the route to next analyses with specific and standardized scaffold features. © 2020 by the authors.

While there is considerable relevant research, in the authors' experience this problem remains challenging for coastal engineering. This paper reviews important challenges in this respect and identifies three key actions to address them: (a) refocusing traditional practice towards more climate-aware approaches; (b) developing more comprehensive risk frameworks that include the multi-dimensionality and non-stationarity of their components and consideration of uncertainty; and (c) building bridges between risk assessment and adaptation theory and practice. We conclude that the way forward includes numerous activities including increased observations; the attribution of coastal impacts to their drivers; enhanced climate projections and their integration into impact models; more impact assessments at the local scale; dynamic projections of spatially-distributed exposure and vulnerability; and the exploration of inherently adaptive options. Given the complexity of the possible solutions, more practical guidance is required. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Coastal engineering; Non-stationarity; Risk; Uncertainty","Climate models; Coastal engineering; Earth (planet); Risk assessment; Risks; Adaptation; Climate change risks; Comprehensive risks; Multidimensionality; Non-stationarities; Practical guidance; Theory and practice; Uncertainty; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; coastal engineering; coastal protection; coastal zone management; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075788661

To explore host-symbiont cell cycle coordination in a marine symbiosis, we employed a model for coral-dinoflagellate associations: the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida) and its native microalgal photosymbionts (Breviolum minutum and Breviolum psygmophilum). Using fluorescent labeling and spatial point-pattern image analyses to characterize cell population distributions in both partners, we developed protocols that are tailored to the three-dimensional cellular landscape of a symbiotic sea anemone tentacle. Introducing cultured symbiont cells to symbiont-free adult hosts increased overall host cell proliferation rates. The acceleration occurred predominantly in the symbiont-containing gastrodermis near clusters of symbionts but was also observed in symbiont-free epidermal tissue layers, indicating that the presence of symbionts contributes to elevated proliferation rates in the entire host during colonization. Symbiont cell cycle progression differed between cultured algae and those residing within hosts; the endosymbiotic state resulted in increased S-phase but decreased G2/M-phase symbiont populations. These phenotypes and the deceleration of cell cycle progression varied with symbiont identity and host nutritional status. These results demonstrate that host and symbiont cells have substantial and species-specific effects on the proliferation rates of their mutualistic partners. This is the first empirical evidence to support speciesspecific regulation of the symbiont cell cycle within a single cnidarian-dinoflagellate association; similar regulatory mechanisms likely govern interpartner coordination in other coral-algal symbioses and shape their ecophysiological responses to a changing climate. IMPORTANCE Biomass regulation is critical to the overall health of cnidariandinoflagellate symbioses. Despite the central role of the cell cycle in the growth and proliferation of cnidarian host cells and dinoflagellate symbionts, there are few studies that have examined the potential for host-symbiont coregulation. This study provides evidence for the acceleration of host cell proliferation when in local proximity to clusters of symbionts within cnidarian tentacles. The findings suggest that symbionts augment the cell cycle of not only their enveloping host cells but also neighboring cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis. This provides a possible mechanism for rapid colonization of cnidarian tissues. In addition, the cell cycles of symbionts differed depending on nutritional regime, symbiotic state, and species identity. The responses of cell cycle profiles to these different factors implicate a role for speciesspecific regulation of symbiont cell cycles within host cnidarian tissues. © 2020 Tivey et al.","Aiptasia; Cell proliferation; Colonization; Coral; Exaiptasia pallida; Symbiodiniaceae; Symbiosis","adult; Aiptasia pallida; algal cell culture; article; biomass; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle progression; cell cycle S phase; cell population; cell proliferation; climate; controlled study; coral; deceleration; dinoflagellate; epidermis; female; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; host cell; human cell; human experiment; image analysis; male; nonhuman; nutritional status; phenotype; regulatory mechanism; symbiont; tentacle; animal; cell cycle; cytology; dinoflagellate; metabolism; physiology; sea anemone; species difference; symbiosis; Animals; Cell Cycle; Dinoflagellida; Nutrients; Sea Anemones; Species Specificity; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081665318

Five years after the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), we do not know how much risk reduction is practiced in rural Africa. The aim of this assessment is to ascertain the state of mainstreaming DRR in development planning in the rural jurisdictions of tropical Africa. One hundred and ninety-four plans of 21 countries are considered. Ten characteristics of the plans are examined: Climate trends, hydro-climatic hazards, vulnerability and risk assessments, alignment with Sendai Framework, vision, strategies and objectives, DRR actions, internal consistency, DRR relevance and funding sources, local and technical knowledge integration, public participation. It is found that local climatic characterization is almost always absent and risk reduction is an objective of the plans in one case out of three. Prevention actions prevail over those of preparedness. There is poor participation in the plan preparation process and this limits the implementation of the actions. A modification of the national guidelines on the preparation of LDPs, the orientation of official development assistance towards supporting climate services and the training of local planners, together with the increase of financial resources in local jurisdictions are essential for improving DRR at local scale. © 2020 by the authors.

This is especially the case for industries that are both emission intensive and trade exposed. A poster child for these vulnerable industries is the cement industry. In this article, I examine the impact of British Columbia's carbon tax on cement trade. I use quarterly data on volume of imports, exports, and net exports of cement between cement-producing Canadian provinces and the United States, as well as the world. Through a series of econometric models, findings suggest that net exports were reduced as a result of the policy. As a share of average domestic cement production, estimates point to reduced net exports between 13 and 18 percent. Further empirical investigation suggests that reductions in domestic production due to the policy stems from this trade effect, not reductions in domestic consumption. I therefore discuss policy options to address these competitiveness pressures in the cement industry. © Canadian Public Policy / Analyse de politiques, March / mars 2020.","Carbon pricing; Cement; Competitiveness effects; International trade; Support policies","carbon emission; cement (construction material); competitiveness; emissions trading; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; pollution tax; Canada",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090155980

While the past climatic changes were forced differently than the ongoing and future anthropogenic changes, such periods may provide insights into potential future climate impacts and ecosystem feedbacks, especially over centennial-to-millennial timescales that are often not covered by climate model simulations. As part of the initiatives to better understand the polar climate system and its global linkages, Indian scientists have been undertaking palaeoclimatic studies, mainly from the Antarctica, its margins and the surrounding Southern Ocean. Antarctic palaeoclimate records come primarily from proxy records of ice cores or marine and lake sediment cores. Among ice core records, the Indian contributions have been focussing on a network of annually resolved shallow depth ice cores to reconstruct the Antarctic climate variability and its regional and global climatic teleconnections, especially during the past few centuries. Compared to this, the Antarctic lake sediment records have focussed on long-term climate variability, especially during the late Quaternary. Recently, as part of the collaborative initiatives under the International Ocean Discovery Program, Indian scientists have been studying longer sedimentary records from the Antarctic continental margin that offer opportunity to study the evolution and dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheets since their formation during the Cenozoic. © 2020 International Union of Geological Sciences.

Here, we emphasize their major role in the co-design of tailored coastal climate services (CCS) based on a case study of French Polynesia. In this perspective, we assessed climate change perceptions by public authorities and identified their needs with regard to climate-related science. This assessment included an analysis of the decision-making context, semi-structured interviews with practitioners representing 23 administrative divisions directly or indirectly involved in climate change issues, and a workshop dedicated to discussing needs in terms of CCS. Generally, respondents did not identify climate change as a major current issue in French Polynesia; they showed more concern for economic growth, pollution, land tenure, and land use planning. However, interviewees were concerned about future impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) and ocean warming and acidification, mentioning in particular their detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems, shoreline position, economy (especially agriculture and the blue economy), and freshwater resources. The interviewed practitioners showed particular interest in SLR projections for future decades up to a century, and for knowledge on expected impacts to critical infrastructure, coastal systems, and natural resources. Practitioners’ needs made it possible to co-define four CCS to be developed: (1) the design of sea-level-rise-compatible critical infrastructures (airports and ports); (2) adapting to the risk of destabilization of beaches and reef islands; (3) professional training on climate change impacts and adaptation, including an analysis of potentially emerging new jobs in the SLR context; and (4) the development of participatory approaches for observing climate change impacts. While the co-development of these CCS will require a multi-year engagement of stakeholders concerned with climate change adaptation, our results already shed light on specific needs for salient CCS in highly vulnerable tropical island territories. © Copyright © 2020 Terorotua, Duvat, Maspataud and Ouriqua.","adaptation to climate change; climate change perception; climate governance; coastal climate services; French Polynesia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082653704

This paper estimates the impact of aviation contrails on climate forcing for flight track data in Japanese airspace and propagates uncertainties arising from meteorology and aircraft black carbon (BC) particle number emissions. Uncertainties in the contrail age, coverage, optical properties, radiative forcing, and energy forcing (EF) from individual flights can be 2 orders of magnitude larger than the fleet-average values. Only 2.2% [2.0, 2.5%] of flights contribute to 80% of the contrail EF in this region. A small-scale strategy of selectively diverting 1.7% of the fleet could reduce the contrail EF by up to 59.3% [52.4, 65.6%], with only a 0.014% [0.010, 0.017%] increase in total fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. A low-risk strategy of diverting flights only if there is no fuel penalty, thereby avoiding additional long-lived CO2 emissions, would reduce contrail EF by 20.0% [17.4, 23.0%]. In the longer term, widespread use of new engine combustor technology, which reduces BC particle emissions, could achieve a 68.8% [45.2, 82.1%] reduction in the contrail EF.

In this perspective, perovskites are divided into four groups based on the B site element, namely titanates, tantalates, niobates and ferrites. The synthesis parameters and factors affecting the efficiency of photocatalysts are discussed.

The alarming increase in pollution levels results in decreased visibility considering increased traffic and emission. A complex and accurate climate modelling is essential to enable precise weather forecasting in this scenario.

Hence, this paper addresses the question: What are the arguments for governing green and atmospheric water? In order to address this question, we have undertaken a scoping analysis of the literature on green and atmospheric water. We conclude that water governance must proactively address green and atmospheric water since: (a) blue water represents only a part of the available fresh water; (b) blue river basins represent only a subset of the wider systemic nature of water; (c) land use change has significant impacts on various water flows, which all may need to be governed; (d) climate variability and change influences blue, green, and atmospheric water availability; (e) an understanding of the socio-ecological uses of the different colors of water is critical for a more optimal and legitimate governance of water; (f) new water technologies make it increasingly possible to modify the use of green and atmospheric water; and (g) global trade infrastructures pressurize local green water resources. Neglecting the need for explicit governance of green and atmospheric water could create new forms of “water grabbing” that would impact water availability beyond the basin scale.

However, limited studies have estimated regional total factor efficiency (TFE) and marginal abatement cost (MAC) of agricultural pollutants in developing countries. Multiple directional vectors have not been considered when using directional distance function approach to analyse agriculture production. In this study, we estimate TFE and MAC of COD emissions for the agricultural sector in China between 2006 and 2015. Three alternative scenarios, represented by three direction vectors, have been considered in a parametric directional approach. We find that there is no substantial efficiency improvement in China's agricultural production when all resource use and output production are considered. Averagely, eastern coastal provinces perform much better than western inland provinces. The average MAC estimate across all three scenarios is 11,640 yuan/tonne. In addition, the MAC curves under three scenarios are generally characterised by increasing trends during 2006–2015. Abatement cost profiles are also characterised by substantial regional heterogeneity in MAC. Provinces in the East region have lower abatement costs than provinces in the West region. In general, our analysis suggests that there is space for China to achieve simultaneous improvements in agricultural production, pollution reduction, and resource saving, and agriculture is a potentially more cost-effective sector to reduce COD emissions compared to other sectors. © 2019","Agricultural COD emissions; Marginal abatement cost; Mitigation policy scenarios; Parametric non-radial distance function; Total factor efficiency","Agricultural chemicals; Agriculture; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Efficiency; Oxygen; Pollution; Agricultural pollutants; Agricultural productions; Agriculture productions; Directional distance function; Efficiency improvement; Marginal abatement costs; Mitigation policies; Radial distance; Chemical oxygen demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076236091

Specifically, stakeholders of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) want these companies to legitimize their actions regarding carbon emissions reductions reporting. The current study aims to explore the impact of carbon emission trading system participation and the level of internal control on the quality of carbon emission disclosures. Using a sample of Chinese state-owned electricity companies from 2012 to 2018 and employing the difference-in-differences (DID) method, we find a positive impact of the carbon emission trading system participation on the quality of carbon emission disclosures, which suggests that the state-owned electricity companies’ participation in the carbon emission trading system leads to the higher quality of carbon emission disclosures. Likewise, we find a positive relationship between the level of internal control and the quality of carbon emission disclosures, which suggests that the state-owned electricity companies with stronger internal control provide the higher quality of carbon emission disclosures. In addition, we find that the findings are only significant in the case of central SOEs as compared to local SOEs.

In order to accurately predict the surface topography evolution and to reveal the intrinsic physical mechanism during the process of laser mitigation, experiments of localized CO2 laser mitigation were firstly carried out to analyze the features of mitigated craters under different laser powers. Then a multi-physics coupled mathematical model was developed based on the fluid control equation, heat and mass transfer equation and material phase transition kinetics to investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of laser interaction with silica. The model considered the effects of Marangoni convection, gravity, capillary force and vaporization recoil pressure, as well as the nonlinear variation of physical parameters of silica material with respect to temperature. The results showed that with the increase of laser power, the material ablation and the appearance of raised rim occurred simultaneously. The depth of the mitigated crater increased sharply when the threshold for material ablation was attained, while the lateral dimension increased linearly. The vaporization recoil pressure was found to be the dominant factor for the formation of Gaussian crater with the raised rim feature. The capillary force caused the material at the edge of the molten pool to have a tendency to reflow after laser shutting down, but it was too small to change the surface topography. This work could significantly contribute to the understanding of laser mitigation process, which laid the foundation for the accurate prediction and evaluation of surface quality of CO2 laser repaired fused silica surface. © 2020 The Authors","CO2 laser; Damage mitigation; Fused silica; Physical mechanism; Surface topography evolution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077925354

To achieve a large IEA size consisting of more than four countries, we propose a novel method of cooperative R&D investment and recovery and a licensing fee for the adoption of advanced technology, by applying the mechanism of a joiner's gain function. The core findings of this study reveal that: (i) a large agreement can be achieved by considering R&D investment, R&D recovery, and a licensing fee; (ii) the diffusion process of advanced technology is clarified; (iii) non-investors’ adoption of an advanced abatement technology can be prevented by setting a licensing fee and instead, they participate and invest in R&D via agreement; (iv) a full participation state can be more easily sustained than any other number of participants. Our approach shows the diffusion process of advanced abatement technology after R&D. Consequently, this paper fills a research gap in cooperative R&D methods and the diffusion process of advanced technologies and provides a hopeful prospect for achieving full participation in IEAs and a large reduction in GHG emissions by way of cooperative R&D. © 2019 The Author","Breakthrough technology; Environmental R&D; International environmental agreements; Investment; Participation game","Diffusion; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Pollution control; Abatement technologies; Advanced technology; Breakthrough technology; Diffusion process; Gain function; International environmental agreements; Participation game; Substantial reduction; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077741706

This study analyses land rental relationships in Slovakia, including legal rental regulations, and identifies the impact of certain factors, such as the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments, and geographical and economic factors on land rental prices. From the results of econometric models, it was found that certain CAP payments have an effect on rental prices, mainly the single area payment scheme (SAPS), payments for agri-environmental-climate schemes (AECS), and animal welfare, which were found to have positive effects. Other important factors found to influence rental prices are economic indicators (such as total revenue share of total costs, share of revenue from agricultural production in terms of total revenue, share of production costs as a percentage of total costs, wages, and number of employees) and geographical factors (such as region or partial production areas). However, the distance of the farm from the district city (LAU 1) and the share of farmland affected by natural constraints do not considerably affect rental prices in Slovakia. Land consolidation is a statistically significant factor according to themodels; however, its impact is almost zero.

Hydrothermal breccia pipes formed in the Karoo Basin in South Africa during emplacement of igneous sills in the Karoo large igneous province represent one of the best-exposed expressions of such venting structures. Earlier work has shown that degassing of thermogenic CO2 and CH4 through the breccia pipes may have contributed to the Early Jurassic environmental changes. Here, we present the first detailed analysis of the distribution of breccia pipes in the western parts of the Karoo Basin. We mapped 431 pipes in a 650 km2 area using outcrop data. The pipes are rooted in contact aureoles around four sills emplaced in organic-rich Ecca Group shale, and thermal modeling of sill cooling and contact metamorphism gives a maximum temperature of 675 °C near the sill contacts, sufficient to convert a significant fraction of the organic carbon to gas. Model estimates indicate that metamorphism in the 650 km2 area generated 75–88 Gt of CO2, depending on actual sill thicknesses and emplacement levels. When further up-scaled, an area of 7400–8700 km2 (i.e., less than 2% of the area in the Karoo Basin intruded by sills) would be required to generate 1000 Gt of CO2. In order to characterize the degassing pipes, their geographical positions and diameters were analyzed using several point-pattern methods. The results showed that the pipes (1) have diameters in the 11–177 m range (average 44 m), (2) are spaced with an average nearest-neighbor distance of 452 m, and (3) are overall randomly spaced but with weak overdispersion at very small scales (&lt;50 m) and weak clusters at larger scales (400–3000 m). In contrast to studies of volcanic pipe spacing, this study on breccia pipes does not indicate that the pipe spacing is controlled by any large-scale geophysical parameters such as crustal or basin thicknesses. Conclusions point to the pipes being formed following sill emplacement and pressure increase in the low-permeability organic-rich shale, followed by rapid carbon degassing, emphasizing their important role in the Early Jurassic climate change and oceanic anoxic event. © 2020 The Geological Society of America.

As with other developing countries, Malaysia’s challenge is to decarbonize its energy-centric economy in the face of population growth pressures and substantial levels of poverty. Drawing on extensive interviews with both public and private stakeholders, we examine how Malaysia has launched its transition to a decarbonized development path. Based on our multi-year analysis, we identify key breakout factors, including behavioral transformations, institutional shifts, and action by a broad network of actors that have allowed Malaysia to begin decarbonizing its economy. At the same time, we note that federal-state friction, limited government capacity, the absence of a centralized management agency, the lack of international funding, incipient environmental awareness, and numerous barriers to investment in renewable energy reinforce carbon lock-in. Our analysis suggests ways in which other rapidly developing countries can learn from Malaysia’s initial successes and challenges. © Copyright © 2020 Susskind, Chun, Goldberg, Gordon, Smith and Zaerpoor.","carbon emission; climate change; decarbonization; lock-in; Malaysia; renewable and sustainable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083160656

Climate change–framing research has shown that people are motivated or deterred by different framing of issues in policy documents and other discourse. Considering this, there is a dearth of understanding of framing decisions in climate change–related policy documents that often inform how different levels of government communicate about and act to address climate change. We contribute a content analysis of framing in climate change–related policy documents tied to three western US cities/states (Phoenix, AZ; Denver, CO; Las Vegas, NV) that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. We discover that climate change is most frequently framed in terms of negatives/losses, both in water-related and climate change documents. Other common frames differed between the water-related and climate change–specific documents. The practical implications of climate change framing decisions are discussed in the context of recent political events in the United States. We emphasize the significance of understanding how local level actors frame climate change, as researchers and government officials have acknowledged the burden of responding to climate change progressively falls to local actors. We call for increased research on framing decisions and their connections to the perceived solution space, or suite of possible actions, to strengthen efforts by local actors to contribute to addressing climate change generally and to sustainably govern water resources specifically. © 2019, AESS.","Cities; Climate change; Content analysis; Discourse; Environmental governance; Urban","catastrophe theory; climate change; decision analysis; development discourse; drought; environmental planning; environmental policy; governance approach; international agreement; urban area; vulnerability; water planning; Arizona; Colorado; Denver; Las Vegas; Nevada; Phoenix; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076535577

The purpose of using this device is to take the thermal energy of the warm drainage water and transfer it to incoming cold water. Many DWHR systems work optimally in a vertical position. Due to the waste water flow in drain pipes. But these requirements are prohibitive to be applied on a large scale of this technology, as many buildings do not have enough space to accommodate the vertical DWHR in their sewage drainage system. This paper presents testing and analysis of the horizontal DWHR system. The result of the test showed the level of effectiveness of the horizontal DWHR unit created by 25.54 percent.

Hence, for these species, the achievement of realistic models useful in conservation planning may depend on the appropriate consideration of habitat information in model calibration. We aimed to evaluate the role of different types of habitat predictors, along with habitat-partitioning, to improve model inference, detect non-stationary responses across habitats and simulate the impact of sampling bias on spatial predictions. As a case study, we modelled the occurrence of the multi-habitat plant species bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) in the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain), where it represents a basic trophic resource for threatened brown bear and capercaillie. We used MaxEnt to compare a baseline model approach calibrated with topo-climatic variables against three alternative approaches using explicit habitat information based on vegetation maps and remote sensing data. For each approach, we ran non-partitioned (all habitats together) and habitat-partitioned models (one per habitat) and evaluated model performance, overfitting and extrapolation. The highest performance was for habitat-partitioned models including habitat predictors. The lowest overfitting was for the baseline non-partitioned model, at the cost of achieving the highest predicted fractional area. The extrapolation success of habitat-partitioned models was low, with the highest performance for the baseline approach. Our results highlight that multi-habitat species responses are non-stationary across habitats, with habitat-biased data resulting in weak spatial predictions. When modelling the distribution of multi-habitat species at regional scale, we recommend using habitat-partitioned models including habitat predictors, either vegetation maps or remote sensing data, to improve the realism of spatial outputs and its applicability in regional conservation planning. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Habitat maps; Stationary responses; Truncated responses; Vaccinium myrtillus; Vegetation predictive models","conservation planning; habitat structure; niche partitioning; numerical model; remote sensing; sampling bias; spatial distribution; vegetation structure; Cantabrian Mountains; Spain; Ursus arctos; Vaccinium myrtillus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076916279

Accordingly, this study investigated the efficacy of an allosteric hemoglobin modulator (voxelotor) to enhance arterial oxygen saturation during low-intensity exercise in hypoxia. Eight normal healthy subjects (36 ± 7 yr; 73.8 ± 9.5 kg; 3 women) completed a submaximal cycling test (60 W) under normoxic (FIO2: 0.21; O2 partial pressure: 144 mmHg) and hypoxic (FIO2: 0.125; O2 partial pressure: 82 mmHg) conditions before (day 1) and after (day 15) 14 days of oral drug administration. While stationary on a cycle ergometer and during exercise, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and dyspnea, oxygen consumption (VO2), and cardiac output (Q) were measured noninvasively, while arterial blood pressure (MAP) and blood gases (SaO2, PaO2, and PaCO2) were measured invasively. The 14-day drug administration left shifted the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC; p50 measured at standard pH and PCO2; day 1: 28.0 ± 2.1 mmHg vs. day 15: 26.1 ± 1.8 mmHg, P < 0.05). RPE, dyspnea, VO2, Q, and MAP were not different between day 1 and day 15. SaO2 was similar during normoxia on day 1 and day 15 while stationary but higher during exercise (day 1: 95.2 ± 0.4% vs. day 15: 96.6 ± 0.3%, P < 0.05). SaO2 was higher during hypoxia on day 15 while stationary (day 1: 82.9 ± 3.4% vs. day 15: 90.9 ± 1.8%, P < 0.05) and during exercise (day 1: 73.6 ± 2.5% vs. day 15: 84.8 ± 2.7%, P < 0.01). PaO2 and PaCO2 were systematically higher and lower, respectively, after drug (P < 0.01), while the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was unchanged suggesting hyperventilation contributed to the rise in SaO2. Oral administration of voxelotor left shifted the ODC and stimulated a mild hyperventilation, leading to improved arterial oxygen saturation without altering VO2 and central hemodynamics during rest and low-intensity exercise. This effect was more pronounced during submaximal hypoxic exercise, when arterial desaturation was more evident. Additional studies are needed to determine the effects of voxelotor during maximal exercise and under chronic forms of hypoxia. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In humans, a novel allosteric hemoglobin-oxygen affinity modulator was administered to comprehensively examine the cardiopulmonary consequences of stabilizing a portion of the available hemoglobin in a high-oxygen affinity state during submaximal exercise in normoxia and hypoxia. Oral administration of voxelotor enhanced arterial oxygen saturation during submaximal exercise without altering oxygen consumption and central hemody-namics; however, the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide was reduced and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen was increased implying that hyperventilation also contributed to the increase in oxygen saturation. The preservation of arterial oxygen saturation and content was particularly evident during hypoxic submaximal exercise, when arterial desaturation typically occurs, but this did not influence arterial-venous oxygen difference.

Previous studies indicated that SO sea ice could dynamically link several processes of carbon sequestration, but these studies relied on models with simplified ocean and sea ice dynamics or snapshot simulations with general circulation models. Here, we use a transient run of an intermediate complexity climate model, covering the past eight glacial cycles, to investigate the orbital-scale dynamics of deep ocean ventilation changes due to SO sea ice. Cold climates increase sea ice cover, sea ice export, and Antarctic Bottom Water formation, which are accompanied by increased SO upwelling, stronger poleward export of Circumpolar Deep Water, and a reduction of the atmospheric exposure time of surface waters by a factor of 10. Moreover, increased brine formation around Antarctica enhances deep ocean stratification, which could act to decrease vertical mixing by a factor of four compared with the current climate. Sensitivity tests with a steady-state carbon cycle model indicate that the two mechanisms combined can reduce atmospheric carbon by 40 ppm, with ocean stratification acting early within a glacial cycle to amplify the carbon cycle response. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

However, resilience of ECMF to future climates is uncertain. We forecast these changes over the extent of North American Pinaceae forests. Location: About 68 sites from North American Pinaceae forests ranging from Florida to Ontario in the east and southern California to Alaska in the west. Taxon: Ectomycorrhizal fungi (Asco- and Basidiomycetes). Methods: We characterized ECMF communities at each site using molecular methods and modelled climatic drivers of diversity and community composition with general additive, generalized dissimilarity models and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN). Next, we projected our models across the extent of North American Pinaceae forests and forecast ECMF responses to climate changes in these forests over the next 50 years. Results: We predict median declines in ECMF species richness as high as 26% in Pinaceae forests throughout a climate zone comprising more than 3.5 million square kilometres of North America (an area twice that of Alaska state). Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions can reduce these declines, but not prevent them. The existence of multiple diversity optima along climate gradients suggest regionally divergent trajectories for North American ECMF, which is corroborated by corresponding ECMF community thresholds identified in TITAN models. Warming of forests along the boreal–temperate ecotone results in projected ECMF species loss and declines in the relative abundance of long-distance foraging ECMF species, whereas warming of eastern temperate forests has the opposite effect. Main Conclusions: Our results reveal potentially unavoidable ECMF species-losses over the next 50 years, which is likely to have profound (if yet unclear) effects on ECMF-associated biogeochemical cycles. © 2020 The Authors.

Ecological restoration can restore desirable ecosystem functions, such as creating habitat for animal conservation and carbon sequestration as woody biomass. In order to maintain these beneficial ecosystem functions, restoration projects need to mature into self-perpetuating communities. Here we compared the ecological attributes of two types of restoration, “active” tree plantings with “passive” natural forest regeneration (“natural regrowth”) to existing remnant vegetation in a cleared agricultural landscape. Specifically, we measured differences between forest categories in factors that may predict future restoration failure or ecosystem collapse: aboveground plant biomass and biomass accrual over time (for regrowing stands), plant density and size class distributions, and diversity of functional groups based on seed dispersal and growth strategy traits. We found that natural regrowth and planted forests were similar in many ecological characteristics, including biomass accrual. Despite this, planted stands contained fewer tree recruit and shrub individuals, which may be due to limited recruitment in plantings. If this continues, these forests may be at risk of collapsing into nonforest states after mature trees senesce. Lower shrub density and richness of mid-story trees may lead to lower structural complexity in planting plots, and alongside lower richness of fleshy-fruited plant species may reduce animal resources and animal use of the restored stand. In our study region, natural regrowth may result in restored woodland communities with greater conservation and carbon mitigation value. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration","carbon sequestration; climate change; diversity; functional traits; plant biomass; size class distribution","aboveground biomass; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem function; reforestation; restoration ecology; species richness; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075712847

It is centered around the main journals in the field of climate adaptation of the built environment, then expanded to map the extent of scientific publications about climate adaptation in general. Studies that regard future climate scenarios have been of particular interest. The majority of the identified literature concerns climate change impacts on buildings in warm climates, with overheating being seen as the greatest challenge. Additionally, few empirical studies are found; most identified research is based on computer simulations or literature reviews. The volume of research on the consequences of climate change on buildings in cold regions is surprisingly small, considering the pecuniary stakes involved. The predictions of climate scenarios suggest regulatory/policy measures on climate adaptation should be taken as quickly as possible to avoid greater costs in the future. However, further research into future scenarios is also essential. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation measures; Buildings; Climate change; Impact","adaptive management; climate change; computer simulation; empirical analysis; future prospect; literature review; nature-society relations; publishing; regulatory framework; research work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085969458

An accurate assessment of its spatial and temporal distribution is mandatory to conduct epidemiological studies able to estimate long-term (e.g., annual) and short-term (e.g., daily) health effects. While spatiotemporal models for particulate matter (PM) have been developed in several countries, estimates of daily nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) concentrations at high spatial resolution are lacking, and no such models have been developed in Sweden. We collected data on daily air pollutant concentrations from routine monitoring networks over the period 2005-2016 and matched them with satellite data, dispersion models, meteorological parameters, and land-use variables. We developed a machine-learning approach, the random forest (RF), to estimate daily concentrations of PM10 (PM&lt;10 microns), PM2.5 (PM&lt;2.5 microns), PM2.5-10 (PM between 2.5 and 10 microns), NO2, and O3 for each squared kilometer of Sweden over the period 2005-2016. Our models were able to describe between 64% (PM10) and 78% (O3) of air pollutant variability in held-out observations, and between 37% (NO2) and 61% (O3) in held-out monitors, with no major differences across years and seasons and better performance in larger cities such as Stockholm. These estimates will allow to investigate air pollution effects across the whole of Sweden, including suburban and rural areas, previously neglected by epidemiological investigations. © 2020 by the authors.

In Ghana, it is expected to have a significant effect on agriculture and other climate dependent livelihoods in all ten regions of the country. The development and implementation of policies on climate change in Ghana require the incorporation of local people’s perception and knowledge of the risks they are exposed to. A study to assess the perceptions and knowledge of climate change was undertaken in the Offinso Municipality in Ghana. The study used a cross-sectional design where the information gathered represented what was going on at one point in time. Respondents (307) were selected from Kwapanin, Koforidua, Kyebi, Sampronso and Anyinasuso communities using the systematic sampling method. The study used questionnaires, focus group discussions and targeted interviews to collect primary information on local people’s perception on climate change. The analysis used descriptive statistics (frequency and percentages) and chi-square to detect any association between demographic characteristics of local people and their perception of climate change. In addition the knowledge levels of respondents on climate change was analysed. The results indicate that perception of climate change is not influenced by origin, gender or level of education; however, it is significantly influenced by age. A knowledge portfolio showed that local people did not have in-depth knowledge on climate change in general. There is therefore the need to create awareness and sensitize local people on causes, indicators and effects of climate change. © The Author(s) 2018.","climate change; Ghana; indigenous knowledge; knowledge; perception",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059464725

However, the multi-dimensional nature of biodiversity presents a major challenge for understanding, mapping and communicating where and how biodiversity benefits coincide with climate benefits. A new integrated approach to biodiversity is therefore needed. Here, we (a) present a new high-resolution map of global above- and belowground carbon stored in biomass and soil, (b) quantify biodiversity values using two complementary indices (BIp and BIr) representing proactive and reactive approaches to conservation, and (c) examine patterns of carbon- biodiversity overlap by identifying 'hotspots' (20% highest values for both aspects). Our indices integrate local diversity and ecosystem intactness, as well as regional ecosystem intactness across the broader area supporting a similar natural assemblage of species to the location of interest. The western Amazon Basin, Central Africa and Southeast Asia capture the last strongholds of highest local biodiversity and ecosystem intactness worldwide, while the last refuges for unique biological communities whose habitats have been greatly reduced are mostly found in the tropical Andes and central Sundaland. There is 38 and 5% overlap in carbon and biodiversity hotspots, for proactive and reactive conservation, respectively. Alarmingly, only around 12 and 21% of these proactive and reactive hotspot areas, respectively, are formally protected. This highlights that a coupled approach is urgently needed to help achieve both climate and biodiversity global targets. This would involve (1) restoring and conserving unprotected, degraded ecosystems, particularly in the Neotropics and Indomalaya, and (2) retaining the remaining strongholds of intactness. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Carbon density; Climate change; Global environmental policy agenda; Multi-dimensional biodiversity; Post-2020 framework; Spatial-planning","action plan; biodiversity; carbon storage; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; environmental policy; global climate; integrated approach; mapping method; policy implementation; policy making; spatial planning; Amazon Basin; Andes; Central Africa; Southeast Asia; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; Biodiversity; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078349717

China's air pollution prevention and control action in 2017–2018 expanded the core area of joint prevention and control from a minor alliance of “2 + 4” cities to a major alliance of “2 + 26” cities, which undoubtedly provides a good natural experiment for advancing theoretical research. In order to clarify whether the expansion of the cooperation scope of air pollution joint prevention and control will further improve the air quality, the paper uses the regression discontinuity design (RDD) to empirically analyze the original “2 + 4” cities and 22 newly added cities. The conclusions indicate that the expansion of the core area of air pollution joint prevention and control in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region and surrounding areas is conducive to further improving regional air quality, and the improvement effect of the “2 + 4” cities in the original core area is greater than that of the newly added 22 cities. The improvement of air quality after the expansion of the alliance is attributed to the unified and coordinated supervision of trans-regional environmental protection agencies, which reduces the “free rider” behavior; the increase of alliance members is conducive to achieve better environmental governance and improve cooperation performance among alliance members. Therefore, it is proposed that when the joint prevention and control of air pollution area is mature, the city should expand the scope of the alliance appropriately, rationally control and strengthen the cooperation among cities within the regional alliance, and consolidate the achievements of inter-regional joint prevention and control air quality improvement. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Alliance performance; Group size; Inter-regional prevention and control; Jing-Jin-Ji region and its surrounding areas","Air quality; Environmental Protection Agency; Expansion; Quality control; Air pollution prevention; Air quality improvement; Alliance performance; Cooperation performance; Environmental governances; Group size; Jing-Jin-Ji region and its surrounding areas; Prevention and controls; Air pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; empirical analysis; environmental management; governance approach; pollution control; regression analysis; urban atmosphere; achievement; air pollution; air quality; article; China; city; environmental protection; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076258668

This paper employs an improved stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence and technology (STRIPAT) model by using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces and municipalities for the period of 2003–2015 to investigate the effect of EII on CO2 emissions, SO2 emissions, and PM2.5 pollution. The results indicate that EII has a positive and significant effect on mitigating CO2 emission. However, the effect of EII on SO2 emission fluctuated although it still contributes to the reduction of PM2.5 pollution through technology innovations. Energy intensity has the largest impact on GHG emissions and air pollution, followed by GDP per capita and industrial structure. In addition, the effect of EII on environmental issues varies in different regions. Such findings suggest that policies on EII should be region-specific so that more appropriate mitigation policies can be raised by considering the local realities. © 2019, Higher Education Press and Springer-VerlagGmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","affluence and technology (STIRPAT) model; CO2 emission; environmental infrastructure investment (EII); governance; PM2.5 pollution; SO2 emission; stochastic impact by regression on population",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077061137

Despite evidence that soil microbial community structure can be shifted by experimental warming and plant invasion, few studies were conducted to quantify the interactive effect of both factors. Here, we compared soil microbial diversity, bacterial community, and soil physiochemical properties in both surface (0–5 cm) and subsurface (5–20 cm) soils of two-year open-top chambers (OTCs) warming and Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) invasion treatments with no warming and Phragmites australis (P. australis) treatments. Results showed that surface soil water content, total organic carbon, total nitrogen (TN), and the ratio of TN to total phosphorous (N:P) were significantly decreased by experimental warming, while pH was significantly enhanced. Soil TN was significantly enhanced in the mixed community of P. australis and S. alterniflora compared with single species community. Soil TP was gradually decreased with the proportion of S. alterniflora increasing by experimental warming. Soil bacterial α diversity was not changed by either experimental warming or S. alterniflora invasion. Experimental warming significantly shifted soil bacterial community, whereas S. alterniflora invasion and their interaction showed no impact. Redundancy analysis showed soil bacterial community structure was highly correlated with soil edaphic factors (i.e. pH, TN, and NH4 +-N). Prediction of microbial function profiles revealed that several bacterial functions, especially carbon and nitrogen metabolism pathways, were adjusted to tolerate warming. Overall, our results demonstrated that experimental warming significantly altered soil bacterial community and physiochemical properties of S. alterniflora and P. australis communities, and should be considered in ecologically sustainable development of Chongming Island and wetland ecosystem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Experimental warming; Open-top chamber; Plant invasion; Soil bacterial community; Soil total nitrogen","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Wetlands; Experimental warming; Open top chambers; Plant invasion; Soil bacterial community; Soil total nitrogen; Bacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076253479

However, the implementation of nature-based solutions stems from a discourse that is almost exclusively derived from a terrestrial and urban context and assumes that risk reduction is resolved locally. We argue that this position ignores the importance of complex ecological interactions across a range of temporal and spatial scales and misses the substantive contribution from marine ecosystems, which are notably absent frommost climatemitigation and adaptation strategies that extend beyond coastal disaster management. Here, we consider the potential of sediment-dwelling fauna and flora to inform and support nature-based solutions, and howthe ecology of benthic environments can enhance adaptation plans. We illustrate our thesis with examples of practice that are generating, or have the potential to deliver, transformative change and discuss where further innovation might be applied. Finally, we take a reflective look at the realized and potential capacity of benthic-based solutions to contribute to adaptation plans and offer our perspectives on the suitability and shortcomings of past achievements and the prospective rewards from sensible prioritization of future research. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Habitat restoration; Marine protection; Natural capital; Nature-based solutions; Offshore development; Rewilding","benthic environment; climate change; disaster management; ecosystem resilience; environmental planning; habitat restoration; marine environment; natural capital; offshore application; prioritization; acclimatization; climate change; ecosystem; environment; environmental protection; Acclimatization; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078339456

Yet, they have been linked to several adverse health impacts, with a large, but modifiable, burden of disease. Among the several transportation-related health risk factors, this study focused on transportation-related noise as an emerging exposure whose burden of disease remains partially recognized. We compared premature deaths potentially attributable to transportation-related noise with deaths from motor vehicle crashes, a well-researched and widely recognized transportation risk factor. Method: We employed a standard burden of disease assessment framework to quantify premature cardiovascular diseases mortality attributable to transportation-related (road and aviation) noise at the census tract level (n = 592) in Houston, Texas. The results were compared to motor vehicle crash fatalities, which are routinely observed and collected in the study area. We also investigated the distribution of premature deaths across the city and explored the relationship between household median income and premature deaths attributable to transportation-related noise. Results: We estimated 302 (95% CI: 185–427) premature deaths (adults 30–75 years old) attributable to transportation-related noise in Houston, compared to 330 fatalities from motor vehicle crashes (adults younger than 75 years old). Transportation-related noise and motor vehicle crashes were responsible for 1.7% and 1.9% of all-cause premature deaths in Houston, respectively. Households with lower median income had a higher risk of adverse exposure and premature deaths potentially attributable to transportation-related noise. A larger number of premature deaths was associated with living in the central business district and the vicinity of highways and airports. Conclusion: This study highlighted the significant contribution of transportation-related noise and motor vehicle crashes to premature deaths in the city of Houston. The analogy between the estimated premature deaths attributable to transportation-related noise and motor vehicle crashes showed that the health impacts of transportation-related noise were as significant as motor vehicle crashes. The estimated premature death rate attributable to transportation-related noise was also comparable to the death rate caused by suicide, influenza, or pneumonia in the US. There is an urgent need for imposing policies to reduce transportation noise emissions and human exposures and to equip health impact assessment tools with a noise burden of disease analysis function. © 2020 The Authors","Attributable deaths; Burden of disease; Motor vehicle crashes; Premature death; Transportation noise","Acoustic noise; Aircraft accidents; Health; Health risks; Vehicles; Attributable deaths; Cardio-vascular disease; Central business districts; Health impact assessment; Motor vehicle crashes; Premature death; Transportation risks; Transportation system; Motor transportation; cardiovascular disease; collision; data processing; health impact; health risk; mortality; noise; public health; traffic emission; adult; adverse outcome; aged; airport; Article; aviation; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; commercial phenomena; comparative study; controlled study; data analysis; disease burden; fatality; high risk population; highway; household income; human; lowest income group; major clinical study; premature mortality; priority journal; residential home; risk assessment; risk factor; Texas; traffic accident; traffic noise; urban area; city; epidemiology; middle aged; motor vehicle; premature mortality; Houston; Texas; United States; Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Aged; Cities; Humans; Middle Aged; Mortality, Premature; Motor Vehicles; Noise, Transportation; Texas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079115791

The NASA Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission is proposed to provide climate quality benchmark spectral radiance observations for the purpose of determining the decadal trends of climate variables, and validating and improving the long-range climate model forecasts needed to prepare for the changing climate of the Earth. The CLARREO will serve as an in-orbit, absolute, radiometric standard for the cross-calibration of hyperspectral radiance spectra observed by the international system of polar operational satellite sounding sensors. Here, we demonstrate that the resulting accurately cross-calibrated polar satellite global infrared spectral radiance trends (e.g., from the Metop IASI instrument considered here) can be interpreted in terms of temperature and water vapor profile trends. This demonstration is performed using atmospheric state data generated for a 100-year period from 2000–2099, produced by a numerical climate model prediction that was forced by the doubling of the global average atmospheric CO2 over the 100-year period. The vertical profiles and spatial distribution of temperature decadal trends were successfully diagnosed by applying a linear regression profile retrieval algorithm to the simulated hyperspectral radiance spectra for the 100-year period. These results indicate that it is possible to detect decadal trends in atmospheric climate variables from high accuracy all-sky satellite infrared radiance spectra using the linear regression retrieval technique. © 2020 by the authors.

The alternative water management (midseason drainage, multiple drainage, and local method) emitted approximately 61% of N2O emissions higher than conventional water management (continuously flooded). The short drainage period (local method) emitted the lowest emission compared to other treatments. There was no difference in crop carbon, harvest part, shoot and root portion among 4 treatments. Also, the efficiency of nitrogen uptake by the crop of all treatments was not different. The continuously flooded and short drainage period is an interesting candidate for mitigating N2O emissions from irrigated rice cultivation. However, multiple drainages are a remarkable effective practice to reduce greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) emissions from the rice field.

The results clearly show the necessity to take both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions into consideration in analyses to be able to make proper priorities in future action strategies. The total annual impact from Jämtland calculated as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) is an uptake of 2.4 Mton (19 ton per capita). Jämtland shows large annual uptakes in forests (12.7 Mton CO2), but also large emissions of methane (80 kton corresponding to 6.7 Mton CO2eq), mainly from lakes, mires and ruminants. Anthropogenic carbon Greenhous gas emissions are dominated by transportation, working machines and consumption (mainly imported indirect emissions). As a complement to GWP also the Absolute Global Temperature Change Potential (AGTP) as degree K response, is presented per sector and total for Jämtland County, for yearly emissions (as a pulse) and continuous emissions over 200 years. A yearly pulse from Jämtland gives a temperature response of about 0 K after 10 years and about −4 μK (cooling effect) after about 50 years). Using both GWP and AGTP as indicators improves the possibilities to find ways how to optimize regional climate policies to reduce global warming until a specific year. Strategies and action plans should be developed focusing on the following: - Reduced regional transportation and consumption activity. - Increased (prioritized) use of renewable fuels for working machines in forestry and agriculture, as well as for heavy trucks. - Evaluate the potential to reduce emissions of methane from wetlands and mires. - Increase/optimize carbon dioxide assimilation in forests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AGTP response; Carbon based fluxes; Carbon dioxide emissions; Methane emissions; Nature emissions; Regional sustainability; Sustainability indicators","Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Environmental protection; Forestry; Gas emissions; Mammals; Methane; Sustainable development; AGTP response; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon-based; Methane emissions; Regional sustainability; Sustainability indicators; Global warming; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; carbon flux; environmental policy; global warming; methane; regional climate; regional policy; sustainability; Jamtland; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074161364

However, lack of coordination between network controls such as conservation voltage reduction (CVR) and assets (DES) may cause detrimental impact on smart grid operations. Therefore, this paper reports on the need for coordination of CVR and DES for maximizing the benefits of both approaches. The impact of integrated operation of CVR devices and DES on energy saving and peak demand reduction have been investigated. The CVR scheme has been implemented using discrete gravitational search algorithm-driven Volt-ampere reactive (VAR) optimization (VVO) in the presence of distributed energy sources (DER). Such a smart grid-enabled centralized CVR scheme has been proposed to be deployed in the grid and integrated with a community energy storage (CES) as DES. The main task of the VVO engine is to minimize the total power demand through optimal settings of Volt-VAR control (VVC) devices. In order to demonstrate the benefits of integrated operation of CVR and CES, the studies have been carried out in three cases, namely without CVR, VVO-based CVR, and CVR with CES in presence of both nonrenewable and renewable (wind) type DERs. Moreover, the impact of the proposed method has not only been demonstrated on hourly varying load of the year but during peak load hour also. Besides, the techno-economic and environmental assessment of combined operation of CES and CVR has been done. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 123-bus unbalanced distribution network with the modification to include the DER and CES system apart from CVR devices has been chosen to corroborate the performance of the proposed method. The test results reveal that the proposed integration method of CVR and CES achieve higher peak sharing and energy saving with reduced carbon emission. In addition, the method assists the demand balancing. Besides, the by-product of CES control strategy has been demonstrated for mitigation of rise in neutral currents. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","active distribution network; conservation voltage reduction; voltage control","Balancing; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Smart power grids; Value engineering; Voltage control; Active distribution networks; Community energy storages (CES); Conservation voltage reductions; Distributed energy sources; Distributed energy storages; Gravitational search algorithms; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; Unbalanced distribution networks; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078045118

This study analyzes long-term trends in emissions in two hot spot regions, Myanmar and Punjab, based on data from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4s) and Fire INventory (FINN) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Our analysis reveals that emissions during active fire seasons increase by approximately 83–106% and 2338–3054% for Punjab and Myanmar, respectively, compared to the estimates of anthropogenic emissions obtained with FINN. We also examine the impact of carbonaceous aerosol from open biomass burning on regional weather by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to conduct a year-long simulation of the post-monsoon and pre-monsoon periods when active fires were reported. The results indicate that the carbonaceous aerosol is vertically lofted by as much as 3–5 km into the atmosphere and, rising as high as the 850 hPa level from the surface, disperses horizontally throughout South Asia. Our calculations on the radiative forcing suggest that changes of up to –6.14 W m–2 and –0.50 W m–2, and –42.76 W m–2 and –1.91 W m–2 occur at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere over Punjab and Myanmar, respectively. We also find that carbonaceous aerosol (black carbon + organic carbon), similar to black carbon (BC), reduces the surface temperature, despite the scattering effects of organic carbon (OC). Overall, open biomass burning causes the surface temperature to decrease by 2 K, the relative humidity to increase by 8% and the planetary boundary layer height to change by as much as 600 m. Changes in the precipitation patterns and volume due to the carbonaceous aerosol from open biomass burning, however, are negligible when considering only the direct radiative feedback. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Biomass burning; Carbonaceous aerosol; South Asia; WRF-Chem","Aerosols; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biomass; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Fires; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Surface properties; Anthropogenic emissions; Biomass-burning; Carbonaceous aerosol; National center for atmospheric researches; Planetary boundary layers; South Asia; Weather research and forecasting models; WRF-Chem; Weather forecasting; aerosol; anthropogenic source; biomass burning; black carbon; boundary layer; radiative forcing; regional climate; India; Myanmar; Punjab; Punjab [India]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080903685

Here, flexible and rigid OLED devices are demonstrated using self-assembled 2D arrays of CDs derived from waste material, viz., human hair. High-performance CDs with a quantum yield (QY) of 87%, self-assembled into 2D arrays, are achieved by improving the crystallinity and decreasing the CDs' size distribution.

As an alternative to change this scenario, it is proposed in this study to develop sustainability guidelines for urban mobility projects that can be applied in developing countries. Through a case study in a Brazilian city, a method of quantifying GHG emissions for the current scenario of the transport system was developed. From this, it became possible to construct four scenarios that determine sustainable urban mobility guidelines organized by complexity levels from the simplest to the most elaborate, each having different GHGs emission levels. The results indicate that the more comprehensive the mobility system remodeling measures, the lower the GHG emissions. The application of the generated guidelines could lead to a reduction of up to 88.6% of annual GHG emissions in the transport sector for the Brazilian city. Thus, the contributions of this work can guide policymakers and planners to define the levels of complexity to be applied in public policies according to the need to reduce emissions or the resources available to invest in this change. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; CO2 reduction; Developing countries; Sustainable mobility; Urban mobility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081696139

In this work, the effect of three different solidification methods on glass formation and reactivity of FeOx–SiO2 slags, as well as on the molecular structure of the resultant Fe-rich inorganic polymers, was investigated. The inorganic polymers were synthesized by mixing the slags (approximate molar ratio FeO/SiO2 = 1.6) with an alkali silicate solution (molar ratios SiO2/Na2O = 1.6 and H2O/Na2O = 25). Results demonstrated that higher cooling rates promoted higher glass formation and faster reaction kinetics when the slags were activated. 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy indicated that all the slags consisted predominantly of Fe2+ ions with a minor amount of Fe3+ ions, regardless of the variability in glass content. The binder phase of all inorganic polymers consisted of iron in both Fe2+ and Fe3+ states, after 28 days of curing. After pulverizing the inorganic polymer pastes and exposing the powder to air for 28 additional days, the Fe2+ state in the binder transformed to Fe3+. The compressive strength evolution of the three slags showed that the 2-day strength was higher for the samples with a higher amorphous fraction, while after 28 days, this influence was less pronounced. © 2019 The Authors.

However, cold regions under a changing climate could be more vulnerable than others because their glaciers, freezing soils and peatlands are sensitive to the slightest of changes in climate. This has posed serious threats to the water resources, sustainable goods production and ecosystem services that depend on regional water quality. Therefore, proper watershed management is imperative. In this paper, we investigate this issue in a cold climate watershed in central Alberta, Canada with the main objective of quantifying the impacts of climate change on water quality status. We modified specific water quality related processes of a process-based model – Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a view of better representing the reality of cold climate regions. A SWAT model is then built-up, followed up by a multi-site and multi-objective (streamflow, sediment and water quality) calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis in a baseline period (1983-2013). The calibrated and validated model is then fed with a high spatial resolution (25 km) daily future climate data – the CanRCM4. Improvements on stream water temperature (Ts) and dissolved oxygen (DO) simulations justified the modifications. This model is able to simulate the dynamics of other water quality variables (carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand – cBOD, total nitrogen – TN and phosphorus – TP) with a wide range of accuracy (very good to satisfactory) in the base period. Agriculture areas account for the highest amount of annual TN (11.16 kgN/ha) and TP (2.88 kgP/ha) yield rate in the base period leading to poor water quality status in the immediate downstream reaches. The situation would be further exacerbated (16.52 kgN/ha and 4.89 kgP/ha) in future. Finally, we tested different alternative management options to compare the water quality status of the Athabasca River Basin (ARB) under a changing climate. Significant reduction in future nutrient concentrations (~ 20% on TN and 60% on TP) can be achieved using a certain combination of management practices and the ecological status of the basin can be improved. This demonstrates that the modified SWAT model can be applied to other cold climate regions, and that the results can be translated to help in managing the ARB in a more holistic way. © 2020 ISEIS All rights reserved.","Athabasca river basin; CanRCM4; Climate change; Cold climate region; SWAT; Water quality","biochemical oxygen demand; climate change; dissolved oxygen; soil and water assessment tool; spatial resolution; uncertainty analysis; water quality; water temperature; watershed; Athabasca Basin; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076429584

In the present study, we conducted a nationwide time-series analysis in 128 counties from 2013-2018 to examine whether temperature modifies the association between short-term ozone exposure with nonaccidental and cause-specific mortality in China. First, we analyzed the effects of ozone exposure on mortality at different temperature levels. Then, we calculated the pooled effects through a meta-analysis across China. We found that high-temperature conditions (&gt;75th percentile in each county) significantly enhanced the effects of ozone on nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, with increases of 0.44% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36 and 0.51%), 0.42% (95% CI: 0.32 and 0.51%) and 0.50% (95% CI: 0.31 and 0.68%), respectively, for a 10 μg/m3 increase in ozone at high temperatures. Stronger effects on nonaccidental and cardiovascular mortality were observed at high temperatures among elderly individuals aged 65 years and older compared with the younger people. Our findings provide evidence that health damage because of ozone may be influenced by the impacts of increasing temperatures, which point to the importance of mitigating ozone exposure in China under the context of climate change to further reduce the public health burden.

Urban resident’s PM2.5 reduction behavior contributes significantly to Chinese haze pollution control. Resident-level policy measures are beneficial for encouraging residents to engage in PM2.5 reduction behaviors. The current research aims to explore the long-term intervention effects of three types of policies (i.e., command and control policies, economic incentive policies and education-guided policies) on resident’s PM2.5 reduction intention and actual behavior. Based on the agent-based modeling and simulation approach, a resident’s PM2.5 reduction behavioral simulation model is developed, and data adopted from a questionnaire survey are analyzed. The simulation results show that resident’s PM2.5 reduction intention is motivated by the interactions among resident agents, and it eventually stabilizes at a higher level (from 4.11 to 4.48). Moreover, the effects of the three types of policy measures on PM2.5 reduction behavior vary depending on the specific scenarios. With respect to single-policy scenarios, these policies all enhance the actual resident’s PM2.5 reduction behavior over the long term. The effects of command and control policies (M = 3.42) and education-guided policies (M = 3.44) are much better than those of the economic incentive policies (M = 3.15). Regarding policy combination scenarios, a combination of economic incentive policies and education-guided policies (MII = 4.15) has a remarkable promotional effect over others for encouraging residents to conduct PM2.5 reduction behaviors. Based on the results, implications and suggestions for improving current resident-level PM2.5 reduction policies and encouraging resident’s PM2.5 reduction behavior are provided. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Agent-based simulation; Command and control policies; Economic incentive policies; Education-guided policies; PM2.5 reduction behavior; Policy measures","atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; haze; modeling; particulate matter; policy approach; pollution control; pollution policy; urban pollution; China; adult; article; education; female; human; human experiment; male; psychological model; questionnaire; resident; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073972485

Herein we present a high-resolution simulation using two different wind farm parameterizations: 1) the ‘‘Fitch’’ parameterization that is included in WRF releases and 2) the recently developed Explicit Wake Parameterization (EWP) scheme. We compare the schemes using a single yearlong simulation for a domain centered on the highest density of current turbine deployments in the contiguous United States (Iowa). Pairwise analyses are applied to diag-nose the downstream wake effects and impact of wind turbine arrays on near-surface climate conditions. On average, use of the EWP scheme results in small-magnitude wake effects within wind farm arrays and faster recovery of full WT array wakes. This in turn leads to smaller impacts on near-surface climate variables and reduced array–array interactions, which at a systemwide scale lead to summertime capacity factors (i.e., the electrical power produced relative to nameplate installed capacity) that are 2%–3% higher than those from the more commonly applied Fitch parameterization. It is currently not possible to make recommendations with regard to which wind farm parameterization exhibits higher fidelity or to draw inferences with regard to whether the relative performance may vary with prevailing climate conditions and/or wind turbine deploy-ment configuration. However, the sensitivities documented herein to the wind farm parameterization are of sufficient magnitude to potentially influence wind turbine array siting decisions. Thus, our research findings imply high value in undertaking combined long-term high-fidelity observational studies in support of model validation and verification. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric movements; Electric utilities; Parameterization; Wakes; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Downstream effects; Electricity generation; High resolution simulations; Installed capacity; Model validation and verification; Observational study; Relative performance; Weather research and forecasting models; Wind turbines; climate modeling; electricity generation; parameterization; sensitivity analysis; weather forecasting; wind turbine; Iowa; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079124816

There are different techniques were used to improve the solar still productivity. So, this research deals with improving the solar still productivity by using ultrasonic waves, reflectors and phase change material. A single solar still was designed, fabricated and tested under the climate conditions of Alexandria, Egypt. The solar still has base dimensions of 1 m × 1 m and integrated with an evacuated solar collector of 200 l capacity. Six ultrasonic humidifiers were installed to strengthen the evaporation frequency of the water basin. A photovoltaic solar panel of 280 W was used to provide the power for ultrasonic humidifiers. An evacuated solar collector was used to provide solar still with hot sprayed water inside the solar still after 13:00 local time. Experimental tests have constructed to powerfully assess the daily productivity of fresh water during the three summer months under the same climate conditions. Four cases were studied to investigate the daily fresh water productivity at different embedded components with the solar still: phase change material; ultrasonic humidifiers and phase change material; evacuated solar collector and phase change material and the forth case is phase change material and ultrasonic humidifiers combined with evacuated solar collector. The results showed that the maximum daily productivity are 5.34 and 7.4 kg per day for 25 and 35 mm water depths respectively in case of using solar still with phase change material and ultrasonic humidifiers integrated with an evacuated solar still. The ultrasonic humidifier was influential in case of integrating evacuated solar collector and improved the daily productivity by 25 and 44% at water depths of 25 and 35 mm respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Evacuated solar collector; Phase change material; Solar still; Ultrasonic humidifiers and fresh water","Desalination; Distillation; Phase change materials; Potable water; Productivity; Renewable energy resources; Seawater; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Climate condition; Embedded components; Experimental test; Fresh Water; Renewable energy source; Solar still productivity; Solar stills; Ultrasonic humidifiers; Solar power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079211737

M), occurs as rapidly sinking pulses of particulate organic carbon (POC). Nearly continuous sediment trap collections confirm that POC export to 3400 m increased significantly after 2011 with carbon attenuation (as fraction of POC remineralized) ranging from a low of 57% to a high of 77% during periods of pulsed flux. All of the major pulse events for the period resulted in the delivery of detrital aggregates that covered part or all of the sediment surface as an organic carbon rich layer at ~4000 m depth. However, the magnitude of the measured Sediment Community Oxygen Consumption (SCOC) did not increase proportionally to the organic carbon inventory change. Here, a model of oxygen consumption, informed by the time series data at Sta. M in the CCE, suggests that aggregate flocs constitute a major source for benthic carbon and a barrier to mass transport of oxygen, leading to reduced carbon attenuation in surface sediments. The correlation of POC delivery with aggregate coverage shows that the majority of POC delivery during pulse events is likely to consume all of the oxygen within the aggregates. Results indicate that an increasing fraction of POC reaches the abyssal sediments at Sta. M under conditions that support increased net burial of carbon. This finding is significant in the context of the fraction of the total POC flux that occurs as pulse events in this important upwelling region. During the period from 2011 to 2017, a third of the total POC flux resulted in aggregate flocs that covered a significant portion of the sediment surface (>47%). Following the 2015–2016 El Nino period the flocs became a dominant feature of the sediment surface.

The cotton hung pad has threads with ends immersed in seawater, hence the capillary property moves the water upward towards the evaporation surface. The cotton hung pad (small layer), and nanoparticles have a significant effect on localizing the heat that speed up the seawater evaporation rate and improve the performance. The Fe3O4, and CuO nanoparticle materials are used and spreaded to the top surface of the cotton pad with different concentrations in the range of 25 g/m2 to 300 g/m2. Also, the exergoeconomic of the desalination system and environmental analysis are investigated. The results showed an enhancement of about 17.55% in the productivity for the modified solar still (MSS) with cotton hung alone compared with the TSS. The configuration of cotton hung pad and nanoparticles with a concentration of 150 g/m2 enhanced the distillate productivity by about 42.3% and 56.6% for Fe3O4 and CuO nanoparticles, respectively compared to TSS. The highest efficiency was about 51%, 45%, 34.5% and 30% for MSS with CuO, MSS with Fe3O4, cotton hung pad only and TSS, respectively. The exergy values showed enhancement of 103% for MSS with CuO compared to TSS. The economic analysis of different modifications indicated that the cost per liter of fresh water was 0.018 $, 0.016 $, and 0.015 $ for MSS with cotton pad and Fe3O4; cotton pad and CuO; and cotton pad only, respectively while the cost for TSS was 0.0189 US$. Furthermore, the exergoeconomic and environmental analysis of enhanced solar stills showed that these systems are cost-effective and helpful in cutting down carbon footprint by mitigation of CO2. Overall, integrating nanoparticles with cotton hung pads were proved to be very effective and promising from economic, environmental, and exergy point of views. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Concentration; Cotton hung pad; Environmental; Exergoeconomic; Nanoparticles materials; Solar desalination","Carbon footprint; Concentration (process); Copper oxides; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Desalination; Distillation; Economic analysis; Evaporation; Exergy; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Nanoparticles; Productivity; Satellites; Seawater effects; Solar heating; Capillary properties; CuO nanoparticles; Desalination systems; Environmental; Environmental analysis; Exergoeconomic; Seawater desalination systems; Solar desalination; Cotton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075357551

Despite this benefit to climate change mitigation and adaptation, mangrove forests are being deforested or degraded at an alarming rate, though restoration efforts may offset these losses. The impacts of deforestation to C stocks are relatively intuitive and result in significant decreases in C stocks. It remains unclear how degradation from selective harvesting of trees affects C stocks or how effective restoration efforts are at restoring C stocks. Furthermore, total ecosystem C (TEC) stocks of pristine mangroves can significantly vary spatially. To address these issues, we conducted an intensive, national assessment of mangrove forests across Cambodia using a grid approach to: 1) examine how land use land cover (i.e., pristine, deforested, degraded, and restored forests) impacts TEC stocks, and 2) how TEC stocks vary spatially across the country. TEC stocks from deforested mangroves were always lower than pristine forests, resulting in an overall loss of 60% C (480 Mg C ha−1). However, TEC stocks from degraded and 25-year-old restored mangroves forests did not differ from pristine forests. Mean TEC in mangroves was 784.7 ± 30.1 Mg C ha−1, decreasing from 957.2 ± 32.8 Mg C ha−1 in the northern region to 628.9 ± 33.1 Mg C ha−1 in the central region to 386.2 ± 19.1 Mg C ha−1 in the southern region of Cambodia. Intensive sampling in mangroves across Cambodia verified impacts of deforestation reported elsewhere, revealed the lack of degradation impacts on TEC stocks, and demonstrated the effectiveness of restoration on TEC stocks after only 25 years. Our gridded sampling approach was able to capture spatial variability across Cambodia and provide a more realistic TEC stock information that can be used for national reporting or participation in C markets. © 2019","Blue carbon; Carbon inventory; Climate change mitigation; Gridded sampling; Rhizophora plantation","Carbon; Climate change; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Land use; Restoration; Carbon inventories; Climate change mitigation; Land use/ land covers; Mangrove ecosystems; National assessment; Rhizophora plantation; Selective harvesting; Spatial variability; Conservation; carbon; carbon emission; climate change; deforestation; degradation; emission inventory; forest ecosystem; mangrove; restoration ecology; Article; Cambodia; carbon dynamics; climate change; deforestation; ecosystem restoration; forest management; land use; mangrove; priority journal; Cambodia; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; tree; wetland; Cambodia; Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae; Cambodia; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Trees; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076454588

Phytoplankton response studies under the combination of elevated CO2 and trace metals are rare. We have conducted two consecutive onboard incubation experiments (R. V. Sindhu Sadhana; August 2017) in the eastern Arabian Sea (SW coast of India) during an upwelling event. A nutrient enriched diatom bloom was initiated onboard and grown under ambient (≈400 μatm, A-CO2) and high CO2 levels (≈1000 μatm; H–CO2) with different zinc (Zn; 1 nM) and copper (Cu) concentrations (1 nM, 2 nM and 8 nM). Phytoplankton community composition and the dominant genera were different during these two experiments. CO2 enrichment alone did not show any significant growth stimulating impact on the experimental community except enhanced cell density in the first experiment. Addition of Zn at A-CO2 level revealed no noticeable responses; whereas, the same treatment under H–CO2 level significantly reduced cell number. Considerably high protein content under H–CO2+Zn treatment was possibly counteracting Zn toxicity which also caused slower growth rate. Cu addition did not show any noticeable impact on growth and biomass production except increased protein content as well as decreased carbohydrate: protein ratio. This can be attributed to relatively higher protein synthesis than carbohydrate to alleviate oxidative stress generated by Cu. The centric diatom Chaetoceros and toxin producing pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia showed no significant response to either CO2 or Zn enrichment. Large centric diatom Leptocylindrus and Skeletonema responded positively to Zn addition in both CO2 levels. The former species showed the most sensitive response at the highest Cu and H–CO2 treatment; whereas, the pennate diatoms Nitzschia and Pseudo-nitzschia (toxigenic diatom) showed higher resilience under elevated CO2 and Cu levels. This observation indicated that in future ocean, increasing CO2 concentrations and trace metal pollution may potentially alter phytoplankton community structure and may facilitate toxigenic diatom bloom in the coastal waters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Arabian sea; Copper; Diatoms; Ocean acidification; Phytoplankton; Upwelling; Zinc","Acidification; Biosynthesis; Carbohydrates; Carbon dioxide; Copper; Forestry; Growth rate; Marine pollution; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Pollution control; Proteins; Trace elements; Tropics; Arabian sea; Biomass productions; Diatoms; Eastern Arabian Sea; Ocean acidifications; Phytoplankton community; Trace metal pollution; Upwelling; Zinc; carbohydrate; copper; protein; zinc; acid; copper; sea water; zinc; community composition; copper; diatom; enrichment; marine pollution; ocean acidification; phytoplankton; upwelling; zinc; acidification; algal bloom; algal community; Article; biomass production; cell count; cell density; Chaetoceros; community structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; diatom; Leptocylindrus; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phytoplankton; protein content; protein synthesis; Pseudo-nitzschia; sea; seawater upwelling; sensitivity analysis; Skeletonema; species composition; water pollution; chemistry; India; pH; physiology; phytoplankton; Arabian Sea; India; Indian Ocean; Bacillariophyta; Chaetoceros; Coscinodiscophyceae; Leptocylindrus; Nitzschia; Pseudo-nitzschia; Skeletonema; Acids; Copper; Diatoms; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; India; Phytoplankton; Seawater; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078655016

The slow rate of adoption of this technology is often attributed to economic and technical considerations. Collaboration of two or more dairy farms into a centralized AD system can improve the process economics through economies of scale. However, uncertainties related to the process parameters and the scope/scale of the collaborative implementation impede its adoption. This study presents techno-economic optimization model as a design aid to determine ideal location, capacity, and participation level (cluster size) that maximize economic return on a cooperative digester. This study employs a probabilistic approach to overcome uncertainty regarding project parameters such as manure biomethane potential (BMP), project capital, and electricity sale price. Two case studies based on dairy production regions in Wisconsin were developed to test the model and demonstrate its capabilities. Herd sizes and spatial distribution in a given region were found to be critical factors in determining the viability of digestion projects in general, and collaborative digestion systems in particular. The number of simulation runs needed to capture the probability of profitable AD facility establishment was less than 1000 for both case studies assessed. Electricity sale price and biomethane potential of feedstock utilized were found to be the most restrictive to the feasibility of AD adoption. Changing the optimization objective function, to adopting maximization, favored the formation of collaborative AD facilities for both case studies evaluated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Centralized management; Optimization; Spatial; Techno-economic; Uncertainty","Digestive system; Economics; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Biomethane potential (BMP); Centralized management; Optimization objective function; Probabilistic approaches; Renewable energy generation; Spatial; Techno-economics; Uncertainty; Anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion; economic analysis; machinery; optimization; probability; uncertainty analysis; waste management; adoption; anaerobic digestion; article; electricity; feasibility study; manure; probability; simulation; uncertainty; Wisconsin; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078165210

Here, we developed a stochastic model to quantify the variability in the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints of product distribution and purchase of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) via three prevalent retail channels in the United Kingdom (U.K.). We found that shopping via bricks and clicks (click and fulfillment via physical store delivery) most likely decreases the GHG footprints when substituting traditional shopping, while FMCGs purchased through pure players with parcel delivery often have higher GHG footprints compared to those purchased via traditional retail. The number of items purchased and the last-mile travel distance are the dominant contributors to the variability in the GHG footprints of all three retail channels.

For instance, arid and semi-arid environments experience a high level of uncertainty in rainfall, which results in unforeseen periods of droughts, or high-intensity rainfall, which generates severe floods, increasing the water insecurity and flood damage in these areas. Climate pattern variations are specifically critical to forecast conditions for flood hazard management. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are useful tools to forecast future climate change scenarios. However, the application of GCM in flood hazard management is particularly challenging, given that they operate under high uncertainty and coarse scale. In this context, a five-class Flood Hazard Index (FHI) map was generated by using a multi criteria index approach, based on defining the greater influence of seven factors related to flood generation: runoff coefficient, elevation, slope, distance from the drainage network, rainfall intensity, soil erosion and land use. In this paper, we utilized monthly data for the baseline period (1980–2004), and then the output of 8 GCMs for surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation were downscaled using a statistical model and evaluated in the baseline period. Consequently, the most suitable models were selected according to their average monthly performance. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was then used to develop a runoff coefficient map, using the downscaled outputs of the selected GCMs. Accordingly, a flood hazard model was developed at a large basin in the northeast of Iran for baseline and future periods (2040–2064) under RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. Having validated the generated flood map for the baseline period, the future maps were generated and compared. Results show the increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation; however, it was found that rainfall intensities are to be increased. This supports the final flood hazard map for the future climate conditions scenario with an increased relative hazard level. This was particularly observed in flat, and moderate sloped areas, compared to the model results with historic climate data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Flood hazard assessment; GCMs; River basin management; SWAT","Climate models; Developing countries; Floods; Hazards; Land use; Rain; Runoff; Water management; Flood hazard assessment; GCMs; General circulation model; High intensity rainfall; River basin management; Soil and water assessment tool; Surface air temperatures; SWAT; Climate change; basin management; climate change; climate effect; flood; flood forecasting; general circulation model; hazard assessment; hazard management; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081003378

In an effort to follow up this cause present study focused on tomato industry waste specifically the peel of tomatoes for extraction of pectin. Pectin extraction was performed using five different extraction techniques (Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE); microwave assisted extraction (MAE); ohmic heating assisted extraction (OHAE); ultrasound assisted microwave extraction (UAME) and ultrasound assisted ohmic heating extraction (UAOHE) at different power levels to study its extraction and degradation kinetics and in turn to optimize the extraction process. The extracted pectin yield ranged from 9.30% for OHAE to 25.42% for MAE. Also, there was very less difference in the yield of MAE and UAME extracted pectin, but at the cost of major difference in degree of esterification 59.76 ± 0.70 and 73.33 ± 1.76%, respectively. In addition, all the pectin extracted under optimized conditions was having acceptable purity, [Galacturonic acid (GalA) content ranged from 675.8 ± 11.31 to 913.3 ± 20.50 g/kg of pectin]. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of functional groups in the finger print region of identification for polysaccharide in all the extracted pectin. According to obtained results, UAME can be considered as better green extraction technology in terms of extraction yield as well as in quality of pectin compared to the other treatments used. Therefore, results suggest that UAME can be used as an efficient pectin extraction method from tomato processing waste. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Extraction; Microwave; Ohmic heating; Pectin; Ultrasonication","Carbon footprint; Degradation; Fruits; Joule heating; Microwaves; Pyrene; Ultrasonics; Assisted extractions; Degradation kinetics; Extraction techniques; Microwave extraction; Microwave-assisted extraction; Pectin; Ultra-sonication; Ultrasound-assisted extraction; Extraction; galacturonic acid; pectin; polysaccharide; pectin; Article; controlled study; degradation kinetics; esterification; food processing; food waste; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; heating; microwave assisted extraction; priority journal; process optimization; tomato; ultrasound assisted extraction; ultrasound assisted ohmic heating extraction; chemistry; comparative study; food industry; industrial waste; isolation and purification; kinetics; tomato; ultrasound; Food Industry; Industrial Waste; Kinetics; Lycopersicon esculentum; Pectins; Ultrasonic Waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074451385

In this article flexibility in energy systems is introduced, flexibility options are categorised along existing literature and a method is explained to approach the estimation of flexibility potential by means of two example regions. Therefore, 13 flexibility options in the electricity system in four categories are analysed: flexible generators, demand side management, storage, and power-to-X.

This will require vast amounts of investments. Cost of the capital needed for these investments are unevenly distributed among European regions. They show a clear North-South and West-East divide, which has not exhibited significant signs of narrowing in recent years. Power system studies investigating a continent-wide European power system, however, usually assume homogeneous cost of capital. The objective of this paper is to investigate how regional differences in cost of capital affect the result of these studies with respect to the optimal power system design. Our analysis is based on power system optimization with inhomogeneous cost of capital in Europe. We find that assuming homogeneous cost of capital leads to estimates on the levelized costs of electricity in a highly renewable European power system, which are too conservative. The optimal system design is significantly affected compared to an inhomogeneous scenario. In particular, we show that inhomogeneous cost of capital favors overall wind power deployment in the case of Europe, while the investment in solar power decreases. © 2020","Climate change mitigation; Investment; Locational marginal price; Power system analysis; Renewables; WACC","Climate change; Costs; Electric power system interconnection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Optimal systems; Solar energy; Systems analysis; Wind power; Climate change mitigation; Locational marginal prices; Power system analysis; Renewables; WACC; Cost benefit analysis; alternative energy; capital; cost analysis; design method; electricity generation; greenhouse gas; investment; optimization; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078234643

Once common, both groups of megabiota have been massively reduced in pre-historic and historic times, with human-induced downsizing still ongoing. Key ecosystem services provided by megafauna and megatrees include nutrient and seed transfer, carbon allocation, climate regulation and biodiversity facilitation. Socio-cultural services include food and timber provisioning and the ‘charisma’ of large-sized organisms, with its associated high cultural, recreational and nature conservation values for human societies worldwide. Conservation and restoration of megafauna and—trees in a socio-ecological framework are needed to counteract past and ongoing analogous downsizing of both groups of megabiota and the loss of important ecosystem services in a human-dominated world. Importantly, synergistic megatree–megafauna restoration promotes self-regulating biodiverse ecosystems across the full range of land use intensities ranging from current downsized wildlands to highly human-modified landscapes. We propose an integrative rewilding-based restoration framework applicable across the whole range of human land use intensity. This includes individual-based protection, assisted colonisation and facilitation of urban wildlife. Active management of megafauna and -trees can be economically beneficial and necessary to minimize human–wildlife conflicts in highly human-dominated landscapes. Societal acceptance and adaptation to old big trees and wild megafauna are prerequisites for successful megabiota restoration in human-modified landscapes and elsewhere where human–wildlife conflicts are hard to avoid. The prime goal of such integrative rewilding activities should be a proactive facilitation of the self-regulation potential of natural and novel ecosystems for which large-sized trees and animals would be some of the most important components for enhancing biodiversity and societal value in the Anthropocene. Such megabiota restoration needs to be done on a wide scale to restore functional effects on the biosphere.

Our study confirms previous suggestions that at least some of the mud volcano fluids are a mixture of deeper salt-rich water and surficial/precipitation water. No apparent water quality differences were found between sampling sites north and south of a major geological fault line. Microbiological analyses revealed diverse communities, both aerobic and anaerobic, including sulfate reducers, methanogens, carbon dioxide fixing and denitrifying bacteria. Several identified species were halophilic and likely derived from the deeper salt-rich subsurface water, while we also cultivated pathogenic species from the Vibrionaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanellaceae, and Clostridiaceae.

Data were collected using Scania Fleet Management System (Scania FMS) over a period of one-year (1 + 2 + 4 + 6 months during the 2015 and 2016). Data for these two parameters of all drivers were recorded daily over a one-year period and calculated in average values on a monthly basis. A one-year cycle of average monthly ambient temperatures of wider geographical region was adopted as the most important external parameter of impact on eco-driving benefits. Longitudinal observation period is divided into: one month initial period of establishing the parameter values before the training (one month), short-term with eco-driving (two months), short-term without eco-driving (four months) and long-term (six months). Significantly higher values of SDS parameter (p &lt; 0.05) and significant reduction of FC (p = 0.0310 &lt; 0.05) were established with a higher average ambient temperature over a short-term period. A partial increase of SDS parameter value (p &lt; 0.10) was established over a long-term period but the level of FC reversed to the values as before the training (p = 0.7554 &gt; 0.05). The results indicate the potential of eco-driving training that manifests significantly positive effects only in good driving conditions. With bad weather conditions that correlate with bad driving conditions, the effects of eco-driving training are supressed with increased requirements for safer driving. Primary conclusion of the paper is that the eco-driving training principles have an apparent positive effect on reduction of FC and CO2 emission but are at the same time sensitive to environmental driving conditions. © 2020 The Author(s).","Ambient temperature; CO2 emission; Driving conditions; Eco-driving; Fuel consumption","Automobile drivers; Fleet operations; Temperature; Average values; Driving behaviour; Driving conditions; Internal parameters; Long-term impacts; Long-term period; Observation Period; Operating parameters; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084175045

Soybean is the main oilseed crop in Iran mainly cultivated for edible oil and meal. The potential effect of climate change on soybean production is, however, not well addressed. This study aimed to quantify the effects of climate change on soybean yield in major producing provinces in Iran using the panel econometric approach and the General Climate Models (GCMs). For this purpose, the climatological data of three meteorological stations, i.e., Ardabil, Golestan, Mazandaran were gathered over 1980–2012. Besides, the soybean economic data obtained from Iran Ministry of Agriculture were used. LARS-WG 6.0 was applied to downscale the outputs of five GCMs under RCP-8.5 for 2021–2040. The results revealed that climate change would affect the soybean yield but effects differ across parameters. The projected climate parameters showed that the mean of minimum, maximum temperature and precipitation would increase for all provinces. Maximum temperature and precipitation had a positive significant effect on soybean yield, while minimum temperature affected the yield negatively. Using the obtained equation for soybean yield and the projected climatic factors over the early twenty-first century (i.e., 2021–2040), a relative average increase of 330, 500 and 260 kg per hectare in soybean yield was projected over the next 20 years in Ardabil, Golestan and Mazandaran provinces, respectively. These results can help decision makers in adapting land and water policies to climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Food security; LARS-WG 6.0; Panel data approach; Soybean oilseed yield","Climate models; Decision making; Food supply; Oilseeds; Soybean oil; Water management; Climate change impact; Food security; LARS-WG 6.0; Mazandaran provinces; Meteorological station; Minimum temperatures; Panel data; Soybean oilseed yield; Climate change; agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; econometrics; food security; panel data; soybean; vegetable oil; yield response; Ardabil; Golestan; Iran; Mazandaran; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075212184

In this review, we focus on subnational MSFs that include at least one grassroots and one government actor. MSFs have been presented, especially by practitioners, as a panacea to address land-use change and support climate mitigation, such as through “landscape” or jurisdictional approaches. However, it is not clear that these initiatives are learning from past experience, particularly from research analyzing the effect of context on the ability of such approaches to reach their objectives. To address this gap, the academic literature was assessed using the RSR method to elucidate the key contextual variables affecting outcomes. In addition to analyzing context, this review identifies four common lessons learned for MSFs: the importance of commitment (to the people, the process and its goals); engaging the implementers (key middle level brokers and government officials who determine what happens on the ground); openness to learn from and listen to stakeholders; and having a design that is adaptive to this context, with time and resources to do so. Findings suggest that the most successful MSFs are those that are recognized as part of a wider process that seeks to transform practices at multiple levels; entail a period of research and meetings at upper levels to identify potential roadblocks and existing capacities with those who would implement the project locally; build consensus and commitment from higher levels, and thus political will; and are designed as adaptive learning processes. The central lesson, then, is not one of how to design initiatives, given such different and distinct contexts. Rather, it is about how to design for engagement to address context, whatever its distinct features, in order to develop and implement initiatives with greater chance of success. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptive governance; Collaboration; Conservation; Development; Indigenous and Local communities; Participation","adaptive management; governance approach; indigenous population; land use change; literature review; local participation; stakeholder",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075277367

In Europe, however, forests are highly fragmented and located close to human populations. This means that maintaining forest sustainability implies not only increasing ecosystem adaptation but also developing social adaptation. Hence, there is a need to understand the current priorities and management goals of forestry stakeholders, as well as their capacity to achieve functional and sustainable FSES in the future. The present study uses an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate stakeholders’ capacity to deal with climate change and top-down policies in different FSESs. We selected five FSESs in France that exhibit a range of climatic threats and socio-economic characteristics to estimate their adaptive capacity and transformative potential. The estimation is based on an assessment of different types of capital (i.e. natural, social, resources, governance) that involves evaluating 70 indicators through more than 70 semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders. Our results highlight that forest management in France, and more broadly in Europe, is mainly based on technical approaches, which build stakeholders’ confidence in their capacity to maintain the status quo. We observe asymmetry in capital distribution in some FSES, mainly through the maximization of the resources capital, which can constraint FSESs in a robustness trap. To develop adaptive capacity for small perturbations as well as transformability, forestry stakeholders should be encouraged to compromises. More balanced capital distribution, with decreased economic benefits, along with new technical approaches and changes to the landscape composition could be necessary to ensure the long-term adaptability of FSES to climate change. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive capacity; Compromise; Natural capital; Robustness trap; Social capital; Transformability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073993977

Herbivore impacts are, in turn, influenced by predators that place top-down forcing on prey species within a given body size range. Here, we explore how the functional composition of terrestrial large-herbivore and -carnivore guilds varies between three mammal distribution scenarios: Present-Natural, Current-Day and Extant-Native Trophic (ENT) Rewilding. Considering the effects of herbivore species weakly influenced by top-down forcing, we quantify the relative influence keystone large-herbivore guilds have on methane emissions, woody vegetation expansion, fire dynamics, large-seed dispersal, and nitrogen and phosphorus transport potential.We find strong regional differences in the number of herbivores under weak top-down regulation between our three scenarios, with important implications for how they will influence climate change relevant processes. Under the Present-Natural non-ruminant, megaherbivore, browsers were a particularly important guild across much of the world. Megaherbivore extinction and range contraction and the arrival of livestock mean large, ruminant, grazers have become more dominant. ENT Rewilding can restore the Afrotropics and the Indo-Malay realm to the Present-Natural benchmark, but causes top-down forcing of the largest herbivores to become commonplace elsewhere. ENT Rewilding will reduce methane emissions, but does not maximize natural climate solution potential. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Climate change; Functional ecology; Herbivory; Macroecology; Mammals","carnivore; climate change; functional change; guild; herbivore; herbivory; macroecology; mammal; mitigation; top-down control; trophic environment; Mammalia; animal; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; mammal; physiology; procedures; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Mammals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078363240

Methods: We use a quasi-experimental design to investigate the causal relationship between regulation of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter (PM 2.5) and mortality among those 65 years of age and older. We exploit regulatory changes in the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). Regulation in 2005 impacted areas of the United States differentially based on pre-regulation air quality levels for PM 2.5. We use county-level mortality data, extracted from claims data managed by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, merged to county-level average PM 2.5readings and attainment status as classified by the Environmental Protection Agency. Results: Based on estimates from log-linear difference-in-differences models, our results indicate after the CAAA designation for PM 2.5in 2005, PM 2.5levels decreased 1.59 micrograms per cubic meter (95% CI = 1.39, 1.80) and mortality rates among those 65 and older decreased by 0.93% (95% CI = 0.10%, 1.77%) in nonattainment counties, relative to attainment ones. Results are robust to a series of alternate models, including nearest-neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates. Conclusion: This analysis suggests large health returns to the 2005 PM 2.5designations, and provides evidence of a causal association between pollution and mortality among the Medicare population. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The results show that significant co-benefits can be found for a range of technological options, such as introducing a limitation on bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) or nuclear power. Cumulative premature mortality may be reduced by 17–23% by 2020–2050 compared to the baseline, depending on the scenarios. However, the ratio of health co-benefits to mitigation costs varies substantially, ranging from 1.45 when a bioenergy limitation is set to 2.19 when all technologies are available.

It describes a multistep study that involves understanding and analyzing how the tool responds to (1) the sectors of GHG emission of a community-scale carbon footprint tool, Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC); (2) the GHG emissions of the municipality; (3) the strategies of the Municipal Climate Change Policy; and (4) the climate change related strategies of a local LEED-ND-certified precinct. Results show that although LEED-ND addresses the GPC's main sources of GHG emissions and the strategies of São Paulo's climate change policy, there is still a need to either improve or better integrate NSA with other tools in a systemic and contextualized approach that does not apply them in isolation. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Climate change; Decarbonization; Greenhouse gases; Leadership in energy and environmental design for neighborhood development (LEED-ND); Low-carbon communities; Mitigation; Neighborhood sustainability assessment","Carbon footprint; Decarbonization; Developing countries; Environmental design; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Climate change policies; GHG emission; Greenhouse gas emission inventories; Leadership in energy and environmental designs; Low-carbon communities; Mitigation; Multi-step; Neighborhood sustainability assessments; Climate change; climate change; development strategy; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; neighborhood; sustainability; urban design; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076051865

Epidemiological studies have associated diseases such as Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Lower Respiratory Infection (LRI), and Lung Cancer (LNC) to long-term PM2.5 exposure resulting in premature mortality. In the present work, the Integrated Exposure Response (IER) model is used to estimate such premature deaths for the year 2016 in 29 million-plus Indian cities. The city-specific registered deaths data along with information of percent share of cause-specific deaths in the total deaths and measured ambient PM2.5 concentrations are used to estimate cause-specific baseline mortality in a city. The premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure is estimated from this baseline mortality. The premature mortality burden attributable to PM2.5 exposure in these cities is 114,700 (104,100–125,500) deaths from the five causes (IHD, Stroke, COPD, LRI, and LNC). IHD is the leading cause of death accounting for 58% of PM2.5 related premature deaths, followed by Stroke (22%), COPD (14%), LRI (4%), and LNC (2%) in these 29 cities. The estimated number of PM2.5 related deaths in productive age group (25 – 50 years) is quite low compared to older people, but the percentage share of these deaths in the cumulative cause-specific baseline deaths is higher for productive age group. Thus, the productive population is considerably at a higher risk of mortality due to PM2.5 exposure. There is approximately 18% and 70% reduction in premature mortality if these cities can attain National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (40 μg/m3) and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (10 μg/m3) of annual PM2.5, respectively. The estimates of air pollution related mortality at the city level could assist in city-specific policy formulation for better air pollution control. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Baseline mortality; Indian cities; Integrated Exposure Response; Measured PM2.5 levels; Registered Deaths","Air quality; Air quality standards; Pulmonary diseases; Shareholders; Baseline mortality; Indian cities; Integrated Exposure Response; Measured PM2.5 levels; Registered Deaths; Air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); disease prevalence; epidemiology; health impact; mortality; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution effect; pollution policy; World Health Organization; adult; aged; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; concentration (parameter); disease burden; environmental exposure; groups by age; high risk population; human; India; ischemic heart disease; lower respiratory tract infection; lung cancer; particulate matter; practice guideline; premature mortality; priority journal; register; World Health Organization; air pollution; city; environmental exposure; mortality; particulate matter; premature mortality; India; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Humans; India; Mortality; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076534442

The study of the dispersion of aerosols, such as contaminants, in the workplace and the search for solutions to capture them are the biggest challenges currently faced in the field of occupational safety and health. In addition, laws and regulations that limit the level of worker exposure to contaminants in workplaces are becoming stricter. The aim of this study was to help reduce exposure to dust, including crystalline silica dust, emitted during the granite polishing process. During this process, the ultrafine particles generated are more difficult to capture than the fine ones, especially in rotational polishing, which causes the worst cases of dust exposure. An experimental test bench was set up to simulate ultrafine particle dispersion and assess three solutions for reducing worker exposure during the rotational polishing process. The use of the test bench allowed experiments to be performed while avoiding human exposure. Results showed that the test bench efficiently simulated the dispersion of ultrafine particle dust. Three solutions designed to reduce dust emissions, based on local exhaust ventilation, were evaluated on the test bench: a push–pull system, a dust shroud and a tool with integrated suction slots. They proved to be more than 95% effective. The results of this work highlight that the performance of local exhaust ventilation systems is very sensitive to the suction flowrate and the speed of the rotating disc, thus illustrating the complexity of dust removal associated with polishing processes in industrial environments. © 2019, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences.","Dispersion; Dry polishing; Experimental simulation; LEV systems; UFPs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077094299

In the state of Wyoming, more than 19,312 km (12,000 mi) of roads are unpaved. Because Wyoming is a leading producer of coal, oil, and natural gas, its unpaved roads have more traffic that results in significant dust emissions. To reduce these emissions, the state currently uses CaCl2 and MgCl2 as dust suppressants. Because its budget is limited, all 19,312 km (12,000 mi) of unpaved roads cannot be treated every year. A previous study concluded that traffic volumes, the percentage of fines passing through a #200 sieve, and annual rainfall make significant contributions to the generation of dust. Considering these factors, this study developed a model that identifies which unpaved roads should be treated given the limited budget. Because the resulting model is nonconvex, an evolutionary solving method was used to identify the best set of projects for chemical treatment. As a case study, the proposed model was implemented on a small network of 23 unpaved roadway segments. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Chemical treatment; Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ); Dust; Dust suppressant; Gravel road; Unpaved road","Air quality; Budget control; Chlorine compounds; Dust; Gas emissions; Gravel roads; Magnesium compounds; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Annual rainfall; Chemical treatments; Congestion mitigation and air qualities; Dust suppressant; Small networks; Solving method; Traffic volumes; Unpaved roads; Coal dust; atmospheric modeling; chemical method; dust; numerical model; optimization; pavement; road; United States; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077185367

In Alpine regions, soil carbon sequestration can play an important role in reducing environmental impacts. However, there is no official methodology to calculate this possible reduction. Biodiversity plays an important role in the Alpine environment and is affected by human activities, such as cattle farming. Our aim was to estimate the carbon footprint (CF) of four different dairy production systems (different in breeds and feeding intensity) by using the LCA approach. The present study included 44 dairy Alpine farms located in the autonomous province of Bolzano in northern Italy. Half of the farms (n = 22) kept Alpine Grey and the other half (n = 22) Brown Swiss cattle. Within breeds, the farms were divided by the amount of concentrated feed per cow and day into high concentrate (HC) and low concentrate (LC). This resulted in 11 Alpine Grey low concentrate (AGLC) farms feeding an average amount of 3.0 kg concentrated feed/cow/day and 11 Alpine Grey high concentrate (AGHC) farms with an average amount of 6.3 kg concentrated feed/cow/day. Eleven farms kept Brown Swiss cows with an average amount of 3.7 kg concentrated feed/cow/day (BSLC) and another 11 farms feeding on average 7.6 kg concentrated feed/cow/day (BSHC). CF for the four systems was estimated using the LCA approach. The functional unit was 1 kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM). Furthermore, two methodologies have been applied to estimate soil carbon sequestration and effect on biodiversity. The system with the lowest environmental impact in terms of CF was BSHC (1.14 kg CO2-eq/kg of FPCM), while the most impactful system was the AGLC group (1.55 kg CO2-eq/kg of FPCM). Including the CF reduction due to soil carbon sequestered from grassland, it decreased differently for the two applied methods. For all four systems, the main factor for CF was enteric emission, while the main pollutant was biogenic CH4. Conversely, AGLC had the lowest impact when the damage to biodiversity was considered (damage score = 0.41/kg of FPCM, damage to ecosystem diversity = 1.78 E-07 species*yr/kg FPCM). In comparison, BSHC had the greatest impact in terms of damage to biodiversity (damage score = 0.56/kg of FPCM, damage to ecosystem diversity = 2.49 E-07 species*yr/kg FPCM). This study indicates the importance of including soil carbon sequestration from grasslands and effects on biodiversity when calculating the environmental performance of dairy farms. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; Dairy production; Damage score; Ecosystem biodiversity; Small-scale dairy farm; Soil carbon sequestration","alpine environment; biodiversity; carbon footprint; cattle; concentration (composition); dairy farming; economic impact; environmental impact; mountain region; soil carbon; Bolzano; Italy; Trentino-Alto Adige; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082550175

Methods: From January 2016 through March 2018, the Center for Climate Change and Health created learning activities, networking and relationship-building opportunities, communication platforms, and information sharing for 12 urban LHDs in the United States. We used administrative data and conducted interviews with participants and key informants to assess success in meeting learning collaborative goals. Results: LHDs developed diverse projects that incorporated internal capacity building, climate and health vulnerability assessments, surveillance, and community engagement. Projects fostered greater LHD engagement on climate change, broadened community partnerships, and furthered LHD integration into jurisdictions’ climate planning. LHD engagement helped shift the dialogue in the community and jurisdiction about climate change to include public health. Conclusions: LHDs have skills and expertise to rapidly partner with other governmental agencies and community-based organizations and to help communities identify vulnerabilities, take action to reduce the health harms of climate change, and—through Health in All Policies approaches and community partnerships—to ensure that climate policies are optimized for positive health and equity outcomes. © 2020, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","adaptation; climate change; health equity; local health departments; resilience","adult; article; capacity building; climate change; health equity; human; interview; learning; public health service; skill; urban health; government; procedures; public health; public health service; United States; urban population; Capacity Building; Climate Change; Health Equity; Humans; Local Government; Public Health; Public Health Administration; United States; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079156902

Bogotá, one of the world's highest-located and largest tropical cities, has made little use of rooftop photovoltaics, despite its potential. Using a simulation model, based on the urban metabolism approach, this paper examines several possible PV technology diffusion paths considering the consumer adoption processes of the residential, commercial, industrial and institutional sectors of the city. Further, the impact of PV diffusion is analyzed in terms of urban metabolism indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions and reduction of technical losses in the electricity system. Results indicate that policy is required for promoting consumer awareness about the use of PVs for meeting electricity demand. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 820,000t of CO2 per year could be achieved. Adoption rates in the residential sector of the order of 26% could be possible. This in turn would represent an installed capacity of 1.5 GW, and emission reductions of 450,000t of CO2 per year. Additionally, the commercial sector could reach a potential installed capacity of 1.2 GW.

In the US it affects over 80% of the population and in general is considered an adverse phenomenon with externalities ranging from increased air pollution to higher energy demand and deteriorated human comfort. Therefore, UHI and its mitigation strategies have been studied extensively to focus on hot summer months and demand for cooling energy. However, current approaches fail to recognize that for regions in cold climates UHI may be a positive phenomenon with benefits from decreased heating energy demand exceeding downsides of higher cooling energy demand. Here, for the period of 12 years we analyze for 48 US states the cost that UHI imposes on the $120B residential market with CO2 emissions that exceed 550 M tons each year. While for states situated in warm climates UHI significantly increases the energy bill, due to varying heating and cooling costs and emissions associated with generation of energy, for some regions located in cold climates, UHI significantly reduces energy demand and carbon emissions.

Some evidence suggests that air pollution exposure during the prenatal period may contribute to adverse cardiorenal health later in life. Here we apply a distributed lag model (DLM) approach to identify critical windows that may underlie the association between prenatal particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) exposure and children's BP at ages 4–6 years. Methods: Participants included 537 mother-child dyads enrolled in the Programming Research in Obesity, GRowth Environment, and Social Stress (PROGRESS) longitudinal birth cohort study based in Mexico City. Prenatal daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatio-temporal model and BP was measured using the automated Spacelabs system with a sized cuff. We used distributed lag models (DLMs) to examine associations between daily PM2.5 exposure and systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), adjusting for child's age, sex and BMI, as well as maternal education, preeclampsia and indoor smoking report during the second and third trimester, seasonality and average postnatal year 1 PM2.5 exposure. Results: We found that PM2.5 exposure between weeks 11–32 of gestation (days 80–226) was significantly associated with children's increased SBP. Similarly, PM2.5 exposure between weeks 9–25 of gestation (days 63–176) was significantly associated with increased DBP. To place this into context, a constant 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 sustained throughout this critical window would predict a cumulative increase of 2.6 mmHg (CI: 0.5, 4.6) in SBP and 0.88 mmHg (CI: 0.1, 1.6) in DBP at ages 4–6 years. In a stratified analysis by sex, this association persisted in boys but not in girls. Conclusions: Second and third trimester PM2.5 exposure may increase children's BP in early life. Further work investigating PM2.5 exposure with BP trajectories later in childhood will be important to understanding cardiorenal trajectories that may predict adult disease. Our results underscore the importance of reducing air pollution exposure among susceptible populations, including pregnant women. © 2019 The Authors","Bayesian distributed lag interaction models; Blood pressure; Distributive lag models; Particulate matter; Prenatal exposure","atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular system; child health; health impact; obesity; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pregnancy; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; Article; blood pressure; child; childhood; cohort analysis; diastolic blood pressure; elevated blood pressure; female; gestation period; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; risk reduction; second trimester pregnancy; sex difference; susceptible population; systolic blood pressure; third trimester pregnancy; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; maternal exposure; Mexico; pregnancy; preschool child; toxicity; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Blood Pressure; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Maternal Exposure; Mexico; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076695711

A well-established method to meet nitrogen oxides emissions’ requirements is selective catalytic reduction with a urea-water solution injection. State-of-the-art designs are based on close-coupled exhaust architecture which suffers from a lack of space for a proper decomposition of a urea-water solution. The optimization of such systems is very challenging and is always intensively supported by numerical simulations. Within this work a two-zone spray representation for a urea-water solution injection is proposed. The two-zone approach captures a non-uniform droplet distribution inside the spray cone while maintaining a reasonable calculation time, since it is still based on a Lagrangian method. The proposed model was applied into exhaust system simulations and tested against a standard spray representation. The results revealed that uniform spray representation led to a smaller wall film formation and different mass balance. Ammonia distribution at the catalyst inlet was not directly affected significantly; however, in real systems one could expect catalyst clogging due to wall film formation, followed by a decrease of ammonia distribution uniformity. The results clearly show that uniform spray representation may lead to misestimation of the selective catalytic reduction system's performance and the novel two-zone approach should be used instead. © 2019 The Authors","CFD; Injection; SCR; Two-phase flow; Urea-water solution; Wall film","Ammonia; Automotive industry; Catalysts; Computational fluid dynamics; Injection (oil wells); Lagrange multipliers; Metabolism; Nitrogen oxides; Thyristors; Two phase flow; Urea; Diesel engine emissions; Distribution uniformity; Lagrangian methods; Nitrogen oxides emission; Selective catalytic reduction systems; System simulations; Wall-films; Water solutions; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075943210

This study aimed to estimate the health and economic co-benefits for the adult population of modal shift from driving to active travel in urban environments. Three scenarios were modelled for the case study, the city of Porto, Portugal, by comparing travel patterns of 2013 to hypothetical scenarios of modal shifts from driving to active transport, namely: i) SC1 - conservative scenario, with a change of 5% from driving to cycling and 10% from driving to walking; ii) SC2 - moderate scenario, with a shift of 10% and 15%, respectively; and iii) SC3 - optimistic scenario, with a shift of 15% and 20%, respectively. The mortality risk reduction for five health outcomes (colon and breast cancers, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease) was assessed, including an estimation of traffic injury and air pollution exposure risks. Results were presented in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) avoided. Economic valuation for each scenario was performed using a Willingness-to-Pay approach for morbimortality and a Cost of Illness approach for 2013 hospitalizations and work absenteeism. Significant health benefits were found in all modelled scenarios, ranging from 1657 (16%) to 2881 (28%) DALYs avoided. Total costs averted ranged from €3894 to €6769 million through the scenarios. Cardio and cerebrovascular diseases mortality presented the largest benefit, accounting for about 3/4 of all avoidable DALYs in all scenarios. Reductions in CO2 and PM10 emissions were calculated, showing a decrease from 31.6 to 73.7 kt of CO2 and 7 to 16 t for PM10, respectively. A modal shift towards active transportation could lead to significant health and economic benefits, indicating that the evaluation of health impacts should be included in the analysis of active transport interventions. © 2019 Elsevier LtdHealth impact assessment should be included when performing a cost-benefit analysis regarding active transportation on public transport policies planning, to understand the economic benefits of related reduced mortality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Active travel; Air pollution; Disability-adjusted life years; Economic valuation; Health impact assessment","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Diseases; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Health risks; Modal analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Active transportations; Active travel; Air pollution exposures; Cerebrovascular disease; Disability adjusted life years; Economic valuation; Health impact assessment; Ischemic heart disease; Cost benefit analysis; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; cardiovascular disease; disability; health impact; health risk; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; public health; absenteeism; air pollution; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; cardiovascular mortality; case study; cerebrovascular disease; colon cancer; cost of illness; cycling; diabetes mellitus; disability-adjusted life year; economic evaluation; health economics; hospitalization cost; ischemic heart disease; particulate matter; physical activity; Portugal; risk reduction; traffic accident; urban area; walking; Willingness To Pay; active transport; adult; car driving; city; cycling; health behavior; human; mortality; procedures; traffic and transport; walking; Porto [Portugal]; Portugal; Adult; Air Pollution; Automobile Driving; Bicycling; Biological Transport, Active; Cities; Health Behavior; Humans; Mortality; Portugal; Risk Reduction Behavior; Transportation; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076344296

However, the relative importance of different terrestrial and aquatic processes driving CO2 production and evasion from streams remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured O2 and CO2 continuously in streams draining tundra-dominated catchments in northern Sweden, during the summers of 2015 and 2016. From this, we estimated daily metabolic rates and CO2 evasion simultaneously and thus provide insight into the role of stream metabolism as a driver of C dynamics in Arctic streams. Our results show that aquatic biological processes regulate CO2 concentrations and evasion at multiple timescales. Photosynthesis caused CO2 concentrations to decrease by as much as 900 ppm during the day, with the magnitude of this diel variation being strongest at the low-turbulence streams. Diel patterns in CO2 concentrations in turn influenced evasion, with up to 45% higher rates at night. Throughout the summer, CO2 evasion was sustained by aquatic ecosystem respiration, which was one order of magnitude higher than gross primary production. Furthermore, in most cases, the contribution of stream respiration exceeded CO2 evasion, suggesting that some stream reaches serve as net sources of CO2, thus creating longitudinal heterogeneity in C production and loss within this stream network. Overall, our results provide the first link between stream metabolism and CO2 evasion in the Arctic and demonstrate that stream metabolic processes are key drivers of the transformation and fate of terrestrial organic matter exported from these landscapes. © 2019 The Authors.

However, in the case of a carbon fiber (CF) and epoxy resin composite, the chemical interactions in the vicinity of the CF may cause the properties of the resin to be different from the rest of the matrix obtaining shorter relaxation times and a greater sensitivity to temperature. This viscoelastic behavior becomes relevant when using the single-fiber fragmentation test to characterize the interfacial shear strength. Such behavior was characterized, by means of the Prony Series of the epoxy resin with two different proportions of curing agent each representing the interfacial region and the matrix. Next, it was modeled considering the elastic properties of the CF, the viscoelastic properties of the interfacial region and the matrix with a three-phase model using the finite element method (FEM). The model represented a fiber fragment from the single fiber fragmentation test (SFFT). A parametric analysis was performed considering different important components in the stress transfer from the matrix to the fiber, especially the elongation rate and the temperature. It was observed that the viscoelastic behavior of the interphase has a larger effect on the interfacial shear strength (IFSS), and notorious differences were observed on the stress transfer efficiency and hereby on the importance of selecting an appropriate testing speed for the SFFT. This analysis is also important in the design or inspection of composite structures/components used in various engineering applications and subjected to large temperature gradients during their operation. © 2019","Finite element method (FEM); Prony series; Single fiber fragmentation test (SFFT); Stress transfer; Viscoelastic behavior","Carbon fibers; Epoxy resins; Fiber reinforced plastics; Shear flow; Viscoelasticity; Fiber reinforced composites; Interfacial shear strength; Prony series; Sensitivity to temperatures; Single fiber fragmentation test; Stress transfer; Stress transfer efficiency; Visco-elastic behaviors; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075740581

The prediction results get mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) close to 2 percent when the region under study has an energy matrix mostly based on fossil fuels, less intermittent. For regions in which more renewable sources are present, the MAPE is around 12 percent. However, in either case, LSTM can predict the hours well with smaller emissions among the next 24 hours. Such day-ahead information brings awareness to the users and allows the scheduling of appliances to work in the hours in which the emissions are minimal, reducing them without significantly affecting the consumers' behavior. © 2016 IEEE.","emission factors; GHG emissions; LSTM; prediction; Smart homes; time series","Automation; Consumer behavior; Costs; Domestic appliances; Electric load management; Energy management; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Intelligent buildings; Long short-term memory; Time series; Time series analysis; Auto regressive process; Emission factors; GHG emission; Load modeling; LSTM; Smart homes; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081756119

Kinetic measurements indicated a rapid activation phase, followed by a continuous slow deactivation. A faster deactivation of CO formation (reverse water-gas shift reaction) compared to that of methanol formation results in an increasing selectivity toward MeOH formation with time on stream. The activation of the catalyst is attributed to a rapid initial reduction of the support (formation of O vacancies). Since based on STEM imaging and XRD measurements sintering of Au nanoparticles is negligible, the subsequent deactivation is attributed to the slow buildup of site-blocking adsorbates, specifically surface carbonates, and/or over-reduction of the catalyst. This is supported also by the reversible nature of the deactivation upon recalcination in O2/N2. Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) measurements, following the buildup/decay of adsorbed formate and methoxy species by DRIFTS upon changing from a CO2/H2 to a CO2/D2 mixture and back under steady-state conditions, indicate that surface formate species are reaction intermediates in the dominant reaction pathway for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, with the calculated rates of formation/decay comparable to the rate of methanol formation. The consequences of these results for the mechanistic understanding of this reaction are discussed.

Despite the clear mutual relevance of solar geoengineering and ESG, few ESG researchers have considered the topic in substantial depth. To stimulate its sustained uptake as a subject within the ESG research program, we identify significant contributions thus far by ESG scholars on the subject of solar geoengineering governance and survey the wider solar geoengineering governance literature from the perspective of the new ESG research framework.

Theses processes rely on a vapor capillary with a delicate, highly dynamic equilibrium of various opposing forces. The direct observation of the vapor capillary's inner surface is hindered with growing capillary depth by the thermal optical emissions with high intensities due to the high temperatures inside the capillary. Even with the use of high intensity laser based illumination and band pass filters adjusted for the laser wavelength, it is merely possible to observe only the upper most part of the capillaries opening. The lack of observability, especially with high temporal resolution to assess the highly dynamic effects contributes to the state of the capillary models that actually are describing quasi-static modes or implement the less dynamic effects that can be observed with state of the art methods. The topographical measurement system, developed by the Institut für Strahlwerkzeuge Universität Stuttgart IFSW, uses the process inherent thermal emission of the capillary governed by the complex refractive index of the base material to reconstruct the inner geometry of the visible capillary surface. This is achieved by using the dependence of the emissivity between emission angle and polarization that is described by the Fresnel equations (Sawannia et al., 2018). The measurement system uses the fact that the quotient of two or more polarization components of the emission from a surface increment is depending on the angle of surface inclination but are almost independent of the surface temperature (Weberpals et al., 2011). Based on the results of the application of the measurement principle with laser beam welding, an adaption to electron beam welding is developed to assess the observability of capillaries with large depth and to contribute in the improvement of capillary models in the wake of the development. To allow the use of the improved measurement system to capture the EBW process capillary with unmatched spatial and temporal resolution, a complete new optical observation beam path was developed and fitted insight a custom-made pressurized chamber inside an electron beam welding machine. © 2020 Institut für Schweißtechnik und Fügetechnik ISF, RWTH Aachen University, Germany","Capillary; Electron Beam Welding; Geometry; Keyhole; laser beam welding; numerical modelling; Process Stability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112503009

In response, analysts have developed multiple robust decision frameworks to help identify investments and policies that can withstand a wide range of future states. Although these frameworks are adept at supporting decisions where uncertainty cannot be represented probabilistically, analysts necessarily choose probabilistic bounds and distributions for uncertain variables to support exploratory modeling. The implications of these assumptions on the analytical outcomes of robust decision frameworks are rarely evaluated, and little guidance exists in terms of how to select uncertain variable distributions. Here, we evaluate the impact of these choices by following the robust decision-making procedure, using four different assumptions about the probabilistic distribution of exogenous uncertainties in future climatic and economic states. We take a water reservoir system in Ethiopia as our case study, and sample climatic parameters from uniform, normal, extended uniform, and extended normal distributions; we similarly sample two economic parameters. We compute regret and satisficing robustness decision criteria for two performance measures, agricultural water demand coverage and net present value, and perform scenario discovery on the most robust reservoir alternative. We find lower robustness scores resulting from extended parameter distributions and demonstrate that parameter distributions can impact vulnerabilities identified through scenario discovery. Our results suggest that exploratory modeling within robust decision frameworks should sample from extended, uniform parameters distributions. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis","Climate change; deep uncertainty; parameterization; robust decision making","Decision making; Investments; Normal distribution; Parameterization; Reservoirs (water); Uncertainty analysis; Climate change adaptation; Deep uncertainties; Economic parameters; Parameter distributions; Probabilistic bounds; Probabilistic distribution; Robust decisions; Uncertainty parameters; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; economic conditions; parameter estimation; parameterization; uncertainty analysis; water demand; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073926639

Here, we present data consistent with the positive effect that the expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana H+-PPase (AVP1) has on reduced carbon partitioning and yield increases in wheat. Immunohistochemical localization of H+-PPases (TaVP) in spring wheat Bobwhite L. revealed the presence of this conserved enzyme in wheat vasculature and sink tissues. Of note, immunogold imaging showed a plasma membrane localization of TaVP in sieve element- companion cell complexes of Bobwhite source leaves. These data together with the distribution patterns of a fluorescent tracer and [U14C]-sucrose are consistent with an apoplasmic phloem-loading model in wheat. Interestingly, 14C-labeling experiments provided evidence for enhanced carbon partitioning between shoots and roots, and between flag leaves and milk stage kernels in AVP1 expressing Bobwhite lines. In keeping, there is a significant yield improvement triggered by the expression of AVP1 in these lines. Green house and field grown transgenic wheat expressing AVP1 also produced higher grain yield and number of seeds per plant, and exhibited an increase in root biomass when compared to null segregants. Another agriculturally desirable phenotype showed by AVP1 Bobwhite plants is a robust establishment of seedlings. © Copyright © 2020 Regmi, Yogendra, Gomes Farias, Li, Kandel, Yadav, Sha, Trittermann, Short, George, Evers, Plett, Ayre, Roy and Gaxiola.","H+-PPase (proton pyrophosphatase); PPi metabolism; reduced carbon partition; wheat (Triticum aestivum); yield",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082710921

The application of two solar assisted solutions has been assessed for an office building located in Finland. The first one is a solar assisted absorption heat pump, which uses solar collectors and district heating as the main heating source. The other solution is a photovoltaic (PV) driven air source heat pump. The solar assisted absorption heat pump is able to upgrade the low temperature (5–10 °C) solar thermal energy into useful heat for building heating supply (renewable energy share of the heating season is about 19%), demonstrating that solar thermal energy can effectively contribute to supplying heat to buildings also in Northern European countries. The solar assisted absorption heat pump shows higher renewable energy share than the PV driven heat pump when comparing system solutions with the same area of installed solar technologies. However, the cost analysis shows that the electrically driven system is more economical viable. In a 15-year timescale, the cost of the electrically driven system is almost half of the thermally driven system. Therefore, costs of this solution have to considerably decrease to make solar assisted absorption heat pump competitive in Northern Europe. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption heat pump; Cold climate; District heating; Heat pump; Photovoltaic; Solar collectors","Cost benefit analysis; District heating; Office buildings; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Temperature; Thermal energy; Absorption heat pumps; Building applications; Cold climate; Heat pumps; Photovoltaic; Renewable energies; Solar assisted heat pump; Solar thermal energy; Air source heat pumps; alternative energy; building; climate; heating; low temperature; photovoltaic system; pump; solar power; temperature effect; Finland; Northern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072638769

Optical gas imaging-based leak detection and repair (LDAR) surveys are commonly used to address fugitive methane emissions or leaks. Despite widespread use, there is little empirical measurement of the effectiveness of LDAR programs at reducing long-term leakage, especially over the scale of months to years. In this study, we measure the effectiveness of LDAR surveys by quantifying emissions at 36 unconventional liquids-rich natural gas facilities in Alberta, Canada. A representative subset of these 36 facilities were visited twice by the same detection team: an initial survey and a post-repair re-survey occurring ∼0.5-2 years after the initial survey. Overall, total emissions reduced by 44% after one LDAR survey, combining a reduction in fugitive emissions of 22% and vented emissions by 47%. Furthermore, >90% of the leaks found in the initial survey were not emitting in the re-survey, suggesting high repair effectiveness. However, fugitive emissions reduced by only 22% because of new leaks that occurred between the surveys. This indicates a need for frequent, effective, and low-cost LDAR surveys to target new leaks. The large reduction in vent emissions is associated with potentially stochastic changes to tank-related emissions, which contributed ∼45% of all emissions. Our data suggest a key role for tank-specific abatement strategies as an effective way to reduce oil and gas methane emissions.

Beside urban park and residential green, recreation in urban forests can act as therapeutic means. From a climatological point of view, urban and periurban forests and green spaces provide a number of benefits particularly including air temperature and humidity control as well as air pollution reduction. Due to their compensating thermal effects urban green and urban forests may help to counteract potentially health relevant effects of urban warming. The main objective of our study is to explore the quantification of forest recreation based on measurement campaigns for the combined simultaneous recording of relevant features along routes comprising varying urban structural types (ranging from built up to densely forested areas). Combining data on subjective well-being and objective data on human physiology can help to quantify health effects of varying environments. The study area is the urban forest of Augsburg, in the German Federal State of Bavaria, Southern Germany. Our results substantiate clear cut and statistically significant climatic differences among varying urban environments (i.e. local climate zone categories) and prove the potential positive effects of urban forests/urban green on bioclimatic conditions (e.g. via a reduction in maximum air temperatures during summer). Moreover, the beneficial effects of urban green structures on human physiological parameters (e.g. reductions in heart rate) could be verified. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Ecosystem services; Forest recreation; Local climate zones; Machine learning","air temperature; atmospheric pollution; bioclimatology; climate conditions; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; greenspace; physiology; pollution control; urban forestry; Augsburg; Bavaria; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078660901

However, designing a catalyst, especially a zeolite, that can operate at mid-low temperatures (where the selective CO2 conversion is favored) is still a challenge for the scientific community. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel coated ZrS/SAPO-34 in combination with an iron catalyst (Fe2O3@KO2) that successfully fills this temperature gap. While making use of the properties of the zeolite to maximize light olefin selectivity, the unique nature of the sulfated zircona (ZrS) layer allows the cracking of C5+ heavy hydrocarbons produced on the Fe component at temperatures where conventional zeolites fall short. In particular, total short olefin yields per pass over 20% at CO2 conversions near 50% (total C2-C4 olefin selectivity = 40-45) can be achieved at T = 375 °C, P = 30 bar, H2/CO2 = 3 and 5000 mL g-1 h-1. Light olefin space-time yields here reported (10.4 mmol gcat-1 h-1) clearly outperform conventional zeolite based bifunctional systems for CO2 conversion.

One of the important variables in this context is precipitation. The investigation of precipitation, one of the most important meteorological factors directly affecting accessibility to water resources, is of special importance. In every region, studies of precipitation on daily, monthly, or annual scales provide important information on the distribution, concentration, and dispersion of precipitation, as well as some conclusions about the associated hydrological problems. In this study, the precipitation concentration was calculated and zoned by means of the precipitation concentration index (PCI) in the basin of Lake Urmia, using monthly and annual rainfall data of 42 selected rain gauge stations, from which 24 stations located in the West Azerbaijan province (in the west of Lake Urmia) and 18 stations located in the East Azerbaijan province (in the east of Lake Urmia) during 1984–2013. The results of the studies of the precipitation concentration index over the basin of Lake Urmia showed that the dominant concentrations of spring, autumn, and winter precipitation were moderate, indicating a moderate distribution for the precipitation of the months in these seasons. In addition, in the period under study, uniform and regular precipitation concentrations (PCI<10) were observed only in winter and in the borders of the basin. In summer, almost the entire surface of the basin (excluding its northeastern part) faced a strongly irregular distribution of precipitation, indicating irregular rainfall in July, August, and September. Most of the basin of Lake Urmia is covered by an irregular distribution of precipitation on an annual scale. By investigating the precipitation distribution in the first and the last 10 years of the statistical period considered and by comparing them, it was revealed that the greatest increase in the precipitation concentration index was in autumn, it rose by approximately 20.55 percent. According to the results, on the basin scale, the concentration index showed that the daily rainfall of the Lake Urmia basin was neither in regular nor in strongly irregular conditions at any of the stations studied. All the stations studied were in fairly regular, moderate concentration and fairly irregular conditions of daily precipitation distribution. The results also showed that the moderate concentration includes most of the daily precipitation distributions throughout the basin. © 2020, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Due to road traffic emissions being a major source of emissions and exposure in European cities, it is necessary to account for differentiated transport environments in population dynamics for exposure studies. In this study, we applied a modelling system to evaluate population exposure in the urban area of Hamburg in 2016. The modeling system consists of an urban-scale chemistry transport model to account for ambient air pollutant concentrations and a dynamic time-microenvironment-activity (TMA) approach, which accounts for population dynamics in different environments as well as for infiltration of outdoor to indoor air pollution. We integrated different modes of transport in the TMA approach to improve population exposure assessments in transport environments. The newly developed approach reports 12% more total exposure to NO2 and 19% more to PM2.5 compared with exposure estimates based on residential addresses. During the time people spend in different transport environments, the in-car environment contributes with 40% and 33% to the annual sum of exposure to NO2 and PM2.5, in the walking environment with 26% and 30%, in the cycling environment with 15% and 17% and other environments (buses, subway, suburban, and regional trains) with less than 10% respectively. The relative contribution of road traffic emissions to population exposure is highest in the in-car environment (57% for NO2 and 15% for PM2.5). Results for population-weighted exposure revealed exposure to PM2.5 concentrations above the WHO AQG limit value in the cycling environment. Uncertainties for the exposure contributions arising from emissions and infiltration from outdoor to indoor pollutant concentrations range from −12% to +7% for NO2 and PM2.5. The developed “dynamic transport approach” is integrated in a computationally efficient exposure model, which is generally applicable in European urban areas. The presented methodology is promoted for use in urban mobility planning, e.g., to investigate on policy-driven changes in modal split and their combined effect on emissions, population activity and population exposure. © 2020 by the authors.

De facto deals between the state and businesses, rather than de jure rules, characterise the state-business relationship in Indian states.

In this perspective, it is paramount to highlight physiological mechanisms of plant responses to changing environments. To determine the impact of cold stress on the physiological attributes of high altitude plant natives, i.e. Pedicularis punctata and Plantago major, we studied the protein, sugar and proline contents, as well as abscisic acid (ABA) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) in leaves collected from three different altitudinal ranges in Himalayan region of Pakistan. Leaves were collected at the initial blooming phase from each altitudinal range i.e. 2400–2500 m, 2950–3250 m and 3500–3550 m. Temperature decreases with an increase in the altitude which induces cold acclimation. Both plant species showed significant variation in the concentrations of the ecophysiological attributes evaluated at the different collection altitudes. The concentrations of all compounds except for IAA increased as temperature decreased and altitude increased. IAA showed an opposite response, that is, the concentrations of this phytohormone decreased with decreasing temperature and increasing altitude. We showed that temperature significantly affected the physiological attributes of Pedicularis punctata and Plantago major in the Himalayan region, which works as a proxy for understanding the plant responses to climate change. As per survival and risk assessment, underlying physiological mechanisms of plant response (understory plants) to changing environments (altitude and temperature ranges) revealed adaptation in the chilling environments. Further studies are needed to completely understand how the studied plants photosynthetic characteristics are affected by altitudinal gradient. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Altitude; Cold stress; Ecophysiology; Himalayas; Phytohormones; Temperature","Climate change; Forestry; Physiological models; Physiology; Risk assessment; Temperature; Altitude; Cold stress; Ecophysiology; Himalayas; Phytohormones; Plants (botany); abscisic acid; indoleacetic acid; phytohormone; plant protein; proline; sugar; adaptation; concentration (composition); ecophysiology; environmental stress; hormone; physiology; plant; temperature anomaly; altitude acclimatization; Article; climate change; cold acclimatization; cold stress; concentration (parameter); environmental change; environmental impact; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; nonhuman; Pakistan; Pedicularis; Pedicularis punctata; photosynthesis; plant leaf; plant physiology; plant response; Plantago major; priority journal; risk assessment; seasonal variation; acclimatization; adaptation; altitude; plant; plant physiology; temperature; Himalayas; Pedicularis; Plantago major; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Altitude; Pakistan; Plant Leaves; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076244662

Air pollution unnecessarily increases morbidity, mortality rates, and environmental degradation globally. This paper presents results from a content analysis of all (n=133) submissions to the 2019 New South Wales Government call for public feedback to its 'Clean Air' issues and action priorities. Findings show stakeholder agreement that air pollution's regulation and measurement are problematic. Issue framing divulged stakeholder agendas, particularly for shipping industries, highlighted inconsistencies in government and industry regulations, and revealed mistrust and issue partiality. Science literacy, proximity to pollution source, socioeconomic status, and pollution visibility affected issue descriptions and recommendations. Cruise ships in Sydney Harbour received disproportionately high focus relative to their contribution to the shipping industry's contribution to local air pollution. Government and health body submissions proposed public education, awareness raising, and personal action as key steps to avoid emission exposure. We argue such 'deficit theory' approaches are inadequate in light of international research evidencing pollution visibility and personal perception poorly reflect scientific air quality measures. To surpass Australian NIMBY approaches to air pollution, we propose adopting European international legislative reform to equitably enforce clean air 'rights' and actions across industries, governments, and communities, irrespective of stakeholder priorities. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

We reanalyzed the high-resolution spectra of comet C/2016 R2 obtained in February 2018 using the UVES spectrograph of the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope. Various forbidden atomic emission lines of [CI], [NI], and [OI] were observed in the optical spectrum of this comet when it was at 2.8 au from the Sun. The observed forbidden emission intensity ratios are studied in the framework of a couple-chemistry emission model. Results. The model calculations show that CO2 is the major source of both atomic oxygen green and red doublet emissions in the coma of C/2016 R2 (while for most comets it is generally H2O), whereas, CO and N2 govern the atomic carbon and nitrogen emissions, respectively. Our modeled oxygen green-to-red-doublet and carbon-to-nitrogen emission ratios are higher by a factor of three than what is found from observations. These discrepancies could be due to uncertainties associated with photon cross sections or unknown production and/or loss sources. Our modeled oxygen green-to-red-doublet emission ratio is close to what is seen in observations when we consider an O2 abundance with a production rate of 30% relative to the CO production rate. We constrained the mean photodissociation yield of CO, producing C(1S) at about 1%, a quantity which has not been measured in the laboratory. The collisional quenching is not a significant loss process for N(2D) though its radiative lifetime is significant (∼10 h). Hence, the observed [NI] doublet-emission ratio ([NI] 5198/5200) of 1.22, which is smaller than the terrestrial measurement by a factor 1.4, is mainly due to the characteristic radiative decay of N(2D). © ESO 2020.","Atomic processes; Comets: individual: C/2016 R2 (Pan-STARRS); Molecular processes; Techniques: spectroscopic","Carbon; Chemical reactions; Electromagnetic wave emission; Oxygen; Spectroscopic analysis; Collisional quenching; Emission intensity ratio; European Southern Observatory; High-resolution spectra; Model calculations; Nitrogen emissions; Radiative lifetime; Very large telescope; Atoms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084139934

Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is used as a tool to quantify the GHG emissions from logistics but in the past the majority of LCAs have been steady-state and linear, when in reality, non-linear and temporal aspects (such as weather conditions, seasonal biomass demand, storage capacity, etc.) also have an important role to play. Thus, the objective of this paper was to optimise the environmental sustainability of forest biomass logistics (in terms of GHG emissions) by introducing the dynamic aspects of the supply chain and using the geographical information system (GIS) and agent-based modelling (ABM). The use of the GIS and ABM adds local conditions to the assessment in order to make the study more relevant. In this study, GIS was used to investigate biomass availability, biomass supply points and the road network around a large-scale combined heat and power plant in Naantali, Finland. Furthermore, the temporal aspects of the supply chain (e.g., seasonal biomass demand and storage capacity) were added using ABM to make the assessment dynamic. Based on the outcomes of the GIS and ABM, a gate-to-gate LCA of the forest biomass supply chain was conducted in order to calculate GHG emissions. In addition to the domestic biomass, we added imported biomass from Riga, Latvia to the fuel mixture in order to investigate the effect of sea transportation on overall GHG emissions. Finally, as a sensitivity check, we studied the real-time measurement of biomass quality and its potential impact on overall logistical GHG emissions. According to the results, biomass logistics incurred GHG emissions ranging from 2.72 to 3.46 kg CO2-eq per MWh, depending on the type of biomass and its origin. On the other hand, having 7% imported biomass in the fuel mixture resulted in a 13% increase in GHG emissions. Finally, the real-time monitoring of biomass quality helped save 2% of the GHG emissions from the overall supply chain. The incorporation of the GIS and ABM helped in assessing the environmental impacts of the forest biomass supply chain in local conditions, and the combined approach looks promising for developing LCAs that are inclusive of the temporal aspects of the supply chain for any specific location. © 2020 by the authors.","Agent-based modelling; Biomass; Energy; Geographical information system; Life cycle assessment; Logistics","alternative energy; anthropogenic source; biomass; combined heat and power; demand-side management; GIS; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; logistics; power plant; seasonality; Finland; Latvia; Naantali; Riga; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082595158

However, all previous studies of the NAAQS ignore this joint nature and focus solely on the effects of NAAQS non-attainment designation on various economic outcomes. Additionally, previous studies ignore the potentiality of regulatory spillover, i.e., abatement for one pollutant decreasing emissions of other, non-regulated pollutants, from the NAAQS. In this paper, we first examine the actions of plant managers who face varying degrees of regulatory oversight. We then estimate the differential effects of the NAAQS and NSR on emissions at coal-fired power plants, while also examining spillover effects. Collectively, this study adds to the literature on environmental regulation in two key ways. First, we use comprehensive data on facility-level NSR permit receipt to examine the differential effects of the NAAQS on plants regulated jointly by NSR and NAAQS non-attainment and those plants regulated only by NAAQS non-attainment. We investigate how the monitoring of areas with non-attainment designation leads to the avoidance of regulatory scrutiny by local plants and find that regulated facilities not subjected to the technological requirements of NSR decreased NO x emissions by 20%. We also examine the mechanisms through which this abatement occurs, e.g., technology, use of cleaner inputs. Second, we identify the spillover effects of the NAAQS for certain pollutants by examining the effects of disparate non-attainment designations from the emissions in question. We find a significant decrease in NO x and CO 2 emissions as a result of carbon monoxide and SO 2-affected non-attainment designation, respectively. We provide evidence that regulatory spillover in this case is the result of different emission control strategies. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Co-benefits; Coal-fired power plants; National Ambient Air Quality Standards; New Source Review; Nitrogen oxide; Spillover; Sulfur dioxide","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Fossil fuel power plants; Mining; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Sulfur dioxide; Co benefits; Coal-fired power plant; National ambient air quality standards; New Source Reviews; Spillover; Air quality standards; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; coal-fired power plant; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; pollutant removal; regulatory approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077039428

This study aims to determine the floristic composition and demographic structures of different stands within the Sidi R'Ghies forest, north-east of Algeria. Data were collected using floristic surveys, diameter measurements at 1.30 m and total height for trees in four plots with size for each plot of 1000 m2. The diversity indices have been calculated on the basis of specific frequencies. The analysis revealed a low floristic richness with 6 woody species belonging to 5 families with the most dominant are the Cupressaceae and Fagaceae (29%). The low density of woody trees (97.78 individuals/ha) was found in Plot 1 and the high density of 205.56 individuals/ha was found in Plot 4. The diametric structure adjusts to the Weibull distribution and shows a predominance of young individuals. The distribution of trees in height classes shows a single distribution with an asymmetric curve. This positive distribution reveals a predominance of individuals with a height between 2 and 8 m (sapling to mature stage).

Both the schemes have a reasonable global geographical distribution of TC genesis locations with under simulation in the eastern North Atlantic and northwestern Australian regions. The mean annual TC frequency in the model is similar to observations using the CSIRO scheme but higher using the OWZP scheme, whereas the annual frequency in reanalysis using the OWZP scheme is similar to observations but halved using the CSIRO scheme. In the CSIRO scheme, both the resolution-dependent thresholds and large-scale climate may play a role for skilful TC formation statistics. In contrast, large-scale climate leads to changes in OWZP TC detections. This highlights the importance of the large-scale environment for TC detections in both the tracking schemes. The OWZP scheme can differentiate the monsoon lows from the actual TCs in the north Indian Ocean compared to the CSIRO scheme, which incorrectly detects them as TCs in the monsoon season. The distribution of TC lifetime in the model using the OWZP scheme is similar to observations. Conversely, the CSIRO scheme detected TCs have shorter lifetimes, perhaps due to intrinsic tracking scheme differences. Although the tracking schemes are fundamentally different, the study shows that there exist some similarities between them and for certain TC formation characteristics the OWZP scheme performs better compared to the CSIRO scheme. © 2020 The Authors.","high-resolution climate model; tracking schemes; tropical cyclone frequency","climate modeling; geographical distribution; monsoon; sea surface temperature; sensitivity analysis; tracking; tropical cyclone; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082313832

Referring to the aforesaid statement, this research aims to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on reservoir operations in the Huong River Basin, Vietnam. To enable further representation of climate change impacts, the HadGEM3-RA Regional Climate Model (RCM) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 climate change scenario was used in this study. For assessing the level of flood risk posed to the study area, a coupled HEC-HMS hydrologic model and HEC-RAS hydrodynamic model was used to represent the behaviour of flow regimes under climate change impacts in the Huong River Basin. The key results demonstrated that the mean temperature and mean annual rainfall would be increased in the future from 0.2–0.8°C, and 4.8–6.0%, respectively. Consequently, the mean annual runoff and mean water level would also be increased from 10–30%, and 0.1–0.3 m above mean sea level, respectively. Moreover, the proposed reservoir operation rules corresponding to flood control warning stages was also derived to reduce peak flows downstream during the rainy season. Finally, the main findings of this study can be a good example for future planning of flood control reservoir systems in Vietnam. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","climate change; flood control; HEC-HMS; HEC-RAS; reservoir operation","climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; flood control; hydrological modeling; regional climate; reservoir; runoff; water level; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082737100

Based on daily data of air quality index (AQI) and air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) from 2015 to 2016, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of air pollution and influencing factors in Henan Province, a key region of the BTH air pollution transmission channel. The result showed that non-attainment days and NAQI were slightly improved at the provincial scale during the study period, whereas that in Hebi, Puyang, and Anyang became worse. PM2.5 was the largest contributor to the air pollution in all cities based on the number of non-attainment days, but its mean frequency decreased by 21.62%, with the mean occurrence of O3 doubled. The spatial distribution of NAQI presented a spatial agglomeration pattern, with high-high agglomeration area varying from Jiaozuo, Xinxiang, and Zhengzhou to Anyang and Hebi. In addition, the NAQI was negatively correlated with sunshine duration, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and positively to atmospheric pressure and relative humidity in all four clusters, whereas relationships between socioeconomic factors and NAQI differed among them. These findings highlight the need to establish and adjust regional joint prevention and control of air pollution as well as suggest that it is crucially important for implementing effective strategies for O3 pollution control. © 2020 by the authors.

Compared to conventional anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (AAO) process, the proposed AO-AAR process achieved more efficient and stable nitrogen removal with greatly shorter HRT (5.6 h) and SRT (8 d) at 10.4 °C, with NH4+-N and total nitrogen in the effluent below 1.5 and 8.0 mg/L, respectively. The AO-AAR also obtained efficient phosphorus removal (&lt;0.5 mg/L) by dosing aluminum in aerobic tank. High load and short SRT deteriorated sludge settleability and dewaterability, but enhanced methane production by improving sludge biodegradability. Dosing aluminum made the AO operating module more stable with improved settleability and dewaterability, and further enhanced methane production. Short HRT and SRT also resulted in the thriving of filamentous bacteria (Thiothrix) and heterotrophic nitrifiers (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Rhodobacter) in the AO module, which helped in enhancing denitrification potential and nitrification efficiency under low temperature. Long-term operation showed that exchange capacity and physicochemical properties of zeolite were unchanged under NaClO–NaCl regeneration by introducing the tail gas from aerobic tank into the used regenerant to remove Ca2+ and Mg2+ exchanged from effluent of the AO module. Techno-economic analysis showed that the AO-AAR process is attractive and sustainable for municipal wastewater treatment by significantly improving nitrogen removal, greatly reducing land occupancy, enhancing methane production and achieving efficient reduction of carbon dioxide emission. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ion exchange; Nitrogen removal; Regeneration; Wastewater treatment; Zeolite","Aluminum; Ammonia; Anoxic water; Bacteria; Biodegradability; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Effluents; Gas adsorption; Global warming; Ion exchange; Methane; Nitrification; Phosphorus; Physicochemical properties; Reclamation; Sodium chloride; Tanks (containers); Temperature; Wastewater treatment; Zeolites; Carbon dioxide emissions; Enhancing denitrifications; Hydraulic retention time; Municipal wastewater treatment; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Regeneration; Sludge biodegradabilities; Techno-Economic analysis; Nitrogen removal; aluminum; ammonia; calcium; magnesium; methane; nitrogen; phosphorus; zeolite; ammonia; nitrogen; adsorption; aluminum; ammonia; ammonium; anoxic conditions; bacterium; carbon dioxide; denitrification; nitrogen; oxic conditions; physicochemical property; pollutant removal; sodium chloride; wastewater treatment; zeolite; Acinetobacter; Article; biodegradability; carbon footprint; denitrification; hydraulic retention time; low temperature; microbial community; municipal wastewater; nitrification; nonhuman; physical chemistry; priority journal; Pseudomonas; Rhodobacter; sludge; solids retention time; Thiothrix; waste water management; adsorption; bioreactor; pollutant; sewage; waste water; Acinetobacter; Pseudomonas; Rhodobacter; Thiothrix; Adsorption; Ammonia; Bioreactors; Environmental Pollutants; Nitrogen; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075189697

We then constructed a model for CO2 emissions prediction based on a revised version of the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model and used it to simulate energy-related CO2 emissions in five scenarios. Results show that: (1) From 2010 to 2017, the economic output effect was a significant, direct, dominant, and long-term driver of increasing CO2 emissions; (2) The STIRPAT model predicted that energy structure will be the decisive factor restricting total CO2 emissions from 2018 to 2035; (3) Low-carbon development in the electric power sector is the best strategy for Changxing to achieve low-carbon development. Under the tested scenarios, Changxing will likely reach peak total CO2 emissions (17.95 million tons) by 2030. Measures focused on optimizing the overall industrial structure, adjusting the internal industry sector, and optimizing the energy structure can help industry-oriented counties achieve targeted carbon reduction and control, while simultaneously achieving rapid economic development. © 2020 by the authors.","County level; Energy consumption; LMDI; Peak CO2 emissions; Scenario analysis; STIRPAT","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; CO2 emissions; County level; LMDI; Scenario analysis; Stirpat; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081538697

Fulfilling this technological demand is not an easy task. Huge data centers consisting large volume of data, large number of servers and various other auxiliary hard ware constitutes the infrastructure needed to support Cloud Computing. The datacenters are set up on a large-scale consisting of many computing nodes and use a tremendous quantity of electrical power which led to higher operational outlays. This increase in energy consumption, demands to rethink the energy efficiency of cloud infrastructures. Nevertheless, we need to analyze the current status prior to changing anything to the infrastructure. One of the key research issues that the cloud computing researchers have been trying to resolve is the reduction of the carbon emission by the data centers. This paper discusses the modern systems, which are developed for the improvement of energy efficiency in case of large scale cloud computing infrastructures while not compromising the quality of services and performance, by investigating all possible areas in the cloud infrastructure responsible for the considerable quantity of energy consumption. A comparative analysis of different survey papers published in recent times is carried out and their key contributions are also reported.

Biomasses are able to substitute the fossil fuels through gasification technology. Gasification converts the biomass using limited air into gaseous fuel containing mainly CO and H2 that are subsequently combusted to produce heat, carbon dioxide, and water. It is obvious that the CO2 is then absorbed by the plants for photosynthesis, maintaining a balanced closed cycle. This study examines the level of global warming potential of this system for supplying heat based on the openLCA v1.9 software. The analysis used a gate-to-gate approach to evaluate scenarios of shell gasification to produce 1 metric tonne of hot-mixed asphalt. The scope covers raw material supply and transportation, palm kernel shell gasification, and products. The evaluation concludes that gasification could potentially reduce CO2 emissions. Environmental impact analysis and interpretation of the results using the openLCA database of Traci 2.1 recommend that greater CO2 emission reduction is possible using palm kernel shell gasification, not only for supplying heat but also for electricity generation to operate all electrical equipments. © 2020, Zhejiang University Press.","Gasification; Global warming; Hot-mixed asphalt; Life cycle analysis; Palm kernel shell",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090597746

All parties ratifying the Paris Agreement have submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), many stating emission reduction targets. The international climate research community has designed five different Shared Socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to characterize various possibilities in demographic and economic changes over the next century. These SSPs were implemented by six integrated assessment model (IAM) teams, which also determined the carbon price trajectory required to limit the temperature rise below 2°C in respective SSPs. In SSP5, also termed the fossil-fueled development scenario, only three IAMs identified that the 2°C target would be feasible, with carbon prices ranging from 220 to 518 US$/tCO2e in 2050. This study aims to analyse the effects of these carbon prices on energy and emissions during 2015–2050 in Nepal. It does so using a long-term energy system model using the framework of the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Enduse (AIM/Enduse) modelling tool. The base case scenario and three carbon price scenarios are developed. Primary energy supply, energy security, energy technology-mix (especially renewable energy usage and hydropower development), emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and local pollutants, and local/regional environmental co-benefits are compared between the base case scenario and carbon price scenarios. The study finds that the implementation of a carbon tax would promote domestic hydropower, improve energy-efficiency and reduce imports of fossil fuels when compared to the base case. Hydropower-based electricity would have a major role in reducing emissions. Key policy insights The carbon prices in SSP5 determined by IAMs to achieve the 2°C target would be sufficient to achieve Nepal’s targets under its NDC in the energy sector. The industry and transport sectors would offer the highest GHG emission reduction. Hydropower and biomass would have major roles in decarbonizing the energy system. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2°C target; AIM/Enduse; carbon tax; GHG mitigation; Nepal; Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","emission control; emission inventory; emissions trading; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; pollution tax; temperature anomaly; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081912953

Canadian energy decision makers are now at a crossroad between making sound fiscal decisions and ramping up efforts to meet emission reduction commitments. Approximately 195,000 people are living in off-grid Canadian communities, with most of these communities relying on fossil-fuel based energy generation. Hybrid renewable energy systems provide a novel solution to address the high costs of off-grid energy and Canada's emission reduction targets. To address the competing stakeholder priorities in off-grid energy planning (e.g., economic, environmental, and system performance), the authors of this paper employed a generalizable combinatorial-based alternative ranking method. Alternative energy technology combinations were simulated to calculate key performance indicator values. The framework allows decision makers to identify the most feasible energy system based on their priorities. A case study was performed with the developed framework for a small off-grid community in British Columbia, Canada. The results show that feasibility of energy system configurations vary greatly based on differing decision-making priorities. The case study also confirmed that hybrid renewable energy systems have better environmental performance compared to their fossil fuel counter parts, but at a significantly higher cost. The study further confirms that the balance between environmental and economic performance of off-grid energy systems can be improved through proper component sizing, management practices, and the integration of energy storage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy planning; Energy system modelling; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Multi criteria decision making; Off-grid energy","Behavioral research; Benchmarking; Decision making; Emission control; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Energy planning; Energy system modelling; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Multi criteria decision making; Off-grids; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075828212

This paper aims to evaluate the suitability of the arable lands located in the Daryache-Namak basin, Iran, for cultivation of several medicinal plants. An approach based on the fuzzy logic was developed that considers potential changes in suitability caused by both climate anomalies and new policies regarding the conflicting water demand. This approach uses different factors, including climate, water availability, soil texture, and salinity to classify the suitability. Monthly outputs of regional climate simulations conducted under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) program were applied to project the future climate. The results showed that climate anomalies and new policies have led to shifts in the spatial distribution of medicinal plants. For instance, the area of highly suitable lands for cultivating medicinal plants was decreased by 10%. Furthermore, the suitability score of the proposed approach had the largest determination coefficient for yield estimations, mainly due to accounting explicitly for various environmental factors. Based on the field survey, it is revealed that the potentially suitable cultivation regions are highly coincident with the existing cultivated locations. Comparing the different polygons indicated that for marginally and not suitable classes, the contribution of maximum and minimum temperature was increased and decreased, respectively. Similarly, in these two classes, the contribution of water availability would increase. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CORDEX; Downscaling; Fuzzy logic; Iran; Vulnerable species","Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Plants (botany); Textures; CORDEX; Determination coefficients; Down-scaling; Environmental factors; Iran; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Regional climate simulation; Vulnerable species; Climate change; climate change; coping strategy; cultivation; downscaling; field method; fuzzy mathematics; medicinal plant; regional climate; salinity; spatial distribution; vulnerability; water availability; water demand; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079453869

It is unclear whether the directivity is caused by the emission mechanism, by reduced radio wave formation toward certain directions, or by absorption/blocking of radio waves along the line of sight. We present here observations of three type IV burst events that occurred on 23, 25, and 29 July 2004, and originated from the same active region. The source location of the first event was near the solar disk center and in the third event near the west limb. Our analysis shows that in the last two events the type IV bursts experienced partial cut-offs in their emission, that coincided with the appearance of shock-related type II bursts. The type II bursts were formed at the flanks and leading fronts of propagating coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These events support the suggestion of absorption toward directions where the type II shock regions are located. © 2019 COSPAR","CME; Coronal mass ejection; Flare; Radio emission; Space weather; Sun","Aerospace engineering; Space research; Sun; Active regions; Coronal mass ejection; Emission mechanism; Flare; Radio emission; Source location; Space observations; Space weather; Radio waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067042292

However, there are still few studies on comprehensive carbon footprint analysis for adding municipal sludge in the cement production. In this study, the lime-dried sludge blended with calcium oxide at the mass mixing ratio of 10% was utilized as raw material for the preparation of Portland cement. The chemical and physical properties of sludge were analyzed. A set of carbon footprint calculation methods of lime-drying treatment of sludge and reuse in cement kilns was then established to explore the feasibility of coprocessing lime-dried sludge in cement kilns. The results showed lime-dried sludge containing CaO, SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 was ideal for cement production as raw material. However, the water content of lime-dried sludge should be strictly limited. The lime-drying process presented the biggest carbon emission (962.1 kg CO2-eq/t sludge), accounting for 89.0% of total emissions. In the clinker-production phase, the lime-dried sludge as raw material substitute and energy source gained carbon credit of 578.8 and 214.2 kg CO2-eq/t sludge, respectively. The sludge used for producing cement clinker could reduce carbon emissions by 38.5% to 51.7%. The addition ratio of lime and stacking time in the sludge lime-drying process could greatly affect the carbon footprint of coprocessing lime-dried sludge in cement kiln. © 2020 by the authors.

The Region of Warmia and Mazury in north-eastern Poland is situated at a distance from conventional energy sources. Therefore, the Region is a Polish leader in power generation from renewable energy sources. The structure of electrical grids in the Region of Warmia and Mazury is poorly developed and insufficient. Therefore, electric power infrastructure should be expanded and modernized as part of energy sector development to increase energy efficiency as well as electricity and heat production from renewable energy sources. The Region of Warmia and Mazury is characterized by a considerable discrepancy between energy generation and energy use. It recent years, electricity consumption exceeded energy production more than 10-fold. The region has to purchase energy from external sources and develop new generation methods, in particular those that rely on renewable resources of energy. In Warmia and Mazury, the most popular renewable energy sources include biomass, wind turbines, solar and photovoltaic panels, hydropower, heat pumps and geothermal energy. The region is characterized by distributed energy generation in small polants that carter mostly to local needs. The University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn has developed, in collaboration with the Warmia and Mazury Energy Agency, a renewable energy strategy for 2010-2020 in the Region of Warmia and Mazury. The strategy is consistent with the Polish Energy Policy and the national plan for the use of renewable energy sources. In the region Warmia and Mazury, efforts are being made to generate 14,000 TJ of energy from renewable sources (approx. 18,4 % of energy consumption in the region) and 1,700 GWh of electricity (approx. 49 % of energy consumption in the region), reduce CO2 emissions in the energy sector by 1,530,000 tons, and the decrease energy consumption per unit of GDP (PLN 1 million) from 1.94 TJ to 1.67 TJ by 2020. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Conventional energy sources; Electric power infrastructure; Electricity-consumption; Energy from renewable sources; Power generation from renewable; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy strategies; Use of renewable energies; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082661592

Approximately 8% of the heat supply to district heating systems comes from excess heat from industrial processes. Many studies indicate that there is a potential to substantially increase this share, and policies promoting energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction provide incentives to do this. Quantifying the medium and long-term economic and carbon footprint benefits of such investments is difficult because the background energy system against which new investments should be assessed is also expected to undergo significant change as a result of the aforementioned policies. Furthermore, in many cases, the district heating system has already invested or is planning to invest in non-fossil heat sources such as biomass-fueled boilers or CHP units. This paper proposes a holistic methodological framework based on energy market scenarios for assessing the long-term carbon footprint and economic benefits of recovering excess heat from industrial processes for use in district heating systems. In many studies of industrial excess heat, it is assumed that all emissions from the process plant are allocated to the main products, and none to the excess heat. The proposed methodology makes a distinction between unavoidable excess heat and excess heat that could be avoided by increased heat recovery at the plant site, in which case it is assumed that a fraction of the plant emissions should be allocated to the exported heat. The methodology is illustrated through a case study of a chemical complex located approximately 50 km from the city of Gothenburg on the West coast of Sweden, from which substantial amounts of excess heat could be recovered and delivered to heat to the city's district heating network which aims to be completely fossil-free by 2030. © 2020 The Authors.

Climate change threats the cities on urban infrastructure, urban life and well-being, urban environment and entire urban system. One of the most obvious impacts of climate change on urban system is the presence of more vulnerability of cities on urban floods due to global sea rise. This is particularly valid for coastal cities. While mitigation strategies could not be comprehensively completed in short time, the adaptation strategies could, therefore, be undertaken to complement the overall strategies to minimize the impacts. An engineering approach can be done at micro-level but should not be the only solution among many possible ways out. Urban planning and design, on the other hand, could be implemented at macro-level. Water sensitive urban design aims at minimizing the negative impacts of water-associated delinquencies through city planning and design. This study attempts to juxtapose the possible engineering approaches to cope with the impacts of climate change in the city at individual micro-level buildings as a way of the urban citizens to adapt to climate change impacts. The engineering solutions proposed in this study are discovered from various studies around the world and adjusted to local conditions taking into account locally available technologies for proper suitability and the solutions are therefore technologically possible, locally adaptable and environmentally friendly.

Research has identified a host of expected or ongoing physical, biological, ecological, and social impacts of climate change on the marine environment, creating a strong climate change adaptation imperative for RFMOs. Through a case study of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), we describe two serious limitations of current RFMO climate change adaptation strategies: (1) a weakened efficacy of resource management and conservation policies caused by viewing climate change as a general climate stressor rather than a unique environmental challenge, and (2) a reliance on incremental policy reform, problematic because it may not enable a pace or scale of policy change proportional to the sustainable development challenges created by a rapidly changing ocean. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of incrementalism and outline potential solutions to the environmental and structural challenges facing the IATTC and other RFMOs, including the concept of adaptation pathways. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptive management; Climate change; Conservation; Fisheries management; IATTC; RFMO","adaptive management; climate change; conservation management; fishery management; policy making; resource management; sustainable development; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Scombridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074535124

The synthetic NC@Fe electrocatalyst enabled efficient and durable CO2 reduction at the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 90.6 % and 93 % reservation of its initial activity after long-term electrolysis. Studies from experiments and DFT calculations indicated that Fe particles induced formation of N-doped carbon layers in NC@Fe electrocatalyst.

The three northeastern provinces (Heilongjiang (HLJ), Jilin (JL), and Liaoning (LN)) are typical heavy industrial regions in China, playing an important role in the national carbon emission reduction target. In this study, we analyzed the energy consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and CO2 emission intensity of each sector in the three regions, and we compared them with the national level and those of China's most developed province Guangdong (GD). Then, based on an input-output (I-O) framework, linkage analysis of production and CO2 emission from sector-system and sector-sector dimensions was conducted. The results showed that the three regions accounted for about 1/10 of China's energy consumption and 1/6 of China's CO2 emissions in 2012. In addition, the level of energy structure, CO2 emission intensity, and sectoral structure lagged behind China's average level, much lower than those for GD. According to the sectoral characteristics of each region and unified backward/forward linkages of production and CO2 emissions, we divided sectoral clusters into those whose development was to be encouraged and those whose development was to be restricted. The results of this paper could provide policy-makers with reference to exploring potential pathways toward energy-related carbon emission reduction in heavy industrial regions. © 2020 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Energy consumption; Heavy industrial regions; Input-output analysis; Sector linkage analysis","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; input-output analysis; policy making; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082557778

Method: The cradle-to-market Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of NZ beef on the European market included beef production on farms, meat processing, packaging and transport stages. Various beef production systems in the Lake Taupō region were modelled: farm systems with and without regulated N leaching limits in place (using N fertiliser inputs of 0 and 100 kg N/ha/year respectively) using suckler beef or beef derived from surplus calves from a dairy farm. The FARMAX model was used to model farm productivity and profitability under these various scenarios, whereas the OVERSEER® model was used to model field/farm emissions (N, phosphorus (P)) and the NZ greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventory model was used to estimate total GHG emissions. Eutrophication and climate change impacts of NZ beef to the European market were calculated using recent regionalised LCA indicators. We estimated freshwater and marine eutrophication impacts of European beef using published N emissions to water and air. We estimated the European consumer's WTP for beef with positive environmental attributes based on a meta-regression analysis based on 21 published studies and compared farmer's profit for the farm system scenarios. Results: When using common P-driven eutrophication indicators, the farms using 100 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year appeared to have a lower freshwater eutrophication impact than farms using no N fertiliser, which is in contradiction with the local freshwater policy for N regulations. When the contribution of both N and P were accounted for, the farms using no N fertiliser had the lowest estimated impact. Comparison with published environmental footprint of beef from Europe showed lower climate change and eutrophication impacts for NZ beef, thus showing potential positive environmental attributes for NZ beef. The European consumer's WTP (32% price premium) for such a beef product with low environmental impacts could offset the cost to farmers for implementing the reduction of N emissions. Conclusions: Bridging the gap between local freshwater policy and LCA indicators starts by considering both P and N emissions and impacts. Combining an environmental LCA with an economic analysis revealed that the consumer willingness to pay could compensate for the environmental cost of protecting the lake that currently only the farmers are bearing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon footprint; Environmental attributes; Freshwater; LCA; Nitrogen; Phosphorus","Agriculture; Beef; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Commerce; Consumer protection; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Dairies; Economic analysis; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Leaching; Life cycle; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Profitability; Regression analysis; Water; Climate change impact; Environmental attributes; Environmental costs; Environmental footprints; Freshwater; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Inventory modeling; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Environmental impact; fertilizer; fresh water; nitrogen; phosphorus; water; carbon footprint; climate change; climate effect; environmental impact; eutrophication; food market; freshwater environment; life cycle analysis; meat; nitrogen; phosphorus; willingness to pay; agricultural worker; air; Article; beef; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; economic aspect; environmental impact; European; eutrophication; farming system; food packaging; greenhouse gas; leaching; life cycle assessment; meat industry; New Zealand; nonhuman; priority journal; animal; bovine; dairying; Europe; eutrophication; red meat; New Zealand; Animals; Cattle; Climate Change; Dairying; Europe; Eutrophication; New Zealand; Red Meat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077512075

In this center each Cu atom is coordinated by two imidazole rings of histidine side-chains, with the exception of one named CuIV. This enzyme has been isolated with CuZ in two forms CuZ(4Cu1S) and CuZ(4Cu2S), which differ in the CuI-CuIV bridging ligand, leading to considerable differences in their spectroscopic and catalytic properties. The Cu atoms in CuZ(4Cu1S) can be reduced to the [4Cu1+] oxidation state, and its catalytic properties are compatible with the nitrous oxide reduction rates of whole cells, while in CuZ(4Cu2S) they can only be reduced to the [1Cu2C-3Cu1C] oxidation state, which has a very low turnover number. The catalytic cycle of this enzyme has been explored and one of the intermediates, CuZ0, has recently been identified and shown to be in the [1Cu2+-3Cu1+] oxidation state. Contrary to CuZ(4Cu2S), CuZ0 is rapidly reduced intramolecularly by the electron transferring center of the enzyme, CuA, to [4Cu1+] by a physiologically relevant redox partner. The three-dimensional structure of nitrous oxide reductase with the CuZ center either as CuZ(4Cu1S) or as CuZ(4Cu2S) shows that it is a unique functional dimer, with the CuZ of one subunit receiving electrons from CuA of the other subunit. The complex nature of this center has posed some questions relative to its assembly, which are only partially answered, as well as to which is the active form of CuZ in vivo. The structural, spectroscopic, and catalytic features of the two forms of CuZ will be addressed here, as well as its assembly. The understanding of its catalytic features, activation, and assembly is essential to develop strategies to decrease the release of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere and to reduce its concentration in the stratosphere, as well as to serve as inspiration to synthetic inorganic chemists to develop new models of this peculiar and challenging copper sulfide center.",,"copper; nitrous oxide reductase; oxidoreductase; sulfide; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Copper; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Sulfides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089969250

This challenge exacts the necessity to explore alternative water sources for agricultural irrigation. The objective of this study was to implement the integrated geospatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate the potentiality of reclaimed water use for agricultural irrigation in California. Five evaluation criteria included in this study were agricultural land (crop type), climate conditions, water policies, irrigation status, and proximity to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) respectively. The suitability maps for reclaimed water use were generated for three cases in terms of accessibility to WWTPs, their discharge volume and appropriate treatment processes respectively. In addition, a composite suitability map was produced using the hybrid model considering all three cases together. Results from this study led to a better understanding of sustainable reclaimed water use for crop irrigation at a regional level. It provided supporting evidence of the applicability of the GIS-MCDA method integrated with AHP technique for a larger geographical scale with a diverse crop pattern. This study established the importance of using both knowledge-based and data-driven criteria and sub-criteria in the decision framework.

Thirty districts with 74 soil profiles from Madhya Pradesh state were considered for the study. However, we are presenting the average results over districts and soil profiles. A well-parameterised and validated APSIM model was used to simulate the effects of temperature and rainfall on maize grain and biomass yield. Increase in temperature having negative effects on both grain and biomass yield of maize. W hile increasing the temperature from base to 5°C, the grain and biomass yield of maize decreased by 40% and 28%, respectively. Further, increasing the temperature by 1°C could reduce the grain and biomass yield by 10% and 8 %, respectively. A small increase in maize yield was observed by 10% decrease of rainfall from the base. W hile rainfall increase by 10% or more and decrease by &gt;20% would results in lower maize yield and biomass. The decrease in maize yield due to increase in temperature could be attributed to decrease in duration of the crop. One-degree increase in temperature may decrease the duration of crop by 4.3 days. This study also revealed that agronomic management practices such as delaying of sowing dates could reduce the impact of climate change on crop yield to a considerable extent. By adopting the sowing date between 7th and 14th July, it may be possible to reduce the impact of temperature change on maize grain and biomass yield in central Indian condition. © 2020, Association of Agrometeorologists.

However, the health challenge of heat has been largely absent from Ireland's public health sector. This is epitomised by the lack of a comprehensive public health-focused heat-health action plan or country-specific codes of practice for heat-health when working outdoors. Our objective is to highlight the anticipated heat-health challenges in Ireland, and other temperate regions, through analysing vulnerable groups and systems, reinforcing the need to respond. Methods: A scoping literature review was conducted to determine how heat affects health of the vulnerable in temperate climatic regions, with a focus on Ireland. Additionally, national Google Trends data was coarsely analysed to determine whether heat is a growing societal concern. Results and discussion: The heat-vulnerable include: older people; chronically ill; infants, pregnant women, children; outdoor workers; socio-economically disadvantaged; urban dwellers; food systems and the health sector. Google Trends data suggest an increase in heat-related health searches over time, demonstrating rising levels of concern to temperature increases, reinforcing a gap in national policy associated with communication of, and response to, the heat-health challenge. Specific, actionable recommendations for adaptation and mitigation strategies are proposed. Conclusion: Heat poses a public and occupational health challenge, receiving limited attention in Ireland. Lack of a co-ordinated effort, places vulnerable populations at risk. Our recommendations, with reference to vulnerable groups and acknowledging the multi-sectoral nature of heat-health and climate change, advocate for the adoption of a ""health and climate change in all policies"" approach and the development of a public health-focused heat-health action plan. © 2020 The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Environmental health; Heat-health; Temperate climate; Vulnerable","action plan; climate change; health impact; public health; temperate environment; temperature effect; vulnerability; adoption; article; attention; child; chronic patient; climate change; controlled study; environmental health; female; heat shock response; human; infant; Ireland; occupational health; pregnant woman; public health; vulnerable population; worker; adult; adverse event; aged; chronic disease; climate change; geriatrics; heat; heat shock response; Ireland; male; newborn; physiology; pregnancy; procedures; very elderly; Ireland; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease; Climate Change; Female; Geriatrics; Heat-Shock Response; Hot Temperature; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Ireland; Male; Pregnancy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082732524

Plants have numerous benefits for indoor spaces, including bioremediation of air contaminants-which promotes the quality of indoor air, drops mechanical ventilation demand, and consequently reduces energy consumption. In this research, a Double Skin Facade (DSF) system is introduced, incorporating Azolla as a natural air purifier in order to absorb occupants’ bio-effluent and also contribute to providing fresh air for indoor spaces. Moreover, the CO2 reduction capacity of Azolla within the DSF as a natural air purifier and its subsequent effects on mechanical ventilation size and the heating/cooling loads is investigated. The challenge for developing the idea of simulating plants activities’ effect through a quantitative method is there are no software or calculating methods that recognize plants as indoor “air purifiers”, therefore, phytoremediation effects on HVAC operation and energy sector have been remained concealed so far. The novelty of this research is attributed to integrating Azolla fern-a hydroponic plant, into building's components for indoor air bioremediation and establishing a new assessment protocol for integrating greenery's effect on HVAC loop in which the performance of the DSF incorporating Azolla as a natural air purifier is evaluated through “Indoor Air Quality” and “Ventilation Rate” procedures, which are acknowledged as practical engineering methods for specifying air exchange demand through mechanical equipment. It is observed that within the VR procedure, DSF with Azolla aids in sequestering indoor CO2, while within the IAQ procedure it results in reducing the building's air exchange demand rate and consequentially, decrease the building's overall energy consumption. Furthermore, the cooling effect of employing Azolla as natural shading component within a DSF cavity is assessed through applying its latent heat capacity into façade thermal convection/conduction, versus aluminum blinds with the same size and spacings to computationally evaluate the thermal benefits of plants for mitigating cavity/interior spaces overheating.

In tropical region offces, an air conditioner is indispensable due to extreme high temperatures. However, the poor ventilation causes health issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to propose an improving IAQ method with low energy consumption. Temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 and CO concentration were monitored in a poorly ventilated offce for one year to observe seasonal variation. The results showed that the maximum CO2 concentration was above the recommended level for comfort. Simple ventilated practices and placing a number of Sansevieria trifasciata (S. trifasciata) plants were applied to improve the IAQ with the focus on decreasing CO2 concentration as well as achieving energy saving. Reductions of 19.9%, 22.5%, and 58.2% of the CO2 concentration were achieved by ventilation through the door during lunchtime, morning, and full working period, respectively. Placing S. trifasciata in the offce could reduce the CO2 concentration by 10.47%-19.29%. A computer simulation was created to observe the effciency of simple practices to find the optimum conditions.

With their ultrahigh photon-stability, hBN single-photon emitters are promising for new applications in quantum technologies and for 2D-material based optoelectronics. Here, we control the emission rate of hBN-defects by coupling to resonant plasmonic nanocavities. By deterministic control of the antenna, we acquire high-resolution emission maps of the single hBN-defects. Using time-gating, we can discriminate the hBN-defect emission from the antenna luminescence. We observe sharp dips (40 nm fwhm) in emission, together with a reduction in luminescence lifetime. Comparing with finite-difference time-domain simulations, we conclude that both radiative and nonradiative rates are enhanced, effectively reducing the quantum efficiency. Also, the large refractive index of hBN largely screens off the local antenna field enhancement. Finally, based on the insight gained we propose a close-contact design for an order of magnitude brighter hBN single-photon emission. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","hBN-defect-center; luminescence-lifetime; nanoantenna; scanning-probe; single-photon-source; super-resolution","Boron nitride; Defects; Finite difference time domain method; III-V semiconductors; Luminescence; Nanoantennas; Nitrides; Particulate emissions; Photons; Refractive index; Time domain analysis; Defect centers; Luminescence lifetime; nanoantenna; Scanning probes; Single-photon source; Super resolution; Particle beams; article; human; human experiment; luminescence; nanoimaging; photon; refraction index; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080858112

Thus, we conducted high-resolution organo-molecular studies on a marine Um-Sohryngkew River K/Pg boundary succession. The results were used as standard reference for comparison with biotic attributes of the brackish water (Jhilmili) to freshwater (Anjar) intertrappean sediments and bole beds of the Deccan Traps. Organo-molecular compounds of the former section show strong correlation with the global stratotype section and point. High amounts of short-chain n-fatty acids and n-alkanes derived from autochthonous marine algal remains were observed in this section. However, the dominance of mid- and long-chain n-alkanes over short-chain n-alkanes in the Jhilmili intertrappean and intravolcanic bole beds of the eastern Deccan volcanic province suggested a terrestrial origin from higher plants under semiarid climatic conditions. The prolific abundance of n-alkanes in the Um-Sohryngkew River succession implies a mixture of terrestrial input from emergent and submerged/floating aquatic macrophytes. Low-molecular-weight aromatic hydrocarbon markers peak in biozone CF2 of the Um-Sohryngkew River succession. Possibly, this corresponds to greenhouse effects linked to the second phase of Deccan volcanism in the latest Maastrichtian, chron 29r. Abundant n-fatty acids found in the eastern Deccan bole beds suggest an origin from bacteria developed in a terrestrial environment. Depleted δ13Cbulk values recorded from Jhilmili intertrappean and eastern Deccan bole beds are indicative of low primary productivity and burning of terrestrial biomass. Total organic carbon (TOC) maxima observed in the lowermost Danian P1a foraminiferal biozone of the Um-Sohryngkew River succession are also linked to late Deccan phase-two eruptions. The presence of three low-molecular-weight aromatic hydrocarbon markers in the eastern Deccan bole bed implies incomplete combustion of organic compounds in a terrestrial environment. Moreover, the dominance of high-molecular-weight aromatic hydrocarbon markers in biozone CF3 of the Um-Sohryngkew River succession is akin to that reported from other well-established K/Pg boundary successions, suggestive of their possible derivation from regional fire induced by the heat supplied by Deccan volcanism, which has been linked to the K/Pg boundary transition. Thus, regional wildfire played a significant role and affected the ecosystem, which perhaps accounts for the mass extinction. © 2019 The Geological Society of America.

The problem statement takes into account the energy dissipation in the material of the plate and fluid on the basis of the Kelvin-Voigt hysteresis model. The refinement of the fluid behavior is based on the assumption that the pressure increment is proportional not only to volumetric strain, but also to the rate of its volumetric strain. This assumption allows us to obtain the generalized Helmholtz wave equation by introducing Skudrzyk's complex sound velocity into consideration to take account of the energy dissipation. The motion equations of the plate are based on the classical Kirchhoff-Love model and are obtained in two versions. In the first version unsimplified three-dimensional wave equations are used to determine the aerohydrodynamic load acting on a plate. The second version is based on simplifying the equations of fluid motion by the introduction of the well-known hypothesis of plane reflection and emission of sound waves. On the basis of the derived equations, exact analytical solutions of two types of problems are obtained. The first type is related to the problem of free vibrations of a rectangular plate hinged around the contour when complex eigenfrequencies were defined. The second type is related to the problem of forced vibrations of the plate under the action of a flat mono-harmonic incident sound wave when sound transmission loss, the stress-strain state parameters of the plate as well as the laws of change in sound pressure in a fluid were determined. It is shown that correct and more meaningful solutions of acoustoelasticity problems of the considered class are possible only in case of describing the behavior of a fluid with unsimplified three-dimensional wave equations with consideration of the energy dissipation. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This weed causes significant yield reduction in many crops and has developed herbicide resistance. The aim of this study was to develop a cohort-based stochastic population dynamics model that integrates both emergence (thermal time) and dynamic population models as a tool to simulate the population dynamics of susceptible and resistant populations of L. multiflorum under the effects of climate change. The current climate scenario and the increase in the average air temperature by 2.5◦C were considered. Chemical and cultural management strategies commonly used in the South Region of Brazil during the winter and summer seasons were incorporated into the model. In the absence of control and under the current climate conditions, the seed bank population grew until reaching an equilibrium density of 19,121 ± 371 seeds m−2 for the susceptible and 20463 ± 363 seeds m−2 for the resistant populations. Considering the second climate scenario, the seed bank reaches an equilibrium density of 24,182 ± 253 seeds m−2 (+26% in relation to the current scenario) for the susceptible population and 24,299 ± 254 seeds m−2 (+18% in relation to the current scenario) for the resistant one. The results showed that the effect of the rise in temperature implies an increase in population in all the management strategies in relation to the current climate scenario. In both climate scenarios, the strategies based on herbicides application controlling cohorts 1 and 2 were the most efficient, and cropping systems including winter oat-soybeans rotation had a smaller impact on the L. multiflorum seed bank than crop rotations including winter wheat or summer corn. Crop rotations including wheat and corn for L. multiflorum management as an adaptive strategy under the future climate change are suggested. © 2020 by the authors.

Particles are deposited physically on leaves and thus the process depends on leaf area and surface properties, which change throughout the year. Current state-of-the-art modeling accounts for these changes only by altering leaf longevity, which may be selected by vegetation type and geographic location. Particle removal also depends on weather conditions, which determine deposition and resuspension but generally do not consider properties that are specific to species or plant type. In this study, we modeled &lt;2.5 μm-diameter particulate-matter (PM2.5) deposition, resuspension, and removal from urban trees along a latitudinal gradient (Berlin, Munich, Rome) while comparing coniferous with broadleaf (deciduous and evergreen) tree types. Accordingly, we re-implemented the removal functionality from the i-Tree Eco model, investigated the uncertainty connected with parameterizations, and evaluated the efficiency of pollution mitigation depending on city conditions. We found that distinguishing deposition velocities between conifers and broadleaves is important for model results, i.e., because the removal efficiency of conifers is larger. Because of the higher wind speed, modeled PM2.5 deposition from conifers is especially large in Berlin compared to Munich and Rome. Extended periods without significant precipitation decrease the amount of PM2.5 removal because particles that are not occasionally washed from the leaves or needles are increasingly resuspended into the air. The model predicted this effect particularly during the long summer periods in Rome with only very little precipitation and may be responsible for less-efficient net removal from urban trees under climate change. Our analysis shows that the range of uncertainty in particle removal is large and that parameters have to be adjusted at least for major tree types if not only the species level. Furthermore, evergreen trees (broadleaved as well as coniferous) are predicted to be more effective at particle removal in northern regions than in Mediterranean cities, which is unexpected given the higher number of evergreens in southern cities. We discuss to what degree the effect of current PM2.5 abundance can be mitigated by species selection and which model improvements are needed. © Copyright © 2020 Pace and Grote.","air quality; deposition velocities; metropolitan areas; model evaluation; resuspension; urban trees",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086130542

Propionate conversion was assessed in slurries containing sediment from three different biogeochemical zones of Aarhus Bay, Denmark. Sediment slurries were amended with 0, 3, or 20 mM sulfate and incubated at 25 °C and 10 °C for 514–571 days. Methanogenesis in the sulfate zone and sulfate reduction in the methane zone slurries was observed. Both processes occurred simultaneously in enrichments originating from samples along the whole sediment. Bacterial community analysis revealed the dominance of Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae members in sulfate-amended slurries incubated at 25°C and 10°C. Cryptanaerobacter belonging to the Peptococcaceae family dominated sulfate-free methanogenic slurries at 25°C, whereas bacteria related to Desulfobacteraceae were dominant at 10°C. Archaeal community analysis revealed the prevalence of different genera belonging to Methanomicrobiales in slurries incubated at different temperatures and amended with different sulfate concentrations. Methanosarcinaceae were only detected in the absence of sulfate. In summary, Aarhus Bay sediment zones contain sulfate reducers, syntrophs, and methanogens interacting with each other in the conversion of propionate.

Global warming affects the ocean surface temperature, in turn leading to a change in the oxygen production of phytoplankton. In this work, the fractional oxygen-phytoplankton-zooplankton mathematical model is considered by the Caputo fractional operator. The production rate of photosynthesis is determined by a temperature function. The model is, therefore, based on the idea that the rate of photosynthesis changes due to the impact of global warming, while phytoplankton oxygen production increases and decreases. We analyze the model with the Caputo fractional derivative differently from the classical case of the model and we compare the results with the integer order derivative when α tends to 1. Existence and uniqueness properties of the oxygen-plankton model have been proved by means of a local Lipschitz condition. It was shown that the species are more sustainable than its corresponding classical case in the Caputo model. Our results show that the effect of global warming on the oxygen production rate has been observed to be quite severe, resulting in oxygen depletion and plankton extinction. © 2020 Author(s).",,"animal; biological model; climate change; growth, development and aging; oxygen consumption; phytoplankton; zooplankton; Animals; Climate Change; Models, Biological; Oxygen Consumption; Phytoplankton; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082313070

It has been considered as an important mitigation strategy by China with strong incentive policies in the past few years. However, with the phasing out of financial subsidy, government and companies should come up with effective solutions to maintain the growing trend of China’s EV market. In this study, the main factors that influence consumers’ EV purchase in China’s overall market and license plate-controlled (LPC) cities are analyzed using logistic regression. T tests are then used to assess consumers’ preferences and differences between LPC cities and cities with no license plate control (NLPC). The results suggest that the license plate control policy is more influential than purchasing subsidy to Chinese consumers, and the negative impact of subsidy phasing out can be alleviated by other policy instruments. To cope with future challenges, the government and automobile companies should pay more attention to the differences between LPC and NLPC cities regarding customers’ EV preferences and influencing factors, and customize policy design towards NLPC cities. More public promotion of EVs are also required to eliminate potential consumers’ misperceptions and increase social acceptance of EVs. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Electric vehicle; Group difference; License plate control; Logistic regression; Purchase influencing factor","architectural design; consumption behavior; design; electric vehicle; fuel consumption; governance approach; greenhouse gas; incentive; mitigation; regression analysis; strategic approach; subsidy system; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076624488

Recent studies have demonstrated that a better understanding of carbon dynamics can be achieved by considering different carbon pools. Here we used a simple method of physical SOC fractionation to assess the impact of market gardening practices on the evolution of total SOC and its stable and labile sub-fractions over a period of several decades. The study was conducted at the Kuinima market gardening zone in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). Composite soil samples (0–15 cm depth) were collected from a chronosequence of 69 fields including control plots and plots farmed for more than 50 years. Samples were wet sieved at 20 µm after agitation or sonication to assess carbon content in the fine (i.e. stable) and coarse fractions. Our results show an asymptotic increase in total carbon content, from 9 g C kg−1 for uncultivated control plots to 28 g C kg−1 for plots cultivated for more than 50 years. This increase tends to stabilize after 30 years. A similar trend is observed for C content in the coarse fraction &gt; 20 µm. In contrast, carbon content in the fraction &lt; 20 µm increased linearly over time, and this increase was greater in sonicated than in agitated samples. Based on the comparison of the two fractionation methods, a strong contribution of micro-aggregation to the physical stabilization of SOC was hypothesized. This stabilization appears favored by short-range-order (SRO) iron and aluminum oxides and/or metal-humus complexes, as suggested by the strong correlation between stable C content and oxalate-extractable Fe and Al. Large and repeated additions of organic amendments in market gardening thus appear to lead to increased SOC content and promote SOC storage in the stable fraction, thereby contributing to soil quality improvement and the mitigation of climate change. © 2019","Carbon fractionation; Market gardening; Soil organic carbon; West Africa","Aluminum oxide; Climate change; Commerce; Iron oxides; Soils; Stabilization; Fractionation methods; Metal humus complexes; Organic amendments; Short-range order; Soil organic carbon; Strong correlation; Sub-saharan africa; West Africa; Organic carbon; chronosequence; depth determination; fractionation; greenspace; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; soil quality; soil stabilization; urban area; Bobo Dioulasso; Burkina Faso; Joturus pichardi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076784802

Open Urban Design (OUD) approach is increasingly used in the design of recent residential neighborhoods, complete and continuous joint ownership is rejected to create spaces with optimal solar and light exposures and create through views. However, the suitability of this configuration shall be tested for different climate conditions. This paper focuses on the assessment of the OUD approach at four climate regions of Morocco in winter and summer. The case study is a recent residential district (54 ha). Two scenarios of building sets were simulated for 12 h in Rabat, Errachidia, Tiflet, and Marrakech. At first, an experimental validation of the 3D microclimate model ENVI-met 4.3.1 is performed. Six morphological indicators are then calculated and cross-correlated to numerical simulation results. The impact of urban parameters on the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) has been investigated; the evolution and the spatial distribution of the average predicted mean vote (PMV) have been presented. It follows that cloudiness, latitude, shading, vegetation, and compactness have a significant effect on Tmrt, and this effect differs from summer to winter. OUD isn't appropriate for the extreme climate conditions whereas, this urban design choice can significantly improve the outdoor thermal comfort in moderate climate conditions depending on morphological parameters and vegetal density. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate zone; Envi-met; Mean radiant temperature; Morocco; Thermal comfort; Urban design","3D modeling; Decision making; Housing; Thermal comfort; Urban planning; ENVI-met; Experimental validations; Mean radiant temperature; Morocco; Morphological indicator; Morphological parameters; Residential neighborhoods; Urban design; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074685344

For this purpose, we used the microscale urban climate model (MUKLIMO_3), in conjunction with the cuboid method, to calculate climate indices such as the average number of summer and hot days per year. For the baseline simulation, we used meteorological measurements from 1981 to 2010 from the weather station located at Klagenfurt Airport. Individual building structures and canopy cover from several land monitoring services were used to derive accurate properties for land use classes in the study domain. To characterize the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies, we compared changes in the climate indices for several (future) climate adaptation scenarios to the reference simulation. Specifically, we considered two major adaptation pathways: (i) an increase in the albedo values of sealed areas (i.e., roofs, walls and streets) and (ii) an increase in green surfaces (i.e., lawns on streets and at roof level) and high vegetated areas (i.e., trees). The results indicate that some climate adaptation measures show higher potential in mitigating hot days than others, varying between reductions of 2.3 to 11.0%. An overall combination of adaptation measures leads to a maximum reduction of up to 44.0%, indicating a clear potential for reduction/mitigation of urban heat loads. Furthermore, the results for the future scenarios reveal the possibility to remain at the current level of urban heat load during the daytime over the next three decades for the overall combination of measures. © 2020 The Authors","Climate adaptation measures; Green roofs; MUKLIMO_3; Urban Heat Island",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078228262

However, whether the same applies in tropical human-dominated landscapes (HDLs) is unclear. In India's Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot, we found that while HDL forests harbor lower tree diversity and aboveground carbon stocks than relatively intact forests, positive diversity–carbon correlations are more prevalent in HDLs. This is because anthropogenic drivers of species loss in HDLs consistently reduce carbon storing biomass volume (lower basal area), and biomass per unit volume (fewer hardwood trees). We further show, using a meta-analysis spanning multiple regions, that these patterns apply to tropical HDLs more generally. Thus, while complementary strategies are needed for securing the irreplaceable biodiversity and carbon values of intact forests, ubiquitous tropical HDLs might hold greater potential for synergizing biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. © 2019 The Authors.

Using a mix of social (interactions between stakeholders, knowledge changes, adoption of practices) and technical indicators (income, fulfillment of caloric requirements of the household, farm resource use, planned biodiversity or greenhouse gas emission changes), we monitored the collaboration between an NGO, local civil authorities, associations, and farmers that aimed to achieve a common goal linked to the participatory and contextualized development of CSA in Colombia. We found that multiple stakeholder engagements led to improved interactions between members of the platform and their local environment, a proactive participation in the platform meetings and a significant increase in farmer knowledge levels on the challenges posed by climate change and the resultant extreme events. The platform also facilitated the adoption of best-bet practices that contribute towards CSA when farmers both diversify their production and decrease the use of mineral fertilizers. Our findings suggest that innovation platforms can facilitate the collective understanding and use of CSA options corresponding to local conditions and priorities. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","Adoption; climate change; climate-smart practices; Latin America; participatory process",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067656396

In coastal wetlands of eastern and central North America, freeze-sensitive woody plants (mangroves) are expected to expand northward into regions currently dominated by freeze-tolerant herbaceous salt marsh plants. To advance understanding of mangrove range expansion, there is a need to refine temperature thresholds for mangrove freeze damage, mortality and recovery. We integrated data from 38 sites spread across the mangrove range edge in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of North America, including data from a regional collaborative network – the Mangrove Migration Network. In 2018, an extreme freeze event affected 60% of these sites, with minimum temperatures ranging from 0 to −7°C. We used temperature and vegetation data from before and after the freeze to quantify temperature thresholds for leaf damage, mortality and biomass recovery of the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) – the most freeze-tolerant mangrove species in North America. For A. germinans individuals near their northern range limit, our results indicate that temperature thresholds for leaf damage are close to −4°C, but temperature thresholds for mortality are closer to −7°C. Thresholds are expected to be warmer for more southern A. germinans individuals and for the other two common mangrove species in the region (Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle). Regenerative buds allowed A. germinans to resprout and recover quickly from above-ground freeze damage. Hence, biomass recovery levels during the first post-freeze growing season were 90%, 78%, 62% and 45% for temperatures of −4, −5, −6 and −7°C, respectively. Due to a combination of vigorous resprouting and new recruitment from propagules, we expect full recovery at most sites within 1–3 years, assuming no further freeze events. Synthesis. To improve predictions of tropical range expansion in response to climate change, there is a need to better understand tropical species’ responses to winter temperature extremes. Collectively, our results refine temperature thresholds for A. germinans freeze damage, mortality and recovery, which can improve predictions of mangrove range expansion and coastal wetland ecological transformations in a warming climate. © 2019 The Authors.

The primary anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are coal dioxide, CO2, which is produced by natural operations such as cement manufacturing, deforestation and combustion of fossil fuels. This could have a major, damaging impact on human well-being. Energy requirements are anticipated to raise by a ratio of 1.5 to 3.0 by 2050, leading to an ever-increasing rise in carbon dioxide emissions. As rising carbon emissions have become a growing issue, there is a need to reduce carbon emissions. Many countries in the world are aiming at increasing the use of renewable energies and improving energy efficiency in urban and rural areas while utilizing the economic growth potential of the low-carbon sector. Among renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy, solar energy is one of the oldest, cleanest, and most reliable renewable energy sources. Over the years, numerous methods for estimating solar radiation on a horizontal plane have been developed.

While there are numerous system designs and model formulations for minimizing electric bills under dynamic prices the use of these systems has the potential to cause an increase in emissions from electricity generation. The increase in emissions is linked to the difference in fuel mix of marginal generators throughout the day as well as inefficiencies associated with energy storage. In this work a multi-objective optimization model is designed to balance the competing goals of minimizing electricity costs for the home owner as well as minimizing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the operation of a BESS under dynamic prices. A total of 22 different regions in the US are analyzed. Optimizing only for energy cost resulted in an annual increase of CO2 emissions in all but two regions ranging from 70 to 2200 kg per household. The multi-objective model when using a social cost of carbon of 42 $/ton can be used to economically reduce these additional emissions in most regions by anywhere from 49 to 1450 kg of CO2 per year. © 2020","Battery energy storage system; BESS; Demand –side management; Emissions; Optimal scheduling; Smart homes","Automation; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Electric batteries; Fuel storage; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Multiobjective optimization; Particulate emissions; Scheduling; Battery energy storage systems; BESS; Carbon dioxide emissions; Multi-objective modeling; Multi-objective optimization models; Optimal scheduling; Residential electricity; Smart homes; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078097661

The competitiveness of these regions could result from their ability to produce high value-added chemicals at the lowest cost. The biomass embodied in a chemical product could reduce carbon emissions, leading to net CO2 removal. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that bio-ethylene could make the Brazilian chemical industry more competitive. This would be achieved by applying the revenues from carbon credits associated with using ethanol and sugarcane bagasse as feedstocks for bio-ethylene production. Three production routes were compared according to their estimated cost of production in Brazil under a simplified life-cycle analysis: sugar-cane-derived ethanol to ethylene (with and without CO2 capture and storage – BECCS); bio-methanol to olefin; and conventional steam cracking of naphtha. When associated with the production of long-lasting materials, the ethanol-to-ethylene with BECCS route achieved the lower CO2 break-even price (US$75/t CO2), followed by ethanol to ethylene without BECCS (US$82/t CO2) and bio-methanol to ethylene (US$106/t CO2).

In this study, a cradle to grave attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to produce drop-in renewable diesel from biogas (via solid-state anaerobic digestion) derived from energy crop, i.e. miscanthus cultivated in strip-mined lands. The analysis included miscanthus cultivation, harvesting, and transportation to the biorefinery, conversion of the biomass to Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and combustion of the drop-in renewable diesel for a passenger vehicle. Results showed that the miscanthus derived drop-in renewable diesel could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 73% when compared with that of the conventional fossil-derived diesel. Similarly, the proposed design consumes 4.91 MJ/GGE of fossil fuel compared to the conventional diesel with fossil fuel depletion of 18.98 MJ/GGE. Although the respiratory effects, smog formation, acidification, and eutrophication potentials of the miscanthus to drop-in renewable diesel process are relatively higher than the conventional process, the proposed technology still represents a sustainable liquid fuels pathway that is less dependent on fossil fuel, can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help attain the renewable transportation fuels standard. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; F-T synthesis; Fossil fuel depletion; GHG emissions; Miscanthus","Anaerobic digestion; Biodiesel; Climate change; Crops; Diesel engines; Drops; Eutrophication; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Organic carbon; Eutrophication potentials; F-T synthesis; Fischer-Tropsch diesel; Fossil-fuel depletions; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Miscanthus; Solid-state anaerobic digestions; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076234575

The Lake is important for fishing in the region. The importance of research is to understand the mobility and bioavailability of each studied metal. The study was carried out on 10 sampling sites during 2017. The sediments were subjected to the technique of sequential extraction to examine the chemical forms of some trace metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb and Ni). Five stage extractions were done as the following order: soluble and exchangeable, carbonate, iron and manganese oxides, organic matter fraction and residual fraction. Attained results from the five fractions showed variations in the concentrations of metal contents of different sites under study. The overall metal concentrations (%) in the initial four extractable fractions (exchangeable, carbonate, oxides and organic matter fractions) were assessed to configure the mobility of each studied metal. The risk assessment code (RAC) represents the summation of exchangeable and carbonate fractions, it was between low and medium risk for aquatic environment. The range percentage of RAC for the metals was in the following order: 1.8–13, 4–23.5, 15–26, 5.7–19.5, 9–25 and 4.8–18.2 for Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb and Ni, respectively. Approximately 30% of the total copper was associated to the organic fraction, which may represent a high mobility of copper in these sediments. The highest mobility of metals in the sediments could be confirmed by its bioavailability factor (BF), which was within the ranges of 0.32–0.61, 0.36–0.59, 0.64–0.83, 0.36–0.72, 0.37–0.62 and 0.52–0.78 for Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb and Ni, respectively. The BF exhibited the following order: Zn > Ni > Cu > Pb ≈ Mn > Fe. The high levels of BF for the studied metals may represent the potentiality for toxic metals to be easily released into the aquatic environment. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","heavy metals; Lagoons; Nile Delta; risk assessment; sediment","heavy metal; lagoon; risk assessment; sediment chemistry; sequential extraction; speciation (chemistry); surficial sediment; trace metal; Beheira; Egypt; Lake Edku; Nile Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079405066

Previous studies have focused on the impact of aggregating climate data used to compute crop yields. However, little is known about the combined data aggregation effect of climate (DAEc) and soil (DAEs) on irrigation water requirement (IWR) in cool-temperate and spatially heterogeneous environments. The aims of this study were to quantify DAEc and DAEs of model input data and their combined impacts for simulated irrigated and rainfed yield and IWR. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator Next Generation model was applied for the period 1998–2017 across areas suitable for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) in Tasmania, Australia, using data at 5, 15, 25 and 40 km resolution. Spatial variances of inputs and outputs were evaluated by the relative absolute difference (rAD¯) between the aggregated grids and the 5 km grids. Climate data aggregation resulted in a rAD¯ of 0.7–12.1%, with high values especially for areas with pronounced differences in elevation. The rAD¯ of soil data was higher (5.6–26.3%) than rAD¯ of climate data and was mainly affected by aggregation of organic carbon and maximum plant available water capacity (i.e. the difference between field capacity and wilting point in the effective root zone). For yield estimates, the difference among resolutions (5 km vs. 40 km) was more pronounced for rainfed (rAD¯ = 14.5%) than irrigated conditions (rAD¯ = 3.0%). The rAD¯ of IWR was 15.7% when using input data at 40 km resolution. Therefore, reliable simulations of rainfed yield require a higher spatial resolution than simulation of irrigated yields. This needs to be considered when conducting regional modelling studies across Tasmania. This study also highlights the need to separately quantify the impact of input data aggregation on model outputs to inform about data aggregation errors and identify those variables that explain these errors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Data aggregation; Data resolution; Model uncertainty; Regional modelling; Scale; Spatial heterogeneity","Crops; Differential equations; Input output programs; Irrigation; Organic carbon; Soils; Water; Water resources; Data aggregation; Data resolutions; Model uncertainties; Regional modelling; Scale; Spatial heterogeneity; Uncertainty analysis; organic carbon; water; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; heterogeneity; irrigation; potato; resolution; soil; water supply; Article; Australia; climate; controlled study; crop management; environmental factor; irrigation (agriculture); plant water content; plant yield; potato; priority journal; simulation; soil; soil analysis; Tasmania; climate change; irrigation (agriculture); Australia; Tasmania; Solanum tuberosum; Agricultural Irrigation; Australia; Climate Change; Data Aggregation; Soil; Solanum tuberosum; Tasmania; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076058639

The proposed system comprises Photovoltaic arrays, wind turbine (WT) and Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES). The study was focused on satisfying energy demand of a typical coastline community, Patani (Lat. 5.23° N and Long. 6.17° E) – a Local Government Area (LGA). Genetic algorithm was adopted to optimise the PHES of the proposed hybrid plant to minimise the difference between energy demand and energy generated. Economic models were developed to ascertain the economic feasibility of the hybrid plant. High fidelity software (HOMER®, MATLAB® and MS Excel® spreadsheet) were utilised for the analysis and optimisation. The peak rated power of PV and WT required to satisfy the energy demand of the LGA are 217 kWp and 226050 kW, respectively. The minimum storage capacity of the PHES was estimated at about 3,930,615 kWh, with the upper reservoir volume of 43170.06 m3. The value of 0.27 $/kWh was obtained for the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE); while the loss of load probability of the proposed energy system was estimated at 0.1086.

This paper explores the impacts of this phenomenon on farmer innovations under recurrent environmental changes. Using a case study of zaï, an indigenous innovative farming practice, the paper makes two interrelated arguments. Firstly, it shows that the pervasive enclosures coerced by the Ghanaian state undermine how indigenous knowledge could be proactively deployed for climate risk management. Secondly, LSLAs produce a social barrier to climate change adaptation, as they lead to heightened uncertainty and apprehension among farmers, which affects decisions on climate risk management. More specifically, land expropriation is an example of how adaptation could be hindered by governance, institutions, and policy at the extra-local scale, including not only existing land use laws, but also the constitutional guarantee of private property. The evidence supporting these arguments come from survey data on 619 plots, 70 in-depth interviews, village-level transect walks, and participant observations. Overall, the paper contributes to emerging debates at the interface of land use policy, climate justice, and sustainable adaptation. Theoretically, it also contributes to understanding State-society relations, as well as the political economy of eminent domain, often justified through discourses of “public benefits.” © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Eminent domain; Farmer innovations; Ghana; Land tenure; Large-scale land acquisitions; Social barriers to adaptation; Zaï","adaptive management; agroecology; climate change; farming system; innovation; land tenure; land use planning; smallholder; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077921611

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value-added chemicals and fuels has been proposed as a method for reusing these excess anthropogenic emissions. While state-of-the-art CO2RR systems exhibit high current densities and faradaic efficiencies, research on long-term electrode durability, necessary for this technology to be implemented commercially, is lacking. Previous reviews have focused mainly on the CO2 electrolyzer performance without considering durability. In this Review, the need for research into high-performing and durable CO2RR systems is stressed by summarizing the state-of-the-art with respect to durability.

This study aims to measure tobacco farmers perspective towards increasing climate riskin Indonesia. Tobacco plantationarea in Temanggung District is selected as a case study since it is well known for its tobacco production, particularly for cigarette.Focus Group Discussion (FGD) towards local tobacco farmers has been conducted to identify how the weather and climate affect the farmer activity, as well as the climate risk due to increasing unpredictability of weather and climate. The result shows that in farmers perspective, it becomes more difficult to manage the farmlands. For the case of tobacco, excessive rainfalls orinsufficient rainfall could cause crop failure. As a result, the tobacco productivity is not as large compared to the past. The farmers also have lower income compared to the past5 years due to lower tobacco quality and quantity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Environmental management; Tobacco; Agricultural sector; Agriculture sectors; Changing climate; Climate change risks; Climate variability and change; Group discussions; Intergovernmental panel; Tobacco production; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083032966

However, knowledge and quantification of the contribution of sustainable vineyard management on climate change impact are needed. Although it is widely assessed by several authors that the agricultural stage has a great impact in the wine chain, very few studies have evaluated the greenhouse gas emission in this phase including the ability of soil to sequester carbon (C) or the off-farm C loss by erosion. This work aimed to provide a vineyard carbon budget (vCB) tool to quantify the impact of grape production on GHG emission including the effects of environmental characteristics and agricultural practices. The vCB was estimated considering four different soil management scenarios: conventional tillage (CT), temporary cover crop with a leguminous species in alternate inter-rows (ACC), temporary cover crop with a leguminous species (CC), permanent cover crop (PCC). The estimation of vCB was applied at territory level in a viticulture area in Sicily (2468 ha of vineyard) using empirical data. Results of the present study showed that the environmental characteristics strongly affect the sustainability of vineyard management; the highest contribution to total CO2 emission is, in fact, given by the C losses by erosion in sloping vineyards. Soils of studied vineyards are a source of CO2 due to the low C inputs and high mineralization rate, except for soil managed by CC which can sequester soil C, contributing positively to vCB. The highest total CO2 emission was estimated in vineyards under CT management (2.31 t ha−1y−1), followed by CC (1.27 t ha−1y−1), ACC (0.69 t ha−1y−1) and PCC (0.64 t ha−1y−1). Findings of vCB applied at territory level highlighted the key role of the evaluation of carbon budget (CB) on a larger scale to identify the CO2 emission in relation to climatic and environmental factors. The present study could contribute to provide suggestions to policymakers and farmers for reducing GHG emissions and promote more sustainable grape production practices. © 2020 by the authors.

Social assistance refers to transfers to poor, vulnerable andmarginalized groups to reduce their vulnerability and livelihood risks, and to enhance their rights and status. Substantial public funds support social assistance programmes globally. Collectively, lower- and middle-income countries spend approximately 1.5% of their GDP on social assistance annually. We focus on the potential of paid employment schemes to promote effective ecosystem stewardship. Available evidence suggests such programmes can offer multiple benefits in terms of improvements in local ecosystems and natural capital, carbon sequestration and local biodiversity conservation. We review evidence from three key case studies: In India (the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme), Ethiopia (the Productive Safety Nets Programme) and Mexico (the Temporary Employment Programme). We conclude that, to realize the potential of employment-based social assistance for ecosystem benefits it will be necessary to address two challenges: First, the weak design and maintenance of local public works outputs in many schemes, and second, the concern that social protection schemes may become less effective if they are overburdened with additional objectives. Overcoming these challenges requires an evolution of institutional systems for delivering social assistance to enable a more effective combination of social and environmental objectives. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Climate change; Ecosystem stewardship; Social protection","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental planning; Gross Domestic Product; livelihood; social policy; state role; vulnerability; Ethiopia; India; Mexico; biodiversity; climate change; employment; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; prevention and control; procedures; public policy; workplace; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Employment; Global Warming; Public Policy; Workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078348147

The HA adsorption presented the highest value (22.57 mg/g) at pH 3, while the equilibrium state was reached after 30 min. By increasing the adsorbent's dosage (0.4–0.5 g/L), the removal efficiency was also improved from 90.3 to 97.6%. The kinetics of adsorption were fitted to the pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.9991). The Langmuir isotherm model was well fitted to the equilibrium data revealing monolayer adsorption model of HA onto the MVAC/CNTs with the maximum capacity of 73.29 mg/g (R2 = 0.9967).

Network visualization and statistical measures of network structure are combined with qualitative case study data to provide a comparative analysis of energy transition networks in Birmingham, Budapest and Frankfurt. Data reveal that existing networks differ in extent, integration and distribution of authority. Contextual characteristics help explain these differences, highlighting the importance of path dependencies and disjunctions in each city. These findings represent important considerations for the Transition Management model which aims specifically at governing sustainability transitions via network governance. Responding to a gap in the literature we demonstrate that Transition Management must be considered as an intervention into locationally specific settings and existing networks. The design of network structures and processes, as well as role of any ‘transition manager’, must reflect contextual factors and existing network considerations. Failure to account for contextual differences limits the model's capacity to contribute to sustainable energy transitions in different cities. © 2020","Energy transitions; Network governance; Transition management; Urban governance","Carbon; Energy transitions; Network governances; Network visualization; Qualitative case studies; Statistical measures; Sustainability transition; Transition management; Urban governance; Data visualization; alternative energy; carbon emission; comparative study; energy policy; energy use; governance approach; urban area; Alabama; Birmingham [Alabama]; Budapest; Frankfurt am Main; Germany; Hesse; Hungary; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078495773

However, such a practice is not widely conducted in Hokkaido, a northern region in Japan, to prevent a possible reduction in rice grain yield caused by cold weather. Therefore, the effects of intermittent drainage on CH4 emission and rice grain yield have not been investigated comprehensively in Hokkaido. In this study, we conducted a three-year field experiment in Hokkaido and measured CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and rice grain yield to elucidate whether the reduction in CH4 emission can be achieved in Hokkaido as well as other regions in Japan. Four experimental treatments, namely, two soil types [soils of light clay (LiC) and heavy clay (HC) textures] and two water management [continuous flood irrigation (CF), and intermittent drainage (ID)], were used, and CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured throughout the rice cultivation periods from 2016 to 2018. Cumulative CH4 emissions in 2016 were markedly low, suggesting an initially low population of methanogens in the soils presumably due to no soil submergence or crop cultivation in the preceding years, which indicates a possible reduction in CH4 emission by introducing paddy-upland crop rotation. Cumulative CH4 emissions in the ID-LiC and ID-HC plots were 21–91% lower than those in the CF-LiC and CF-HC plots, respectively, whereas the cumulative N2O emissions did not significantly differ between the different water managements. The amount of CH4 emission reduction by the intermittent drainage was largest in 2018, with a comparatively long period of the first drainage for 12 days in summer. Rice grain yields did not significantly differ between the different water managements for the entire 3 years, although the percentage of well-formed rice grains was reduced by the intermittent drainage in 2018. These results suggest that CH4 emission from paddy fields can be reduced with no decrease in rice grain yield by the intermittent drainage in Hokkaido. In particular, the first drainage for a long period in summer is expected to reduce CH4 emission markedly. © 2019, © 2019 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","CH4; Hokkaido; intermittent drainage; N2O; paddy soil",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078626612

Integrated 24 h PM2:5 samples were collected on quartz-fiber filters using a 30 L min1 air sampler at an urban site in Ulaanbaatar. The aerosol samples were analyzed for organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), anhydrosugars (levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan), and water-soluble ions. OC was found to be the predominant species, contributing 64% and 56% to the quantified aerosol components in PM2:5 in winter and spring, respectively. BB was identified as a major source of PM2:5, followed by dust and secondary aerosols. Levoglucosan = mannosan and levoglucosan =KC ratios indicate that BB in Ulaanbaatar mainly originated from the burning of softwood. Because of the large uncertainty associated with the quantitative estimation of OC emitted from BB (OCBB), a novel approach was developed to optimize the OC/ levoglucosan ratio for estimating OCBB. The optimum OC/ levoglucosan ratio in Ulaanbaatar was obtained by regression analysis between OCnon-BB (OCtotal- OCBB) and levoglucosan concentrations that gives the lowest coefficient of determination (R2) and slope. The optimum OC/ levoglucosan ratio was found to be 27.6 and 18.0 for winter and spring, respectively, and these values were applied in quantifying OCBB. It was found that 68% and 63% of the OC were emitted from BB during winter and spring, respectively. This novel approach can also be applied by other researchers to quantify OCBB using their own chemical measurements. In addition to OCBB, sources of OCnon-BB were also investigated through multivariate correlation analysis. It was found that OCnon-BB originated mainly from coal burning, vehicles, and vegetative emissions. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; biomass burning; carbon emission; optimization; organic carbon; particulate matter; tracer; urban area; Central Province [Mongolia]; Mongolia; Ulaanbaatar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082435036

In India, most vehicles run on conventional fuels producing harmful gases and particulate matter, causing an adverse effect on the human health &amp; environment. Most urban cities in India are witnessing a rapid increase in the level of urban air pollution, which can be largely attributed to the continuous surge in the number of on-road vehicles. According to a KPMG report, it is estimated that by 2030 there will be a 100% incremental adoption of electric vehicles which will lead to the minimization of the pollution level generated from the conventional cars. However, in India, 57.3% of electricity is produced through coal thermal power plant. It cannot be denied that coal leaves behind harmful by-products upon combustion. The emissions from the coal power plants in India increased from 901.7 g CO2/kWh in 2005 to 926 g CO2/kWh in 2012. This is much higher than global averages in the same period, which were 542 g and 533 g CO2/kWh, respectively. The increase in the number of electric vehicles is likely to increase the demand for electricity, which may result in a rise in emissions from thermal power plants, thus offsetting the reductions in tailpipe emissions. This study deals with assessing the impact of shifting the fleet from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to electric vehicles (EV) on power generation sources, i.e., coal power plants, and its impact on the environment in India. The implication viability of electric vehicle over internal combustion engine vehicle has been assessed with exergy analysis, taking into account the total emissions involved from well to wheel. In the current power generation scenario of India, a comparative analysis of direct and indirect emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles (powered with coal power generation) shows that electric vehicles emit less CO2 and CO, whereas SO2 and Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emisions (indirectly from the thermal power plant), are higher. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Emissions; Exergy; Thermal power plants; Urbanization; Viability","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal industry; Combustion equipment; Electric vehicles; Exergy; Fleet operations; Fossil fuel power plants; Internal combustion engines; Particulate emissions; Plants (botany); Pollution; Road vehicles; Thermoelectric power plants; Comparative analysis; Impact on the environment; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Power generation sources; Thermal power plants; Urban air pollution; Urbanization; Viability; Coal combustion; coal combustion; electric vehicle; electricity generation; emission; engine; exergy; power generation; thermal power; urbanization; viability; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078239133

Climate information provided on seasonal time-scales can sometimes improve agricultural decision-making. However, there are many barriers to the effective dissemination, communication and use of such information on farm and across the value chain. We used a case study in southern India to explore ways of overcoming some of these barriers such as those limiting access to information and effective communication of probabilistic forecast information. Firstly, we used social network analysis at the village level to identify particular individuals, groups or/and institutions who are central in information networks so as to be able to support them to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, equity and robustness of information transfers. This allowed us to identify potential opportunities and challenges around access, communication and forecast use. Close linking of formal and informal networks appeared to be a common, positive influencing factor. Secondly, we used value chain analysis to assess how pre-and post-farm decision-makers could use seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) in their own businesses and how this may propagate up and down the value chain. We found that the motivation for using SCF varied across the value chain and was likely of limited use to smaller, off-farm value chain players who take a short-term adaptive management approach to planning. However, it was seen as having significant potential for larger businesses who take a more strategic approach. This identified a possible risk of increased competitive inequality between businesses of different sizes. Thirdly, we addressed the challenge of translating probabilistic climate forecast information into support for decision making by using decision analysis with intermediaries enabling them to structure clearly problems with embedded climate probabilities. The construction of decision-trees enabled farm advisers and local researchers to explore the potential value of SCF by using the decision trees as a “boundary object” around which farmers and other decision makers, agricultural scientists, climate scientists, economists, social scientists and policy-makers could have thoughtful discussion leading to useful strategies to better manage climate risk. This paper outlines approaches and outcomes associated with these three activities as a way of exploring effective application of seasonal climate information and identifies additional research to enhance applicability. © 2018","Climate risk; Decision analysis; Seasonal climate forecasts; Social network analysis; Value chains","adaptive management; communication; decision analysis; decision making; developing world; livelihood; mapping; network analysis; probability; rural area; smallholder; social network; weather forecasting; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082531047

There are some estimates that there will be 75-80 million vapers worldwide by 2020. Most of these products are based on coil-and-wick technology. Because the heating and aerosol formation are separate processes, the system can lead to dry-wicking and elevated emission of carbonyls if designed and/or manufactured poorly. Low-nicotine and low-power coil-and-wick devices have also been linked to increased exposure to formaldehyde due to compensatory behavior by users. We characterized the emissions of a vaping product which uses a fabric-free stainless-steel mesh distiller plate technology that heats and aerosolizes the e-liquid in a single process. The plate has a microporous structure for capillary-induced liquid transformation (wicking) and aerosolization that is optimized to avoid fluid starvation and overheating and improved control. Compared with emissions previously reported for a coil-and-wick nicotine vaping product (e-cigarette), most classes of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) from this vaping product were below the level of detection or quantification. For those that were quantifiable, this vaping product generally had lower levels of emissions than the e-cigarette, including carbonyls. Formaldehyde and methyl glyoxal levels did not differ significantly between vaping products. In this system, the single mode of liquid transfer and vapor formation permits high aerosol mass delivery but further reduces emissions of HPHCs that may be present in conventional e-cigarette aerosol, by lessening the risk of thermal breakdown of the aerosol-generating solvent mixture. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"1 naphthylamine; 2 anisidine; 2 methylaniline; 2 naphthylamine; 2,6 dimethylaniline; 3 aminobiphenyl; 4 biphenylamine; aromatic amine; benzidine; carbonyl derivative; cigarette smoke; cotinine; formaldehyde; glycerol; glyoxal; nicotine; nitrosamine; propylene glycol; stainless steel; unclassified drug; aerosol; air pollution; Article; chemical analysis; comparative study; controlled study; Health Canada; liquid; risk assessment; technology; vaping; aerosol; chemistry; electronic cigarette; human; tobacco; Aerosols; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Humans; Tobacco Products; Vaping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081231711

In addition to intrinsic activity control, geometrical factors of electrocatalysts such as their porous structure have been demonstrated to affect the reaction selectivity, but understanding its origin is still important. Herein, we demonstrate that reduced graphene oxide layers can effectively control the Faradaic efficiency for CO production of porous zinc nanoparticle electrocatalysts. Simply tuning the coverage of graphene oxide dramatically varies Faradaic efficiency for CO production from 66 to 94% even in the bicarbonate electrolyte at the same biased potential, in which the hydrogen evolution rate was notably suppressed without sacrificing CO2 reduction to CO production rate unlike many Zn-based electrocatalysts. The graphene oxide layers are revealed to play roles in providing geometric barriers for the mass transport channels of reactants rather than changing the chemical states of the Zn-based electrocatalysts according to in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical reaction kinetic studies. In addition, computational fluid dynamics simulation studies estimate the Faradaic efficiency dependence on the surface coverage and suggest that the selective suppression of H2 evolution is associated with the larger increment in local pH compared to that in local pCO2 at the porous electrocatalyst surfaces. Decoupling between these reactant concentrations is originated from the higher consumption rate and lower bulk concentration of proton compared to those of CO2, and the surface coating with graphene oxide can be an effective way to control mass transport channel.

The high overpotential, stability, and selectivity in the use of a single-metal-based catalyst still remain a challenge. In current work, instead of using pure noble metals (Ag, Au, and Pt) as the catalyst, a nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy (HEA: AuAgPtPdCu) has been used for the conversion of CO2 into gaseous hydrocarbons. Utilizing an approach of multimetallic HEA, a faradic efficiency of about 100% toward gaseous products is obtained at a low applied potential (-0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode). The reason behind the catalytic activity and selectivity of the high-entropy alloy (HEA) toward CO2 electroreduction was established through first-principles-based density functional theory (DFT) by comparing it with the pristine Cu(111) surface. This is attributed to the reversal in adsorption trends for two out of the total eight intermediates - *OCH3 and *O on Cu(111) and HEA surfaces.

Our article assesses the implications of an accelerated shift towards steel recycling in China. Given the relevance of steel for development worldwide as well as its environmental intensity, any such shift is likely to have implications for competitiveness in China and beyond. Recent findings suggest that China could take advantage of an increasing availability of obsolete steel scrap in the coming decades, moving towards more circular, and potentially greener, steel production. We assess such industrial restructuring from an economic perspective and address the competitiveness of China relative to other developing and industrialised regions. The analysis uses a novel global economy-wide modelling framework (ENGAGE-materials) to assess the aggregate and sector-level impacts of different scrap use options in China in the 2019–2030 time frame. The results show moderate GDP gains for China of cumulated USD 589 billion in GDP gains by 2030 despite a replacement of primary steel capacity. A more comprehensive industrial policy mix aimed at improved recycling practices and more adaptive downstream sectors could increase gains to USD 819 billion. The international implications are mixed, with losses for iron ore producers (Australia, Brazil and India) and gains for most developing countries benefiting from lower steel prices. Another result is an increasing demand for coal in electricity production if such a shift wouldn't be aligned with an accelerated energy transition towards low carbon pathways. We discuss policy implications of such alignment, potential co-benefits, and a need for green international partnerships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CGE modelling; China; Circular economy; Environmental impacts; International trade; Steel recycling","competitiveness; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; green economy; Gross Domestic Product; international trade; iron and steel industry; recycling; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076029028

CO2 data from December 2004 to December 2009 acquired by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument onboard the Aura satellite were used to establish the CO2 vertical distribution at selected regions in South Africa. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories (HYSPLIT) atmospheric model backward trajectories were used to determine the long-range air transport impacting on South African CO2 atmospheric distribution and to detect the source areas of air masses impacting on South Africa's atmosphere. The study found that long-range air transport can result in the accumulation or dilution of atmospheric CO2 at various sites in South Africa, depending on the source region and type of air flow. The long-range air transport from different source regions at the upper air level between the 700 and 500 hPa stable layers and the layer above 500 hPa strengthens the inhomogeneity in the vertical distribution of CO2, which is caused by the decoupling effect of the upper air stable layers. This long-range air transport also involves intercontinental air transport. © 2020 by the authors.","Atmospheric CO2; Long-range air transport; Meteorology","Meteorology; Air transport; Atmospheric model; Backward trajectory; Decoupling effects; Influence of meteorologies; Single particle; Tropospheric emission spectrometers; Vertical distributions; Carbon dioxide; atmospheric modeling; carbon dioxide; long range transport; meteorology; vertical distribution; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082304552

Documents published in recent years (2011–2015) include more mentions of climate change than older documents (1985–1997). However, the review showed that while climate change is discussed within the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning documents, the final Resource Management Plans contain few mentions of climate change. Further, there is minimal consideration of how climate change may impact land-based livelihoods. These results prompt questions about the planning process, how climate change considerations are integrated into the final documents, and how that impacts on-the-ground management.

These SLCPs also have detrimental impacts on human health and agriculture. Studies show that the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, which includes Nepal, has been experiencing the impacts of these pollutants in addition to greenhouse gases. In this study, we derive a national-level emission inventory for SLCPs, CO2, and air pollutants for Nepal and project their impacts under reference (REF) and mitigation policy (POL) scenarios. The impacts on human health, agriculture, and climate were then estimated by applying the following: (1) adjoint coefficients from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-chemical transport model that quantify the sensitivity of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and surface O3 concentrations in Nepal, and radiative forcing in four latitudinal bands, to emissions in 2 × 2.5° grids, and (2) concentration–response functions to estimate health and crop loss impacts in Nepal. With the mitigating measures undertaken, emission reductions of about 78% each of BC and CH4 and 87% of PM2.5 could be achieved in 2050 compared with the REF scenario. This would lead to an estimated avoidance of 29,000 lives lost and 1.7 million tonnes of crop loss while bringing an economic benefit in present value of 2.7 times more than the total cost incurred in its implementation during the whole period 2010–2050.

In Fiji, traditional knowledge of climate and disaster mitigation has been known to contribute to better disaster management resilience by communities. TCW of 2016 is one of the strongest cyclones that have struck the islands of Fiji, and many of its remote communities were severely damaged. Responses to the damage caused by TCW varied from community to community, and resilience was shown to depend on the availability of traditional knowledge of climate and disaster mitigation as well as the effective mobilization of social capital exhibited in the long-standing tradition in Fijian villages of mutual help within the community. Our findings suggest that communities without such resources are often left out in recovery processes and may be in particular need of support. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Community resilience; Cyclone; Disaster; Fiji; Social capital; Traditional knowledge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079713083

However, the net role of soil erosion in the global C cycle is still unclear as it involves small-scale SOC removal, transport, and redeposition processes that can only be addressed over selected small regions with complex models and measurements. This leads to uncertainties in future projections of SOC stocks and complicates the evaluation of strategies to mitigate climate change through increased SOC sequestration.</p> In this study we present the parsimonious process-based Carbon Erosion DYNAMics model (CE-DYNAM) that links sediment dynamics resulting from water erosion with the C cycle along a cascade of hillslopes, floodplains, and rivers.

CE-DYNAM is the result of the coupling of a previously developed coarse-resolution sediment budget model and the ecosystem C cycle and erosion removal model derived from the Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) land surface model. CE-DYNAM is driven by spatially explicit historical land use change, climate forcing, and global atmospheric <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> concentrations, affecting ecosystem productivity, erosion rates, and residence times of sediment and C in deposition sites. The main features of CE-DYNAM are (1) the spatially explicit simulation of sediment and C fluxes linking hillslopes and floodplains, (2) the relatively low number of parameters that allow for running the model at large spatial scales and over long timescales, and (3) its compatibility with global land surface models, thereby providing opportunities to study the effect of soil erosion under global changes.</p> We present the model structure, concepts, limitations, and evaluation at the scale of the Rhine catchment for the period 1850-2005&thinsp;CE (Common Era). Model results are validated against independent estimates of gross and net soil and C erosion rates and the spatial variability of SOC stocks from high-resolution modeling studies and observational datasets. We show that despite local differences, the resulting soil and C erosion rates, as well as SOC stocks from CE-DYNAM, are comparable to high-resolution estimates and observations at subbasin level.</p> We find that soil erosion mobilized around <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">66±28</span>&thinsp;Tg (10<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">12</span>&thinsp;g) of C under changing climate and land use over the non-Alpine region of the Rhine catchment over the entire period, assuming that the erosion loop of the C cycle was nearly steady state by 1850.

It is unknown what biological mechanisms are involved in this process. A first trimester trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo) was exposed to various concentrations of PM2.5 (PM2.5) in order to elucidate the effect of urban particulate matter (PM) of size &lt;2.5 μm on placental function. Methods: PM2.5 were collected at a site representative of urban traffic and dispersed in cell media by indirect and direct sonication. The HTR-8 cells were grown under standard conditions. Cellular uptake was studied after 24 and 48 h of exposure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured by ELISA. Changes in membrane integrity and H2O2 production were analyzed using the CellToxTM Green Cytotoxicity and ROSGloTM assays. Protease activity was evaluated by MitoToxTM assay. Mitochondrial function was assessed through high resolution respirometry in an Oroboros O2k-FluoRespirometer, and mitochondrial content was quantified by citrate synthase activity. Results: TEM analysis depicted PM2.5 cellular uptake and localization of the PM2.5 to the mitochondria after 24 h. The cells showed aggregated cytoskeleton and generalized necrotic appearance, such as chromatin condensation, organelle swelling and signs of lost membrane integrity. The mitochondria displayed vacuolization and disruption of cristae morphology. At 48 h exposure, a significant drop in hCG secretion and a significant increase in progesterone secretion and IL-6 production occurred. At 48 h exposure, a five-fold increase in protease activity and a significant alteration of H2O2 production was observed. The HTR-8 cells exhibited evidence of increased cytotoxicity with increasing exposure time and dose of PM2.5. No significant difference in mitochondrial respiration or mitochondrial mass could be demonstrated. Conclusion: Following exposure to air pollution, intracellular accumulation of PM may contribute to the placental dysfunction associated with pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, through their direct and indirect effects on trophoblast protein secretion, hormone regulation, inflammatory response, and mitochondrial interference. © Copyright © 2020 Nääv, Erlandsson, Isaxon, Åsander Frostner, Ehinger, Sporre, Krais, Strandberg, Lundh, Elmér, Malmqvist and Hansson.","air pollution; inflammation; mitochondria; placenta; PM2.5; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; preeclampsia; trophoblast cells","aluminum; chromium; citrate synthase; gonadotropin; interleukin 6; iron; manganese; mitochondrial protein; oxygen derivative; progesterone; reactive oxygen metabolite; Article; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; cytotoxicity assay; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; high performance liquid chromatography; HTR-8 cell line; human; human cell; inflammation; mitochondrial membrane potential; mitochondrial respiration; morphological trait; oxidative stress; oxygen consumption; protein analysis; protein expression; protein localization; protein secretion; transmission electron microscopy; trophoblast",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082665203

The MD conditions, combined with intensive agricultural activities and the current water management system, have led to water scarcity problems in Mediterranean and Semi-arid regions of Chile. An emblematic case is the Petorca basin, where a water crisis is undergone. To characterize this crisis, we analyzed water provision by using tree-ring records, remote sensing, instrumental data, and allocated water rights within the basin. Results indicate that the MD is the most severe dry period over the last 700-years of streamflow reconstruction. During the MD, streamflow and water bodies of the upper parts of the basin have been less affected than mid and low areas of this valley, where consumptive withdrawals reach up to 18% of the mean annual precipitation. This extracted volume is similar to the MD mean annual precipitation deficits. The impacts of the current drought, along with the drier climate projections for Central Chile, emphasize the urgency for faster policy changes related to water provision. Climate change adaptation plans and policies should enhance the current monitoring network and the public control of water use to secure the water access for inhabitants and productive activities. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Conflicts for water; Drought; Streamflow reconstruction; Water access; Water management; Water scarcity","Agricultural robots; Drought; Forestry; Remote sensing; Stream flow; Trees (mathematics); Water management; Agricultural activities; Climate change adaptation; Climate projection; Current monitoring; Instrumental data; Mean annual precipitation; Water management systems; Water scarcity; Climate change; drought; reconstruction; streamflow; water management; water use; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082681197

Such mapping requires a range of spatial data. This paper examines the use of remote sensing and spatial ecosystem service modelling to examine nature's contribution to targets under SDG 6, also highlighting synergies with other key SDGs and trade-offs with agriculture. We use a wide range of remotely sensed and globally available datasets (for land cover, climate, soil, population, agriculture) alongside the existing and widely used spatial ecosystem services assessment tool, Co$tingNature. With these we identify priority areas for sustainable management to realise targets under SDG 6 (water) at the country scale for Madagascar and at the basin scale for the Volta basin, though the application developed can be applied to any country or major basin in the world. Within this SDG 6 priority areas footprint, we assess the synergies and trade-offs provided by this land for SDG 15 (biodiversity) and SDG 13 (climate action) as well as SDG 2 (zero hunger). Results highlight the co-benefits of sustainably managing nature's contribution to SDG 6, such as the protection of forest cover (for SDG target 15.2), carbon storage as a contribution to the Paris climate agreement and nationally determined contributions (SDG 13) and biodiversity (for SDG target 15.5) but also trade-offs with the zero hunger goal (for SDG 2). Such analyses allow for better understanding of land management requirements for realising multiple SDGs through protection and restoration of green infrastructure.

Despite its great abundance on earth, the accessibility for microorganisms is often limited, because poorly soluble ferric iron (Fe3+) is the predominant oxidation state in an aerobic environment. Hence, the reduction of Fe3+ is of essential importance to meet the cellular demand of ferrous iron (Fe2+) but might become detrimental as excessive amounts of intracellular Fe2+ tend to undergo the cytotoxic Fenton reaction in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. We demonstrate that the complex formation rate of Fe3+ and phenolic compounds like protocatechuic acid was increased by 46% in the presence of HCO3 - and thus accelerated the subsequent redox reaction, yielding reduced Fe2+. Consequently, elevated CO2/HCO3 - levels increased the intracellular Fe2+ availability, which resulted in at least 50% higher biomass-specific fluorescence of a DtxR-based Corynebacterium glutamicum reporter strain, and stimulated growth. Since the increased Fe2+ availability was attributed to the interaction of HCO3 - and chemical iron reduction, the abiotic effect postulated in this study is of general relevance in geochemical and biological environments. IMPORTANCE In an oxygenic environment, poorly soluble Fe3+ must be reduced to meet the cellular Fe2+ demand. This study demonstrates that elevated CO2/HCO3 - levels accelerate chemical Fe3+ reduction through phenolic compounds, thus increasing intracellular Fe2+ availability. A number of biological environments are characterized by the presence of phenolic compounds and elevated HCO3 - levels and include soil habitats and the human body.

Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) overcome all these limitations, as they exhibit complex and fast motions, quietness, lightness, and softness. Recently, there has been much focus on studies of the DEAs material's non-linearity, the non-linear electromechanical coupling, and viscoelastic behavior of VHB and silicone-based conical DEAs having compliant electrodes that are based on graphite powder and carbon grease. However, the mitigation of overshoot that arises from fast response conical DEAs made with solid electrodes has not received much research focus. In this paper, we fabricated a conical configuration of multiwalled carbon nanotube/polydimethylsiloxane (MWCNT/PDMS) based DEAs with a rise time of 10 ms, and 50% peak overshoot. We developed a full feedback state-based linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) having Luenberger observer to mitigate the DEAs overshoot in both the voltage ON and OFF instances. The cone DEA's model was identified and a stable and well-fitting transfer function with a fit of 94% was obtained. Optimal parameters Q = 70,000, R = 0.1, and Q = 7000, R = 0.01 resulted in the DEA response having a rise time value of 20 ms with zero overshoot, in both simulations and experiments. The LQR approach can be useful for the control of fast response DEAs and this would expand the potential use of the DEAs as artificial muscles in soft robotics. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon nanotubes; Conical actuator; Controller",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082331502

To quantify urban air pollution-induced ROS/RNS formation, damage and detoxification, nine different biochemical parameters related to free radical formation, scavenging and membrane damage were estimated in twelve tropical tree species. The experiment was performed in three different seasons at four distinct urban environments in Varanasi city located in the Indo-Gangetic plain of India. Redundancy analysis was performed to statistically assess the relationship between air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and O3) and temperature with ROS/RNS generation and their detoxification. Significant effects of air pollution exposure and temperature on ROS/RNS formation, scavenging and membrane damage were recorded with increasing pollution load in the city for all the tree species. The extent of variability (47–87%) in responses of different tree species was due to their intrinsic ability to scavenge free radicals which minimized the membrane damage. PM2.5, NO2 and O3 were identified as major pollutants that influenced trees to different extents in regulating ROS/RNS. However, the response was maximum against NO2 (34–72%) followed by PM2.5 (16–64%) and O3 (3–31%), indicating that under urban environment, trees are considerably sensitive to the combined effects of both particulate and gaseous pollutants. Reactive oxygen intermediate release, total free radical scavenging activity, NO scavenging activity and membrane stability index were identified as major parameters which showed distinct responses with increasing pollution load. Caesalpinia sappan, Ficus religiosa and Albizia lebbeck were identified as most tolerant tree species having higher ROS/RNS scavenging potential resulted in lower membrane damage. Thus responses of urban trees to air pollution are governed by their intrinsic defence mechanisms to scavenge ROS/RNS by maintaining the membrane integrity through integrated cross-talk between different antioxidative pathways. © 2018","Air pollution; RNS; ROS; Scavenging activity; Tree","Air pollution; Detoxification; Fog; Free radicals; Membranes; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Radon; Tropics; Urban planning; Air pollution exposures; Biochemical parameters; Free radical scavenging activity; Reactive nitrogen species; Reactive oxygen intermediates; Reactive oxygen species; Scavenging activities; Tree; Forestry; 1,1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl; hydrogen peroxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; rain; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; sulfur dioxide; superoxide; free radical; reactive oxygen metabolite; air temperature; atmospheric pollution; detoxification; ecosystem response; free radical; pollution effect; reactive oxygen species; scavenging (chemistry); tree; tropical environment; urban area; air monitoring; air pollution; air temperature; Albizia lebbeck; Article; Caesalpinia sappon; canopy; climate change; controlled study; detoxification; Ficus religiosa; India; limit of quantitation; lipid peroxidation; membrane damage; nonhuman; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; urban area; air pollutant; city; particulate matter; tree; India; Uttar Pradesh; Varanasi; Albizia lebbeck; Caesalpinia sappan; Ficus religiosa; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Free Radicals; India; Particulate Matter; Reactive Oxygen Species; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077501700

This is partly due to rapid economic growth, industrialization, and efforts to bring electricity to rural communities. Apart from restructuring the power sector through progressive adoption of high efficiency low emission (HELE) power plants with potential carbon capture, pre-combustion carbon capture along with syngas based industrial production and petrochemical feedstock substitution can lay the foundations for an economically viable, less carbon emission intense industrial future for India. One of the biggest opportunities for carbon dioxide abatement through clean coal technology lies in using India's abundant low rank coal reserves through coal gasification and carbon capture to enable and expand a carbon neutral industrial economy, which today emits close to 25% [1–3] of the total greenhouse gases (GHG). A practical and holistic macro and micro-level techno-economic analysis is an essential pre-requisite for enabling a clean coal-based industrial economy in a cost-sensitive developing country like India. Through this study, the key sectors that can be enabled using coal gasification and carbon capture are identified and the viable techno-economic options, macro-economic and trade impact, policy support options and a carbon capture finance model for India are analyzed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia; Carbon capture; Coal gasification; Methanol; Steel; Techno-economic analysis; utilization and storage (CCUS)","Ammonia; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal gasification; Coal industry; Coal storage; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Fossil fuel power plants; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Methanol; Petrochemicals; Precombustion; Proven reserves; Steel; Synthesis gas manufacture; Carbon emissions; Clean coal technologies; Economic growths; Economically viable; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Industrial production; Petrochemical feedstocks; Techno-Economic analysis; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076013702

Thus, an improved P-graph integrating carbon emission pinch analysis (CEPA-P-graph) method was proposed to resolve raw material management problem with simpler structures and less results. The proposed method was applied in raw material planning in terms of the regional energy planning problem, and two ethylene plants under carbon emission constraints were examined. As the parameter information of the problem was utilized by pinch technology, the search domain of structure optimization was further reduced, and the computing complexity was reduced, while the advantages of the P-graph multi-solution are guaranteed. The experimental results demonstrated the validity of the proposed method.

Attractive alternatives to expensive noble metals used in these renewable energy technologies are earth-abundant transition metal oxides. However, they are often limited by catalytic and conductive capabilities. Here reported is a spinel oxide, Co2VO4, by marrying metallic vanadium atomic chains with electroactive cobalt cations for superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)—a key process for fuel cells, metal–air batteries, etc. The experimental and simulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy analyses reveal that Co2+ cations at the octahedral sites take the low spin state with one eg electron (t2g 6eg 1), favoring advantageous ORR energetics. Measurement of actual electrical conductivity confirms that Co2VO4 has several orders of magnitude increase when compared with benchmark cobalt oxides. As a result, a zinc–air battery with new spinel cobalt vanadate oxide as the ORR catalyst shows excellent performance, together with a record-high discharge peak power density of 380 mW cm−2. Crucially, this is superior to state-of-the-art Pt/C-based device and is greatest among zinc–air batteries assembled with metal, metal oxide, and carbon catalysts. The findings present a new design strategy for highly active and conductive oxide materials for a wide range of electrocatalytic applications, including ORR, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Temperature had a significant effect on process indicators whilst the effect of pHin was negated by the STNS’ high alkalinity and its buffering capacity offered by ammonia/ammonium speciation, eliminating the need for pH control during digestion. Furthermore, there was an insignificant and significant variation in the biodegradability (Bo) and gas yields of STNS, respectively. This nullified the need for reactor heating if gas yields were not prioritised. Nonetheless, optimum conditions (35.5–37.0 °C and pHin 6.5) yielded 200–217 mL biogas/gVS (≈ 55% CH4), 108–118 mL CH4/gVS and 69–74% VS, 54–57% TS and 47–48% COD reduction.

However, the correlations between kinetics and process parameters were mostly non-monotonic.

They are commonly associated with protostellar winds and jets emerging from low- and high-mass young stellar objects (YSO). Aims. We wish to perform for the first time a statistical study of the location and motion of individual water maser cloudlets, characterized by typical sizes that are within a few au, with respect to the weak radio thermal emission from YSOs. Methods. For this purpose, we have been carrying out the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages survey of a sample (38) of high-mass YSOs. The 22 GHz water maser positions and three-dimensional (3D) velocities were determined through multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array observations with accuracies of a few milliarcsec (mas) and a few km s-1, respectively. The position of the ionized core of the protostellar wind, marking the YSO, was determined through sensitive radio continuum, multi-frequency Jansky Very Large Array observations with a typical error of ≈20 mas. Results. The statistic of the separation of the water masers from the radio continuum shows that 84% of the masers are found within 1000 au from the YSO and 45% of them are within 200 au. Therefore, we can conclude that the 22 GHz water masers are a reliable proxy for locating the position of the YSO. The distribution of maser luminosity is strongly peaked towards low values, indicating that about half of the maser population is still undetected with the current Very Long Baseline Interferometry detection thresholds of 50-100 mJy beam-1. Next-generation, sensitive (at the nJy level) radio interferometers will have the capability to exploit these weak masers for an improved sampling of the velocity and magnetic fields around the YSOs. The average direction of the water maser proper motions provides a statistically-significant estimate for the orientation of the jet emitted by the YSO: 55% of the maser proper motions are directed on the sky within an angle of 30° from the jet axis. Finally, we show that our measurements of 3D maser velocities statistically support models in which water maser emission arises from planar shocks with propagation direction close to the plane of the sky. © ESO 2020.","ISM: jets and outflows; ISM: molecules; Masers; Radio continuum: ISM; Techniques: interferometric","Interferometers; Radio astronomy; Stars; Time and motion study; Motion of individual; Propagation direction; Radio interferometers; Star-forming region; Statistical properties; Threedimensional (3-d); Very long baseline interferometry; Young stellar objects; Masers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088112177

Some of the most prominent sources for particle acceleration in our Solar System are large eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These accelerated particles can generate radio emission through various mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied by a variety of solar radio bursts with different shapes and characteristics in dynamic spectra. Radio bursts directly associated with CMEs often show movement in the direction of CME expansion. Here, we aim to determine the emission mechanism of multiple moving radio bursts that accompanied a flare and CME that took place on 14 June 2012. Methods. We used radio imaging from the Nançay Radioheliograph, combined with observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, to analyse these moving radio bursts in order to determine their emission mechanism and three-dimensional (3D) location with respect to the expanding CME. Results. In using a 3D representation of the particle acceleration locations in relation to the overlying coronal magnetic field and the CME propagation, for the first time, we provide evidence that these moving radio bursts originate near the CME flanks and that some are possible signatures of shock-accelerated electrons following the fast CME expansion in the low corona. Conclusions. The moving radio bursts, as well as other stationary bursts observed during the eruption, occur simultaneously with a type IV continuum in dynamic spectra, which is not usually associated with emission at the CME flanks. Our results show that moving radio bursts that could traditionally be classified as moving type IVs can represent shock signatures associated with CME flanks or plasma emission inside the CME behind its flanks, which are closely related to the lateral expansion of the CME in the low corona. In addition, the acceleration of electrons generating this radio emission appears to be favoured at the CME flanks, where the CME encounters coronal streamers and open field regions. © ESO 2020.","Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: particle emission; Sun: radio radiation","Dynamics; Observatories; Radio astronomy; Sun; Accelerated electrons; Coronal magnetic fields; Coronal mass ejection; Particle acceleration; Solar dynamics observatories; Solar-terrestrial relations; Three-dimensional reconstruction; Threedimensional (3-d); Particle accelerators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089022284

In conjunction with global cuts to carbon emissions, active restoration interventions are being investigated as an additional option to buy time while these stressors are mitigated. One intervention with the potential to improve recovery during or postbleaching involves the addition of probiotic treatments, that is the addition of microorganisms that provide benefits to the host. Fragments of the branching coral, Acropora millepora, were experimentally exposed to a bleaching event coupled with the inoculation of Symbiodiniaceae probiotics (Durusdinium trenchii and Cladocopium goreaui) to determine if these probiotic treatments could ameliorate bleaching related stress and mortality. Fragments inoculated with C. goreaui and exposed to 32°C for 6 days exhibited significantly less mortality (9.1 ± 5%) compared to corals exposed to 32°C without probiotics (66.7 ± 8%) or with D. trenchii (41.7 ± 9%). Fragments in the C. goreaui probiotic treatment also bleached less and exhibited the highest photosynthetic efficiency compared to fragments inoculated with the D. trenchii at 32°C. Internal transcribed spacer-2 amplicon sequencing did not detect the inoculated D. trenchii and C. goreaui cells within A. millepora tissues at the end of the experiment, suggesting the corals did not reestablish symbiosis but instead used inoculated cells as a nutritional supplement, although other factors such as shuffling conditions may have had an effect. This study highlights that nutritional supplementation can possibly aid coral resilience to temperature stress, though a far more detailed understanding of the factors that influence host regulation during symbiosis establishment is required. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration","bleaching; heat stress; probiotics; Symbiodiniaceae; symbiosis","bleaching; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; coral reef; efficiency measurement; mortality; probiotics; symbiosis; Acropora millepora; Anthozoa; Symbiodiniaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075301769

Identifying the resilience of urban bird communities to climate change is critical for making conservation decisions. This study explores the pattern in bird communities across nine European cities and examines the projected impact of climate change in order to detect communities facing a higher risk of functional change in the future. First, generalized linear mixed models were used to explore the potential resilience of urban bird communities in nine European cities and the effects of land cover, latitude, abundance of potential predators (dogs and cats), and bird species richness in each trophic guild. Bird community resilience was represented by an index of functional evenness, because it indicates relatively uniform functional space within the species assemblages. Second, bird community resilience in each city was compared with projected changes in temperature and precipitation for the year 2070 to explore potential future threats to conservation. The results showed that community resilience was not significantly associated with land use or abundance of predator. The number of granivorous and granivorous-insectivorous species increases the potential resilience of the community, while the numbers of insectivores, carnivores, and omnivores was negatively correlated with resilience. Of the nine cities, Madrid and Toledo (Spain) are projected to experience the largest change in temperature and precipitation, although their bird communities are characterized by relative high resilience. In contrast, Rovaniemi, at the Arctic Circle (Finland) is projected to experience the second highest increase in temperature among the focused cities, and their bird communities are characterized by low resilience. These findings indicate the importance of future research on the combined effect of functional diversity of species assemblages and climate change on urban biodiversity. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Biotic homogenization; Bird diversity; Community resilience; Conservation; Functional evenness; Urbanization","Biodiversity; Birds; Conservation; Forestry; Information dissemination; Land use; Biotic homogenizations; Bird diversity; Community resiliences; Functional evenness; Urbanization; Climate change; abundance; avifauna; biodiversity; climate change; community structure; functional change; granivory; land use change; species diversity; species richness; urbanization; vulnerability; Europe; Aves; Canis familiaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078249174

We also calculate reduced land-use emissions with maize ethanol production compared to the situation without it.

Hence, it’s important to identify cost-effective measures for reducing their emissions. As a first step, roadside observations of diesel vehicles were recorded between February and April 2017 at six locations: two on the ring road (RR), two inside the RR, and two on major arterial highways outside the RR. Out of all diesel vehicles observed (n = 12,039), 35% were emitting a visible plume of black smoke and hereafter are referred to as “superemitters”. Of the 4,248 superemitters, 45% were buses of varying sizes, 34% were large trucks, and 19% were small pickups. Superemitters made up the largest fraction of diesel vehicle traffic on the RR (43%–46%) but were also abundant inside the RR (27%–29%), where human population and pollutant exposure is greatest. Upon developing a comprehensive understanding of the superemitting vehicle types and ownership, maintenance patterns and servicing costs were studied through a survey of vehicle owners, vehicle drivers, and local maintenance centers. The costs of general servicing ranged between USD 16 for tractors and USD 203 for construction vehicles depending on the size of the vehicle. Lastly, the effect of general servicing on emissions while idling was explored for a small sample of superemitters (n = 4). PM2.5 emissions reduced from 10.90 g L–1 to 3.76 g L–1 and BC emissions reduced from 0.847 g L–1 to 0.596 g L–1 after servicing. Taken together, results from this roadside surveillance study and exploratory emission-measurement campaign provide preliminary evidence that a policy of mandatory, routine maintenance of a targeted subset of the diesel fleet can systematically reduce emissions and improve air quality in the Kathmandu Valley and other cities around the world that are facing similar problems. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","General servicing; Plume opacity; Roadside surveillance; Tailpipe exhaust; Urban transportation","Air quality; Cost effectiveness; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Landforms; Maintenance; Road vehicles; Roadsides; Smoke; Urban transportation; Construction vehicle; Cost-effective measures; Emission measurement; General servicing; Local maintenances; Pollutant exposures; Routine maintenance; Tailpipe exhaust; Exhaust systems (engine); air quality; atmospheric pollution; diesel engine; exhaust emission; smoke; traffic emission; urban transport; Kathmandu Valley; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080866331

As a result, three communities in Madre de Dios, Peru were mapped during October 2017 to determine Hg0 vapor concentrations in the air. The town of Tres Islas exhibited Hg0 concentrations less than 200 ng/m3: the minimum risk level defined by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. These low concentrations were reflective of a town in the region with limited exposure to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). However, the ASGM communities of Laberinto and Delta One exhibited concentrations of Hg0 vapor that exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3 surrounding active gold shops, where amalgams and processed amalgams were heated with open flames. Laberinto was reevaluated in May 2018 during which time Hg0 levels on the sidewalks in front of gold shops again exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3. Within the scope of this paper a rapid mapping technique allows for the detection of sources of Hg0 pollution and identifies neighborhoods that require intervention to decrease Hg0 emissions.

Yield gaps (YGs)—the difference between current and potential yield of agricultural systems—indicate the ability to increase output while holding land area constant. Here, we assess YGs in global grazed-only permanent pasture lands using a climate binning approach. We create a snapshot of circa 2000 empirical yields for meat and milk production from cattle, sheep, and goats by sorting pastures into climate bins defined by total annual precipitation and growing degree-days. We then estimate YGs from intra-bin yield comparisons. We evaluate YG patterns across three FAO definitions of grazed livestock agroecosystems (arid, humid, and temperate), and groups of animal production systems that vary in animal types and animal products. For all subcategories of grazed-only permanent pasture assessed, we find potential to increase productivity several-fold over current levels. However, because productivity of grazed pasture systems is generally low, even large relative increases in yield translated to small absolute gains in global protein production. In our dataset, milk-focused production systems were found to be seven times as productive as meat-focused production systems regardless of animal type, while cattle were four times as productive as sheep and goats regardless of animal output type. Sustainable intensification of pasture is most promising for local development, where large relative increases in production can substantially increase incomes or “spare” large amounts of land for other uses. Our results motivate the need for further studies to target agroecological and economic limitations on productivity to improve YG estimates and identify sustainable pathways toward intensification. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","agriculture; climate binning; livestock; pasture productivity; sustainable intensification; yield gap closure","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural intensification; alternative agriculture; climate conditions; data set; grazing; livestock farming; pasture; yield response; Animalia; Bos; Capra hircus; Ovis aries; agriculture; animal; bovine; climate; livestock; meat; sheep; Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Climate; Livestock; Meat; Sheep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077909946

Zero-tillage (ZT) practice is a proponent of better resource utilization, to improve soil physical condition, and a potential sink to atmospheric carbon. However, the impact varies across climates, over the ZT history, cropping systems, and soil depths. A meta-analysis was performed, based on 4,131 paired data from 522 studies spread globally, to evaluate the effect of ZT in comparison to conventional tillage, on soil physical condition (bulk density; mean weight diameter of aggregates; field capacity water content; and steady-state infiltration rate), soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and the root response (root length density). Zero-tillage significantly improved mean weight diameter of aggregates and field capacity water content at surface and subsurface layers by 19–58% and 6–16%, respectively, and resulted in no change in bulk density in either of the layers, but infiltration rate increased by 66%. Surface 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm layers had significantly higher SOC content under ZT, whereas in other layers, the SOC content either reduced or did not change, resulting in a small and insignificant variation in the SOC stock (~1.1%) in favor of ZT. The root length density improved by ~35% in ZT only at 0- to 5-cm soil depth. Effect of climate, soil type, or cropping system could not be broadly recognized, but the impact of ZT certainly increased over time. Improvements in soil aggregation and hydraulic properties are highly convincing with the adoption of ZT, and therefore, this practice leads to the better and sustainable use of soil resources. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","meta-analysis; plant root; soil organic carbon; soil physical condition; zero-tillage","Aggregates; Agriculture; Food supply; Organic carbon; Soils; Meta analysis; Plant roots; Soil organic carbon; Soil physical conditions; Zero tillage; Infiltration; hydraulic property; meta-analysis; organic carbon; plant; root; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil type; water content; zero tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077839757

Thus, in many countries, bans are being discussed on diesel vehicles in inner cities. These diesel bans pose a severe threat to logistics service providers (LSPs) that are active in city logistics, since their fleets are based on diesel-powered vehicles. One solution for LSPs is to introduce battery-electric heavy-duty trucks (HDTs). However, this is rarely done at present, due to high investment costs of such trucks. In order to compensate these high investments, high mileages are required in order to benefit from such vehicles' low operating costs. Implementing 24-hour delivery would increase the daily mileage of HDTs. Because of noise emission regulations, 24-hour delivery could only be performed using battery-electric HDTs. In this study, we explore whether using battery-electric HDTs for 24-hour delivery is economical for LSPs. We use data from a German LSP in food logistics, develop a system dynamics model, and integrate a total cost of ownership calculation along with an LSP and a retail store discrete choice model to determine whether 24-hour delivery with battery-electric HDTs is profitable for the LSP, and how it might be accepted and diffused among stores. We find that 24-hour delivery using battery-electric HDTs is immediately profitable. This is due to the almost 50% increase in the daily trip potential of battery-electric HDTs in comparison to diesel HDTs, which leads to a lower required total number of HDTs in the fleet. Lower transportation costs, increased delivery quality, and decreased risk lead to rapid adoption of 24-hour delivery among stores, while lower total costs of ownership (TCO) accelerate the adoption by the LSP. Diffusion through the fleet and stores takes only slightly longer than one HDT lifetime. Consequently, 24-hour delivery with battery-electric HDTs is a promising solution for innovative and sustainable city logistics. © 2020 by the authors.","Battery-electric trucks; City logistics; Diffusion; Discrete choice model; Electric vehicles; Heavy-duty trucks; Logistics service providers; System dynamics; Total cost of ownership","Automobiles; Costs; Diesel engines; Operating costs; Profitability; Retail stores; Secondary batteries; Trucks; Diesel-powered vehicles; Discrete choice models; Heavy duty trucks; Logistics service provider; Sustainable cities; System dynamics model; Total cost of ownership; Transportation cost; Battery electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086639576

To test whether C is a limiting resource, we applied a shade gradient from ambient light to 44% (maximum shade) of incident photon flux density (PFD) in late successional, Carex curvula-dominated alpine grassland at 2,580 m elevation in the Swiss central Alps for 3 years (2014–2016). Total aboveground biomass did not significantly decrease under reduced PFD, with a confidence interval ranging from +4% to −15% biomass in maximum shade. Belowground biomass, of which more than 80% were fine roots, was significantly reduced by a mean of 17.9 ± 4.6% (±SE), corresponding to 228 g/m2, in maximum shade in 2015 and 2016. This suggests reduced investments into water and nutrient acquisition according to the functional equilibrium concept. Specific leaf area (SLA) and maximum leaf length of the most abundant species increased with decreasing PFD. Foliar concentration of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) was reduced by 12.5 ± 4.3% under maximum shade (mean of eight tested species), while NSC concentration of belowground storage organs were unchanged in the four most abundant forbs. Furthermore, maximum shade lowered foliar δ13C by 1.56 ± 0.35‰ and increased foliar nitrogen concentrations per unit dry mass by 18.8 ± 4.1% across six species in 2015. However, based on unit leaf area, N concentrations were lower in shade (effect of higher SLA). Thus, while we found typical morphological and physiological plant responses to lower light, shading did not considerably affect seasonal aboveground biomass production of this alpine plant community within a broad range of PFD. This suggests that C is not a growth-limiting resource, matching the unresponsiveness to in situ CO2 enrichment previously reported for this type of grassland. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","belowground; fructan; isotope; nonstructural carbohydrates; photon flux density; root; shade; soil solution; specific leaf area; Swiss Alps","aboveground biomass; alpine environment; belowground biomass; carbohydrate; grassland; nutrient cycling; photon flux density; plant; root; Alps; Switzerland; Carex curvula; carbon; biomass; grassland; plant physiology; sunlight; Biomass; Carbon; Grassland; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Sunlight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078674353

However, existing strategies are associated with high costs, low effectiveness, and potential adverse economic impact on tropical countries and local people. Moreover, because the underlying causes of deforestation are not clearly understood, the policy options that would be most effective in halting deforestation are not known. Therefore, in this study, I examine the main factors influencing forest area change by synthesizing the results of a multinational data analysis, a Malaysian socio-economic survey, and Indonesian household surveys on deforestation that were conducted between 1990 and 2014. I reveal that poverty has a strong impact on forest area change and that high agricultural rent accelerates deforestation. I then use logical equations based on my own findings and those of previous studies to represent the relationships between deforestation, poverty, agricultural rent, and forest scarcity. From these equations, I derive clear and reasonable explanations for the causes of deforestation and assess the effectiveness of various policies and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation strategies to halt deforestation. I suggest that poverty-reduction strategies can represent sound and effective methods for reducing tropical deforestation. These findings will facilitate development of sustainable strategies that will both reduce deforestation over long term and reconcile forest conservation with social welfare. © 2019 The Author(s)","Agricultural rent; Climate change; Deforestation; Logical equations; Poverty reduction; REDD","climate change; conservation; deforestation; emission control; environmental policy; forest management; poverty alleviation; sustainability; Indonesia; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075169291

Trends in the seasonal and long-term melting of snow and glaciers, governed by initial ice reserves, meteorological factors and geographic features, vary across sub-basins in the HMA region. We examined the economic impacts of climate-led changes in river flow in two drainage basins, one each from the Karakoram and Central Himalaya region. We used an integrated assessment framework to estimate the changes in economic value of the hydropower generation from hydropower plants on rivers fed by snow and glacier melt in the two sub-basins. The framework, developed under a NASA High Mountain Asia project, coupled biophysical models (a suite of climate models, snow/glacier-hydrology, and hydropower model) with economic analysis. We compared the differences in estimated river flow over historic and future time using the water balance model in sixteen scenarios (eight climate models and two emissions scenarios) for rivers upstream of hydropower plants in each sub-basin. Using the hydropower model we developed, we estimated the changes in hydropower generation at the Naltar IV hydropower plant, with an 18 MW capacity, located in Hunza, Karakoram, and the Trishuli hydropower plant, with a 19.6 MW capacity, in Trishuli, Central Himalaya. When compared to their baselines, the estimated impact of climate change and temporal variability were higher for the Naltar plant than for the Trishuli plant. Our sensitivity analysis shows that hydropower plants with water storage facilities help reduce the impact of changes, but the estimated impacts are higher for the higher capacity plants. This study provides an example of the differential impacts of climate change on hydropower plants located in rivers fed by varying amounts of snow and glacier melt at different decades in this century. This type of integrated assessment of climate change impact will support the scientific understanding of hydrologic flow and its impacts on a hydropower economy under various climate scenarios, as well as generate information about water resource management in a changing climate. © Copyright © 2020 Mishra, Veselka, Prusevich, Grogan, Lammers, Rounce, Ali and Christian.","climate change; economic analysis; glaciers; hydrology; hydropower; Karakoram anomaly and Himalaya; remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082675768

The outbreak waned soon after a decrease in importation in mid-2000s and strengthening the control measures. Compared with other post-eradication epidemics in Europe this one was unprecedented by its extension and duration. Methods: The aim of this study is to identify geographical determinants of transmission. The degree of favourability of climate for vivax malaria was assessed by measuring the sum of effective temperatures and duration of season of effective infectivity using data from 22 weather stations. For geospatial analysis, the locations of each of 405 autochthonous cases detected in Moscow region have been ascertained. A MaxEnt method was used for modelling the territorial differentiation of Moscow region according to the suitability of infection re-emergence based on the statistically valid relationships between the distribution of autochthonous cases and environmental and climatic factors. Results: In 1999-2004, in the beginning of the outbreak, meteorological conditions were extremely favourable for malaria in 1999, 2001 and 2002, especially within the borders of the city of Moscow and its immediate surroundings. The greatest number of cases occurred at the northwestern periphery of the city and in the adjoining rural areas. A significant role was played by rural construction activities attracting migrant labour, vegetation density and landscape division. A cut-off altitude of 200 m was observed, though the factor of altitude did not play a significant role at lower altitudes. Most likely, the urban heat island additionally amplified malaria re-introduction. Conclusion: The malariogenic potential in relation to vivax malaria was high in Moscow region, albeit heterogeneous. It is in Moscow that the most favourable conditions exist for vivax malaria re-introduction in the case of a renewed importation. This recent event of large-scale re-introduction of vivax malaria in a temperate area can serve as a case study for further research. © 2020 The Author(s).","Autochthonous cases; Climate favourability; Environmental determinants; Geospatial analysis; Modelling; Re-introduction; Vivax malaria","altitude; Article; climate; construction work; density; disease re-emergence; environmental factor; environmental temperature; epidemic; geographic distribution; human; meteorology; migrant worker; nonhuman; observational study; Plasmodium vivax malaria; rural area; Russian Federation; season; urban area; vegetation; animal; Anopheles; city; climate; epidemic; geography; parasitology; physiology; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; rural population; Animals; Anopheles; Cities; Climate; Disease Outbreaks; Geography; Humans; Malaria, Vivax; Moscow; Plasmodium vivax; Rural Population; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082013659

As a result, a great deal of efforts and resources has been spent on the research and development of high efficiency and low emission engines for automotive applications in the attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and levels of nitrogen oxides and soot emissions, which affect the air quality. This research has developed strategies to investigate the combustion characteristics, engine performance and exhaust emission of diesel–gasoline dual-fuel operation in a Ricardo Hydra single-cylinder optical engine running at 1200 r/min, equipped with a high-pressure common rail injection system for diesel fuel delivery, and a port fuel injection system, designed and manufactured by the author, for gasoline fuel delivery, in order to allow for dual-fuel operations. In-cylinder pressure measurement is used for calculating all engine parameters, heat release rate and efficiency. In addition to the thermodynamic analysis of the combustion parameters, high-speed imaging of spray and combustion chemiluminescence was used for the optical analysis of the effect of the above-mentioned parameters on auto-ignition and combustion processes. Effects of different substitution ratios and diesel injection strategies at low engine loads were studied when the total fuel energy was kept constant. The three main substitution ratios used in this study include 45%, 60% and 75%, which also indicates the amount of fuel energy from port-injected gasoline, where the rest is provided by the direct injection of diesel. Depending on the testing conditions, such as injection strategy and intake conditions, some dual-fuel operations were able to deliver high efficiency and improved emissions compared to that of a pure diesel engine operation, with the diesel–gasoline operation offering more consistency in improved thermal efficiency. The optical analysis of the combustion illustrates the main difference in the flame propagation, distribution and quality for each substitution percentage, as well as the condition under examination. It was observed that combustions with higher concentration of diesel fuel having more diffusion-like combustion, especially with diesel injection timings closer to the top dead centre, where there is less time for the two fuel and air to properly mix before combustion occurs, resulted in higher temperature and levels of NOx due to the pockets of high diesel concentrations within the combustion chamber, whereas higher concentration of gasoline, especially at earlier diesel injection timings, resulted in more homogeneous fuel mixture and thus lower combustion temperatures. In other words, when the gasoline substitution ratio is lower, optimised start of injection is advanced further, so that richer diesel mixture needs longer ignition delay to have proper combustion timing, and combustion is milder and peak heat release rate is slightly lower due to less local diesel rich mixture area by means of earlier injection timing, and in terms of emissions, lower gasoline substitution ratio, decreases NOx with more homogeneous diesel mixture, and same can be said for total hydrocarbon. Performing the thermodynamics testing with an all metal piston alongside the optical testing allowed for the confirmation of these outcomes. This study not only delivers an insight to the benefits of dual-fuel engine operation, it also represents the benefits of optical engines in providing better understanding of engine operation and ways of improving it. © IMechE 2019.","Diesel engine combustion; diesel engine emissions; diesel engine performance; diesel engines (compression ignition engines); dual-fuel engine; engine emission control; engine optical diagnostics; fuel efficiency/economy; fuel technology: engines","Air quality; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Atmospheric temperature; Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Combustion chambers; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Dual fuel engines; Emission control; Engine cylinders; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Ignition; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Thermoanalysis; Compression ignition engine; Diesel engine combustions; Diesel engine emissions; Diesel engine performance; Engine emission; Fuel efficiency; Fuel technology; Optical diagnostics; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069855203

Annual aggregates of information on malaria cases, deaths, diagnostics and control interventions from 2001 to 2008 and monthly reported data from 2009 to 2017 were obtained from the National Malaria Control Programme. We used a generalized linear regression model to examine the associations among total malaria cases, death, insecticide-treated net coverage, indoor residual spraying and climatic parameters. Results: Reduction in malaria mortality is demonstrated by the milestone margins of over 97% by the end of 2017. Malaria incidence likewise declined during the period (from 33 to 5 per 1000 population), representing a reduction of about 86% (R 2 = 0.3) slightly less than the decline in mortality. The distribution of insecticide treated nets generally declined between 2001 and 2014 (R 2 = 0.16) before increasing from 2015 to 2017, while the number of people protected by indoor residual spraying slightly increased (R 2 = 0.27). Higher rainfall was significantly associated with an increased number of malaria cases. The covariates rainfall and temperature are a better pair than IRS and LLIN to predict incidences. On the other hand, IRS and LLIN is a more significant pair to predict mortality cases. Conclusions: While Eritrea has made significant progress towards malaria elimination, this progress should be maintained and further improved. Distribution, coverage and utilization of malaria control and elimination tools should be optimized and sustained to safeguard the gains made. Additionally, consistent annual performance evaluation of malaria indicators would ensure a continuous learning process from gains/threats of epidemics and resurgence in regions already earmarked for elimination. © 2020 The Author(s).","Control; Elimination; Eritrea; Malaria; Public health; Vector-borne diseases","rain; insecticide; Article; controlled study; environmental factor; epidemic; Eritrea; health care utilization; human; incidence; indoor residual spraying; malaria; malaria control; morbidity; mortality rate; parasite clearance; population research; retrospective study; risk factor; social determinants of health; data analysis; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; infection control; insecticide treated net; malaria; mortality; mosquito control; procedures; public health; statistical model; Data Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Eritrea; Humans; Incidence; Infection Control; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Insecticides; Linear Models; Malaria; Morbidity; Mortality; Mosquito Control; Public Health; Rain; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081888408

Climate change is likely to add new challenges to pre-existing dynamics in transboundary systems. According to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Climate Change Strategy and the SADC Shared Watercourses Protocol, there is a need to integrate climate change impacts and associated adaptation measures into water management plans to ensure water security for all countries involved in the future.

These communities provide examples of the most common livelihood strategies across the region: small-scale fisheries (San Felipe) and semi-subsistence small-holder farming (Tzucacab and Calakmul). Although the perception that annual rainfall is reducing is not supported by instrumental records, changes in the timing of vital summer rainfall and an intensification of the mid-summer drought (canicula) are confirmed. The impact of both droughts and hurricanes on livelihoods and crop yields was reported across all communities, although the severity varied. Changes in traditional milpa cultivation were seen to be driven by less reliable rainfall but also by changes in Mexico’s agricultural and wider economic policies. Diversification was a common adaptation response across all communities and respondents, resulting in profound changes in livelihood strategies. Government attempts to reduce vulnerability were found to lack continuity, be hard to access and too orientated toward commercial scale producers. Population growth, higher temperatures and reduced summer rainfall will increase the pressures on communities reliant on small-scale farming and fishing, and a more nuanced understanding of both impacts and adaptations is required for improved livelihood resilience. Greater recognition of such local-scale adaptation strategies should underpin the developing Mexican National Adaptation Policy and provide a template for approaches internationally as adaptation becomes an increasingly important part of the global strategy to cope with climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).","Diversification; Drought; Hurricane; Weather lore",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079732658

Goals within the WFG Act include 'a healthier Wales', 'a more equal Wales' and 'a more prosperous Wales'. Reviewing key factors that led to Wales enacting this ground-breaking legislation is worthwhile for other legislatures around the world that may wish to create policy for future generations. We suggest that the drive of individual politicians, events at the time and recent history were the most critical issues in developing a more nuanced piece of legislation-the WFG Act. Methods: Ten interviews were conducted with those involved in the development of the WFG Act. Relevant documents were identified through systematic literature reviews and discussion with interviewees. Initial outcomes were tested against policy analysis frameworks, and Kingdon's Multiple Stream Analysis was selected. Results: Key 'policy entrepreneurs' were found to be important, along with growing evidence of the problems of climate change and recommendations for sustainable development in Wales. The importance of context and capitalising on global and local events by policy actors was significant. A supportive environment, including the third sector, community groups, cross-party backing, committed civil servants and a change of ministers helped with momentum. Discussion: Policy-makers did not work directly with historians on developing the WFG Act. However, recent history was included with collaboration of the Wales Audit Office, who had evaluated the Welsh Government's implementation of the duty to promote sustainable development. Sustainable, future-generation policies of other nations were also used to help shape the WFG Act. Kingdon's Multiple Stream Analysis is a useful theory to interpret the timing and impact of this policy change. Conclusions: The problem of climate change, suitable policy solutions, political support, timing and, most importantly, policy entrepreneurs were all significant in the development of the WFG Act. Due to multiple factors, policy-makers in Wales have legislated for the long term, placing sustainability and the well-being of present and future generations at the heart of public services and government. © 2020 The Author(s).","health; Policy-making; politics; sustainable development; Wales","article; civil servant; climate change; controlled study; government; heart; human; interview; law; management; public figure; sustainable development; systematic review; Wales; wellbeing; forecasting; health care delivery; health care policy; legislation and jurisprudence; organization and management; politics; sustainable development; Wales; Delivery of Health Care; Forecasting; Health Policy; Humans; Politics; Sustainable Development; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082560770

Methods: Deformable image registration is used to: (a) register each respiratory phase of the 4DMRI to the end-exhale MRI; (b) register the reference end-exhale CT to the end-exhale MRI volume; (c) generate the virtual 4DCT by warping the registered CT according to the obtained deformation fields. A respiratory-gated carbon ion treatment plan is optimized on the planning 4DCT and the corresponding dose distribution is recalculated on the virtual 4DCT. The method was validated on a digital anthropomorphic phantom and tested on eight patients (18 acquisitions). For the phantom, a ground truth dataset was available to assess the method performances from the geometrical and dosimetric standpoints. For the patients, the virtual 4DCT was compared with the planning 4DCT. Results: In the phantom, the method exhibits a geometrical accuracy within the voxel size and Dose Volume Histograms deviations up to 3.3% for target V95% (mean dose difference ≤ 0.2% of the prescription dose, gamma pass rate &gt; 98%).

The authors' model is devoted to combined radiant heat transfer both inside the heat-insulated combustion chamber and its ceramics walls, which could be scattering and absorbing for penetrating radiant component in the subsurface volume of optically heterogeneous porous material. The influence of thermal conduction, scattering (absorption) and external convective effects on the increase of the internal overheating zone in subsurface layers is simulated under intensive radiation. The unique set of optical, thermal-physical and mechanical properties of structural ceramics, depending on their porosity, were first proposed. The radiation fields of the absorbed energy in the near IR region and the corresponding temperature distributions in the modeled opaque and semitransparent ceramics walls were calculated under a stationary radiant-convective heat load during the active combustion phase at time intervals 0.01... 0.1 s (diesel engines) and 10...100 s (turbine ones). In order to control the emission of nitrogen oxides, the authors propose a generation model of NOx, its growth or reduction caused by the management of radiant overheating inside semitransparent heat-insulation in which surface temperature is due to volumetric radiant absorption. It is shown that for semitransparent materials (coatings), the optimal thermal mode is determined first of all by thermal radiant characteristics in near IR at heating small times and it begins to correct at long ones due to the effect of thermal conductivity. This process may be modeled and regulated by the selected microstructural porosity of ceramic heat insulation. © 2020 by the authors.","Absorption; Coating; Combustion chamber; Opaque; Overheating; Scattering; Semitransparent; Subsurface",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083063352

The drag breakdown in the case of riblets installed is a topical matter for understanding on which form of drag riblets act. Indeed, linear theories and flat-plate experiments show that riblets act on friction drag whereas other experiments in pressure-gradient flow revealed an increased performance of riblets that was not interpreted. A contribution to clarify this effect has been recently provided analyzing the effect of riblets on form drag in two-dimensional pressure-gradient flows. In the present paper the effect of riblets on pressure drag is discussed also in three-dimensional flows analyzing CFD solutions of the flow around an innovative regional turbo-prop aircraft (wing-body configuration) with NLF and riblets installed.

We analysed individual level data from the whole of England on factors associated with cycling among adolescents, including cycle training delivered by the age of 11 years in primary schools. Methods: Data came from the nationally representative Millennium Cohort Study collected when participants were aged 13–15 years (adolescents). We assessed frequency of cycling at least once per week (regular cycling) and used logistic regression to assess how this differed across characteristics including demographic, health and environmental factors, as well as receiving cycle training (‘Bikeability’) in primary school. Results: We found that 21.0% of adolescents cycled at least once per week. In fully adjusted analyses, this was more common among boys than girls (32.5% vs. 9.4%, p < 0.001), and those in rural areas than urban areas (24.9% vs. 20.3%, p < 0.001). Adolescents in areas with higher prevalence of adult cycle commuting were more likely to cycle regularly (26.1% in high cycling areas vs. 19.3% in low cycling areas, p < 0.001). Participants offered cycle training in primary school were not more likely to cycle regularly as adolescents (21.7% vs. 22.3%, p = 0.528). Discussion: Approximately one in five adolescents in England cycles regularly, although being offered cycle training in primary school was not linked to greater cycling. Many of the factors associated with adolescent cycling are similar to those for adults and adolescents are more likely to cycle in areas with higher levels of adult cycling. © 2020 The Authors","Adolescents; Cycle training; Cycling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077655683

We performed a meta-analysis of 3002 observations from 104 published studies on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in Siberia (Russian Federation). Siberia is a vast region characterized by a large C-rich permafrost region, which is already degrading due to escalating climate change, and also large wetland areas, also regarded as a source of CH4. GHG fluxes were strongly controlled by location (Western, Central, Eastern, and Far East Siberia), permafrost presence and season. Maximum CO2 fluxes, in the permafrost zone, were observed in Central and Eastern Siberia. In the non-permafrost zone, maximum CO2 fluxes were found in Western Siberia. According to our analyses, CH4 fluxes in the permafrost zone were significantly different in all parts of Siberia. Thus, permafrost has a more profound effect on CH4 than on CO2 flux. The rank order of increase of CH4 emissions among the various Siberian regions is as follows: Central &lt; Eastern &lt; Western &lt; Far East. In the non-permafrost area, CH4 fluxes in Western Siberia are higher than those in the Central part. Soil temperature was the only significant predictor of soil CO2 flux in the permafrost area. CH4 fluxes were well correlated with temperature and soil water content in the permafrost zone, but only dependent on temperature in the non-permafrost area. In this meta-analysis, we established several statistically significant temporal trends of long-term changes of GHG fluxes over three decades (1984–2017): an increasing trend of soil CO2 fluxes in the non-permafrost area of Western Siberia and a declining trend in the non-permafrost area of Central Siberia. There was also a significant increasing trend of CH4 fluxes in the permafrost area of Eastern Siberia, and its decreasing trend in the non-permafrost area of Western Siberia. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","CH4; Climate change; CO2; Permafrost; Siberia","carbon dioxide; meta-analysis; methane; permafrost; soil water; thawing; trend analysis; water content; wetland; Far East; Siberia; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; ecosystem; Far East; meta analysis; permafrost; Russian Federation; soil; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Far East; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Permafrost; Russia; Siberia; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077341425

We analyze the extent to which economic activity, climate policies, and market forces drove California's greenhouse gas emissions trends overall and in two key categories: electricity and light-duty vehicles. We also compare historical trends with business-as-usual and policy expectations from the 2008 Climate Change Scoping Plan, California's official strategy for achieving the 2020 emissions limit. Our analysis, based on data through 2017, indicates that reduced economic activity during the 2008–2009 recession and its aftermath has been a major contributor to early achievement of the 2020 emissions limit. Policies and market forces, however, have played a larger role in reducing emissions in recent years—particularly in the electricity sector, which has decarbonized more rapidly than expected.

Additionally, to study the synoptic climatology of the dust variability, the aerosol index (AI) data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite and meteorological data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis datasets were used. The dust types observed at the surface stations are classified into two categories: weak dust and dust storms. A statistical study of the ground measurements demonstrated that weak dust category events are prevalent in the cold months, whereas storm category events are prevalent in the hot months. Additionally, the annual distribution distinguishes two periods for dust observations, before and after 1989, where the number of events in the first period is lower than the annual average but increases during the second period. The synoptic climate study indicated that two main atmospheric wind patterns, anticyclonic and northerly (shamal) patterns, accompany the dust events in the study area. The dust in winter and autumn is mainly affected by the anticyclonic pattern, while that in spring and summer is mainly affected by the shamal pattern. In addition, a synoptic study of selected cases confirmed the climate results and demonstrated the existence of two atmospheric patterns corresponding to winter and summer. Both patterns include troughs over the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf and a ridge or high-pressure cell over the eastern Mediterranean region during the summer atmospheric pattern and over the mid-Arabian Peninsula during the winter atmospheric pattern. The characteristic of non-dust storm composition demonstrated that the storms exhibit pronounced synoptic systems (winter and summer) with the highest pressure/geopotential gradient near the Arabian Peninsula. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","dust categories; monthly dust variability; northern Saudi Arabia; seasonal dust variability; synoptic features; TOMS aerosol index","Aerosols; Climatology; Storms; Aerosol index; monthly dust variability; Saudi Arabia; seasonal dust variability; synoptic features; Dust; data set; dust storm; ground-based measurement; seasonal variation; synoptic meteorology; TOMS; Arabian Peninsula; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Persian Gulf; Red Sea [Indian Ocean]; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073792347

Predictive knowledge of particle size distributions, both under different operating modes or with fuels of different origin, is increasingly important and necessary. The predictive knowledge of particle distribution is a key factor when it comes to understanding the efficiency of filters and the reactivity of retained particulate matter and thereby helping the design of the regeneration processes of these filters during the lifetime of the vehicle, with the lowest fuel consumption. This work presents a phenomenological model of prediction of particle size distributions under different operating modes, typical of the urban driving conditions with four different fuels, two of fossil origin: diesel without biodiesel and gas-to-liquid derived from natural gas and two of renewable origin: biodiesel (mixture of palm and soy biodiesel) and farnesane (obtained by means of biotechnological processes of sugarcane sub-products).

This assumption may lead to inaccurate predictions of species distribution shifts under climate change. Models have been developed to address this issue, but most of them depend upon prior knowledge on evolutionary lineages, phenotypic traits or ecological processes underlying local adaptation or adaptive plasticity. As such information is often lacking, these models are not frequently used to predict distribution shifts for many species. This limits our ability to explore general patterns of change across species. Innovation: Here, we propose a modelling framework that can be applied across a large sample of species to assess their distribution shifts under future climate while exploring the effect of intraspecific spatial variation in the response to climate conditions. The proposed approach does not require a detailed understanding of the processes underlying such variation. The geographical distribution of a species is split into spatial subsets along the gradient of occupied climate conditions. These subsets are considered as proxies for intraspecific spatial niche variation. Local models are built with each subset and their predictions are assembled across the study area under different dispersal assumptions. Using European butterflies as an example, we show that this approach can be used to explore the uncertainty about predicted distribution shifts arising from intraspecific spatial variation in sensitivity and response to changing climate conditions. Main conclusions: Our modelling approach is not intended to replace advanced modelling methods based on species-specific knowledge of ecological and evolutionary processes, but it is useful as an exploratory tool to detect species for which detailed information on intraspecific responses to climate conditions is likely to make a difference for prediction of future distribution shifts. © 2019 The Authors.

Beauv., and Vitex parviflora Juss. modified soils in Guam's limestone forests, reducing storage pools of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Background and Objectives: Invasive plants may engineer negative changes in ecosystem properties. This study was conducted to determine changes in soil chemistry following infestations of three problematic tree species on Guam. Materials and Methods: Minerals, metals, and mineralization dynamics were measured in invaded sites and paired sites with biodiverse native tree cover. Results: Most soil properties were significantly changed by long-term infestations of the invasive tree species. The soils within invaded sites exhibited total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus that were less than native sites. In contrast, the carbon/nitrogen ratio increased for every species-site combination. The other chemical properties were idiosyncratic among the sites and species. Conclusions: Mitigation and restoration activities that include the removal of these trees from project sites may require many years for the below-ground ecosystems to return to their native state. These three invasive trees decrease the ability of Guam soils to sequester recalcitrant forms of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. © 2020 by the author.

Despite the interest, the overall amount of international adaptation finance that has reached local recipients remains low. What makes internationally-financed climate change adaptation projects focus on investment at the community level is particularly poorly understood. This study systematically assesses conditions that influence the focus on vulnerable local communities in internationally-financed adaptation projects. Using the Adaptation Fund (AF) under the Kyoto Protocol as the case study, we apply fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to analyze 30 AF projects to identify specific configurations of conditions that lead to a stronger or weaker community focus in project design. We find that the absence of high exposure to projected future climate risks is a necessary condition for a weaker community focus in AF projects. Three configurations of sufficient conditions are identified that lead to a stronger community focus. They involve the contextual factors of projected future climate risks, civil society governance, and access modality to AF financing. In particular, AF projects with a stronger community focus are stimulated by the sole presence of higher exposure to projected future climate risks in a group of countries, and by the complementary roles of civil society governance and the access modality to the AF in others.

Taranto (Apulia region, Southern Italy) is one of the most industrialized cities in Southern Italy due to the massive presence of industrial sites, including a huge steel plant. The latter hosts a large open-air mineral deposit, whose dust strongly impacts the Tamburi neighborhood, downwind of the plant when the wind blows north-wester. In order to reduce the PM10 (particulate matter) and B(a)P (Benzo(a)pirene) concentrations in this neighborhood, the Apulia Region enacted a law restricting some industrial activities during certain meteorological situations, called wind days, characterized by strong north-westerly winds. Connected to the regional law, there was a Local Health Unit warning to the Tamburi population to ventilate indoor environments during the central hours of the day. The aim of this work is to assess the effectiveness and the appropriateness of the intervention implemented and to evaluate whether it effectively improved the air quality in the neighborhood close to the mineral deposit. Time-space statistical analysis of PM data measured by the fixed monitoring network before and after the intervention period was carried out. The analysis was performed for different meteorological conditions, different wind days characteristics (long/short), time periods, and other pollutants such as PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), which includes B(a)P for which measurements were not available. In the area closest to the industrial area, there was a reduction in the difference between the concentration of PM10 on wind days and those in other weather conditions. The reduction was more consistent on long, persistent wind days, when the difference in concentrations reduced from 13.3 to 3.9 μg/m3. However, the uncertainties regarding the wind days predictions suggest that the PM reduction may only partially be attributed to the regional law. Furthermore, the analysis of the PAH showed that there are weather conditions other than wind days that lead to a deterioration in the air quality in the neighborhood. Regarding the warning given by local health authorities to protect the population from dust injuries, the wind days daily PM10 profiles do not evidence a sharp reduction during the selected time slot, while other industrial pollutants clearly increase in the same time slot. Overall, results evidence the partiality of the intervention and call for a more comprehensive emissions plan to reduce their impact on air quality. In general, the study shows the need to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of any intervention and to take the consequent decisions to adapt them. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality regulations; Industrial emissions; Mineral parks; Taranto; Wind day","accountability; air quality; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); emission control; human activity; industrial emission; industrial location; PAH; particulate matter; regulatory framework; wind velocity; Italy; Puglia; Taranto; Dascyllus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078479308

The present study quantified the C flux induced by accelerated erosion for different states of India where soil erosion is the most critical form of land degradation. The lateral transport of eroded C was estimated for individual Indian states using spatially referenced data for soil erosion rates that were assessed using the universal soil loss equation (USLE) applied to the information about 1649 soil association units and their SOC inventories across the country. The results indicated that soil erosion varies widely across the states. The states lying in the north region (Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh) and all states of the north-eastern Himalayan region, Peninsular plateau (Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and others) and Peninsular India (Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka) showed more soil loss due to water erosion. At the national level in India, erosion transported about 4.87 Pg of soil and 115.36 Tg of C every year, which consequently emits about 34.61 Tg of C to the atmosphere. Among the states in India, Madhya Pradesh had the highest value of erosion-associated C loss (20.33 Tg C yr−1), followed by Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh with losses of 9.98, 9.18, 9.11 and 8.70 Tg C yr−1, respectively. The possibility of C sequestration in various degraded lands was also explored. The results revealed that between 19 and 27 Tg C yr−1 could be sequestered in soils by adopting achievable technological options in erosion-affected areas of India, offering the potential to reduce approximately 24.5% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural soils of India (94 Tg C). Highlights: Eroded carbon is an important factor in biogeochemical carbon (C) cycle in India. A new database on lateral transport of C is created for India.

To evaluate strategies to reduce PM2.5 exposure, the contribution of different sources, both indoor and outdoor, to overall personal PM2.5 exposure needs to be identified. Despite this, exposure to PM2.5 from indoor and outdoor origin are most often considered separately. This work presents the first application of a microenvironmental modelling approach in a sub-Saharan African city (Accra, Ghana) to estimate personal PM2.5 exposures to population groups disaggregated by gender and age and identify the key factors determining these exposures. Time-activity profiles for each population group were combined with PM2.5 concentrations estimated for three home microenvironments using a dynamic microenvironmental model, INDAIR, and for work, school and transport microenvironments using a steady-state model to estimate personal PM2.5 exposures. In Accra, cooking using charcoal, compared to liquified petroleum gas (LPG), was estimated to result in substantially higher home PM2.5 concentrations, and higher personal PM2.5 exposure for the female adult and child population groups, compared with the male population groups. In households cooking using charcoal, more than 60% of total personal PM2.5 exposure was estimated to be due to residential cooking for the child and female population groups, which reduces to less than 10% when LPG was used for cooking, with the remaining contribution from PM2.5 of outdoor origin. The key parameters to which personal PM2.5 exposure estimates are sensitive are the air exchange rate between indoor and outdoors, the kitchen volume, and charcoal emission rates. This study therefore informs on the additional data collection and measurements that could substantially enhance the parameterisation of micro-environmental models for application in low- and middle-income countries where a limited number of studies have been conducted, and improve their utility in assessing strategies to reduce personal air pollution exposure of different population groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Accra; Indoor air pollution; Microenvironmental modelling; Outdoor air pollution; Particulate matter; Personal exposure","Charcoal; Indoor air pollution; Liquefied petroleum gas; Parameter estimation; Population statistics; Accra; Air pollution exposures; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Low and middle income countries; Outdoor air pollution; Particulate Matter; Personal exposures; Particles (particulate matter); charcoal; petroleum derivative; atmospheric pollution; child health; emission; modeling; particulate matter; petroleum; pollution exposure; public health; adult; Africa south of the Sahara; air quality; Article; child; cooking; environmental exposure; female; Ghana; household; human; low income country; male; microenvironment; middle income country; particulate matter; priority journal; school; sex difference; steady state; work; Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080108782

This work aimed to evaluate the N best management practices using the calibrated and validated Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) model for maize (short and long season), wheat, barley, sunflower and alfalfa in the Violada Irrigation District (VID, Northeast Spain) to reduce the impact of N losses on irrigation return flows quality. In total, 59 farmers’ field plots were investigated from 2014 to 2017 crop seasons distributed in the different soil types in the VID in order to assess the current and optimum N fertilization and the combined irrigation and N fertilization management practices. Considering the whole cultivated crop area in each soil type of the VID and comparing with the current N fertilization, results showed that the optimum N management could reduce the NO3–N leaching below root zone by 51 % and residual NO3–N in soil by 58 %. These reductions could be improved further by 35 % and 3 %, respectively, under the combined N fertilization and irrigation optimum management. The more vulnerable soils for NO3–N leaching (shallow and/or very permeable soils) were also identified. As for the impact of individual crops, the model identified that both long and short season maize were the most polluting crops (84 % of total N leached) due to the heavy fertilization applied by the local farmers that exceed crop requirements by more than 50 %. Moreover, the recommended irrigation and N fertilization could reduce N2O–N emissions by 60 %, the triple than under the recommended N fertilization alone. This study supports the potential of the DSSAT model to incentivize farmers to adjust their N fertilizer and irrigation practices to crop requirement and soil properties to ensure production while improving environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Best management practices; DSSAT; Intensive irrigation; Nitrogen use efficiency","Artificial intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Irrigation; Leaching; Soils; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Best management practices; DSSAT; Environmental sustainability; Intensive agricultural system; Irrigation districts; Irrigation return flows; Management practices; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Nitrogen fertilizers; agricultural technology; alfalfa; barley; best management practice; crop production; decision support system; farming system; fertilizer application; irrigation system; maize; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; sustainability; wheat; Spain; Helianthus; Hordeum; Medicago sativa; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076456603

Yet they are also inter-linked. While it has been widely demonstrated that climate change hinders poverty eradication efforts, there is no consensus on the reverse causality, mainly due to methodological limitations of existing research. This study addresses this gap in our understanding of the causal relationship between poverty reduction and climate change mitigation through the analysis of a cash transfer program aimed at poverty reduction. By linking micro and macro data, the study explores the causal link between poverty reduction at the household level and environmental impact at the aggregate local level. The context of the empirical research is the Familias en Acción program in Colombia, a conditional cash transfer program launched by the Colombian government in 2000. Multiple data sets are used for the analysis. The findings show that the receipt of cash transfers at the household level is associated with increases in the purchase of land- and energy-intensive goods. But this, in turn, does not have a negative effect on local environmental conditions in treated municipalities. Deforestation rates are, in fact, lower compared to similar municipalities. This counter intuitive finding is partly explained by the mediating effect of market proximity. The research thus contributes to the literature by providing new and novel evidence on the relationship between poverty reduction and the local environment and by proposing empirical solutions to address existing methodological challenges for research in this area. From a policy perspective, the study demonstrates the significance of local context, advocates for the use of global carbon footprints, and confirms that the environmental footprint of poverty reduction is small. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Colombia; Conditional cash transfers; Deforestation; Poverty reduction; Sustainable development","climate change; deforestation; empirical analysis; environmental impact; poverty alleviation; social policy; sustainable development; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076494507

There is currently limited evidence about the effect of elevated air temperatures on metabolic health. The aim of this work was to assess changes in metabolic and stress hormonal profiles during a short-term stay in a mountainous, climate-cooler setting against those observed in the urban setting. A prospective, randomized, 2 x 2 cross-over trial of non-obese healthy adults in urban and mountainous areas of a Mediterranean country (Cyprus) was set up during summer, under real-life conditions. The intervention was a short-term stay (mean ± SD: 7 ± 3 days) in a mountainous, climate-cooler setting (altitude range: 650–1200 m), being ~1-h drive away from the main urban centres of Cyprus. The primary endpoint was the change in metabolic hormones levels (leptin and adiponectin) and stress hormone levels (cortisol) between the two settings. Personal air and skin temperature sensors were deployed while biospecimen were collected in each setting. A total of 41 participants between 20 and 60 years old were enrolled and randomized during July 2018, of whom 39 received the allocated intervention, 8 were lost to follow up or excluded from analysis and a total of 31 participants were analysed. A significant leptin reduction (β = −0.255; 95% CI: −0.472, −0.038; p = 0.024) was observed for non-obese healthy adults during their short-term stay in the mountainous environment. The intervention effect on adiponectin or cortisol levels was not statistically significant (β = 0.058; 95% CI: −0.237, 0.353; p = 0.702), and (β = −0.026; 95% CI: −0.530, 0.478; p = 0.920), respectively. In additional analyses, daily max skin temperature surrogate measures were significantly associated with leptin levels (β = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.051, 0.633; p = 0.024). During summer season, a short-term stay in climatologically cooler areas improved the leptin levels of non-obese healthy adults who permanently reside in urban areas of a Mediterranean country.

Findings: Embracing IK and LI in climate change adaptation projects can enhance adoption and scaling success of climate-smart agriculture innovations in smallholder farming. Such efforts will improve: information gathering and dissemination, mobilization of resources, establishment of useful networks with relevant stakeholders, capacity building farmers on various fronts and provision of leadership in climate adaptation programs. Practical implications: Fully embracing IK and LI can improve the scaling of climate-smart innovations only if development partners recognize IK systems that are to be transformed and build on them instead of trying to replace them. Also, participatory approaches in scaling innovations will enhance input from rural people in climate change adaptation programs.

In the article, measures to reduce harmful substances emissions with vehicles exhaust gases are divided into three groups: Constructive, organizational-technological, and organizational-managerial. The environmental friendliness of urban transport systems is ensured by an increase in the ""green"" vehicles share in the fleet. This electric transport: Trams, trolley buses, electric buses, as well as vehicles with natural gas' engine. Reducing air pollution, noise and vibration make electric vehicles more attractive and competitive, but we must bear in mind that the silent movement of electric vehicles and electric buses may pose a threat to the pedestrian's safety. Road traffic accidents (RTA) worsen the situation, as they aggravate the difficult traffic situation, causing congestion, traffic jams, and, consequently, increase the negative impact.

The results demonstrated that with 1 wt% CQDs loading, 87 % of o-xylene (50 ppm) can be photodegraded, which is 55.3 % higher than pure TiO2 (56 %) under UV/visible light. This improved photocatalytic activity is associated with the important role of CQDs on TiO2 surface, which increased the o-xylene adsorption and facilitated the photogenerated hole-electron separation process. Also, the 1 wt%CQDs/TiO2 nanocomposite showed photocatalytic activity in the visible region (λ &gt; 400 nm) compared to pure TiO2 (inactive). The DFT study revealed that o-xylene strongly adsorb on TiO2 (001) surface than (101) through π electrons of the aromatic ring. The in situ DRIFTS study showed that free OH groups on the photocatalyst surface could act as effective Lewis sides for the o-xylene adsorption. The interaction of π electrons of the aromatic ring and isolated OH groups was also observed. The FTIR peaks for CO2 increased in the case of CQDs/TiO2 nanocomposite contrasted to pure TiO2, which suggested that the presence of CQDs improved the mineralization potency of TiO2.

A total of nine key locations in each city were considered and one location in each city was a control. A modified segmented regression analysis was employed to understand the overall climate change and linear regression analysis to evaluate the impacts of urbanisation. The study indicates a significant overall climate change during the 1986–2011 period when compared with the 1960–1985 periods, and urbanisation added to the overall climate change.

This prevents us from discovering whether life is or ever was present on Mars. DNA is an ideal target biosignature since it is unambiguous, nonspecific, and readily detectable with nanopore sequencing. Here, we present a proof-of-concept utilization of the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencer for direct life detection and show how it can complement results from established space mission instruments. We used nanopore sequencing data from the MinION to detect and characterize the microbial life in a set of paleochannels near Hanksville, UT, with supporting data from X-ray diffraction, reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Life Detector Chip (LDChip) microarray immunoassay analyses. These paleochannels are analogs to martian sinuous ridges. The MinION-generated metagenomes reveal a rich microbial community dominated by bacteria and containing radioresistant, psychrophilic, and halophilic taxa. With spectral data and LDChip immunoassays, these metagenomes were linked to the surrounding Mars analog environment and potential metabolisms (e.g., methane production and perchlorate reduction).

The strong feedbacks between carbon-rich permafrost, climate and herbivory suggest an NCS consisting of reverting the current wet/moist moss and shrub-dominated tundra and the sparse forest-tundra ecotone to grassland through a guild of large herbivores. Grassland-dominated systems might delay permafrost thaw and reduce carbon emissions-especially in Yedoma regions, while increasing carbon capture through increased productivity and grass and forb deep root systems. Here we review the environmental context of megafaunal ecological engineering in the Arctic; explore the mechanisms through which it can help mitigate climate change; and estimate its potential-based on bison and horse, with the aim of evaluating the feasibility of generating an ecosystem shift that is economically viable in terms of carbon benefits and of sufficient scale to play a significant role in global climate change mitigation. Assuming a megafaunal- driven ecosystem shift we find support for a megafauna-based arctic NCS yielding substantial income in carbon markets. However, scaling up such projects to have a significant effect on the global climate is challenging given the large number of animals required over a short period of time. A first-cut business plan is presented based on practical information-costs and infrastructure-from Pleistocene Park (northeastern Yakutia, Russia). A 10 yr experimental phase incorporating three separate introductions of herds of approximately 1000 individuals each is costed at US$114 million, with potential returns of approximately 0.3-0.4% yr-1 towards the end of the period, and greater than 1% yr-1 after it.

In this study, we developed an innovative climate-sensitive matrix model using random forests (RF) algorithm to estimate tree diameter growth, tree mortality, and stand recruitment and consequently predict population dynamics of the central hardwood forests under four climate scenarios (i.e. Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP]2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5). Based on post-sample validation, this RF matrix (RFMatrix) model was more accurate than the traditional climate-sensitive matrix model and Landis pro 7.0. According to the importance values of all predicted variables, the variability in tree diameter growth, tree mortality, and stand recruitment was mainly explained by local tree and stand-level factors, followed by climatic and anthropogenic factors, and soil factors were the least important for all the species. Additionally, our model predictedthat climate change could substantially reduce total stand basal area. The RFMatrix model and its prediction results could assist future forest population dynamics studies on the central hardwood region under changing climate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bootstrapping simulations; Climate change; Importance value; Sensitivity analysis","Climate models; Decision trees; Dynamics; Forecasting; Forestry; Hardwoods; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Sensitivity analysis; Anthropogenic factors; Bootstrapping simulations; Central hardwood regions; Changing climate; Climate scenarios; Importance value; Management decisions; Tree diameter growth; Climate change; algorithm; bootstrapping; climate change; diameter; forest management; recruitment (population dynamics); sensitivity analysis; woodland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078224933

Until now, the underlying pathways of the effects of environmental and biological factors on wetland N and C cycling rates are still not fully understood. Here, we investigated soil potential/net nitrification, potential/unamended denitrification, methane production/oxidation rates in 36 riverine, lacustrine, and palustrine wetland sites on the Tibet Plateau. The results showed that all the measured N and C cycling rates did not differ significantly among the wetland types. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that soil physicochemical properties (e.g., moisture, C and N concentration) explained a large amount of the variance in most of the N and C cycling rates. Microbial abundance and diversity were also important in controlling potential and unamended denitrification rates, respectively. Path analysis further revealed that soil moisture and N and C availability could impact wetland C and N processes both directly and indirectly. For instance, the indirect effect of soil moisture on methane production rates was mainly through the regulating the soil C content and methanogenic community structure. Our findings highlight that many N and C cycling processes in high-altitude and remote Tibetan wetlands are jointly regulated by soil environments and functional microorganisms. Soil properties affecting the N and C cycling rates in wetlands through altering their microbial diversity and abundance represent an important but previously underestimated indirect pathway. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Denitrification; Methane; Nitrogen; Physicochemical properties; Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Biogeochemical process; Environmental factors; Methanogenic community structures; Microbial abundances; Organic matter decomposition; Soil nitrogen and carbons; Soil physico-chemical properties; Stepwise multiple regression; Wetlands; carbon; genomic DNA; methane; nitrogen; carbon; nitrogen; biogeochemistry; community structure; denitrification; environmental factor; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; nutrient cycling; relative abundance; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; species diversity; wetland; altitude; Article; bacterial gene; decomposition; environmental factor; microbial diversity; multiple regression; nitrification; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidation; physical chemistry; real time polymerase chain reaction; soil acidity; soil microflora; soil moisture; wetland; microbiology; soil; Tibet; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Carbon; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Tibet; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081669760

For example, the perchlorate-reduction rate was 1.7 mmol/m2-d when perchlorate was the sole electron acceptor, but it dropped to 0.64 mmol/m2-d when nitrate also was present. The perchlorate-reduction rate returned to 1.60 mmol/m2-d after all nitrate was consumed. Denitratisoma and Azospirillum were main genera involved in perchlorate and nitrate reduction, and both could utilize NO3− and ClO4− as electron acceptors. Results of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that transcript abundances of nitrate reductase (narG), nitrite reductase (nirS), and perchlorate reductase (pcrA) increased when the perchlorate and nitrate concentrations were higher. Specifically, pcrA transcripts correlated to the sum of perchlorate and nitrate, rather than perchlorate individually. Analysis based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) suggests that bacteria able to utilize both acceptors, preferred NO3− over ClO4− due to nitrate reduction having lower energy barriers for proton and electron transfers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Competition; Membrane batch biofilm reactor; Nitrate; Perchlorate reductase; Reversible inhibition","Batch reactors; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Competition; Density functional theory; Electrons; Nitrates; Polymerase chain reaction; BIofilm reactors; Electron transfer; Lower energy barriers; Nitrate concentration; Perchlorate reductase; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Reversible inhibitions; Sole electron acceptors; Inorganic compounds; methane; nitrate; nitrate reductase; nitric oxide donor; nitrite reductase; oxidoreductase; perchlorate; perchlorate reductase; unclassified drug; methane; nitric acid derivative; biofilm; bioreactor; chemical alteration; electron; inhibition; methane; nitrate; perchlorate; Article; Azospirillum; Dechloromonas; Denitratisoma; density functional theory; electron; electron transport; high throughput sequencing; Ignavibateriales; methanotrophic bacterium; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; Proteobacteria; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rhodocyclales; biofilm; bioreactor; oxidation reduction reaction; Azospirillum; Denitratisoma; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Methane; Nitrates; Oxidation-Reduction; Perchlorates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076701633

In the Bohai Bay rift Basin, Eastern China, the turbidite sandstones are the critical targets for hydrocarbon production and development. However, their intricate sedimentary patterns and the small size of the reservoirs introduces more challenge for their understanding and prediction. Through seismic sedimentology workflow, 90°-phase adjustment, strata slicing, spectral decomposition, RGB color blending technique, and geobody extraction, 3D seismic data and wireline log information data are integrated to understand the historical evolution of delta-turbidite systems and predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of sandbodies of the Es3m sub-member in the Shahejie Formation, dongying depression. The study identifies two system tracts in the study area, transgressive and highstand system tracts, from seismic and wireline logs interpretation. We identified six fourth-order sequences within the highstand system tracts, each of which corresponds to a different period of deltas progradation. Stratal slicing mapping on multiple deposition surfaces reveals the high-resolution historical evolution of the delta-turbidite systems and the distribution of their associated sandbodies. Interpretation of slices shows six stages of deltas development, which led to widespread delta-fed turbidite reservoirs. Three multi-delta-turbidite systems: the northern fan-turbidite systems and the southeast-turbidite systems are documented, which evolved throughout all stages of delta development. Rapid progradation of multi-deltas systems played an essential role in the evolution and development of thin-bedded reservoirs in the HST. Faults and local topographic lows controlled the spatial distribution of sandbodies in the area. The individual sandbodies range from 4.48 km2 to 16.49 km2 in size, and they vertically superimposed from bottom to top. The classification scheme presented in this work shows a successful application in terms of paleoenvironmental reconstruction and reservoir prediction of the delta-fed turbidite systems, which can be applied to similar systems worldwide. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dongying depression; Geobody extraction; Lacustrine delta-turbidite systems; Seismic sedimentology; Spectral decomposition; Stratal slicing","Blending; Extraction; Forecasting; Oil field development; Sedimentology; Well logging; Dongying depression; Seismic sedimentology; Spectral decomposition; Stratal slicing; Turbidite systems; Seismology; deltaic deposit; lacustrine deposit; paleoenvironment; prediction; reconstruction; sedimentology; three-dimensional modeling; turbidite; Bohai Sea; Bohaiwan Basin; China; Dongying Depression; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076024988

The various research laboratories of China, did a remarkable experimental/numerical research on the development of HCNG engines. A deep perusal of the performance and emission characteristic of the HCNG blends under specific conditions has been explored by these research facilities. This is proved by the series of research paper published by researchers of these laboratory. Hydrogen addition to natural gas increases the laminar burning velocity of the mixture, which will boost the combustion and reduces the brake specific fuel consumption. At an optimum excess air ratio and spark timing, the brake thermal efficiency increases while cycle-by-cycle variations significantly reduces. However, the presence of hydrogen increases the combustion temperature result in high NOx emission. However, at optimized ignition timing and excess air ratio, higher thermal efficiency at low NOx under the limit of emission regulation is possible. Other pollutant species in exhaust smoke like total hydrocarbon (THC), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) emission impressively reduces after hydrogen enrichment. These advantages of HCNG engines over CNG engines are impressive and provides an option for the betterment of environment. Apart from the laboratory research, many HCNG fueled, heavy-duty city bus demonstration projects have been successfully accomplished in various provinces of China.

There is a lack of regional studies that consider the integrated effects of multiple climatic and hydrological factors on mangrove cover. Multi-year-averaged data can reveal general relationships between mangrove cover and macro- climatic and hydrological conditions but often obscures the relationships at a finer temporal scale. Using data from 1990 to 2011, we extracted the annual mangrove area for one tropical and six subtropical important mangrove nature reserves in southern China. Annual and categorized macro- climatic and hydrological variables (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation and evapotranspiration) were also derived for each site. We then applied Kendall rank correlation and Bayesian regression to identify the relationships between mangrove variables and macro- climatic and hydrological variables. To investigate and validate the relevance of key factors that affect mangrove growth, we analyzed the changes in patterns of macro- climatic and hydrological conditions using the Pettitt test and a t-test. The tropical mangrove area exhibited only limited correlations with these factors, while the subtropical mangrove areas exhibited relatively strong correlations with precipitation and temperature. At the annual scale, the effects of precipitation were highly dependent on the local salinity background and the salt tolerance of dominant species and were stronger in drier regions and in drier periods. In subtropical regions, an increase in temperature was always positively correlated with mangrove expansion. The percentage of hot days (>30 °C) in a year, as opposed to cold days, can better explain mangrove area variations. Our results indicate that subtropical regions are more influenced than tropical regions by macro- climatic and hydrological factors. Precipitation and temperature are the governing macro- climatic and hydrological factors associated with mangrove area variations. Although previous studies have reported a positive relationship between precipitation and mangrove growth, the relationship is not necessarily positive at finer temporal resolutions. While freezes are recognized as one of the main causes of mangrove die-back in many other parts of the world, indices based on hot weather may be more suitable for explaining and predicting changes in mangrove areas in warmer regions such as southern China. © 2019","Macro-climate; Macro-hydrology; Mangrove forest cover; Remote sensing; Southern China","Remote sensing; Environmental factors; Hydrological condition; Hydrological factors; Hydrological indicators; Hydrological variables; Mangrove forest; Southern China; Subtropical regions; Tropics; annual variation; Bayesian analysis; correlation; forest cover; mangrove; regression analysis; remote sensing; solar radiation; temporal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075539182

It is not only a more sustainable paradigm that can reduce emissions, but can also bring societal benefits by offering a more affordable on-demand mobility option to the general public. Many car sharing service providers as well as automobile manufacturers are entering the competition by expanding both their EV fleets and renting/returning station networks, aiming to seize a share of the market and to bring car sharing to the zero emissions level. During their fast expansion, one determinant for success is the ability of predicting the demand of stations as the entire system is growing continuously. There are several challenges in this demand prediction problem: First, unlike most of the existing work which predicts demand only for static systems or at few stages of expansion, in the real world we often need to predict the demand as or even before stations are being deployed or closed, to provide information and decision support. Second, for the new stations to be deployed, there is no historical data available to help the prediction of their demand. Finally, the impact of deploying/closing stations on the other stations in the system can be complex. To address these challenges, we formulate the demand prediction problem in the context of fast expanding electric vehicle sharing systems, and propose a data-driven demand prediction approach which aims to model the expansion dynamics directly from the data. We use a local temporal encoding process to handle the historical data for each existing station, and a dynamic spatial encoding process to take correlations between stations into account with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN). The encoded features are fed to a multi-scale predictor, which forecasts both the long-term expected demand of the stations and their instant demand in the near future. We evaluate the proposed approach with real-world data collected from a major EV sharing platform for one year. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art, showing up to three-fold performance gain in predicting demand for the expanding EV sharing systems. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Data-driven; Demand Prediction; Electric Vehicle Sharing; System Expansion","Automobile manufacture; Convolutional neural networks; Decision support systems; Electric automobiles; Encoding (symbols); Forecasting; Signal encoding; Automobile manufacturers; Data driven; Decision supports; Demand prediction; Expansion dynamics; Sharing platforms; Societal benefits; System expansion; Data Sharing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089761528

In order to promote bicycling as an alternative form of transportation, a holistic approach to improving the quality of the biking experience is needed. The planning of bicycle routes typically takes into consideration available right-of-way, existing roadway infrastructure, and safety concerns, among other factors. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution, on the other hand, is rarely considered despite bicyclists being vulnerable to the harmful air pollution due to their direct exposure to vehicular exhaust and increased breathing rate during biking. Methods: This paper presents a method for incorporating exposure to traffic-related air pollution as another consideration in the bicycle route planning process. The method first applies a streamlined process for estimating the level of near-road air pollution concentration. Then a bicycle route planning tool is developed which allows planners and engineers to compare the exposure of bicyclists to traffic-related air pollution among different bicycle route options. Additionally, this paper demonstrates how to apply the method in two case studies in the City of Riverside, California. Results: Through the case studies, it is shown that considering exposure to traffic-related air pollution can change the results of bicycle route planning. Conclusions: The presented case studies illustrate how the consideration of exposure to traffic-related air pollution could impact the results of bicycle route planning. Planners may refer to the presented method or use the information in the analysis differently based on their needs in specific projects. Planners and stakeholders may jointly determine how important the different factors, including exposure to traffic-related air pollution, are in relation to one another and what tradeoff between different factors will be. © 2019",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075568188

Hence, this paper conducts an investigation on rotating machine fault diagnosis, and a novel method based on the structure of fast kurtogram is proposed. On one hand, a novel index is constructed that makes use of both the second order cyclostationary theory and the threshold of statistical test based on hypothesis of coloured noise. In order to reduce impact of outliers on the proposed method, information of fault characteristic frequency of rotating machine to be diagnosed is involved in the definition of index. On the other hand, the Meyer wavelet filters of empirical wavelet transform are employed to replace the filters of fast kurtogram, mainly considering the Meyer basis' properties of good time and frequency localization, good spectrum partitioning capability, and similarity with gear and bearing vibration signal. In the case study, an acoustic emission signal of planetary gearbox and a vibration signal of rolling bearing are used to validate the proposed method compared with the fast kurtogram and Gini-based method. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Fast kurtogram; Meyer wavelet filters; rotating machine diagnosis; second order cyclostationary; statistical test","Acoustic emission testing; Discoloration; Failure analysis; Losses; Roller bearings; Rotating machinery; Statistical tests; Vibrations (mechanical); Wavelet transforms; Acoustic emission signal; Fault characteristics; Kurtogram; Meyer wavelet; Planetary gearboxes; Rotating machine; Second-order cyclostationary; Time and frequencies; Fault detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079052217

The effects of repeated applications of urea alone or in combination with nitrification inhibitors on nitrogen (N) cycling microbes involved in nitrification and denitrification together with non-targeted microbes are not well understood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of repeated application of urea and DMPP on soil physio-chemistry, ammonia oxidizers and total bacteria in the soil. We collected soil samples from a 4.5-year field experiment under crop rotation with repeated application of seven treatments, namely control (CK), Urea (U), Urea + DMPP (UE) applied at 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha−1, each treatment with three replicates. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) gene copy numbers increased as the N application rate increased (from 0 to 120 kg N ha−1). The use of DMPP significantly reduced AOB and nirK gene copy numbers compared to urea alone at an application rate of 120 kg N ha−1. There was no treatment effect on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), Comammox clade A and B, nosZ and bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The community composition of AOB and AOA changed with N addition and use of DMPP but increasing N addition rate changed the composition of AOB only. Addition of N increased potential nitrification rates at 80 and 120 kg N ha−1. There was no significant treatment effect on the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level. This experiment demonstrated that the application of N (with or without DMPP) at rates lower than 120 kg N ha−1 would not result in significant impacts on soil archaeal and bacterial ecology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP); Ammonia-oxidizing archaea; Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria; Bacterial community; Comammox",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075484868

Effects of single faunal species, genera or families have been investigated, but it is unknown how soil fauna diversity may influence emissions of both carbon dioxide (CO2, end product of decomposition of organic matter) and nitrous oxide (N2O, an intermediate product of N transformation processes, in particular denitrification). Here, we studied how CO2 and N2O emissions are affected by species and species mixtures of up to eight species of detritivorous/fungivorous soil fauna from four different taxonomic groups (earthworms, potworms, mites, springtails) using a microcosm set-up. We found that higher species richness and increased functional dissimilarity of species mixtures led to increased faunal-induced CO2 emission (up to 10%), but decreased N2O emission (up to 62%). Large ecosystem engineers such as earthworms were key drivers of both CO2 and N2O emissions. Interestingly, increased biodiversity of other soil fauna in the presence of earthworms decreased faunal-induced N2O emission despite enhanced C cycling. We conclude that higher soil fauna functional diversity enhanced the intensity of belowground processes, leading to more complete litter decomposition and increased CO2 emission, but concurrently also resulting in more complete denitrification and reduced N2O emission. Our results suggest that increased soil fauna species diversity has the potential to mitigate emissions of N2O from soil ecosystems. Given the loss of soil biodiversity in managed soils, our findings call for adoption of management practices that enhance soil biodiversity and stimulate a functionally diverse faunal community to reduce N2O emissions from managed soils. © 2019 The Authors.

Sea surface chlorophyll a concentrations was measured by Ferry Box monitoring system on the Chinese polar research vessel Xue Long, which circumnavigated the Antarctic continent in a clockwise direction during the austral summer 2013–2014 (November 2013–April 2014). The concentrations of chlorophyll a indicated a relatively uniform distribution of 0.049–11.647 mg m−3 (mean 0. 869 mg m−3, n = 152,751). The highest chlorophyll a concentrations (mean 1.847 mg m−3) was found in the Ross sea (RS). In addition, six high-chlorophyll a hot spots were recognized. Analysis revealed that phytoplankton bloom could be controlled by multiple factors in different regions, and the chlorophyll a bloom is attributed to the combined effect of surface and subsurface processes such as, continental shelf, sea ice melting, Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) upwelling, suitable temperature, and nutrient injection from subsurface to the surface. The topographic effects, sea ice melting and CDW upwelling may play a major role in controlling primary productivity in the SO. Among of all, CDW upwelling may be the most important role improving primary productivity.

Through an extensive review of official datasets, government statistics, authoritative website information and 101 journal articles that are germane to the study, it was found that the global carbon emission has continued to rise although many places have introduced incentive or subsidy schemes for carbon mitigation. Carbon emission has become a major evaluation aspect of the renowned building environmental rating methods such as BREEAM and Green Star, but it remains merely an evaluation criterion under the energy analysis category of both LEED and BEAM Plus. Whereas the first international standard (ISO 16745) on carbon emission calculation and carbon metrics for existing buildings was not referenced in any of the studies reviewed, following this standard to pursue carbon studies in future can enable comparisons of study results on the same basis. Rather than simulation studies, more empirical research using operational data of existing buildings should be carried out in order to obtain real and definite findings.

However, previous aircraft work has indicated large daily variability in the results. Here we use measurements of CO2, CH4, and CO from aircraft over 5 days within an inverse model to estimate emissions from the DC-Baltimore region. Results show good agreement with previous estimates in the area for all three gases. However, aliasing caused by irregular spatiotemporal sampling of emissions is shown to significantly impact both the emissions estimates and their variability. Extensive sensitivity tests allow us to quantify the contributions of different sources of variability and indicate that daily variability in posterior emissions estimates is larger than the uncertainty attributed to the method itself (i.e., 17% for CO2, 24% for CH4, and 13% for CO). Analysis of hourly reported emissions from power plants and traffic counts shows that 97% of the daily variability in posterior emissions estimates is explained by accounting for the sampling in time and space of sources that have large hourly variability and, thus, caution must be taken in properly interpreting variability that is caused by irregular spatiotemporal sampling conditions.

However, it is not so easy for other consumption industries, such as food, computers, motor vehicles and most of the service industries, which are more diffuse ones, and incorporate most of their carbon emissions from China from furthest stages of production (3 to 9). In terms of economic policy, this imply that if these industries (or firms) that supply the final demand of the world economy want to reduce a significant part of their emissions generated in China, it should be through establishing collaboration agreements with the suppliers in China that are in the remote stages of the production process, which entails higher transaction costs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon footprint; Emissions embodied in trade; Multiregional input-output model; Network analysis; Processing exports; Structural path analysis","Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Electric network analysis; Emission control; Regression analysis; Sales; Service industry; Carbon emissions; Economic policies; Industry clusters; Input output model; Path analysis; Production layers; Production process; Worldwide industry; Carbon footprint; carbon emission; carbon footprint; emissions trading; export; global economy; industrial production; input-output analysis; mapping; network analysis; path analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082175242

When planning the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, it is critical to consider the potential interactions and synergies among these three emerging systems. This study proposes a framework to optimize charging infrastructure development for increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in systems with different levels of autonomous vehicle adoption and ride sharing participation. The proposed model also accounts for the pre-existing charging infrastructure, vehicle queuing at the charging stations, and the trade-offs between building new charging stations and expanding existing ones with more charging ports. Using New York City (NYC) taxis as a case study, we evaluated the optimum charging station configurations for three EV adoption pathways. The pathways include EV adoption in a 1) traditional fleet (non-autonomous vehicles without ride sharing), 2) future fleet (fully autonomous vehicles with ride sharing), and 3) switch-over from traditional to future fleet. Our results show that, EV adoption in a traditional fleet requires charging infrastructure with fewer stations that each has more charging ports, compared to the future fleet which benefits from having more scattered charging stations. Charging will only reduce the service level by 2% for a future fleet with 100% EV adoption. EV adoption can reduce CO2 emissions of NYC taxis by up to 861 Tones/day for the future fleet and 1100 Tones/day for the traditional fleet. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based model; Charging infrastructure; Shared autonomous electric vehicles; Simulation optimization","Autonomous agents; Autonomous vehicles; Charging (batteries); Computational methods; Economic and social effects; Electric vehicles; Agent-based model; Autonomous driving; Charging infrastructures; Charging station; Fully-autonomous vehicles; Service levels; Simulation optimization; Transportation sector; Fleet operations; electric vehicle; public transport; technology adoption; trade-off; transportation development; transportation planning; travel behavior; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079016922

Scenarios indicate that climate change mitigation will increase global wood demand. This might call for adjustments of well-established management approaches. This study investigates to what extent increasing wood demands in three climate change mitigation scenarios can be satisfied with current forest management approaches of different intensities in a southern Swedish region. Forest management practices in Kronoberg County were mapped through interviews, statistics, and desk research and were translated into five different management strategies with different intensities regulating management at the property level. The consequences of current practices, as well as their intensification, were analyzed with the Heureka Planwise forest planning system in combination with a specially developed forest owner decision simulator. Projections were done over a 100-year period under three climate change mitigation scenarios developed with the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIUM). Current management practices could meet scenario demands during the first 20 years. This was followed by a shortage of wood during two periods in all scenarios unless rotations were reduced. In a longer timeframe, the wood demands were projected to be easily satisfied in the less ambitious climate change mitigation scenarios. In contrast, the demand in the ambitious mitigation scenario could not be met with current management practices, not even if all owners managed their production forests at the intensive extreme of current management approaches. The climate change mitigation scenarios provide very different trajectories with respect to future drivers of forest management. Our results indicate that with less ambitious mitigation efforts, the relatively intensive practices in the study region can be softened while ambitious mitigation might push for further intensification. © 2020 by the authors.

Policy network analysis is a way to explore connections between adaptation and mitigation, and the opportunities or barriers to effective integration between these two policy subdomains. This study explores climate governance and policy networks by examining collaboration and information flows in national policy processes in Peru, a country with an active climate change policy domain. In contrast to most climate policy network analyses, this study distinguishes adaptation and mitigation subdomains through a multiplex approach. We used ERGM (Exponential Random Graph Models) to explain the existence of information flows and collaborations among 76 key actors in climate change policy in Peru. We identified actors who could connect adaptation and mitigation subdomains. Results show a concentration of influence in national government actors, particularly in the mitigation subdomain, and the isolation of actor groups that matter for policy implementation, such as the private sector or subnational actors. Results highlight the predominance of mitigation over adaptation and the existence of actors well positioned to broker relationships between the subdomains. The top brokers across subdomains were, however, not only actors with high centrality and brokerage roles in the subdomains, but also several ‘unusual key players’ that were not brokers in any of the two layers separately. Key policy insights National government institutions are central actors in climate change policy networks in Peru, reflecting national ownership of the climate change issue. Private sector organizations and subnational actors in Peru are the least involved in information sharing and collaboration on climate change. Actors from different levels and sectors are active in both adaptation and mitigation, which is good for climate policy integration. Actors with the capacity to bridge the two policy subdomains are not necessarily central to each subdomain but may be actors that close structural holes between subdomains. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Broker; ERGM; multiplex; network analysis; policy coherence; synergy","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; network analysis; policy implementation; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082919471

Despite the increasing GDP, its rapid development has caused a string of serious environmental problems, especially air pollution. With the frequent occurrence of serious and complex air pollution phenomena such as smog, China's air quality problem has become a research focus of the international community, which poses severe challenges to the Chinese government to improve its environmental governance capability and governance methods. In spite of the central government's continuous attention to air quality issues, local governments tend to choose economic growth over environmental protection. The law enforcement of local governments to control air pollution is a direct factor affecting regional air quality. China's mode of environmental law enforcement has exposed many problems in the field of air quality control. Through direct leadership of the local Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), the Chinese government has formed an old administrative mode and a one-sided guiding mechanism with economic development as an indicator. By analyzing the number of days with air quality on and above the Air Quality Level 2 in various regions in China, and by combining the analysis with the GDP of various regions in 2018, this study found that the number of days with air quality on or above Level 2 and the development of local GDP show a positive correlation. Therefore, in response to such management defects, China should focus on strengthening the response and implementation of local governments to environmental policies and form a management structure under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE). Local governments should shift from the simple mode of ""administrative supervision"" to the comprehensive mode of ""administrative supervision + coordination"" to form a new mechanism of cooperative governance under the leadership of local governments and implemented by the Local EPB, to decompose the overall and stage tasks of air pollution control, and to specifically implement the governance tasks and objectives to specific local government departments and the local EPB. We need to improve the efficiency of regional air pollution control, and effectively curb the deterioration of air pollution. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air quality; Deterioration; Economics; Energy resources; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Law enforcement; Quality control; Environmental governances; Environmental policy; Environmental problems; International community; Management structure; Positive correlations; Regional air pollution; Regional air quality; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082972783

However, the PEC-CO2RR still faces challenges from complex reaction pathways, obstructed mass transfer, and large photovoltage requirements. The goal of this perspective is to point out some of the limitations of PEC-CO2RR to a practical application.

Moreover, we highlight the remaining challenges to both science and engineering and propose the key steps in developing a fully functional PEC-CO2RR system.

In this study, daily PM10 and PM2.5 samples were collected simultaneously at the Jinan Environmental Monitoring Station (EMS)in Jinan, China from 15 November 2016 to 15 March 2017. The aim of this work was to improve the understanding of the characteristics and sources of air particles and determine different levels of PM2.5 pollution and its constituent elements, water-soluble ions and carbonaceous species. Nitrate (NO3 -), organic materials (OM) and sulfate (SO4 2-) were identified as the three main components of PM2.5 pollution. With increasing pollution level, the contributions of SO4 2-, NO3 - and NH4 + increased at greater rates, unlike that of OM. The proportion of SO4 2- exceeded that of NO3 - and became predominant in severe PM2.5 pollution (SP; 250 μg m-3 ≤ PM2.5 ≤ 500 μg m-3). This work demonstrates that SO4 2- has a dominant role in SP level and, consequently, requires greater research attention. It is demonstrated that relative humidity (RH) enhances the rate of sulfate formation more than that of nitrate. Therefore, under the current Chinese emergency response measures, it is necessary to further reduce emissions of SO2 and NO2. Four clusters of backward trajectories identified dominant pollution vectors originating from highly industrialized areas that exacerbate the poor air quality in Jinan. It is, therefore, necessary to undertake regional control measures to reduce pollutant emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the effects of these stressors on the economically important shellfish that inhabit these waters are still not well-understood. This study evaluated the combined effects of the harmful algae Microcystis aeruginosa (0%, 50%, and 100% of total dietary dry weight) and high pH (8.0, 8.5 and 9.0) on the antioxidant responses of the triangle sail mussel H. cumingii. The mussels were exposed to algae and high pH for 14 d, followed by a 7-day depuration period. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mussel hemolymph, antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the digestive glands were analyzed during the experimental period. GST, SOD and GPx activity levels and the content of GSH increased following exposure to toxic M. aeruginosa, whereas CAT activity was inhibited. pH showed no significant effects on the immune defense mechanisms and detoxification processes. However, a high pH could cause increased ROS and MDA levels, resulting in oxidative injury. After a 7-day depuration period, exposure to toxic M. aeruginosa or high pH resulted in latent effects for most of the examined parameters. The treatment group exposed to the highest pH (9.0) displayed an increased oxidation state compared with the other pH treatments (8.0 and 8.5) for the same concentrations of toxic M. aeruginosa. The trends observed for ROS, MDA, GPx, GST, SOD and GSH levels indicated that a high density of toxic algae could result in severe and continuous effects on mussel health. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Antioxidant capacity; High pH; Microcystis aeruginosa; Triangle sail mussel Hyriopsis cumingii","Algae; Antioxidants; Bacteria; Detoxification; Enzymes; Eutrophication; Molluscs; Peptides; Reservoirs (water); Antioxidant capacity; Detoxification process; Glutathione peroxidase; Glutathione S-transferases; High pH; Microcystis aeruginosa; Superoxide dismutases; Triangle sail mussel Hyriopsis cumingii; pH effects; antioxidant; catalase; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione transferase; malonaldehyde; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; antioxidant; catalase; fresh water; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione transferase; malonaldehyde; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; alga; antioxidant; concentration (composition); cyanobacterium; depuration; detoxification; immune system; mollusc; pH; reactive oxygen species; algal bloom; Article; comparative study; concentration (parameter); detoxification; dry weight; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; exocrine gland; harmful alga; hemolymph; Hyriopsis cumingii; immunity; Microcystis aeruginosa; mussel; nonhuman; pH; toxic alga; algal bloom; animal; chemistry; ecotoxicology; eutrophication; metabolism; microbiology; Microcystis; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; physiology; Unionidae; algae; Hyriopsis cumingii; Microcystis aeruginosa; Animals; Antioxidants; Catalase; Ecotoxicology; Eutrophication; Fresh Water; Glutathione; Glutathione Peroxidase; Glutathione Transferase; Harmful Algal Bloom; Hemolymph; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Malondialdehyde; Microcystis; Oxidation-Reduction; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase; Unionidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075627909

This study unravels structure sensitivity of ultrasmall Ag nanocubes with lengths below 25 and 70 nm (L25-and L70-Ag-NCs) enclosed completely by the (100) facet toward an efficient CO2RR to CO. The ultrasmall L25-Ag-NCs deliver a remarkably larger current density, a significantly higher Faraday efficiency (FE) of near-unity, and a comparably higher energy efficiency of 64.0% as well as a better stability of 18 h as compared to L70-Ag-NCs, Ag nanoparticles, and bulk Ag. More importantly, CO generation initiates at an ultralow overpotential of 146 mV, accompanied with a remarkably high onset CO FE of 59.6%, further demonstrating the excellence of L25-Ag-NCs for highly active and selective CO2RR.

They form a potential family of heterogeneous catalysts for energy conversion. The practical implementation of these heterostructures, however, requires the precise control of their catalytic performance. Here we use 2D magnesium oxide (MgO) overlayers on metal substrates for electrocatalysis of CO2 reduction. By comprehensive first-principles calculations, the effects of the facet and number of layers of MgO sheets, as well as the type and exposed surface of metal substrates on the catalytic behavior of various 2D MgO/metal heterostructures are clearly revealed. Our calculations show that the high activity for CO2 reduction originates from the exotic surface states of MgO overlayers, mediated by their electronic coupling with metal substrates. The key parameters governing the activity and selectivity, including the p-band center of MgO sheets and the work function of 2D MgO/metal heterostructures, are thoroughly analyzed to establish an explicit band structure-Activity relation. These findings provide universal guidelines for engineering the oxide/metal interface with atomic precision and developing durable, cost-effective and environment-benign catalysts made of p-block elements for various energy applications.

The accelerated conversion of CO2 to water-insoluble and stable magnesium carbonate is a thermodynamically downhill route for permanently storing CO2. However, a practical constraint of carbon mineralization is the slow kinetics at low CO2 concentrations. In this study, we investigate a direct integrated mineralization approach, whereby CO2, amine solvents (such as monoethanolamine, MEA), water and alkaline Mg-bearing solids are reacted in a slurry reaction environment. About 70% conversion of magnesium oxide to magnesium carbonate was achieved at 50 °C after 3 hours. The looping of amine-bearing solvents between the CO2 loaded and release states, facilitates the accelerated conversion of magnesium-bearing oxides to magnesium carbonate. Hydrated magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide phases were noted when less than complete conversion of magnesium oxide was achieved. The morphological features were determined using in operando ultra-small and small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS/SAXS) and grazing incidence-small angle X-ray scattering (GI-SAXS) measurements. The proposed pathway is an adaptive, low temperature, single-step approach for the direct capture, conversion and storage of CO2. By demonstrating the effectiveness of aqueous alkaline amine looping approach for the accelerated carbon mineralization of MgO, we aim to expand this approach to include heterogeneous alkaline industrial residues such as coal fly ash and steel slag and naturally occurring minerals such as magnesium silicate and calcium silicate.

We estimate dynamic panel data models using 8755 major manufacturing facilities in the USA from 2001 to 2010. Our results suggest that being classified as an HPV facility can have significant and positive effects on compliance. We also find general deterrence effects such that a given facility’s compliance rate rises with fines on HPV facilities within the same state. However, the deterrence effects of enforcement differ by HPV status.

However, the health benefits from this improvement remain unclear. Therefore, we collected time-series data covering deaths, weather variables and air pollutants during the two periods (2004–2009, 2014–2017) and fitted single-pollutant models using the generalized additive models to evaluate the change of mortality risks associated with air pollutants in Lanzhou. Results showed that the annual average concentrations of respirable particulate matter (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) dropped by 19.28% and 66.29%, while the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) increased by 16.61% in 2014–2017 compared to 2004–2009. During the period 2004–2009, we found a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 (lag 2), SO2 (lag 0–5) and NO2 (lag 0–5) were associated with mortality increments of 0.12% (95% CI: 0.01, 0.22), 0.86% (95% CI: 0.42, 1.31) and 1.29% (95% CI: 0.70, 1.90), respectively. During the period 2014–2017, the association between PM10 and daily deaths was not significant, but we observed a 10-μg/m3 increase in SO2 (lag 0–5) and NO2 (lag 4) were related to mortality increments of 4.23% (95% CI: 1.82, 6.70) and 0.85% (95% CI: 0.19, 1.52), respectively. From 2004–2009 to 2014–2017, we observed markedly decline of mortality risk due to PM10, but not SO2 or NO2.

This study proposes a three-stage hybrid neural network model to forecast outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. It subsumes outlier correction, decomposition, neural network, and metaheuristic optimization to guarantee high accuracy. The adopted methods serve different purposes and ultimately aim at improving the performance of model. Firstly, a robust outlier correction preprocessing method is employed to filter the abnormal information in the original PM2.5 concentrations series and reduce its complexity. Then, the processed series is adaptively decomposed into several subseries by empirical wavelet transform. The subseries are more stationary and their trends are more obvious than original series. To forecast each subseries and generate multi-step forecasting outputs, weighted regularized extreme learning machine whose parameters are optimally determined by neural network algorithm is used. Finally, inverse empirical wavelet transform is implemented to reconstruct the subseries and correct unexpected forecasting values beyond the frequency bands. The proposed model is tested by the actual data collected from four cities in China. Results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed model has accurate forecasting performance, whose root mean square errors of 5-step daily forecasting results in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan are 4.7555μg/m3, 3.3024μg/m3, 6.4326μg/m3, and 4.3191μg/m3, respectively; (2) all components of the hybrid model are indispensable to promote accuracy; (3) the proposed model significantly outperforms seven benchmark models and five existing models; (4) the forecasting results can be utilized to analyze the trend of pollution and perform better management measures. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Metaheuristic optimization; Multi-step forecast; Neural network model; Outlier correction; PM2.5 concentrations forecasting; Time series decomposition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077714695

However, production and life cycles of such technologies tend to produce CO2 emissions. To minimize life-cycle emissions, one should account for such emissions and implement adequate policies to encourage innovation and adoption of well-performing technologies in this respect. We develop a framework to analyse this issue, grounded in the concepts of ‘energy return on energy invested’ (EROI) and ‘net energy return on carbon invested’ (EROC). Applying these to the main PV technologies and production regions – namely China, EU and USA – displays considerable discrepancies. We conditionally predict the development of average EROI and EROC over time under business-as-usual and low-carbon electricity generation scenarios.

A new plant functional type (PFT) representing Miscanthus is also presented. The Miscanthus PFT fits well with growth parameters observed at a site in Lincolnshire, UK; however, global observed yields of Miscanthus are far more variable than is captured by the model, primarily owing to the model's lack of representation of crop age and establishment time. Global expansion of bioenergy crop areas under a 2 ?C emissions scenario and balanced greenhouse gas mitigation strategy from the IMAGE integrated assessment model (RCP2.6- SSP2) achieves a mean yield of 4.3 billion tonnes of dry matter per year over 2040-2099, around 30 % higher than the biomass availability projected by IMAGE. In addition to perennial grasses, JULES-BE can also be used to represent short-rotation coppicing, residue harvesting from cropland or forestry and rotation forestry. © 2020 Author(s).",,"bioenergy; biomass; crop rotation; crop yield; dry matter; energy crop; numerical model; England; Lincolnshire; United Kingdom; Miscanthus; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081884617

Drawing on data from five different research projects and two hundred interviews, Lis reflects on how EU accession forced Poland to mobilize their resources and produce expertise on carbon dioxide and shale gas, in order to actively participate in the debates around EU climate change ambitions and goals. A significant lack of capacity and expert institutions made it difficult for Poland to quickly assess the impacts of EU legislation or to propose new solutions for itself, and it is precisely this struggle for knowledge production that will be examined during the course of the book.

We examine here 36 examples of local climate change adaptation plans of small and mid-sized urban communities in France and the United States and reflect on the experiences they offer to future planning. Driven by different methodological guidelines, French and U.S. plans demonstrate different strong points, offering useful insights for future planning. Yet, they appear to share similar shortcomings on both sides of the Atlantic. The key findings include the need for clearer planning toolkits for local governments, engagement of diverse stakeholders, attention to equity, and higher level of integration of plans across multiple sectors and scales.

In the regions, most intensely engaged in this form of employment, mobile oil work has largely replaced the dominant industries of the previous century. This geographic shift in Canadian investment and production has created uneven labour markets, with high demand for labour in the Northern Alberta and high unemployment in de-industrialized communities in Atlantic Canada. (2) Methods: There is little quantitative evidence on the flows of mobile workers from the East to the West and the impact of this movement on the Atlantic Canadian economy. Data for this paper were obtained through a special arrangement with Statistics Canada in the fall of 2015 and winter of 2016, from the Canadian Employer–Employee Dynamics Database (CEEDD). (3) Results: Analysis of CEEDD revealed that the oil and gas industry of Northern Alberta has a significant impact on the economies of Atlantic Canada with an increasing dependence for interprovincial workers. (4) Conclusions: To the extent that mobile work has served as a replacement for traditional industries, mobile work is re-structuring the social and economic makeup of Atlantic Canadian communities. The more reliant Atlantic Canadian communities become on oil-related mobile work, the more precarious their economies will become as global markets for oil and gas change and targeted actions on climate change increase. © 2020 by the authors.

In this unique populated region, which is characterized by significant gaps in the socio-economic levels particularly between the North (Europe) and South (Africa), parallel with population growth and migration, increased water demand and forest fires risk - the vulnerability of the Mediterranean population to human health risks increases significantly. Indeed, climatic changes impact the health of the Mediterranean population directly through extreme heat, drought or storms, or indirectly by changes in water availability, food provision and quality, air pollution and other stressors. The main health effects are related to extreme weather events (including extreme temperatures and floods), changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive diseases and changes in environmental and social conditions. The poorer countries, particularly in North Africa and the Levant, are at highest risk. Climate change affects the vulnerable sectors of the region, including an increasingly older population, with a larger percentage of those with chronic diseases, as well as poor people, which are therefore more susceptible to the effects of extreme temperatures. For those populations, a better surveillance and control systems are especially needed. In view of the climatic projections and the vulnerability of Mediterranean countries, climate change mitigation and adaptation become ever more imperative. It is important that prevention Health Action Plans will be implemented, particularly in those countries that currently have no prevention plans. Most adaptation measures are “win-win situation” from a health perspective, including reducing air pollution or providing shading solutions. Additionally, Mediterranean countries need to enhance cross-border collaboration, as adaptation to many of the health risks requires collaboration across borders and also across the different parts of the basin. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Health action plan; Health impacts; Mediterranean","rain; action plan; atmospheric pollution; climate change; health impact; health risk; heat wave; population growth; public health; vulnerability; water demand; air pollution; air quality; chronic disease; climate change; drought; environmental impact; environmental stress; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; female; flooding; food quality; forest fire; greenhouse effect; heat; high risk population; human; male; Mediterranean Sea; mineral dust; North Africa; population growth; population migration; precipitation; priority journal; public health; Review; social aspect; summer; vulnerable population; warming; water availability; weather; Africa; Europe; South Africa; Southern Europe; Mediterranean Sea; North Africa; Africa, Northern; Climate Change; Europe; Humans; Mediterranean Region; Public Health; South Africa; Vulnerable Populations",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077731447

In this study, we aim to intensify the synergy between geometrical structure and complex physical–chemical processes in a tubular SOEC reactor for higher Electricity-to-CH4 efficiency. First, we divided the reactor into two parts: Electrolysis region and Methanation reaction (MR) region, and investigated their respective contribution and interaction. According to a self-developed multi-physics tubular SOEC model, we optimized the geometry of the reactor to synergistically regulate the field temperature of the Electrolysis and MR region. The results indicate that CH4 production ratio and Electricity-to-CH4 efficiency can be enhanced through the lengthening of either the Electrolysis region or the MR region. When fed with a cathode gas of 75%H2O + 20%CO2 + 5%H2 (20 mL min−1), an tubular SOEC reactor optimized with an Electrolysis region of 0.10 m and a MR region of 0.045 m can convert 91% of CO2 to CH4 at 1.5 V with an Electricity-to-CH4 efficiency of 49%. An improved synergy between pressure, operating voltage and gas flow can significantly improve CH4 production with less electricity. A tubular SOEC reactor with the optimized geometry can convert 95% of CO2 to CH4 at 1.2 V and 16 bar with an Electricity-to-CH4 efficiency of 81%, producing 52 vol% of dry CH4 at the cathode outlet. After optimization, tubular SOEC reactor can realize a more efficient PtM, thus, promote the combination of renewable power and natural gas networks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Direct power-to-methane; Electricity-to-methane efficiency; Geometry optimization; Pressurization; Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC); Steam/carbon dioxide co-electrolysis","Carbon dioxide; Cathodes; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Flow of gases; Geometry; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Methane; Natural gas; Pressurization; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Co-electrolysis; Field temperature; Geometrical structure; Geometry optimization; Natural gas networks; Operating voltage; Optimized geometries; Seasonal energy storages; Regenerative fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079694532

Decomposing these effects on human exposure is essential to guide future environmental policies. The lack of ground PM2.5 observations limits the assessment of human exposure to PM2.5 over China. This study proposed a novel diagnostic framework using satellite observations to decompose the variation in cρ resulting from change in the mean PM2.5 concentration, spatial difference in PM2.5 change, and demographic change. In this framework, we decomposed cρ into mean PM2.5 concentration (c0) and pollution-population-coincidence induced PM2.5 exposure (PPCE). We then used this framework to decompose the variation in cρ over China within three recent Five-Year Plans (FYPs) (2001–2015). The results showed that the decline in c0 reduced cρ in most provinces within the eleventh and twelfth FYPs. The spatial difference in PM2.5 change reduced the PPCE and cρ in most provinces within the tenth and twelfth FYPs, with the most substantial reduction rate of −3.64 μg m−3·yr−1 in Tianjin within the twelfth FYP. Rural-to-urban migration resulting from rapid urbanization, however, increased the PPCE and cρ (by as much as 0.22 μg m−3·yr−1) in all provinces except Taiwan within all three FYPs. The demographic change reduced cρ in Taiwan because of the migration of population into less polluted areas. To better reduce human exposure, it is recommended that control efforts further target populous residential areas and urbanization planning relocates people into less polluted areas. Our decomposition framework paves a new way to decompose the human exposure to other air pollutants in China and other regions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Human exposure; PM2.5; Public health; Satellite observations; Urbanization","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); decomposition; environmental policy; observational method; particulate matter; pollution exposure; urban area; urban planning; urbanization; air pollutant; article; China; decomposition; human; public health; residential area; Taiwan; urbanization; air pollutant; air pollution; demography; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; space flight; China; Taiwan; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Demography; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Spacecraft; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077474226

With this in mind, this study analyzes the influencing factors of electricity consumption and estimates the electricity consumption efficiency by considering the role of structural changes in China's 30 provinces over the period 2006–2015. The following findings are obtained: (1) Per capita income, urbanization, population, the proportion of secondary industry, and electricity price have significant impacts on electricity consumption. (2) The optimization of industrial structure is conducive for improving the electricity consumption efficiency and has a significant impact, while the improvement in electrification level will lead to a decrease in efficiency score during the study period. (3) There are significant differences in electricity consumption efficiency with a range from 0.372 to 1.000, depending on different model specifications, regions, and years.

Private environmental governance can functionally advance one of federalism’s core values: policy experimentalism. To the extent that private governance by business firms arouses skepticism for this experimental role because firms’ motives to achieve profit in a competitive environment differ from the incentives motivating public regulators, private universities offer an alternative institutional locus for experimentalism.

One promising concept is the decentralized feed-in by consumers equipped with their own small production units (prosumers). Prosumers can provide an added value regarding security of supply, emission reduction and economic welfare, but in order to achieve this, in addition to advanced hydraulic control strategies also superordinate control strategies and appropriate market models become crucial. In this article we study methods to find a global optimum for the local energy community or at least an acceptable approximation to it. In contrast to standard centralized control approaches, based either on expert rules or mixed integer linear optimization, we adopt an agent-based, decentralized approach that allows for incorporation of nonlinear phenomena. While studied here in small-scale systems, this approach is particularly attractive for larger systems, since with an increasing number of interacting units, the optimization problem becomes more complex and the computational effort for centralized approaches increases dramatically. The agent-based optimization approach is compared to centralized optimization of the same prosumer-based setting as well as to a purely central setup. The comparison is based on the quality of the optimization solution, the computational effort and the scalability.

Firstly, the emission efficiency of CO2 of 13 cities in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei in 2005-2014 was estimated using the non expected output SBM model. Then, the emission reduction potential of cities is quantitatively analyzed based on equity and efficiency of the emission reduction potential index. The results show that the overall carbon emission efficiency of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city is decreasing during the research period. The urban emission reduction potential index has the same trend, and Beijing has the lowest emission reduction potential and Tangshan has the highest emission reduction potential. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; CO2 emission efficiency; CO2 emission reduction potential","Air pollution; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Carbon emission efficiencies; Carbon emissions; Development strategies; Emission efficiencies; Emission reduction potentials; Equity and efficiencies; Urban emissions; Emission control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083220462

However, heating and maintaining AFs at a certain water temperature during a cold stream event is difficult. As a technical and economical solution, a localized “survival zone,” with the appropriate water temperature, can be created in the water pool, where aquatic creatures can aggregate. Here, STAR-CCM+ was employed to simulate the three-dimensional temperature conditions of an AF in extreme weather and examine the survival zone volume. TRNSYS was used to simulate solar collectors (SCs) and a heat pump (HP) combisystem under the required heating capacity. The Taguchi method was used to optimize the geometry of the AF. In STAR-CCM+, eight parameters (distance between inlets 1 and 2, inlet heights, outlet positions, inlet velocity as fixed mass flow rate, barrier length, barrier position, barrier thickness, and barrier number) were compared. Of them, the two inlet heights, outlet positions, barrier length, and barrier position were selected according to their difference in percentage of the survival zone and set the orthogonal array for deployment in the Taguchi method. The survival zone of the AF's optimized geometry increased by 40%. In TRNSYS, three heating systems—namely boiler heating system, HP–boiler heating system, and SC-HP-boiler heating combisystem—were compared for their heating gain, contributions, payback period, and CO2 emissions. Thus, solar combisystems effective in reducing CO2 emissions are uneconomical and are not the most suitable heating system for cold streams. Nevertheless, boiler heating systems are potentially the most suitable for the optimized geometry of the AF during a cold current, particularly for instant heating. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air-source HP; Aquatic farm; Combisystem; Particle image velocimetry; Solar collector; STAR-CCM+; Taguchi method; TRNSYS","Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Geometry; Hypothermia; Investments; Solar collectors; Solar water heaters; Stars; Taguchi methods; Temperature; Velocity measurement; Air sources; Combisystem; Dimensional temperatures; Optimized geometries; Particle image velocimetries; Solar combisystems; Solar water heating; TRNSYS; Solar heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077457426

Poyang Lake and its extremely productive wetland constitute the largest lake-floodplain system of the Yangtze River basin. This study aims to use a daily water balance model in combination with a physically based hydrodynamic model to investigate the overall hydrological regime of the lake-floodplain system. Water balance analysis shows that 79.0% and 12.2% of yearly inflows are from river discharges from the upstream gauged and downstream ungauged catchments, respectively. The direct precipitation contributes around 3.0% on the lake surface, while the balance of 1.2% is sourced from floodplain runoff (0.5%) and lake's backflow (0.7%). Around 86.9% of the total lake outflow is discharged into the Yangtze River, while 1.5% evaporates for the lake water surface. Net groundwater discharge (11.6%) has greater impacts on the water balance than the net groundwater recharge (4.6%). Water balance results highlight that the catchment rivers and the associated groundwater system are important parts of Poyang Lake. In general, the catchment rivers exhibit higher flashiness during the rising and flood periods than the other periods, and the flashiness in the lake downstream and floodplains is higher than in the lake upstream regions and the main lake, respectively, demonstrating spatiotemporal variability in the flood pulse in the lake-floodplain system. This study contributes to provide more detailed information regarding hydrological components and their relative effects to decision-makers for both Poyang Lake and other similar floodplains, given proposals to cope with the climate and human interventions and the accelerating pace of water resources and water safety management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Catchment rivers; Flashiness index; Flood pulse; Floodplains; Hydrodynamic model; Water balance model","Banks (bodies of water); Catchments; Climate models; Decision making; Floods; Hydrodynamics; Information management; Lakes; Recharging (underground waters); Runoff; Wetting; Flashiness index; Flood pulse; Flood-plains; Hydrodynamic model; Water balance models; Rivers; ground water; catchment; flash flood; floodplain; hydrodynamics; hydrological regime; river discharge; runoff; water budget; wetland; Article; China; decision making; evaporation; flashiness; flooding; floodplain; hydrodynamics; lake; precipitation; priority journal; quantitative analysis; river basin; runoff model (hydrology); seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; water analysis; water and water related phenomena; water cycle; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Basin; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075895737

BTEX samples of four emission sources (coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, gasoline volatilization and solvent evaporation) and ambient air from three sampling sites (rural, urban and suburban) were collected during winter in Taiyuan, northern China. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and thermal desorption–gas chromatography–isotope ratio mass spectrometry were employed to investigate the composition characteristics and stable carbon isotopic (δ13C) analysis of BTEX, respectively. The results revealed that the δ13C value of BTEX for coal combustion, with the range of −23.8‰ to −25.2‰, was higher than that for vehicle exhaust, gasoline volatilization and solvent evaporation, ranging from −25.5‰ to −27.6‰, −28.0‰ to −30.9‰ and −27.7‰ to −32.1‰, respectively. Atmospheric BTEX concentrations were the highest at the suburban site (41.5 μg/m3) and the lowest at the rural site (27.0 μg/m3). The δ13C values of atmospheric BTEX at rural, urban and suburban sites ranged from −24.8‰ to −26.2‰ (average −25.3‰), −24.8‰ to −26.9‰ (average −26.0‰) and −23.9‰ to −25.4‰ (average −24.8‰), respectively, indicating that the suburban site was enriched in 13C relative to rural and urban sites. The B/T ratio results indicated that coal combustion was the primary source of atmospheric pollution in Taiyuan. The mean contribution of emission sources in all three sampling site were determined by adopting Isosource-based quantitative calculation. For rural, urban and suburban sites, coal combustion, as the major source, made mean contributions of 62.3%, 46.0% and 74.1%, while vehicle exhaust was responsible for 22.0%, 30.6% and 15.3%, respectively. Coal combustion and vehicle exhaust were the top two primary sources of BTEX in Taiyuan, especially coal combustion provided a half contribution to atmospheric BTEX. Therefore, implementing controls on coal combustion is crucial to reduce ambient volatile aromatic compound pollution, especially in areas with high coal consumption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmosphere; BTEX; Emission sources; Source apportionment; Stable carbon isotope","Aromatization; Carbon; Coal; Earth atmosphere; Evaporation; Gas chromatography; Gasoline; Isotopes; Mass spectrometry; Pollution; Rural areas; Toluene; Urban growth; Vehicles; BTEX; Composition characteristics; Emission sources; Isotope ratio mass spectrometry; Quantitative calculation; Source apportionment; Stable carbon isotopes; Volatile aromatic compounds; Coal combustion; aromatic compound; benzene; carbon; carbon 13; ethylbenzene; ortho xylene; toluene; atmospheric pollution; BTEX; carbon isotope; coal combustion; concentration (composition); heating; pollutant source; rural area; source apportionment; stable isotope; suburban area; volatile organic compound; volatilization; air pollution; ambient air; Article; China; combustion; evaporation; heating; isotope analysis; mass fragmentography; priority journal; rural area; suburban area; urban area; volatilization; China; Shanxi; Taiyuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080110467

Till now, very few small molecule NIR-IIb fluorophores have been reported due to the extremely rare organic NIR-IIb skeleton and a notorious aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect in aqueous solution. In this study, highly twisted NIR-II small molecule fluorophores such as HL3 (45.5° at the S0 state) with the emission wavelength extending into the NIR-IIb region were designed and synthesized using an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) strategy. HL3 dots showed a remarkable increase in fluorescence intensity with a QY of 11.7% in the NIR-II window (&gt;1000 nm) and 0.05% in the NIR-IIb region (&gt;1550 nm) in water. High-resolution in vivo imaging of the whole body, cerebral vasculature, and lymphatic drainage beyond 1550 nm was achieved using NIR-II AIE HL3 dots for the first time.

Considering that excessive prevention and control efforts affect economic development, this paper combined an empirical orthogonal function, a continuous wavelet transform, and a concentration-weighted trajectory method to study joint regional governance during key pollution periods to provide suggestions for the efficient control of PM2.5. The results from our panel of data of PM2.5 in China from 2016 to 2018 could be decomposed into two modes. In the first mode, the pollution center was in central Shaanxi Province, and the main eruption period was from November to January of the following year. As the center of this region, Xi'an should cooperate with the four cities in eastern Sichuan (Nanchong, Guangan, Bazhong, and Dazhou) to control PM2.5, since the eruption occurred in this area. Moreover, governance should last for at least two cycles, where one cycle is at least 23 days. The pollution center of the second mode was in the western part of Xinjiang. Therefore, after the prevention and control efforts during the first mode are completed, the regional city of Kashgar should continue to build a joint governance zone for PM2.5 along the Tianshan mountains in the east, focusing on prevention and control over two cycles (where one cycle is 28 days). © 2020 by the authors.

The impacts of El Niño and La Niña events are particularly critical for understanding these variations. Besides the individual El Niño and La Niña event, newly-identified El Niño and La Niña dominant cycles also add another dimension into the analysis. As the world largest food producer and importer, China has endeavored to increase its agricultural production while reducing climate risks over time. By using satellite-based indicators, ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) indices and grain yield statistics for China, the characteristics of ENSO events, as well as their relationships with crop-growing conditions and yields at different administrative levels are analyzed. The results show that the evaluation of agricultural impacts of an El Niño/La Niña event should consider both the dominant cycle in which the event occurs and the characteristics of the event itself, combined with local crop phenology. Additionally, county and prefectural level analysis shows that over the long term, in China, La Niña events tend to have net positive impacts on grain productivity compared to the effects of El Niño events.

This paper investigates the relationship between urban spatial structure and PM2.5 concentrations by drawing upon a panel dataset covering 286 Chinese cities during the 2001–2016 period. We measure two dimensions of urban spatial structure by using the LandScan High Resolution Global Population Dataset. The polycentricity-monocentricity dimension reflects to what extent population is distributed in a single center or across a number of subcenters. The concentration-dispersion dimension represents to what extent population is clustered in urban centers. By controlling for per capita GDP, population density, and the employment share of the secondary industry, our empirical results based on two-way fixed panel regression models find positive relationships between polycentricity, dispersion, and PM2.5 concentrations of Chinese cities. Other things being equal, an increase in the degrees of polycentricity and dispersion by 0.1 would lead to a rise in PM2.5 concentration by 0.1996 μg/m3 and 0.4063 μg/m3 respectively. Moreover, we find that the impact of polycentricity on PM2.5 concentrations is heterogeneous across cities. For cities with higher per capita GDP (&gt;5200 US$) or a higher employment share of the secondary industry (&gt;55.37%), a polycentric distribution of population is also expected to reduce PM2.5 concentrations. The results suggest that the planning of polycentric urban structure pursued by many Chinese local governments should be cautiously rethought. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Heterogeneity; LandScan; PM2.5 source profiles; Urban spatial structure","Air pollution; Dispersions; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Anthropogenic activity; Global population; Heterogeneity; LandScan; PM2.5 concentration; Population densities; Source profiles; Urban spatial structures; Population distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075000974

In this study, a numerical simulation model for calculating the temperature and pressure within a fracture during supercritical carbon dioxide fracturing was established based on rock mechanics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer. Moreover, the effects of impact of in-situ stress of reservoir, reservoir temperature, carbon dioxide temperature at the bottom of the well and injection rate on temperature and pressure in the fracture are analyzed based on this new model. The results show that the temperature and pressure of carbon dioxide in the fracture are constantly changing during the fracturing, due to the propagation of the fracture, which makes the temperature and pressure in the fracture unable to reach a steady state. The effect of supercritical carbon dioxide fracturing in reservoirs with higher temperature and lower in-situ stress is better, and higher injection temperatures and smaller injection rates should be chosen in order for carbon dioxide to quickly reach the supercritical state. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Fossil hydrogen; Mechanics; Pressure; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Temperature","Carbon dioxide; Fluid mechanics; Fracture; Heat transfer; Hydrogen production; Injection (oil wells); Mechanics; Pressure; Reservoirs (water); Rock mechanics; Stresses; Temperature; Injection rates; Injection temperature; Insitu stress; Reservoir temperatures; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Supercritical state; Temperature and pressures; Water consumption; Supercritical fluid extraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079048361

In recent years, P. massoniana plantations have been developed on more than 11,300,000 hm2 in southern China, but numerous problems have been observed, such as soil degradation, biodiversity reduction, and ecological functional decline. Crop tree management impacts on fine root development, which can be explained by the variations in the root orders. In this study, a 36-year-old P. massoniana plantation located in Huaying, Sichuan Province, was selected as the research field. In 2015, crop tree management was initiated, with a crop tree intensity of 150 trees per hectare. After 3 years of growth, fine roots of crop and noncrop trees were collected by the sector method with an angle of 15 degrees and a radius of 2 meters. We analyzed the morphological characteristics and biomass in different root orders, and explored their carbon and nitrogen contents. The results were as follows: (1) The specific root length (SRL), root length density (RLD), and surface root area (SRA) of the crop trees were larger than those of the noncrop trees; the SRL increased significantly from 0-0.5 m to 1-1.5 m from the stem. (2) The fine root biomass of the crop trees was significantly larger than that of the noncrop trees. The fine root biomass of the crop and the noncrop trees increased with the horizontal distance from the stem from 0-0.5mto 1-1.5 m. The morphological indexes of the noncrop trees at the distances of 1-1.5 m and 1.5-2 m were significantly different, while those of the crop trees at those distances were not. (3) The fine root C content of the crop trees was significantly higher than that of the noncrop trees and varied significantly along a vertical distribution. The fine root N content of the crop trees was significantly higher than that of the noncrop trees, and the N content of topsoil was higher than that of deeper soil. In conclusion, our results indicated that crop tree management increased the production of a large-diameter wood of P. massoniana, which might be attributed to the improvement of soil permeability and nutrient stock, and thus, the enhancement of fine root quantity and water/nutrient absorption ability. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, the spatio-temporal variations in aerosol optical depth (AOD) are compared with that in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and net primary productivity (NPP) during 2001-2017 in China using multiple remote sensing data. The correlations between them are analyzed at different scales. Overall, the AOD exhibited a northeast-to-southwest decreasing pattern in space. A national increasing trend of 0.004 year-1 and a declining trend of-0.007 year-1 of AOD are observed during 2001-2008 and 2009-2017. The direct PAR (PARdir) and diffuse PAR (PARdif) present consistent and opposite tendency with AOD during two periods, respectively. The total PAR (PARtotal) shows a similar variation pattern with PARdir. In terms of annual variation, the peaks of AOD coincide with the peaks of PARdif and the troughs of PARdir, indicating that aerosols have a significant positive impact on PARdir and a negative impact on PARdif. Furthermore, the PARdir has a stronger negative association with AOD than the positive correlation between PARdif and AOD at national and regional scales, indicating that PARdir is more sensitive to aerosol changes. The NPP has higher values in the east than in the west and exhibits a significant increasing trend of 0.035 gCm-2day-1 after 2008. The NPP has a negative correlation (-0.4-0) with AOD and PARdif and a positive correlation (0-0.4) with PARdir in most areas of China. The area covered by forests has the highest NPP-PAR correlation, indicating that NPP in forests is more sensitive to the PAR than is the NPP in grasslands and croplands. This study is beneficial for interpreting the aerosol-induced PAR impact on plant growth and for predicting plant production on haze days. © 2020 by the authors.

To improve understanding of distribution, variations, and main influence factors of air pollution in central China, long-term multiple satellite observations from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) are used to characterize particle pollution and their primary gaseous precursors, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Hubei province during 2005-2017. Unlike other regions in eastern China, particle and gaseous pollutants exhibit distinct spatial and temporal patterns in central China due to differences in emission sources and control measures. OMI SO2 of the whole Hubei region reached the highest value of ~0.2 Dobson unit (DU) in 2007 and then declined by more than 90% to near background levels. By contrast, OMI NO2 grew from ~3.2 to 5.9 x 1015 molecules cm-2 during 2005-2011 and deceased to ~3.9 x 1015 molecules cm-2 in 2017. Unlike the steadily declining SO2, variations of OMI NO2 flattened out in 2016 and increased ~0.5 x 1015 molecules cm-2 during 2017. As result, MODIS AOD at 550 nm increased from 0.55 to the peak value of 0.7 during 2005-2011 and then decreased continuously to 0.38 by 2017. MODIS AOD and OMI SO2 has a high correlation (R &gt; 0.8), indicating that annual variations of SO2 can explain most changes of AOD. The air pollution in central China has notable seasonal variations, which is heaviest in winter and light in summer. While air quality in eastern Hubei is dominated by gaseous pollution such as O3 and NOx, particle pollutants are mainly concentrated in central Hubei. The high consistency with ground measurements demonstrates that satellite observation can well capture variations of air pollution in regional scales. The increasing ozone (O3) and NO2 since 2016 suggests that more control measures should be made to reduce O3-related emissions. To improve the air quality in regional scale, it is necessary to monitor the dynamic emission sources with satellite observations at a finer resolution. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Central China; Emission control; MODIS; OMI","Air pollution; Air quality; Emission control; Fog; Molecules; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Radiometers; Satellites; Sulfur dioxide; Atmospheric pollutants; Central chinas; Ground measurements; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Ozone monitoring instruments; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal patterns; Ultraviolet spectrometers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082303066

In this correspondence, an optimal operation of HC refining system is presented using nonlinear multiobjective model predictive control strategies that aim at set-point tracking objective of pulp quality, economic objective, and specific energy (SE) consumption objective, respectively. First, a set of input and output data at different times are employed to construct the subprocess model of the state process model for the HC refining system, and then the Wiener-Type model can be obtained through combining the mechanism model of Canadian Standard Freeness and the state process model that determines their structures based on Akaike information criterion. Second, the multiobjective optimization strategy that optimizes both the set-point tracking objective of pulp quality and SE consumption is proposed simultaneously, which uses NSGA-II approach to obtain the Pareto optimal set. Furthermore, targeting at the set-point tracking objective of pulp quality, economic objective, and SE consumption objective, the sequential quadratic programming method is utilized to produce the optimal predictive controllers. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can make the HC refining system provide a better performance of set-point tracking of pulp quality when these predictive controllers are employed. In addition, while the optimal predictive controllers orienting with comprehensive economic objective and SE consumption objective, it has been shown that they have significantly reduced the energy consumption. © 2013 IEEE.","High consistency (HC) refining system; nonlinear multiobjective model predictive control (MPC); optimal operation; pulp quality; specific energy (SE) consumption","Biological systems; Controllers; Data structures; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Model predictive control; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Papermaking; Pareto principle; Predictive control systems; Production; Pulp; Quadratic programming; Refining; Biological system modeling; Load modeling; Multi-objective modeling; Optimal operation; Predictive models; Pulp qualities; Refining systems; Specific energy; Pulp refining; Controllers; Economics; Energy Conservation; Optimization; Production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030623860

The exploratory spatial data analysis results showed that the three emissions had significant agglomeration effects, and the spatial aggregation patterns of the emissions were similar to the patterns of fossil energy consumption spatial aggregation. The spatial Durbin model estimation results showed that the clean energy consumption proportion and factor allocation of energy and labour inhibited air pollution emissions.

Many studies have looked at heavy metal pollution in the context of single source-pathway-receptor relationships, however few have sought to understand pollution from a more wholistic multi-media perspective. To investigate potential risks in a more wholistic way, concentrations of six heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb) were detected in multi-media (water, sediment and riparian soil) collected from 14 sampling sites in the main stream of the Songhua River. Chemical analyses indicated that the average concentration of heavy metals in water followed: Zn &gt; Cr &gt; Pb&gt; Ni &gt; Cd, with a different trend observed in sediments and riparian soil: Zn &gt; Cr &gt; Ni &gt;Pb &gt; Cu&gt; Cd. The potential risk was evaluated using the heavy metal pollution index (HPI), Nemerow pollution index (PN), hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (CR) metrics. Results showed that all HPI values were lower than the critical level of 100 indicating that the levels of these targeted heavy metals were within drinking water safety limits. The PN indicated that both sediment (2.64) and soil (2.95) could be considered “moderately polluted”, with Cd and Zn providing the most significant contributions. A human health risk assessment suggested that the non-carcinogenic risks were within acceptable levels (HI &lt; 1), as was the cancer risk associated with dermal adsorption (CR &lt;10−6). However, the CR associated with ingestion exposure (4.58 × 10−6) exceeded the cancer risk threshold (10−6) indicative of elevated cancer incidence in exposed populations. Health-risk estimates were primarily associated with Cd in the Songhua River. Source apportionment was informed by Pearson correlation analysis coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) which indicated that Cu was mainly derived from natural (geogenic) sources; Cr and Ni were associated with industrial emissions; Pb might be derived from agricultural and transportation sources; Zn might be from industrial, agricultural activities and transportation; while Cd is likely from industrial and agricultural emissions. The source apportionment information could provide the basis for a risk-management strategy focused on reducing Cd and Zn emissions to the riverine environment. Results from this study will provide the scientific knowledge that is needed for measuring and controlling heavy metals sources and pollution characteristics, and identifying the potential cancer risk with different exposure pathways, as well as making effective environmental management policies at catchment or regional scales. © 2020 by the authors.

By integrating regulatory focus and social exchange perspectives with job crafting literature, the authors investigate how skill variety promotes employee job crafting and the moderating roles of employee's promotion focus and procedural justice climate. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted two questionnaire surveys, one with a sample of 205 employees from a variety of organizations in China, and the other one with a sample of 265 employees within 44 work groups at a state-owned enterprise in China, to examine the hypotheses. Findings: Results suggest that a high level of skill variety within a job promotes employee job crafting, that such an effect is stronger when the employee's promotion focus is high rather than low, and that procedural justice climate mitigates the negative influence of a low level of promotion focus. Originality/value: The authors' findings suggest that both self-regulatory and social exchange mechanisms play a critical role in promoting employee job crafting when individuals are engaged in jobs that entail a high level of skill variety. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Job crafting; Procedural justice climate; Promotion focus; Skill variety",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079736101

As people gradually realize the importance of the environment, low carbon has become one of the core indicators of power system evaluation, so it is particularly important to guide the coal enterprises to achieve a win-win situation of economic and environmental benefits. Combined with the carbon emission policies, this paper takes the coal supply chain network as the research object and aims to develop a comprehensive decision model for sustainable design of coal supply chain. First, this paper extracts the influencing factors of low-carbonization in coal supply chain and constructs an interpretative structural model (ISM). The results show that low-carbon green technology, low-carbon production cost, utilization level of green energy and energy efficiency are the most basic manifestations of low-carbonization of coal supply chain and interact with each other, therefore this paper builds an optimization model with the objective of minimizing the low-carbon production costs in the coal supply chain. Concurrently, this paper introduces four policies (emission cap, carbon tax, carbon trade and carbon offset) as constraint condition. Then, in the aspect of model solving, this paper combines the differential evolution (DE) strategy to mutate, cross and select the leaders generated in each iteration of the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), further increases the diversity of the salp swarm, avoids the algorithm falling into a local optimum, and proposes the salp swarm algorithm based on differential evolution (DE-SSA). Finally, this paper compares the effects of four different carbon emission policies on the optimization of coal supply chain network through empirical analysis, and finds that coal enterprises have the best emission reduction effect under the carbon trade policy. The development and implementation of this paper not only enriches the related research of efficient supply chain, but also provides scientific and quantifiable decision-making technology for coal enterprises. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission policies; Coal supply chain; Interpretative structural model; Optimization; Salp swarm algorithm based on differential evolution","Behavioral research; Carbon; Coal; Coal carbonization; Decision making; Ecodesign; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Iterative methods; Optimization; Structural optimization; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Coal supplies; Constraint conditions; Design and optimization; Differential Evolution; Economic and environmental benefits; Interpretative structural modeling; Optimization modeling; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076243345

Thus, based on the harmonious management theory, we propose a two-stage allocation model of “preliminary allocation-harmonious diagnosis and evolution” to analyze the harmonious allocation of carbon emission permits. Specifically, we integrate four principles of fairness, efficiency, sustainability, and government macrocontrol to construct an allocation index system and use the dynamic multiattribute decision-making method to obtain a preallocation scheme. Also, by establishing a directional diagnosis criterion and degree diagnosis criterion, harmonious diagnosis and evolutionary adjustment of preallocation scheme were carried out to obtain a harmonious allocation scheme with high acceptability. The allocation results of North China in 2020 indicate the following: (1) As the preallocation scheme may be difficult to be accepted by various regions, harmonious diagnosis and adjustment play an important role in the allocation of carbon emission permits. By simulating the negotiation process of each region, we obtained the allocation with high acceptability. (2) According to the allocation result, Hebei obtained the highest proportion of carbon emission quota, while Beijing and Tianjin obtained a lower proportion of carbon emission quota. (3) Compared with the allocation results of grandfather principle, Shanxi and Nei Mongol have great pressure on emission reduction, i.e., these regions should occupy a larger share in the future carbon emission trading market. This study is expected to provide a reference for the initial allocation of carbon emission permits, thus reducing conflicts and promoting the harmonious development of region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission permits; Dynamic multiattribute decision-making; Harmonious allocation; Harmonious diagnosis","Commerce; Decision making; Emission control; Carbon emission permits; Carbon emission trading; Dynamic multi-attribute decision making; Harmonious allocation; Harmonious development; Harmonious managements; Initial allocations; Negotiation process; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075372466

However, the low quality of its printed products jeopardizes its future development. Distortion, also known as warping deformation, which is caused by many factors such as inappropriate process parameters and process drifts, is one of the most common defects in the fused deposition modeling process. Rapid detection of such part distortion during the printing process is beneficial for improving the production efficiency and saving materials. In this article, a real-time part distortion monitoring method based on acoustic emission is presented. Our work is to identify distortion defects and understand the condition of the distortion area through sensing and digital signal processing techniques. In our experiments, both the acoustic emission hits and original signals were acquired during the fused deposition modeling process. Then, the acoustic emission hits were analyzed. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition was utilized to eliminate noise and extract features from the original acoustic emission signal to further analyze the acoustic emission signal in the case of part distortion. Furthermore, the root mean square of the reconstructed signals was calculated, and the prediction results are strongly correlated with the ground truth printing states. This work provides a promising method for the quality diagnosis of printing parts. © The Author(s) 2019.","acoustic emission; distortion; ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Fused deposition modeling; monitoring","Acoustic emissions; Cost effectiveness; Defects; Deposition; Digital signal processing; Distortion (waves); Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Monitoring; Acoustic emission signal; Deposition modeling; Digital signal processing techniques; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Environment friendly; Monitoring methods; Production efficiency; Warping deformations; Acoustic emission testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066874123

The experimental results show that the proposed GAASAM can effectively solve the vehicle routing problem of the proposed model, achieve better performance than the genetic algorithm, and avoid falling into a local optimal trap. The distribution routes obtained by GAASAM are with lower total distribution cost, and achieve the goal of green distribution in which energy, fuel consumption and carbon emissions are reduced at the same time.

This pilot study demonstrates an approach to derive H2S concentrations by coupling in situ and remote sensing data. Using AMOG (AutoMObile trace Gas) Surveyor, a mobile air quality and meteorology laboratory, we measured in situ concentrations of CH4, CO2, NH3, H2S, and wind at a southern California university research dairy. Emissions were 0.13, 1.93, 0.022 and 0.0064 Gg yr−1; emission factors (EF) were 422, 6333, 74, and 21 kg cow−1 yr−1, respectively, for the 306 head herd. Contributing to these strong EF were spillway emissions from a grate between the main cowshed and the waste lagoon identified in airborne remote sensing data acquired by the hyperspectral thermal infrared imager, Mako. NH3 emissions from the Chino Dairy Complex, also in southern California, were calculated from Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite data for 2008–2017 using average morning winds, yielding a flushing time of 2.7 h, and 8.9 Gg yr−1. The ratio of EF(H2S) to EF(NH3) for the research dairy from AMOG data were applied to IASI NH3 emissions to derive H2S exposure concentration maps for the Chino area, which ranged to 10–30 ppb H2S for many populated areas. Combining remote sensing with in situ concentrations of multiple emitted gases can allow derivation of emissions at the sub-facility, facility, and larger scales, providing spatial and temporal coverage that can translate into exposure estimates for use in epidemiology studies and regulation development. Furthermore, with high fidelity information at the sub-facility level we can identify best practices and opportunities to sustainably and holistically reduce husbandry emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia; Dairy; Emissions; Exposure; Hydrogen sulfide; IASI; in situ; Methane; Remote sensing; Satellite","Agriculture; Air quality; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Dairies; Gases; Hydrogen sulfide; Methane; Particulate emissions; Satellites; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Airborne remote sensing; Exposure; Exposure concentration; IASI; In-situ concentrations; Infrared atmospheric sounding interferometers; Regulation development; Thermal infrared imager; Remote sensing; ammonia; carbon dioxide; hydrogen sulfide; methane; agricultural emission; ammonia; animal husbandry; concentration (composition); dairy farming; emission inventory; estimation method; hydrogen sulfide; IASI; in situ measurement; methane; remote sensing; satellite data; air pollution; air quality; airflow; animal husbandry; Article; bovine; carbon footprint; environmental exposure; goat; greenhouse gas; kernel method; methodology; nonhuman; pilot study; priority journal; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sheep; wind speed; California; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077365894

The Los Angeles Basin (LAB) contributes to poor air quality in downwind deserts including the Mojave Desert. Few studies have investigated potential air pollution inputs to the Mojave, whose fragile ecosystem includes endangered plant and animal species. Data were collected on 19 August 2015 by a mobile air quality laboratory, AMOG (AutoMObile trace Gas) Surveyor, that observed inputs can arise from the LAB as well as the San Joaquin Valley (SJV), California. The campaign used a strong methane (CH4) plume as a tracer for the downwind fate of emissions from Bakersfield area petroleum production and also measured ozone (O3). Additional in situ concurrent airborne GHG and O3 data were collected by AJAX - Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment. Both AMOG and AJAX measure winds. Mojave Desert air quality was very poor (visibility ~4 km). Based on the winds, an additional source was inferred beyond the LAB and SJV Basins. Numerical transport modeling and analysis of aerosol lidar data collected the same day by the Cloud Profiling LiDAR onboard the Earth Research-2 stratospheric airplane demonstrated that fires in Northern California were responsible, with prevailing winds transporting air southwards along the eastern Sierra Nevada Range (Bishop Valley) to the Mojave. Whereas the southern and eastern Mojave are impacted by SJV and LAB outflow, the north Mojave generally avoids these inputs. This study shows it can be affected by even distant wildfires, which likely will increase in occurrence and intensity from climate change. Thus, regulatory efforts to reduce air quality impacts on the endangered Mojave ecosystem must include wildfires and also account for the significant differences between different regions of the Mojave. Currently, there is a paucity of studies, highlighting the critical need for field research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol optical depth; Air basin; Airborne campaign; COMEX; Fire; Flux estimation; LiDAR; Methane; Smoke; Transport; Weather regional forecast model","Aerosols; Air quality; Arid regions; Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Fires; Greenhouse gases; Laboratories; Methane; Optical radar; Petroleum industry; Remote sensing; Smoke; Weather forecasting; Wind; Aerosol optical depths; Air basins; Airborne campaign; COMEX; Flux estimation; FORECAST model; Transport; Landforms; methane; ozone; petroleum; air quality; endangered species; forecasting method; lidar; methane; model validation; numerical model; optical depth; petroleum; plume; remote sensing; satellite data; smoke; urban area; air pollution; air quality; air transportation; airborne particle; cavity ring down spectroscopy; climate change; desert; ecosystem; Mojave desert; plume dispersion; priority journal; remote sensing; wind; California; Mojave Desert; San Joaquin Valley; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078887449

However, the origin of such enhanced selectivity remains controversial. Here, we prepared two Cu-based electrodes with mixed oxidation states, namely, HQ-Cu (containing Cu, Cu2O, CuO) and AN-Cu (containing Cu, Cu(OH)2). We extracted an ultrathin specimen from the electrodes using a focused ion beam to investigate the distribution and evolution of various Cu species by electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. We found that at the steady stage of the CO2RR, the electrodes have all been reduced to Cu0, regardless of the initial states, suggesting that the high C2+ selectivities are not associated with specific oxidation states of Cu. We verified this conclusion by control experiments in which HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were pretreated to fully reduce oxides/hydroxides to Cu0, and the pretreated electrodes showed even higher C2+ selectivity compared with their unpretreated counterparts. We observed that the oxide/hydroxide crystals in HQ-Cu and AN-Cu were fragmented into nanosized irregular Cu grains under the applied negative potentials. Such a fragmentation process, which is the consequence of an oxidation-reduction cycle and does not occur in electropolished Cu, not only built an intricate network of grain boundaries but also exposed a variety of high-index facets. These two features greatly facilitated the C-C coupling, thus accounting for the enhanced C2+ selectivity. Our work demonstrates that the use of advanced characterization techniques enables investigating the structural and chemical states of electrodes in unprecedented detail to gain new insights into a widely studied system. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Copper oxides; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Electron energy levels; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron scattering; Energy dissipation; Grain boundaries; Ion beams; Oxidation; Characterization techniques; Control experiments; Cu-based electrodes; Fragmentation process; High index facets; Negative potential; Oxidation reduction cycles; Specific oxidation; Copper; carbon; carbon dioxide; copper; hydroxide; oxide; Article; controlled study; cross coupling reaction; crystal; electron energy loss spectroscopy; electron microscopy; electroreduction; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; reduction (chemistry); steady state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080102685

However, aerosol chemistry in coastal regions of eastern China with high industrial emissions remains poorly characterized. Here we present a comprehensive characterization of aerosol composition and sources near two large steel plants in a coastal city in Shandong in fall and spring using a PM2.5 time of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor. The average (±1σ) mass concentration of PM2.5 in spring 2019 (54 ± 44 μgm-3) was approximately twice that (26±23 μgm-3) in fall 2018. Aerosol composition was substantially different between the two seasons. While organics accounted for ∼ 30% of the total PM2.5 mass in both seasons, sulfate showed a considerable decrease from 28% in September to 16% in March, which was associated with a large increase in nitrate contribution from 17% to 32 %. Positive matrix factorization analysis showed that secondary organic aerosol (SOA) dominated the total OA in both seasons, accounting on average for 92% and 86 %, respectively, while the contribution of traffic-related hydrocarbon-like OA was comparable (8 %-9 %). During this study, we observed significant impacts of steel plant emissions on aerosol chemistry nearby. The results showed that aerosol particles emitted from the steel plants were overwhelmingly dominated by ammonium sulfate and/or ammonium bisulfate with the peak concentration reaching as high as 224 μgm-3. Further analysis showed similar mass ratios for NOx=CO (0.014) and NOx=SO2 (1.24) from the two different steel plants, which were largely different from those during periods in the absence of industrial plumes. Bivariate polar plot analysis also supported the dominant source region of ammonium sulfate, CO, and SO2 from the southwest steel plants. Our results might have significant implications for better quantification of industrial emissions using ammonium sulfate and the ratios of gaseous species as tracers in industrial regions and nearby in the future. © 2020 Author(s).",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; atmospheric plume; coastal zone; industrial emission; seasonal variation; traffic emission; urban area; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081664545

A cost-effective field measurement protocol to support lidar-assisted carbon monitoring programs-implementing a prototype design at six different sites in the United States. Gen. Tech. Rep. PNW-GTR-984. Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 66 p. Given the increasing interest in the use of lidar-based remote sensing to support carbon monitoring systems, including those used for measurement, reporting, and verification requirements for REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation) programs in tropical nations, there is a corresponding need for the cost-effective field measurement systems to enable model development and robust assessment of uncertainty in these programs. In this report, we describe an efficient field sampling design and measurement protocol designed to provide field-based estimates of biomass/carbon stored in trees and coarse woody materials to support complex, multilevel carbon monitoring systems using Landsat time series and airborne lidar. Airborne lidar data were collected as a strip sample (single flight lines spaced 5 km apart) at six sites in the United States (Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania/New Jersey, and South Carolina) (298 total flight lines), and about 50 field plots were established within the lidar coverage at each site. Field plots were distributed across 15 (3 cover x 5 height) strata at each site, using field protocols that were consistent with those of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program. Field measurements were collected digitally on personal tablets and uploaded daily into a database. Preliminary regression analyses indicate strong relationships between lidar metrics and tree biomass at all sites. © 2020, USDA Forest Service.

Key uncertainties were identified and the effect of future impacts on the carbon budget were assessed. The water of the shelf seas contains between 210 and 230 Tmol of carbon and absorbs between 1.3 and 3.3 Tmol from the atmosphere annually. Off-shelf transport and burial in the sediments account for 60–100 and 0–40% of carbon outputs from the NWES, respectively. Both of these fluxes remain poorly constrained by observations and resolving their magnitudes and relative importance is a key research priority. Pelagic and benthic carbon stocks are dominated by inorganic carbon. Shelf sediments contain the largest stock of carbon, with between 520 and 1600 Tmol stored in the top 0.1 m of the sea bed. Coastal habitats such as salt marshes and mud flats contain large amounts of carbon per unit area but their total carbon stocks are small compared to pelagic and benthic stocks due to their smaller spatial extent. The large pelagic stock of carbon will continue to increase due to the rising concentration of atmospheric CO2, with associated pH decrease. Pelagic carbon stocks and flows are also likely to be significantly affected by increasing acidity and temperature, and circulation changes but the net impact is uncertain. Benthic carbon stocks will be affected by increasing temperature and acidity, and decreasing oxygen concentrations, although the net impact of these interrelated changes on carbon stocks is uncertain and a major knowledge gap. The impact of bottom trawling on benthic carbon stocks is unique amongst the impacts we consider in that it is widespread and also directly manageable, although its net effect on the carbon budget is uncertain. Coastal habitats are vulnerable to sea level rise and are strongly impacted by management decisions. Local, national and regional actions have the potential to protect or enhance carbon storage, but ultimately global governance, via controls on emissions, has the greatest potential to influence the long-term fate of carbon stocks in the northwestern European continental shelf. © Copyright © 2020 Legge, Johnson, Hicks, Jickells, Diesing, Aldridge, Andrews, Artioli, Bakker, Burrows, Carr, Cripps, Felgate, Fernand, Greenwood, Hartman, Kröger, Lessin, Mahaffey, Mayor, Parker, Queirós, Shutler, Silva, Stahl, Tinker, Underwood, Van Der Molen, Wakelin, Weston and Williamson.","biogeochemistry; budget; carbon; coastal; impacts; marine; shelf",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082699069

The annulus reactor was found to reduce the temperature gradient within the diluted catalyst bed by effective cooling and thus provide experimental data at steady-state and in kinetic regime allowing for the comparison of intrinsic activity between different catalysts. The addition of Zr enhanced the overall performance of methanol synthesis. However, the CZA-Zr catalyst displayed significantly reduced CO2 conversion, possibly due to intensified water-gas shift reaction activity. The addition of Ga and Mg to CZA was found to be detrimental to the catalytic performance and is attributed to difficulties in reducibility and the increased crystalline size of copper particles. A relatively long induction period was observed for CZA-Zr sample in this study, which is attributed to the effective cooling imparted by the annulus reactor suppressing the r-WGS reaction. © 2019","Annulus reactor; Cu catalyst; Metal additive; Methanol synthesis; Oil cooling","Additives; Catalyst activity; Chemical shift; Cooling; Methanol; Petroleum additives; Synthesis gas manufacture; Zinc; Zirconium compounds; Annulus reactor; Cu-catalysts; Metal additives; Methanol synthesis; Oil cooling; Water gas shift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063329237

There is a gap, however, in our knowledge of the extent to which urban climate change mitigation efforts affect the adoption of adaptation policies. Analysing the presence of different levels of climate change mitigation efforts in European cities, while also considering local climate risks and national adaptation mandates, our results show a positive and significant correlation between mitigation and adaptation policies. This is partly a result of the perceptions and discourses linking global and local climate risks, and partly a consequence of the co-benefits of the two activities at the local level, which enable cities to piggyback on their prior mitigation efforts when adopting adaptation policies. A conceptual ‘mitigation-adaptation nexus’ governance framework is adopted to improve the current synergy versus conflict debate. Multilevel logit regression analyses of 261 European cities, controlling for both city- and country-level factors, suggest that adaptation is positively influenced in cities with mitigation action policies with monitoring systems, rather than mere mitigation commitments. We also find that national mandates drive local adoption of adaptation policies. Key policy insights The mitigation-adaptation nexus approach enables cities to regard climate change policies not as single-dimensional, but as comprehensive capacity building efforts. Cities committed to actual progress on mitigation policy (i.e. with a monitoring system in place) are more likely to adopt adaptation policies. Cities are driven to join municipal adaptation networks on the basis of their established mitigation policies rather than local climate risk profiles. National adaptation mandates have an important influence on local climate planning. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","European cities; local climate risk; mitigation-adaptation nexus; urban climate policy","climate change; environmental policy; urban climate; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082324432

However, few studies have operationalized atmospheric cooperation steps and theorized the underlying logic of asymmetry as a barrier to further cooperation. Given that air quality degradation and its impact on neighboring countries have worsened around the world, it is imperative to identify a framework with which to analyze the degree of transboundary cooperation. This study aims to provide a general explanation of barriers to transboundary air pollution cooperation and test the explanation empirically through a case study of China and South Korea. Our findings suggest that asymmetric barriers—in state capacity, economic interests, domestic pressures, and international pressure—impede the process of cooperation in atmospheric politics.

Emissions of ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), greenhouse gases (GHGs), and odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have a detrimental effect on the environment, climate, and quality of life in rural communities. We are building on previous research to bring advanced oxidation technologies from the lab to the farm. To date, we have shown that ultraviolet A (UV-A) has the potential to mitigate selected odorous gases and GHGs in the context of swine production. Much less research on emissions mitigation has been conducted in the context of poultry production. Thus, the study objective was to investigate whether the UV-A can mitigate NH3, H2S, GHGs, and O3 in the simulated poultry barn environment. The effects of several variables were tested: the presence of photocatalyst, relative humidity, treatment time, and dust accumulation under two different light intensities (facilitated with fluorescent and light-emitting diode, LED, lamps). The results provide evidence that photocatalysis with TiO2 coating and UV-A light can reduce gas concentrations of NH3, CO2, N2O, and O3, without a significant effect on H2S and CH4. The particular % reduction depends on the presence of photocatalysts, relative humidity (RH), light type (intensity), treatment time, and dust accumulation on the photocatalyst surface. In the case of NH3, the reduction varied from 2.6-18.7% and was affected by RH and light intensity. The % reduction of NH3 was the highest at 12% RH and increased with treatment time and light intensity. The % reduction of NH3 decreased with the accumulation of poultry dust. The % reduction for H2S had no statistical difference under any experimental conditions. The proposed treatment of NH3 and H2S was evaluated for a potential impact on important ambient air quality parameters, the possibility of simultaneously mitigating or generating GHGs. There was no statistically significant change in CH4 concentrations under any experimental conditions. CO2 was reduced at 3.8%-4.4%. N2O and O3 concentrations were reduced by both direct photolysis and photocatalysis, with the latter having greater % reductions. As much as 6.9-12.2% of the statistically-significant mitigation of N2O was observed. The % reduction for O3 ranged from 12.4-48.4%. The results warrant scaling up to a pilot-scale where the technology could be evaluated with economic analyses. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Air quality; Emissions; LED UV; Livestock; Odor; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Poultry; Titanium dioxide","Air pollution; Air quality; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Dust; Economic analysis; Farm buildings; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen sulfide; Odors; Particulate emissions; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Poultry; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Sustainable development; Titanium dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Advanced oxidation technology; Ambient air quality; Direct photolysis; Emissions mitigation; Experimental conditions; Livestock; Poultry production; Statistical differences; Greenhouse gases; agricultural emission; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; catalysis; greenhouse gas; hydrogen sulfide; odor; ozone; photochemistry; pollutant removal; poultry; titanium; ultraviolet A radiation; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082309155

With a high penetration of DERs on primary circuits (feeders), utility substation communication, automation, and control must adopt to this new paradigm. In principle, utility substations can transition to and operate the feeder circuits in an islanded mode, effectively as Distribution Feeder Microgrids. This creates the need for research to address the challenges associated with integrating and managing significant deployment of DERs on circuits served by distribution substations. In response, this study addresses substation control to manage circuits emanating from utility substations as a microgrid. To this end, a model for substation automatic control using a Generic Microgrid Controller compliant with the IEEE 2030.7 standard was developed, and the role and impact of substation control to improve energy management, increase renewable penetration, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated. The detailed digital simulation model developed encompassed two 12 kV distribution circuits emanating from a utility distribution substation. Individual homes were modeled and results verified using field data collected from a previous study. Various scenarios were simulated in order to determine PV hosting capability of the circuits equipped with a controller at the substation and with three energy storage configurations: (1) A residential energy storage unit (RESU) where all customers own a battery energy storage behind the meter, (2) a community energy storage (CES) unit where a utility-owned battery energy storage is deployed near each transformer, and (3) a circuit battery where a relatively large battery is deployed at the substation serving the entire feeder microgrid. Results show that substation automation and control can increase renewable penetration and reduce emissions without any necessary upgrades to the grid infrastructure. Moreover, the CES configuration was found to be a more economic approach for achieving high PV penetration and GHG reduction than residential storage, achieving a 660 mTCO2eq reduction per MWh of installed energy storage and overall 32% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Controller; Distributed energy resources; Distribution management; Feeder microgrid; GHG reduction; Substation automation","Automation; Controllers; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Electric network analysis; Electric substations; Energy resources; Feeding; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution management; GHG reductions; Micro grid; Substation automation; Battery storage; automation; energy storage; greenhouse gas; photovoltaic system; power plant; reduction; residential energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076830334

However, source emissions associated with the PM2.5 disparity have not been well understood. In this study, we found 2.54 μg/m3 (40.9%, p &lt; 0.0001) higher PM2.5 concentration, on average, in more vulnerable (MV) communities than in less vulnerable (LV) communities in California for the period 2012–2014. Multiple linear regression models were employed to quantify the contributions of on- and off-road vehicles and point source emissions to the PM2.5 disparity between MV and LV communities while adjusting for local meteorology and site-specific characteristics. Controlling for on-road vehicular emissions associated with PM2.5 reduced the spatial PM2.5 disparity the most between MV and LV communities down to 1.05 μg/m3 (p = 0.0105), followed by off-road vehicular emissions (1.75 μg/m3, p &lt; 0.0001) and PM2.5 point source emissions (2.17 μg/m3, p &lt; 0.0001). The comparison of the full (including 3 emission predictors together) and reduced (including 2 emission predictors) models also demonstrated the strongest association of on-road vehicular emissions with the observed PM2.5 disparity. The largest contribution of on-road vehicular emissions to PM2.5 disparity seems to be attributable to disproportionately higher road density, especially for limited access roads such as Interstate highways (a factor of 1.76–2.39) and higher traffic volume (a factor of 1.62) in MV communities. These findings suggest that continuing efforts to reduce on-road traffic emissions and consider the spatial relation between MV communities and high-traffic roadways may be beneficial to alleviate potential PM2.5 health risks, particularly in MV communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Disparity; Environmental justice; Exposure; PM2.5; Source","Health risks; Highway engineering; Linear regression; Off road vehicles; Roads and streets; Disparity; Environmental justice; Exposure; PM2.5; Source; Road vehicles; emission control; environmental justice; exhaust emission; meteorology; particulate matter; point source pollution; pollution exposure; road traffic; all-terrain vehicle; article; California; controlled study; health hazard; highway; justice; meteorology; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079424097

For this study, four kerogen samples (type II) from the Bakken Formation were selected on the basis of the differences in their thermal maturity as well as representing the pre-oil and oil window stages as measured through organic petrology and bulk geochemical screening of the samples using programmed pyrolysis. Later, organic matter was extracted from selected aliquots for chemical spectroscopy. Results documented a systematic structural change in these four samples, where the ratio of CH3/CH2 increased when the maturity increases, along with the presence of a shorter aliphatic chain length. Furthermore, the aromatic carbon structure becomes more abundant in higher maturities and oil window stages quantified by 13C NMR, XPS, and FTIR. Also, the rate of increase in aromaticity demonstrates a considerable rift between the pre-oil window and oil window stages, as verified through bulk geochemical screening of the samples with Rock-Eval 6 pyrolysis hydrogen index. Notably, it is found that kerogen maturation causes the relatively bulky oxygen-related carbon compounds to reduce at the early stages of maturation (pre-oil window), followed by the concentration of such compounds at higher maturity stages. Next, the ratio of carbonyl/carboxyl functional groups to aromatic carbon shows an increase in the oil window stage, while a reduction of sulfur in higher maturities was detected mainly in the SOx forms. Finally, the nitrogen content of the samples is reported in a variety of forms, which varied regardless of the thermal maturation. It is concluded that the structural and chemical changes that occur in the organic matter involve defunctionalization of heteroatom functional groups, coupled with an increase in cross-linked carbon in the residual remaining kerogen. © 2020 American Chemical Society",,"Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Biogeochemistry; Crosslinking; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Kerogen; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Oil shale; Photoelectrons; Photons; Pyrolysis; Screening; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Amorphous organic matters; Chemical spectroscopies; Defunctionalizations; Fourier transform infra reds; Fourier transform infrared; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Structural evolution; Thermal maturation; Nuclear magnetic resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085558987

The response of permafrost regions to anthropogenic climate change remains uncertain, in part because of a lack of information on their response to past changes in global climate. Here we test the use of stalagmites from two caves in Siberia as a novel, precisely dated, and highly localised archive of past permafrost carbon cycle dynamics. Stalagmite growth at these sites is controlled by the presence/absence of permafrost above the cave over glacial-interglacial time scales. We target the transition layer between two subsequent growth phases (interglacials) and the interval directly following growth resumption after the last glacial in three stalagmites, as this is where a geochemical imprint of thaw-related processes in the frozen zone between surface and cave would be recorded. We apply a multi-proxy approach including carbon isotopes (δ13C and 14C) and trace element concentrations, combined with petrographic analyses and high-resolution U-Th chronology. Our dataset indicates complex growth patterns and possible intervals of microbial colonisation of the stalagmite surface in the transition layers. High-resolution U-Th ages confirm that the transition layer is not a single, long growth hiatus, but rather a period of extremely slow or episodic growth phases, possibly during “skipped” interglacials. However, we find no conclusive evidence for a geochemical signature related to permafrost degradation and related local carbon cycle dynamics, which might be related to insufficient sensitivity of the archive for high-frequency processes and/or insufficient measurement resolution. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycle; Permafrost; Radiocarbon; Siberia; Stalagmite/speleothem; Trace elements; U-Th dating","carbon cycle; glacial-interglacial cycle; hiatus; paleoenvironment; permafrost; radiocarbon dating; reconstruction; speleothem; stalagmite; trace element; uranium series dating; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075790273

Methane production requires adapted microbial communities (“inoculum”) to be present in the manure. Complete removal of liquid dairy manure (thus removing all inoculum) from storage tanks in the spring has been shown to significantly reduce CH4 emissions over the following warm season. This study examined whether the same mitigation effect would occur after fall removal of liquid dairy manure. Emissions of CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O), ammonia (NH3), and CO2 were measured from six 11.88-m3 tanks equipped with flow-through chambers. There were three inoculated controls (20% inoculum) and three uninoculated treatments, where inoculum was completely removed in the fall/winter (0% inoculum). Direct N2O and NH3 (indirect N2O) were minor contributors to the total GHG budget, contributing &lt;2% on a CO2 equivalent (CO2e) basis. Removal of inoculum led to a 34% decrease in total emissions on a CO2e basis and to a 29% decrease in the CH4 conversion factor compared with the inoculated control (0.37 vs. 0.52; p =.01). Overall, removing inoculum in the fall reduced CH4 emissions from manure storage tanks; however, fall inoculum removal was less effective than in a previous study where inoculum was removed in the spring. The timing of inoculum removal may affect the efficiency of this CH4 mitigation strategy. However, this method may be impractical for larger manure storage tanks. Further study is required to overcome challenges of time-sensitive, complete inoculum removal from farm-scale storage tanks. © 2020 The Authors.

Here, we explore the impacts on reserve network cost and configuration associated with planning for climate change in the USA using networks that prioritize areas projected to be climatically suitable for 1460 species both today and into the future, climatic refugia and areas likely to facilitate climate-driven species movements. For 14% of the species, networks of sites selected solely to protect areas currently climatically suitable failed to provide climatically suitable habitat in the future. Protecting sites climatically suitable for species today and in the future significantly changed the distribution of priority sites across the USA-increasing relative protection in the northeast, northwest and central USA. Protecting areas projected to retain their climatic suitability for species cost 59% more than solely protecting currently suitable areas. Including all climatic refugia and 20% of areas that facilitate climate-driven movements increased the cost by another 18%. Our results indicate that protecting some types of climatic refugia may be a relatively inexpensive adaptation strategy. Moreover, although addressing climate change in conservation plans will have significant implications for the configuration of networks, the increased cost of doing so may be relatively modest. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Climate change; Connectivity; Conservation planning; Protected areas; Refugia","biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; connectivity; conservation planning; habitat selection; movement; prioritization; protected area; refugium; strategic approach; United States; animal dispersal; biodiversity; climate change; economics; environmental protection; plant dispersal; procedures; recreational park; refugium; United States; Animal Distribution; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Parks, Recreational; Plant Dispersal; Refugium; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078325272

Their initialization remains challenging as partitioning of SOM into different hypothetical pools is intrinsically linked to model assumptions. Diffuse reflectance mid-infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) provides information on SOM quality and could yield a measurable pool-partitioning proxy for SOM. This study tested DRIFTS-derived SOM pool partitioning using the Daisy model. The DRIFTS stability index (DSI) of bulk soil samples was defined as the ratio of the area below the aliphatic absorption band (2930 cm-1) to the area below the aromatic-carboxylate absorption band (1620 cm-1). For pool partitioning, the DSI (2930 cm-1 = 1620 cm-1) was set equal to the ratio of fast-cycling = slow-cycling SOM. Performance was tested by simulating long-term bare fallow plots from the Bad Lauchstädt extreme farmyard manure experiment in Germany (Chernozem, 25 years), the Ultuna continuous soil organic matter field experiment in Sweden (Cambisol, 50 years), and 7 year duration bare fallow plots from the Kraichgau and Swabian Jura regions in southwest Germany (Luvisols). All experiments were at sites that were agricultural fields for centuries before fallow establishment, so classical theory would suggest that a steady state can be assumed for initializing SOM pools. Hence, steady-state and DSI initializations were compared, using two published parameter sets that differed in turnover rates and humification efficiency. Initialization using the DSI significantly reduced Daisy model error for total soil organic carbon and microbial carbon in cases where assuming a steady state had poor model performance. This was irrespective of the parameter set, but faster turnover performed better for all sites except for Bad Lauchstädt. These results suggest that soils, although under long-term agricultural use, were not necessarily at a steady state. In a next step, Bayesian-calibrationinferred best-fitting turnover rates for Daisy using the DSI were evaluated for each individual site or for all sites combined. Two approaches significantly reduced parameter uncertainty and equifinality in Bayesian calibrations: (1) adding physicochemical meaning with the DSI (for humification efficiency and slow SOM turnover) and (2) combining all sites (for all parameters). Individual-site-derived turnover rates were strongly site specific. The Bayesian calibration combining all sites suggested a potential for rapid SOM loss with 95 % credibility intervals for the slow SOM pools' halflife being 278 to 1095 years (highest probability density at 426 years). The credibility intervals of this study were consistent with several recently published Bayesian calibrations of similar two-pool SOM models, i.e., with turnover rates being faster than earlier model calibrations suggested; hence they likely underestimated potential SOM losses. © Author(s) 2020.",,"adsorption; aromatic hydrocarbon; Bayesian analysis; calibration; fallow; humification; physicochemical property; soil organic matter; uncertainty analysis; Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany; Kraichgau; Swabian Alb; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082433335

Thus, budget state metrics can provide important information on a reef's growth potential and on the capacity of reefs to sustain key geo-ecological services such as habitat provision and coastal protection. Whilst various approaches for estimating carbonate budgets exist, census-based methods have gained recent interest because they quantify the contribution of different functional groups and taxa, and allow assessments of the links between changing reef ecology and budget states. However, the present paucity of supporting data on growth and erosion rates for the majority of coral species and reef-associated taxa represents a constraint on these budget estimates and limits meaningful between-site comparisons. In light of the growing interest in using carbonate budgets as a functional reef “health” assessment tool, this review thus considers our current state of knowledge regarding the geographic coverage of existing reef budget states and the availability of relevant supporting data. We use this to highlight current knowledge gaps, future challenges, and opportunities that emerging techniques may offer.

In contrast, the No. 1 porphyry Cu–Au deposit in the Xiongcun district (Tibet, China) has abundant pyrrhotite, reduced fluids (CH4 ≫ CO2), and a relative lack of highly oxidized minerals, which are indicative of low fO2 conditions. Scanning electron microscopy, fluid inclusion, C–H–O–He–Ar isotopes, and whole-rock organic carbon contents and isotope analysis were used to constrain the evolution of ore-forming fluid, the origin of CH4 and metal deposition mechanisms for the No. 1 deposit. The He–Ar isotopic compositions (3He/4He = 0.11–0.96 Ra, 40Ar/36Ar = 418.7–2920.2) suggest that the ore-forming fluids predominantly derived from crust source with minor mantle input. The H–O isotopic analysis results (δ18OH2O = −1.8 to +5.2‰, δD = −106 to −89.9‰) indicate that the ore-forming fluids were derived from a magmatic source that mixed with some meteoric waters. The element compositions of zircons and fluid/melt inclusions from the mineralized Middle Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry reveal that the primary magma was characterized by high log fO2 (&gt;NNO) conditions. The quartz diorite porphyry intruded into the carbon-bearing wall rocks produced abundant CH4 by thermal decomposition of organic matter (δ13CCH4 = −26.3 to −28.5‰), which changed the redox state of the porphyry copper system from oxidized to reduced condition.

The purpose of this paper was to evaluate different options for a progressive city to reach carbon neutrality in energy prior to the surrounding system. The study followed the C40 Cities definition of a carbon-neutral city and used the City of Vantaa in Finland as a progressive case aiming for carbon neutrality by 2030, five years before the national target for carbon neutrality. The study mapped the carbon neutrality process based on City documents and national statistics, and validated it through process-owner interviews. It was identified that most of the measures in the carbon neutrality process were actually outside the jurisdiction of the City, which outsources the responsibility for the majority of carbon neutrality actions to either private properties or national actors with broader boundaries. The only major measure in the City's direct control was the removal of carbon emissions from municipal district heat production, which potentially represent 30% of the City's reported carbon emissions and 58% of its energy-related carbon emissions. Interestingly, the City owns electricity production capacity within and beyond the city borders, but it doesn't allocate it for itself. Allocation would significantly increase the control over the City's own actions regarding carbon neutrality. Thus, it is proposed that cities aiming for carbon neutrality should promote and advance allocable carbon-free energy production, regardless of geographical location, as one of the central methods of achieving carbon neutrality. © 2020 by the authors.","C40 Cities; Carbon neutral cities; GHG Protocol; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainable built environment","carbon emission; electricity; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; sustainability; sustainable development; urban area; Finland; Uusimaa; Vantaa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082804687

One of the earliest changes was the introduction of new plant and animal foods and culinary traditions. This study presents the first archaeological reconstruction of indigenous diets and foodways in the Caribbean spanning the historical divide of 1492. We use multiple isotope datasets to reconstruct these diets and investigate the potential relationships between dietary and mobility patterns at multiple scales. Dietary patterns are assessed by isotope analyses of different skeletal elements from the archaeological skeletal population of El Chorro de Maíta, Cuba. This approach integrates carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of bone and dentine collagen with carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of bone and enamel apatite. The isotope results document extreme intrapopulation dietary heterogeneity but few systematic differences in diet between demographic/social groups. Comparisons with published isotope data from other precolonial and colonial period populations in the Caribbean indicate distinct dietary and subsistence practices at El Chorro de Maíta. The majority of the local population consumed more animal protein resources than other indigenous populations in the Caribbean, and their overall dietary patterns are more similar to colonial period enslaved populations than to indigenous ones.

Five global gridded sea surface temperature products were evaluated with independent in situ SST data of the Yellow Sea (YS) from 2010 to 2013 and the sources of SST error were identified. On average, SST from the gridded optimally interpolated level 4 (L4) datasets had a root mean square difference (RMSD) of less than 1 °C compared to the in situ observation data of the YS. However, the RMSD was relatively high (2.3 °C) in the shallow coastal region in June and July and this RMSD was mostly attributed to the large warm bias (>2 °C). The level 3 (L3) SST data were frequently missing in early summer because of frequent sea fog formation and a strong (>1.2 °C/12 km) spatial temperature gradient across the tidal mixing front in the eastern YS. The missing data were optimally interpolated from the SST observation in offhore warm water and warm biased SST climatology in the region. To fundamentally improve the accuracy of the L4 gridded SST data, it is necessary to increase the number of SST observation data in the tidally well mixed region. As an interim solution to the warm bias in the gridded SST datasets in the eastern YS, the SST climatology for the optimal interpolation can be improved based on long-term in situ observation data. To reduce the warm bias in the gridded SST products, two bias correction methods were suggested and compared. Bias correction methods using a simple analytical function and using climatological observation data reduced the RMSD by 19-29% and 37-49%, respectively, in June. © 2020 by the authors.","Bias correction; Evaluation; Global gridded dataset; Sea surface temperature; Validation; Yellow Sea","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Ships; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Bias correction; Evaluation; Global gridded dataset; Sea surface temperature (SST); Validation; Yellow sea; Oceanography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081913569

The analysis was conducted for NSAs operating within ten major emitting economies that together accounted for roughly two-thirds of global GHG emissions in 2016. Our assessment includes 79 regions (e.g. subnational states and provinces), approximately 6,000 cities, and nearly 1,600 companies with a net emissions coverage of 8.1 GtCO2e/year, or a quarter of the ten economies’ total GHG emissions in 2016. The analysis reflects a proposed methodology to aggregate commitments from different subnational (i.e. regional and city government) and non-state (i.e. business) actors, accounting for overlaps. If individual commitments by NSAs in the ten high-emitting economies studied are fully implemented and do not change the pace of action elsewhere, projected GHG emissions in 2030 for the ten economies would be 1.2–2.0 GtCO2e/year or 3.8%–5.5% lower compared to scenario projections for current national policies (31.6–36.8 GtCO2e/year). On a country level, we find that the full implementation of these individual commitments alone could result in the European Union and Japan overachieving their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), while India could further overachieve its unconditional NDC target. In the United States, where the national government has rolled back climate policies, NSAs could become a potential driving force for climate action. Key policy insights Full implementation of reported and quantifiable individual commitments by regions, cities and businesses (NSAs) in ten major economies could reduce emissions by 3.8%–5.5% in 2030 below current national policies scenario projections. National governments’ mitigation targets could be more ambitious if they would take NSA commitments into account. With full implementation of such action, the European Union and Japan would overachieve their NDC targets. For the United States such action could help meeting its original 2025 NDC target in spite of rollbacks in national climate policies. The full universe of NSA climate action expands far beyond the subset of commitments analysed in this study; NSAs could become a strong driving force for enhanced action towards the Paris climate goals. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

This review focuses specifically on the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO), an important ""building block"" for the chemicals industry. CO2 electrolysis technologies offer potentially carbon-neutral routes for the production of specialty and commodity chemicals. Many different technologies are actively being pursued. Electrochemical CO2 reduction from aqueous solutions stems from the success of alkaline and polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers for water electrolysis and uses performance metrics established within the field of aqueous electrochemistry. High-temperature CO2 electrolysis systems rely heavily on experience gained from developing molten carbonate and solid oxide fuel cells, where device performance is evaluated using very different parameters, commonly employed in solid-state electrochemistry. In this review, state-of-the-art low-temperature, molten carbonate, and solid oxide electrolyzers for the production of CO are reviewed, followed by a direct comparison of the three technologies using some of the most common figures of merit from each field. Based on the comparison, high-temperature electrolysis of CO2 in solid oxide electrolysis cells seems to be a particularly attractive method for electrochemical CO production, owing to its high efficiency and proven durability, even at commercially relevant current densities. © 2020 The Author(s).

Previous work in degraded lands has focused on afforestation and soil conservation, which has obvious limitations in terms of generality and scope of application for production systems in climate change scenario. A key challenge in degraded lands is to develop climate smart systems those are resilient to extreme weather and have high potential for carbon sequestration. Therefore, we examined the effectiveness of Sapota trees (Achras zapota) and regional crops/grasses (annuals) combination (agroforestry) with soil water conservation (SWC) for enhancing climate resilience and carbon sequestration of agro ecosystem in semi-arid degraded lands of Western India. The experiment was conducted for eight years (2010–2017) in four systems: (i) Sapota + Crops on terrace (SCTe) (ii) Sapota on terrace (STe); (iii) Sapota and Trenches on slope (STrS); and (iv) Sole Sapota on slope (SS) and their performance was assessed during different annual rainfall events (Normal, Heavy, High, Abnormal, Drought). Our findings explained that, among all the annual rainfall events, drought resulted in the mortality of Sapota tree and reduction in biomass production of the grasses, while, terrace and trench measures reduced the tree mortality and enhanced the grass biomass production. Plant population of Cowpea and Castor crops were recorded significantly higher during normal rainfall, but a decline was observed during rest of the rainfall events. Height and diameter growth increment in Sapota was recorded higher during normal rainfall compared to the drought period. SWC measure such as terraces and trench contributed higher growth increment and biomass production in Sapota tree, compared to sole slope, under all the rainfall conditions. Rainfall variability also affected the Cowpea and Caster and their yield was recorded maximum during normal rainfall and minimum during drought period, respectively. Moreover, SWC measure such as terrace and trench enhanced fruit yield of Sapota during the drought period. These measures also improved carbon stock and carbon sequestration in Sapota and grasses during the eight years. Overall, carbon stock and carbon sequestration in plants and soil were observed greater in uncultivated terrace (STe), followed by cultivated terrace (SCTe) and trench (STr) systems, respectively, while, overall, their lower value was observed in slope system (SS). The results suggested that tree and annuals combination (agroforestry) along with soil water conservation measures enhanced agro ecosystem resilience to extreme weather and improved the carbon stock and sequestration potential. Therefore, soil and water conservation should be considered, along with only those trees and annuals, which have the capability to enhance climate resilience and potential of high carbon sequestration, in semi-arid climate change vulnerable degraded ravine landscape. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforestry; Carbon stock; Climate change; Extreme weather; Soil-water conservation","afforestation; agricultural ecosystem; agroforestry; carbon sequestration; climate change; diameter; ecosystem resilience; extreme event; plantation forestry; India; Manilkara zapota; Poaceae; Sapota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076688245

In addition to an electron-donating Cp* ligand (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), the catalyst featured a proton-responsive pyridyl-benzimidazole-based N,N-bidentate ligand. Owing to the presence of a relatively electron-rich Co center, the reduced Co(I)-state was made prone to activate the electrophilic carbon center of CO2. At the same time, the proton-responsive benzimidazole scaffold was susceptible to facilitate proton-transfer during the subsequent reduction of CO2. The above factors rendered the present catalyst active toward producing CO as the major product over the other potential 2e/2H+ reduced product HCOOH, in contrast to the only known similar half-sandwich CpCo(III)-based CO2-reduction catalysts which produced HCOOH selectively. The system exhibited a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of about 70% while the overpotential for CO production was found to be 0.78 V, as determined by controlled-potential electrolysis. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the past few decades, considerable progress has been made in estimating global primary production at high spatial and temporal scales by combining in situ measurements of primary production with remote-sensing observations of phytoplankton biomass. One of the major challenges in this approach lies in the assignment of the appropriate model parameters that define the photosynthetic response of phytoplankton to the light field. In the present study, a global database of in situ measurements of photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-I) parameters and a 20-year record of climate quality satellite observations were used to assess global primary production and its variability with seasons and locations as well as between years. In addition, the sensitivity of the computed primary production to potential changes in the photosynthetic response of phytoplankton cells under changing environmental conditions was investigated. Global annual primary production varied from 38.8 to 42.1 Gt C yr-1 over the period of 1998-2018. Inter-annual changes in global primary production did not follow a linear trend, and regional differences in the magnitude and direction of change in primary production were observed. Trends in primary production followed directly from changes in chlorophyll-a and were related to changes in the physico-chemical conditions of the water column due to inter-annual and multidecadal climate oscillations. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis in which P-I parameters were adjusted by ±1 standard deviation showed the importance of accurately assigning photosynthetic parameters in global and regional calculations of primary production. The assimilation number of the P-I curve showed strong relationships with environmental variables such as temperature and had a practically one-to-one relationship with the magnitude of change in primary production. In the future, such empirical relationships could potentially be used for a more dynamic assignment of photosynthetic rates in the estimation of global primary production. Relationships between the initial slope of the P-I curve and environmental variables were more elusive. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Ocean-colour remote-sensing; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Primary production","Marine biology; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Environmental conditions; Environmental variables; Global primary productions; Ocean colour remote sensing; Photosynthetic parameters; Photosynthetic response; Primary production; Spatial and temporal scale; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081937424

We conducted a comprehensive observation campaign at an Olympic Forest Park site and a surrounding building roof site from 2011 to 2012, with half-hour time step details, including observations of meteorological conditions, radiation and surface heat fluxes. We attempted to find out the effects of changes in the surface radiation and energy balance due to the underlying surface structure and used material by statistical analysis. As expected, besides regular heat fluxes exchange, we also observed larger (by 20.35 W/m2) sensible heat fluxes in the park site than in the building roof during winter. We found the horizontal advection disrupts the local energy balance and modifies the near surface air temperature. Specifically, horizontal advection bringing in external energy would reduce the difference of local near surface temperature between the park and the building roof and weaken the cooling effect of the park. The relationship between urban land cover and its structure and urban surface heat fluxes can be analyzed and discussed, which can provide some practical evidence for future urban construction planning and residents' health. © 2019","Building; Observation; Park; Surface radiation; Turbulent heat fluxes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074832280

During the last decades a Trombe wall is the most popular system among other passive heat supply systems. Solar radiation intensity is the main factor, which has the huge impact on the thermal effectiveness of a Trombe wall. Making a decision regarding Trombe wall application in a heat supply system depends on the correct forecasting of solar radiation intensity on the surface during the heating period. This article contains the brief calculation for forecasting of solar radiation intensity on a Trombe wall surface. The main innovations in the calculation under consideration are taking into account of clouds impact, as well as determination of solar radiation intensity on a horizontal surface, if there are no values for the set city in NASA data bases. The calculation results has showed, that in case of Harbin climatic conditions a Trombe wall can allow to provide 32% of required amount of heat energy in the coldest month. Annual savings of heat energy are approximately 61%. Thus, a Trombe wall, as an additional heat source, is a reasonable option for the heat supply system in the set climatic conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082484706

During RRV epidemics in the State of Victoria (such as 2010/11 and 2016/17) notifications can account for up to 30% of national RRV notifications. However, little is known about factors which can forecast RRV transmission in Victoria. We aimed to understand factors associated with RRV transmission in epidemiologically important regions of Victoria and establish an early warning forecast system. We developed negative binomial regression models to forecast human RRV notifications across 11 Local Government Areas (LGAs) using climatic, environmental, and oceanographic variables. Data were collected from July 2008 to June 2018. Data from July 2008 to June 2012 were used as a training data set, while July 2012 to June 2018 were used as a testing data set. Evapotranspiration and precipitation were found to be common factors for forecasting RRV notifications across sites. Several site-specific factors were also important in forecasting RRV notifications which varied between LGA. From the 11 LGAs examined, nine experienced an outbreak in 2011/12 of which the models for these sites were a good fit. All 11 LGAs experienced an outbreak in 2016/17, however only six LGAs could predict the outbreak using the same model. We document similarities and differences in factors useful for forecasting RRV notifications across Victoria and demonstrate that readily available and inexpensive climate and environmental data can be used to predict epidemic periods in some areas. Furthermore, we highlight in certain regions the complexity of RRV transmission where additional epidemiological information is needed to accurately predict RRV activity.

There is much scientific evidence that measures to reduce these pollutants do improve air quality but, at the same time, contribute to the acceleration of global warming, because they result in removing the cooling effect of these gases. Until now climate change and air quality regulations have been discussed independently. This work tries to assess the effect of policies to improve air quality on climate change, and vice versa.

So, involving both the bifurcation theory and the control theory into the research concerning regulator mechanisms of local climate evolution can give interesting results. For example, five years ago so-called HDS-hypothesis was proposed, in accordance with which local climate dynamics is determined by natural competition between the amplitude quantization (restricted by the temperature Hysteresis) and the time quantization (caused by the Double Synchronization). The conceptual model of local climate dynamics from this hypothesis (so-called HDS-model) first provided building bifurcation diagrams by processing the data of meteorological observations and also explained the phenomenon of the interannual variability from the bifurcation consequences. Here we discuss the HDS-hypothesis in order to find a way to soften the problem known within the limits of the traditional climatology, namely: how to research evolution of local climate dynamics under the essential scarcity of the data necessary to analysis. We use the electronic setup, mathematical model of which is equivalent to the HDS-model. We focus on complex behaviors when fast alternations of averaged meteorological variables (temperature, pressure, precipitation, and so on) can occur, which are not supposed to consider in the context of the traditional hypothesis on local climate dynamics. We compare the dynamics evolution made by the mathematical modeling with the observations made for both electronic and natural real systems. From the control theory, these results show striking similarity between the HDS-dynamics and local climate dynamics; from the climate theory, these results continue the novel interdisciplinary exploring in the local dynamics evolution. © 2020 IEEE.","automatic test equipment; bifurcation; design for experiments; energy conversion; global warming; hysteresis; land surface temperature; nonlinear dynamical systems; pulse modulation; signal reconstruction","Bifurcation (mathematics); Control theory; Data handling; Dynamics; Solar energy; Amplitude quantization; Bifurcation diagram; Bifurcation theory; Experimental testing; Interannual variability; Meteorological observation; Meteorological variables; Temperature hysteresis; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083981843

How durable or ephemeral will existing urban geographies prove in the face of societal devaluations and destruction associated with climate change? Will breaks in and with existing urban forms be suffered through climate change impacts, or waged proactively in the name of deep decarbonization? Dystopian climate imaginaries present such material ruptures, mass stranding of real estate assets, and ‘premature death’ as an existential urban crisis. I maintain here that they are, rather, business as usual for urban capitalism, and its own longer-unfolding crisis. Property developers and appraisers have frequently truncated the lifetime of urban built environments, in how they have represented buildings and their long-term value—and non-value—and in how these representations have become material fact. I consider some bodies of critical urban scholarship necessary to exploring such processes and their climate significance, an important task for City going forward. I argue that in contexts like the United States, this charge demands creative engagements between cultural studies and political economy. I consider several relevant discussions now emerging in urban political economy. First, I explore Tapp and Kay’s (2019. “Fiscal geographies: ‘Placing’ taxation in urban geography.” Urban Geography 40 (4): 573–581.) call for new ‘fiscal geographies’ as a provocation for urban climate futures. Specifically, I discuss how property taxation and valuation practices have become central to the ‘disposability’ and premature degradation of US urban built environments, and the climate significance of this wasting. Second, I consider emerging critical geographies of insurance as a window into urban coastal futures under climate change. Following recent interventions such as Johnson (2015. “Catastrophic fixes: Cyclical devaluation and accumulation through climate change impacts.” Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space 47 (12): 2503–2521) and Taylor (2020. “The real estate risk fix: Residential insurance-linked securitization in the Florida metropolis.” Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space. OnlineFirst), urbanists must question how promised financial solutions for climate change’s threat to these spaces risk compounding mass devaluations and erasures to come. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","building lifetimes; climate change; fiscal geographies; insurance; urban futures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082931693

While some of these trends might not last, one of them is here to stay, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced drastically, with the changing climate there will be more droughts and extreme weather events in many regions of the world in the coming decades. This affects the productivity of agriculture and will impact the financial bottom line of the actors in the beer sector. Economic research shows that the impacts of climate change will have dire consequences on the global economy if adaptation to those changes is not undertaken (e.g., Stern Report 2006; Tol 2009). However, little is known about the consequences of extreme weather events and climatic changes for the beer sector. Anecdotal evidence and data for prices of barley and hops suggest that prices for both products, especially hops, are sensitive to droughts, hail, and heavy rain events. Using time series on temperature and precipitation, soil moisture and crop yields, in this article we investigate how climatic conditions in one of the world's most important hop growing regions, the Hallertau in Germany, have changed over the last decades. Focussing on two specific extreme weather events, we investigate, how they affect hops output. Furthermore, we analyze how farmers have responded to the changes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087908144

This study is aimed to investigate the depletion of the CS molecule using the optically thin molecular line observations. We mapped five prestellar cores, L1544, L1552, L1689B, L694-2, and L1197, using two molecular lines, (J = 2-1) and (J = 1-0) with the NRO 45 m telescope, doubling the number of cores where the CS depletion was probed using . In most of our targets, the distribution of emission shows features that suggest that the CS molecule is generally depleted in the center of the prestellar cores. The radial profile of the CS abundance with respect to directly measured from the CS emission and the Herschel dust emission indicates that the CS molecule is depleted by a factor of ∼3 toward the central regions of the cores with respect to their outer regions. The degree of the depletion is found to be even more enhanced, by an order of magnitude, when the contaminating effect introduced by the presence of CS molecules in the surrounding envelope that lie along the line of sight is removed. Except for L1197-which is classified as relatively the least evolved core in our targets, based on its observed physical parameters-we found that the remaining four prestellar cores are suffering from significant CS depletion at their central region, regardless of the relative difference in their evolutionary status. © 2020.

The 72,000 m2 of town contains six public buildings: a high school, library, youth center, childcare center, public health center, and management center, and the facilities incorporated a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES). This paper demonstrates the field tests and measurement results of annual and monthly source and site energy consumption and generation. The annual average daily final yield of the PV system installed in the town achieved 3.5 kWh/kWp/d, and the monthly performance ratio ranged from 65% to 79%. It was also found that the HRES contributed to generate over 24% more surplus energy compared with conventional heat pump system.

Some of these may redeposit near emission sites or be transported over long distances causing wide-spread pollution. With an aim to identify key factors affecting particulate emissions, we report novel investigations on the adsorptive capture of particulate matter (PM) released during low temperature pyrolysis (600 °C; 15 min) of waste printed circuit boards (PCBs). A significant proportion of the released particulates (5.3 to 37%) were captured by adsorbents located downstream and in close proximity to the emitting source. Data was collected for four different PCBs and three adsorbents: alumina, silica-gel and activated carbon. With sizes ranging from nanoparticles to over 10 µm, adsorbed particulates were present as fines, spheres, oblongs, clusters and larger particles with no specific shape. Of the 24 elements identified initially in waste PCBs, only 14 were detected in released particulates: major PTEs— Zn, Sn, Pb and Cu (up to 400 ppm); minor PTEs— Ni, Mn, Cd, Cr and Ba (up to 10 ppm); trace PTEs— Co, In, Bi, Be and Sb (up to 1 ppm). Key factors influencing the release of PTEs during thermal processing were identified as basic elemental characteristics, densities, melting points, vapor pressures, initial concentrations, local bonding and mechanical strength. These results show that the presence of low melting point/high vapour pressure elements (Zn, Pb, Sn) should be minimised for a significant reduction in PTE emissions during e-waste processing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","E-waste; Particulates; PCBs; Pollution; Potentially toxic elements; Thermal processing","Activated alumina; Activated carbon; Aluminum oxide; Bonding; Electronic equipment; Electronic Waste; Heat treatment; Melting point; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Silica; Silica gel; Thermal pollution; Thermal processing (foods); Trace elements; Wastes; Environmental risks; Fine particulates; Initial concentration; Low-temperature pyrolysis; Particulate Matter; Particulates; Potentially toxic elements; Waste printed circuit board (PCBs); Printed circuit boards; activated carbon; adsorbent; aluminum oxide; antimony; barium; beryllium; bismuth; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; indium; lead; manganese; nanoparticle; nickel; potentially toxic element; silica gel; tin; toxic substance; unclassified drug; zinc; trace element; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); electronic waste; environmental risk; particulate matter; PCB; source apportionment; Article; chemical binding; concentration (parameter); density; e-waste; elemental analysis; low temperature procedures; mechanics; melting point; particle size; particulate matter; printed circuit board; priority journal; pyrolysis; solid waste management; toxic waste; vapor pressure; dust; environmental monitoring; recycling; Dust; Electronic Waste; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Recycling; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080050671

Hence, a wide range of often conflicting material interests can be expected surrounding mangrove forest policy and management. These conflicts result in different issues of mangrove policy and management, on which different actors articulate their positions through publicly stated claims. It is unclear, in how far these publicly stated positions and claims resemble the formal interest of the actors only, or if they also reveal parts of their informal interests. In the Sundarbans mangrove forests, a number of issues have arisen, which are of contemporary policy concern. The aim of this study is to identify the most recent issues relating to the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and analyse the actors' claims/arguments on the identified issues which were publicly stated as an expression of formal or informal interest. In order to analyse these public claims, content analysis of selected Bangladeshi national newspapers, experts' deliberations and national policy documents was undertaken as an empirical method to ascertain relevant issues and actors' claims. A theory-based actor typology was applied to distinguish the relevant actors, and the concept of formal and informal interests was employed. The results indicate that the most salient policy issues around mangrove forest policy and management are: establishing Rampal power plant; protection of the Sundarbans forest area; environmental pollution; biodiversity conservation; reputation as a World Natural Heritage Site; relevance for climate change adaptation and mitigation; and local people's livelihoods. Government and Administration are found to be the most active actor in all the observed issues. Surprisingly, only very few administrations partake in public deliberations and the Prime Minister seems to dominate the public debate. This might be explained by the fact that the Rampal power plant project is perceived as the most contentious issue among all actors, with strong discursive support from the Prime Minister. In light of this issue structure, non-governmental actors as well as most bureaucracies are rarely found to actively engage in public debate on mangrove issues while informal interests were being displayed by Prime Minister and non-ruling political parties to a limited extent. Future empirical study to be conducted on the historical trajectory of Rampal power plant addressing the Prime Minister's arguments and environmental concerns of civil society actors. Also it would be worth to map the high degree of bureaucratic rivalry which can be assumed form the conflicting interest in mangrove forests between the responsible ministry—the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and other ministries in their struggle for power. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Formal and informal interests; Policy actors' claims and arguments; Policy issues; The Sundarbans of Bangladesh","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Power plants; Public administration; Bangladesh; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change adaptation; Environmental pollutions; Formal and informal interests; Ministry of environments; Policy issues; World natural heritages; Forestry; biodiversity; climate change; forest management; mangrove; policy approach; social participation; stakeholder; Sundarbans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078153912

Although AD has been efficiently employed in developed countries, however, its application in the developing countries is still far from enough. This paper for the first time identifies the detailed prospects of the development of the AD industry in China by applying the political, economic, social, and technical framework followed by an in-depth cost-benefit analysis which can be used as a case for other developing countries. The findings of this study revealed that incentive policies such as feed-in tariffs (FIT), credits for carbon reduction and tax exemptions ensure progress in AD application on a large scale. Furthermore, MSW treatment capacity using harmless treatment facilities including anaerobic digestion will rise from 21.6 thousand tons per day in 2015 to 36.4 thousand tons per day by 2020 in China. Moreover, the social capitals have been stimulated by the higher investments from the government for the development of the AD industry. AD plants have low cost of operation due to their smaller sizes, water saving capacity and higher digestion efficiencies, which makes anaerobic digestion a competitive alternative for the treatment of MSW in the near future. The cost-benefit analysis revealed that AD projects have good market potential with an attractive net profit margin and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 31% and 12%, respectively. The industry has enormous potential for attracting foreign investment, while generating considerable revenue. The information provided in this study is helpful to advance the implementation of AD systems in China and other developing countries.

This variation in leaf structure can have physiological consequences such as increased respiratory costs, reduced internal carbon dioxide conductance rates and ultimately reduced maximum photosynthetic rates (Amax). In Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carrière, the leaf structure varies along the vertical gradient in ways that suggest compensatory changes to enhance photosynthesis, and this variation seems to be driven largely by light availability rather than by Ψ. These trends in leaf structure coupled with remarkably fast growth rates and dependence on moist environments inspire two important questions about P. sitchensis: (i) does foliar water uptake minimize the adverse effects of decreasing Ψ with height on leaf structure, and (ii) do trends in leaf structure increase photosynthetic rates despite increasing height? To answer these questions, we measured foliar water uptake capacity, predawn (Ψpd) and midday water potential and gas-exchange rates as they varied between 25- and 89-m heights in 300-year-old P. sitchensis trees in northwestern California. Our major findings for P. sitchensis include the following: (i) foliar water uptake capacity was quite high relative to published values for other woody species; (ii) foliar water uptake capacity increased between the crown base and treetop; (iii) wet season Ψpd was higher than predicted by the gravitational potential gradient, indicating foliar water uptake; and (iv) the maximum photosynthetic rate increased with height, presumably due to shifts in leaf structure between the crown base and treetop, mitigating height-related decreases in Amax. These findings suggest that together, the use of fog, dew and rain deposits on leaves and shifts in the leaf structure to conserve and possibly enhance photosynthetic capacity likely contribute to the rapid growth rates measured in this species. © The Author(s) 2020.

The transients are observed in the first 120 s of the reaction, followed by a lower steady-state production rate after 3–5 min. The catalytic reactivity in the initial 120 s is important in understanding the catalyst performance and determining the reactions responsible for carbon deposition. Monitoring the changes in the H2 and CH4 partial pressures from the start, through the transient production regime, and on through the steady-state regime, shows that the transient reactivity is directly related to the decomposition of CH4. This finding is further supported by the linear trend found between the H2/CO ratio and the carbon deposition in the peak region of the product gas profile. Although significant amounts of carbon are deposited on the Ni surface, it is not completely deactivated at any of the reaction temperatures in the 500–800 °C range explored herein. Characterizing the initial reactivity in terms of carbon deposition and catalyst performance in dry reforming of CH4 may lead to changes in the sampling technique for researchers working with reforming reactions, and optimized catalysts that exhibit reduced initial carbon deposition. © 2019","Catalyst deactivation; Dry reforming; Methane decomposition","Carbon; Carbonization; Catalyst deactivation; Deposition; Methane; Nickel; Catalyst performance; Catalytic reactivity; Dry reforming; Dry reforming-of-methane; Methane decomposition; Reaction temperature; Steady state production; Steady-state regime; Reforming reactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079886152

Although information on chemical composition of pollen is of importance in all of those research areas, pollen chemistry has been rarely measured due to complex and time-consuming analyses. Vibrational spectroscopies, coupled with multivariate data analysis, have shown great potential for rapid chemical characterization, identification and classification of pollen. This study, comprising 219 species from all principal taxa of seed plants, has demonstrated that high-quality Raman spectra of pollen can be obtained by Fourier transform (FT) Raman spectroscopy. In combination with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), FT-Raman spectroscopy is obtaining comprehensive information on pollen chemistry. Presence of all the main biochemical constituents of pollen, such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, carotenoids and sporopollenins, have been identified and detected in the spectra, and the study shows approaches to measure relative and absolute content of these constituents. The results show that FT-Raman spectroscopy has clear advantage over standard dispersive Raman measurements, in particular for measurement of pollen samples with high pigment content. FT-Raman spectra are strongly biased toward chemical composition of pollen wall constituents, namely sporopollenins and pigments. This makes Raman spectra complementary to FTIR spectra, which over-represent chemical constituents of the grain interior, such as lipids and carbohydrates. The results show a large variability in pollen chemistry for families, genera and even congeneric species, revealing wide range of reproductive strategies, from storage of nutrients to variation in carotenoids and phenylpropanoids. The information on pollen’s chemical patterns for major plant taxa should be of outstanding value for various studies in plant biology and ecology, including aerobiology, palaeoecology, forensics, community ecology, plant-pollinator interactions, and climate effects on plants. © Copyright © 2020 Kenđel and Zimmermann.","flowering; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; male gametophyte; multivariate analysis; palynology; pollen wall; pollination; Raman spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083335371

In the case of metal–semiconductor composites, formation of Schottky barrier height and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect stimulated by the metallic dispersion cooperatively separates the charge carriers and alters the optical response to longer wavelength region, respectively, which are of paramount importance in the light-induced redox reactions. From the view point of attaining maximum synergy, bimetallic deposition over the titania support has impelled interest due to the supportive interactions arising from metal–metal and metal–TiO2 heterojunctions. In this review article, bimetallic systems constituting mainly Cu, Ni, Au, Ag, Pd and Pt over the titania surface are discussed under the light of preparative methods, their distribution, electronic interactions between the metals and with the titania support, charge carrier transfer pathways, structural stability and optimized content towards achieving maximum efficiency in various applications such as pollutant degradation, CO2 reduction, H2 evolution reaction (HER) and in the functional group conversion of few organic compounds. The role of each metal in the bimetallic system and the effects arising from structure–morphology features of titania are considered to furnish insightful discussion into this exquisite heterojunction. The bimetallic deposition over the other emerged semiconductors are briefly surmised to attest the versatility of this strategy and its reliability from several prospects are brought to the fore to provide the room for developing efficient bimetallic–semiconductor heterostructures. © 2019, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.","Bimetallic systems; Charge carrier dynamics; Metal deposition; Photocatalysis; TiO2",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076129028

Various explanations for this have been proposed, from the observed frequency range, telescope sensitivity, to beaming of the emission. In a recent paper, we illustrated that exoplanets can orbit through the radio photosphere of the wind of the host star, a region that is optically thick at a specific frequency, for a large fraction of their orbits. As a result, radio emission originating from the planet could be absorbed or 'eclipsed' by the wind of the host star. Here, we investigate how the properties of the stellar wind and orbital parameters affect the fraction of the orbit where the planet is eclipsed by the stellar wind.We show that planets orbiting stars with low-density winds are more favourable for detection in the radio. In terms of the orbital parameters, emission from transiting planets can escape the stellar wind easiest.We apply our model to the τ Boo planetary system, and show that observing the fraction of the planet's orbit where it is eclipsed by the wind of the host star could be used to constrain the properties of the stellar wind. However, our model developed would need to be used in conjunction with a separate method to disentangle the mass-loss rate and temperature of the stellar wind. © 2020 The Author(s).","Planet-star interactions; Planetary systems; Planets and satellites: aurorae; Radio continuum: planetary systems; Stars: mass-loss; Stars: winds, outflows",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086588093

Using a laboratory-scale reciprocal inoculation experiment with two native soils (paddy and upland agricultural soils) and the gamma-irradiated fraction of these soils, we aim to disentangle and determine the relative contribution of abiotic (i.e., soil edaphic properties) and biotic (i.e., initial methanotrophic community composition) controls of methane oxidation during re-colonization. Methane uptake was appreciably higher in incubations containing gamma-irradiated paddy than upland soil despite the initial difference in the methanotrophic community composition. This suggested an overriding effect of the soil edaphic properties, which positively regulated methane oxidation. Community composition was similar in incubations with the same starting inoculum, based on quantitative and qualitative pmoA gene analyses. Thus, results suggested that the initial community composition affects the trajectory of community succession to an extent, but not at the expense of the methanotrophic activity under high methane availability.

In the last three decades, the Brazilian government has established a regional protected area (PA) network that currently covers approximately 48 % of the region. Despite their importance, some sectors of the Brazilian society have argued that the expansion of the PAs across the region hampers the local economic development, because they make less area available for non-forest economic activities such as large-scale agriculture, mining, and power generation. In this study, we analysed the relationship between local economic growth and PA coverage in 516 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon from 2004 to 2014. We modelled the impact of the coverage of the three types of PAs (strictly-protected, multiple-use, and indigenous lands) on the (i) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the real gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita), and (ii) real gross value added per capita (GVA per capita) of the agriculture, industry, services, and government sectors in each municipality. The models also considered the following control variables at the municipal level: area, age, per capita GPD in 2004 (or per capita GVAs in 2004), population growth rate between 2004 and 2014, education index, deforested area outside PA per capita, deforested area inside PA per capita, degraded area outside PA per capita, degraded area inside PA per capita, and presence of illegal mining within PA. We applied spatial Durbin error models (SDEM) to analyse the direct, indirect, and total impacts of the PAs on the local economic growth. We did not find a statistically significant relationship between the local economic growth and PA coverage in any of the three PA groups evaluated. Only the total impact of the GVA per capita of the industry was negatively correlated with the coverage of the strictly-protected PAs. Our findings do not support the arguments used by some interest groups of the Brazilian society that the social and environmental gains generated through the expansion of PAs across the region constrain the overall local economic growth. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation policy; Indigenous lands; Local development; Multiple-use protected areas; Strictly-protected areas; Tropical rainforest","conservation management; economic development; economic growth; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; indigenous population; local government; protected area; rainforest; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077917362

However, some key methodological questions remain, such as which kinds of interactions are permitted to include in these models, how to incorporate the effects of multiple interacting species, and how to account for interactions that may have a temporal dependence. We addressed these questions in an effort to model the distribution of the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus during its fall migration (September–November) through Mexico, a region with new monitoring data and uncertain range limits even for this well-studied insect. We estimated species richness of selected nectar plants (Asclepias spp.) and roosting trees (various highland species) for use as biotic variables in our models. To account for flowering phenology, we additionally estimated nectar plant richness of flowering species per month. We evaluated three types of models: climatic variables only (abiotic), plant richness estimates only (biotic) and combined (abiotic and biotic). We selected models with AICc and additionally determined if they performed better than random on spatially withheld data. We found that the combined models accounting for phenology performed best for all three months, and better than random for discriminatory ability but not omission rate. These combined models also produced the most ecologically realistic spatial patterns, but the modeled response for nectar plant richness matched ecological predictions for November only. These results represent the first model-based monarch distributional estimates for the Mexican migration route and should provide foundations for future conservation work. More generally, the study demonstrates the potential benefits of using SDM-derived richness estimates and phenological information for biotic factors affecting species distributions. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the impact of oxygen stress on zooplankton, which is the major trophic link between primary producers and fish, remains largely unknown in lakes. Therefore, we studied 41 lakes with different trophic and oxygen conditions to assess the role of oxygen stress on zooplankton communities and carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Samples were collected from each lake at the peak of summer stratification from three depth layers (the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion). Our results revealed that freshwater zooplankton were relatively tolerant to anoxic conditions and the greatest changes in community structure were found in lakes with the highest oxygen deficits. This caused a switch in dominance from large to small species and reduced the zooplankton biomass in lower, anoxic layers of water, but not in the upper layers of water where the oxygen deficits began. This upper anoxic layer could thus be a very important refuge for zooplankton to avoid predation during the day.

Box 3000FIN-90014, Finland","One-fourth of the land area in the Northern Hemisphere is affected by perennially frozen ground, known as permafrost. The thermal conditions of permafrost govern complex geo- and ecosystems and provide support for Arctic cities and transportation infrastructure. Permafrost, however, is not permanent. Rather it is sensitive to the warming climate and human-induced disturbances. Recently, rapid degradation of permafrost landscapes has been observed across the Arctic. In addition to the local implications for the hydro-ecology, geo- and biodiversity and ground stability, permafrost degradation can affect the global climate through biogeochemical feedbacks. Ongoing changes to Arctic permafrost systems may have environmental and socio-economic repercussions on national and international scales. The main aims of this thesis were to first examine how environmental conditions control the thermal and geomorphic permafrost characteristics on a circumpolar scale. Next, the sensitivity of permafrost to 21st century climate change was assessed. Lastly, high-resolution geohazard maps were produced and used to quantify the amount of infrastructure potentially at risk from thawing near-surface permafrost across the Northern Hemisphere. The thesis utilized statistical ensemble modelling techniques and geospatial datasets combined with comprehensive circumpolar observational datasets. Based on the results, the studied permafrost characteristics were strongly controlled by and sensitive to current and future climatic conditions. The air temperature and rainfall had the most prominent contributions, while the effects of local terrain properties on a circumpolar scale were often found to be small. By the mid-century, the extent of near-surface permafrost may decrease by 34-47% depending on human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Suitable areas for permafrost landform occurrence will similarly shrink, including regions of cold continuous permafrost. Quantifications of the infrastructure at risk indicated that around 70% of the studied engineering elements and four million people were located in areas of projected near-surface permafrost thaw. Moreover, one-third of all the infrastructure elements and nearly a million people situated in regions with high potential for permafrost degradation-related damage to the built environment. In conclusion, circumpolar permafrost was projected to show extensive regionally distinct sensitivities to the ongoing climate change. Although most of the thermal and geomorphic impacts were projected to occur by the mid-century regardless of the climate-change scenario, it is argued that mitigating climate change could reduce the potential consequences for natural and human systems. In order to achieve a higher applicability of circumpolar-scale analyses on local scales, further developments in the availability and quality of global observational and geospatial data are required. Moreover, it is proposed that the pronounced nonlinearity found between climatic conditions and the studied permafrost characteristics should be carefully considered in future assessments. © 2020 Geographical Society of Northern Finland.

The term weak carbon leakage describes a situation where an increase in consumption in developed countries leads to growing emissions in less developed countries. This effect is strongly related to phenomena like globalization and outsourcing of production. As a consequence, a large part of daily consumed products are imported and include embodied emissions (i.e. direct and indirect emissions that occur in the regions of production). For the development of effective policy instruments addressing consumption-based-emissions (CBE) embodied in these international products and processes, it is essential to apply a consumption-based approach (CBA), including both consumer-oriented policies, focusing on final demand, and producer-oriented policies, focusing on industry. Since a considerable share of consumption behaviour is performed by routines, habits and within social practices (cooking, working or shopping), CBE due to consumer behaviour are analysed in this paper by applying the social practices (SP) approach to the case of Austria. Based on this approach the development of effective policy instruments addressing a reduction of CBE by three types of interventions (re-crafting, substituting and interlocking) are discussed for the main hotspots of Austria’s CBE: construction and mobility. Key policy insights An SP perspective enriches the development of CBE policy instruments by shifting the focus of interventions from individual motivations (conscious consumption) towards the constitutional frame and the particular practice-setting which determines consumer behaviour. Consumption sectors such as construction and mobility are most often embedded in behavioural interlocking (e.g. commuting), calling for practical policy mixes to address this complex interplay of practices. The SP approach demonstrates that CBE can be addressed also by single instruments (e.g. changing a regulation, favouring the avoidance of certain practices or materials offered/used) only. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","construction; consumption-based emissions; interlocking; mobility; policy instruments; Social practices","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; consumption behavior; emission control; leakage; policy approach; policy development; policy making; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084784514

The powders were obtained by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS). The coatings were formed by plasma spraying with local protection. The introduction of additional carbon into cermet TiC–10Р6М5 + 2.38 C made it possible to compensate for carbon losses during plasma spraying and to form a coating with an additional carbon content of 1.35%. The content of the titanium carbide phase in the coating is retained; however, the period of the carbide lattice is reduced, the more so for the coating with a nickel-based matrix. The content of oxygen and nitrogen in the coatings with respect to the initial powders increases mainly in the cermet containing the steel matrix. The presence of silicon and boron in the cermet grade obtained with the matrix from the alloy H77X15C3P2 did not reduce the loss of carbon in the coating.

Conventional MFM systems use a fabricated grating in the emission path for a single emission wavelength band and one set of focal plane separations. While a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) can add more flexibility as a replacement to the fabricated grating, the relatively small number of pixels in the SLM chip, cross-talk between the pixels, and aberrations in the imaging system can produce non-uniform intensity in the different axially separated image planes. We present an in situ iterative SLM calibration algorithm that overcomes these optical- and hardware-related limitations to deliver near-uniform intensity across all focal planes. Using immobilized gold nanoparticles under darkfield illumination, we demonstrate superior intensity evenness compared to current methods. We also demonstrate applicability across emission wavelengths, axial plane separations, imaging modalities, SLM settings, and different SLM manufacturers. Therefore, our microscope design and algorithms provide an alternative to the use of fabricated gratings in MFM, as they are relatively simple and could find broad applications in the wider research community. © 2020 Amin et al.

Vicuña Mackenna 4860, Santiago, 7820436, Chile, Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable, Santiago, Chile","We have analyzed trends in ambient fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particulate matter in Santiago, Chile, for the last 30 years. PM2.5 has monotonously decreased between 67% and 72% at those sites. Trends varied between −2.0 and −2.7 (μg/m3/year) between 1989 and late 90's, and between −0.7 and −1.1 (μg/m3/year) afterwards. This slowing down is likely a consequence of fast increase of motor vehicles in the city, which have become a dominant source of ambient PM2.5. Annual ambient PM2.5 concentrations are still above 20 (μg/m3), so more regulation is needed to bring them down. Coarse particles have changed little in 30 years, decreasing between 0% and 12%; particle concentrations have evolved in a non-linear way: first increasing in 1989–1995, then decreasing until 2003, and with a flat trend afterwards. We ascribe these trends to a combination of a) public works implemented throughout the city, b) fugitive dust controls like street sweeping programs and emission offsets for PM10 and c) increasing numbers of motor vehicles in the city. Further initiatives are needed to curb down coarse particles as well. By considering interaction between trend and seasonality, we have found that ambient PM2.5 has monotonously decreased all year long at all monitoring sites with similar patterns; this is characteristic of a regional-scale pollution. For ambient PM2.5-10 trend and season have a more complex, site-specific interaction, suggesting local sources and site location in the basin are relevant in determining ambient concentrations of coarse particles. A limitation of this study is that no quantitative link between ambient concentrations trends and atmospheric emissions could be established with the analyses carried out. A strength of the study is the long period analyzed with measurements conducted with the same gravimetric methodology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Motor vehicle emissions; Particulate matter; Road dust; Sustainable development; Urban air quality","air quality; ambient air; concentration (composition); dust; fractionation; particulate matter; pollutant source; size distribution; sustainable development; traffic emission; urban pollution; air quality; article; Chile; dust control; motor vehicle; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; sustainable development; air pollutant; air pollution; animal; Chile; city; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; Chile; Metropolitana; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animals; Chile; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077374150

However, studies on GHG emissions from extracted peatlands after rewetting are limited. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2 O) emission fluxes were determined using the opaque closed chamber method along water level gradients from littoral zones to the open water body of constructed shallow lakes with different vegetation zones in a nutrient-rich rewetted extracted peatland in Sweden. Vegetation communities and their position relative to water level, together with short-term water level fluctuations, such as inundation events and seasonal droughts, and temperature had a significant impact on CH4 emissions fluxes. During “normal” and “dry” conditions and high soil temperatures, CH4 emissions were highest from Carex spp.-Typha latifolia L. communities. During inundation events with water levels &gt; 30 cm, sites with flooded Graminoids-Scirpus spp.-Carex spp. emitted most CH4. Methane emissions from the water body of the constructed shallow lakes were low during all water level conditions and over the temperature ranges observed. Nitrous oxide emissions contributed little to the emission fluxes from the soil-plant-water systems to the atmosphere, and they were only detectable from the sites with Graminoids. In terms of management, the construction of shallow lakes showed great potential for lowering GHG emission fluxes from nutrient rich peatlands after peat extraction, even though the vegetated shore emitted some N2 O and CH4. © 2020 by the authors.

In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy monitored changes in the composition of the SSE Li garnet [Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTaO)] upon annealing in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and upon Ar+ ion sputtering. Trends in core level spectra demonstrate that binding energy (BE) calibration of the Li 1s at 56.4 eV yields a more consistent interpretation of results than the more commonly used standard of the adventitious C 1s at 284.8 eV. Annealing one ambient-exposed sample to &gt;1000 K in UHV effectively reduced surface carbonate and oxygen, leaving significant amounts of carbon in lower oxidation states. A second ambient-exposed sample was subjected to 3 keV Ar+ ion sputtering at 500 K in UHV, which eliminated all surface carbon and reduced the O 1s intensity and BE. These methods present alternative approaches to lithium carbonate removal than heating or polishing in inert atmospheres and are compatible with fundamental surface science studies. In particular, the data show that sputtering at mildly elevated temperatures yields facile elimination of carbonate and other forms of surface carbon. This is in contrast to annealing in either UHV or noble gas environments, which result in carbonate reduction, but with significant remnant coverages of other forms of carbon. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Annealing; Binding energy; Carbon; Carbonation; Garnets; Inert gases; Ionic conduction in solids; Ions; Photoelectrons; Photons; Solid electrolytes; Sputtering; Ultrahigh vacuum; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbonate reduction; Core-level spectra; Elevated temperature; Lithium carbonates; Situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Solid-state electrolyte; Surface carbonates; Surface science studies; Lithium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078450193

Many recent studies have investigated 100% renewable energy generation scenarios, but few have explored the trade-offs associated with an electricity grid dominated by non-synchronous generation (i.e. wind and solar). Fast frequency response from grid-forming inverters—along with other technology changes—could help mitigate low system inertia levels, but the impact of this response is unknown. An inertia-constrained unit commitment and dispatch model was used to study the stability of future grid scenarios with high penetrations of non-synchronous renewable energy generation under a variety of technology scenarios. The Texas grid (the Electric Reliability Council of Texas – ERCOT) was used as a test case and instances when the system inertia fell below 100 GW·s (the grid's current minimum level) were recorded. When the modeled critical inertia limit was reduced to 80 GW·s to represent changes in grid operation, no critical inertia hours occurred for renewable energy penetrations up to 93% of annual energy. The critical inertia limit could drop to 60 GW·s if the largest generators in ERCOT (two co-located nuclear plants) were retired, but emissions increased by ~25% in these scenarios. If the critical inertia limit was kept the same (100 GW·s), adding 525 MW of fast frequency response from wind, solar, and energy storage could reduce the number of critical inertia hours by up to 95%. These results show that changes to grid operating practices and generator retirements reduced critical inertia hours more than fast frequency response from inverter-connected resources. Each of these mitigation pathways has associated trade-offs, so the transition to a grid dominated by non-synchronous energy generation should be handled with care, but high renewable energy penetrations (i.e. >80%) might be feasible in Texas. © 2020","Fast frequency response; Grid stability; Non-synchronous; Renewable energy; Synthetic inertia; Unit commitment & dispatch","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Frequency response; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Stability; Grid stability; Non-synchronous; Renewable energies; Synthetic inertia; Unit-commitment; Electric load dispatching; identification method; power generation; solar power; stability analysis; trade-off; wind power; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077662472

This paper uses regulatory information about abatement and compliance cost estimates to measure the greenhouse gas abatement cost curve of the mandate. Historical compliance costs per unit of biofuel appear readily available, yet findings here show that using these data along with observed biofuel quantities biases biofuel mandate abatement cost estimates upward. Unbiased estimation requires that related biofuel mandate costs and emissions are estimated along with associated market effects, including on fuel use, using an economic model. Moreover, this approach relates greenhouse gas abatement to the implications for crop prices and land use, taking account of interactions within the crop sector. Results show that the United States biofuel mandate causes up to 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent abatement for compliance costs that are equivalent to carbon prices ranging up to $20 per ton, with a large part coming from reductions in petroleum product use as the mandate encourages substitution to biofuels. Abatement costs are reduced if ethanol is made at new facilities with fewer emissions or if petroleum output expansion causes greater emissions than the historical average. Findings also indicate that GHG abatement via the mandate is initially costly due to the nature of biofuel demand, there can be a trade-off between corn price increase and GHG reduction, and the increase in total area planted to crops in the U.S. is less important than the reallocation of land among crops. © 2019","Abatement; Biofuel mandate; Compliance cost; Economic model; Greenhouse gas abatement cost curves; Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable fuel standard","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Cost reduction; Crops; Dust abatement; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Regulatory compliance; Abatement costs; Compliance costs; Economic modeling; GHG abatements; Greenhouse gas abatements; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Renewable fuels; Unbiased estimation; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076045456

Our findings reveal that the resonance of this frame has varied significantly among different actors, influencing the ideas and strategies of climate activists and lawyers around the world, but having limited resonance among policymakers in the United States or Canada or among Inuit communities themselves.

In this study, the Community Earth System Model with prescribed daily fire aerosol emissions is used to investigate fire aerosols' impacts on global climate with emphasis on the role of climate feedbacks. The total global fire aerosol radiative effect (RE) is estimated to be 20.78 6 0.29 W m22, which is mostly from shortwave RE due to aerosol-cloud interactions (REaci; 20.70 6 0.20 W m22). The associated global annual-mean surface air temperature (SAT) change DT is 20.64 6 0.16 K with the largest reduction in the Arctic regions where the shortwave REaci is strong. Associated with the cooling, the Arctic sea ice is increased, which acts to reamplify the Arctic cooling through a positive ice-albedo feedback. The fast response (irrelevant to DT) tends to decrease surface latent heat flux into atmosphere in the tropics to balance strong atmospheric fire black carbon absorption, which reduces the precipitation in the tropical land regions (southern Africa and South America). The climate feedback processes (associated with DT) lead to a significant surface latent heat flux reduction over global ocean areas, which could explain most (;80%) of the global precipitation reduction. The precipitation significantly decreases in deep tropical regions (58N) but increases in the Southern Hemisphere tropical ocean, which is associated with the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone and the weakening of Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell. Such changes could partly compensate the interhemispheric temperature asymmetry induced by boreal forest fire aerosol indirect effects, through intensifying the cross-equator atmospheric heat transport. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.

To solve this problem, previous scientific efforts have been widely laid on the fabrication of PVK-based type II heterojunctions or Schottky-junctions. Unfortunately, this was at the cost of the weakened reduction ability of the photo-generated electrons due to the electron transfer. Herein, a PVK-based Z-scheme photocatalyst is delicately designed to not only boost the charge separation but also preserve the high redox potential of semiconductors. By delicately controlling the interfacial interaction, effective Z-scheme electron transfer is built, which enables the largely enhanced visible-light-driven overall conversion of CO2 and H2O to CH4 and O2. This work is expected to provide a new way to rational design-effective PVK-based photocatalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Lead halide perovskite (PVK) has been deemed as a promising photocatalyst alternative because of its remarkable photoelectrical properties; however, the severe charge recombination has limited its catalytic activity. Herein, we report a PVK-based Z-scheme heterojunction, α-Fe2O3/Amine-RGO/CsPbBr3, for high-efficiency CO2 reduction in the presence of H2O. By delicately controlling the interfacial interaction, effective Z-scheme electron transfer from α-Fe2O3 to CsPbBr3 is built, leading to boosted charge separation and prolonged carrier lifetime, as confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR), transient absorption (TA) spectra, etc. The impactful spatial separation of photo-generated carriers in Z-scheme system finally enables an 8.3-fold enhancement in photocatalytic performance as compared to CsPbBr3.

Microbial activity is often emphasized with respect to nodule formation. However, the relationship between microbial activity and Fe–Mn nodule growth is still obscure. Here, we investigate the microbial community, elemental distributions, mineral compositions, and pore structural characteristics within Fe–Mn nodules from the western Pacific Ocean. Abundant bacterial and archaeal communities were found in the studied nodules, and some species may be related to iron reduction, and manganese oxidation and anammox. Abundant mineralized manganese oxidizing bacteria were also observed in the nodules. In addition, more reduced manganese, more organic carbon, micron-sized pores, and higher bacterial diversity were detected on the younger surface layers of the nodules. These results reveal that more biogeochemical reactions occur in younger areas of nodules than in inner areas. We suggest that micro- and nano-structures within nodules provide a beneficial micro-environment and nutrition channels for biogeochemical activity that contribute Fe–Mn nodule growth, and an interdependent relationship occurs between microbial ecosystems and nodules.

CO2 emissions intensity inequality analysis in China can provide a scientific basis for the Chinese government to formulate reasonable regional carbon emission abatement strategies, so as to realize the goal above. This paper adopted the Theil index to study the provincial-level CO2 emissions intensity inequality in China during 2005-2015. The regional decomposition was firstly conducted and then the factors of interregional and intraregional inequalities were explored. The results show: (i) a clear increase in provincial CO2 emissions intensity inequality in China has happened; (ii) this inequality and its increase were both mainly explained by the intraregional component; and (iii) the energy efficiency was the most important and positive contributor in the interregional, Eastern, Central, andWestern China inequalities. Energy efficiency was also the key factor that caused the growth in interregional and Western China inequalities. However, most of the Eastern and Central China inequality increments over the whole period were respectively driven by the expanding carbonization gap and the changing GDP share, instead of the trajectory of energy efficiency. According to the results, regional emission mitigation strategies were proposed. © 2020 by the authors.

Raman spectra show that the amorphous carbon nanodots were formed within the a-SiCx:H films as Ta is equal to and higher than 600 °C. Meanwhile, the decomposition and transformation from sp3 C to sp2 C of the carbon nanodots can be inferred by the Raman spectra with increasing Ta. XPS analysis suggest that the near-surface oxidation of the films become strong as Ta &gt; 600 °C which can be contributed to the chemical bond reconstruction and the formation of carbon nanodots within the films. The decrease of the optical band gap derived from the measured absorption spectra of the films can be attributed to the formation and graphitization of the carbon nanodots within the a-SiCx:H films. HRTEM measurements indicate that the enhancement of the areal density and the size reduction of the carbon nanodots take place within the a-SiCx:H films with increasing Ta. However, the dispersion of the carbon nanodots embedded in the a-SiCx:H films is still very bad compared with that of the CQDs dispersed in chemical solvents.

Since the 12th Five-year Plan, China has included this technology as part of its future national carbon mitigation strategies. China's policy framework in relation to CCUS has had a strong influencing role in the technology's progress to date. This paper employs the “policy cycle” to analyze China's existing CCUS regulatory framework at the national and provincial level, evaluate its performance and clarify its shortcomings in light of the comparisons of policy movements undertaken in other countries. The results indicate that China's CCUS policy is insufficient for further development of the technology and many issues remain to be solved. This includes the lack of an enforceable legal framework, insufficient information for the operationalization of projects, weak market stimulus, and a lack of financial subsidies. These factors may be the reason we have seen low participation rates of Chinese companies in CCUS and little public understanding of what the technology offers.

A wise use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer is important for mitigating GHG emissions. To evaluate the potential of different fertilizers treatments to mitigate total GHG emissions, a field experiment was conducted to investigate nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3) emissions and nitrate (NO3 −) leaching from a typical rice and winter wheat rotation system in Southeast China. Six reduced N treatments (including single reducing N input, increasing potassium input, combined application of urea ammonium (UA) and organic fertilizer (OF), single application of urea with hydroquinone and dicyandiamide (UHD) and urea formaldehyde (UF)) and the local practice (conventional N fertilizer) were applied in the study. Most of the reduced N treatments tended to reduce the cumulative CH4, N2O and NH3 emissions and NO3 − leaching relative to the local practice, while single application of UHD during the rice season obviously increased the CH4 and NH3 emissions (p &lt; 0.05) and all of the reduced N treatments during the wheat season had no obvious mitigation effect on NO3 − leaching. Moreover, the single reducing N input and single application of UHD significantly decreased the rice yields (p &lt; 0.05), and the other treatments could maintain the yields. For the whole rice-wheat rotation system, only the single application of UHD significantly increased the GHG intensity (GHGI) by 22.0% (p &lt; 0.05) and reduced the N use efficiency (NUE) by 9.1% compared to the local practice and the other reduced N treatments reduced the GHGI by 11.0–42.7% and increased the NUE by 5.2–34.3%, especially the reducing local N input levels by 18–32% and increasing potassium input or combined application of UA and OF treatments, which had the obvious mitigation effects and should be given priority for total GHG mitigation in future crop production. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Combined application; Direct and indirect GHGs; GHGI; Lowering N input; Rice-wheat fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078845243

Given a determined logistics demand pattern, this multi-stakeholder decision making problem is first formulated as a bi-level programming model followed by its equivalent mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) to depict the leader-follower behaviors. To capture the risk aversion level of the logistics authority in uncertain demand environment, an improved adjustable robust optimization method is proposed, including an individual control parameter and providing an exact expression of the maximum satisfaction probability.

However, current environmental assessment methods require large amounts of data, long assessment cycles, and tedious assessment processes; thus, they cannot quickly respond to the rapidly changing urban green space. To resolve the above problems, we present a multidimensional model for sustainable and smart cities equipped with RE–3DSG sensors to detect the real experience of residents and the three–dimensional structure of the urban green space. RE–3DSG sensors consist of two parts: The net ecosystem service (Net ES) and green volume ratio (GVR), where Net ES provides a solution consisting of runoff control, air purification, cooling, carbon sequestration, noise reduction, and recreational area establishment, while GVR assesses the spatial structure of urban built environment plant clusters. By implementing the proposed model, it is proven that it can assist users (usually decision makers in government departments) to improve the decision–making efficiency and increase the satisfaction of residents with urban green spaces, thereby achieving the goal of building a sustainable and smart city. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, the effects of the three main factors on the interannual variation (IAV) and seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) of GPP in China were investigated using 12 terrestrial biosphere models from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project. The simulated ensemble mean value of China's GPP between 1981 and 2010, driven by common climate forcing, LULCC and CO2 data, was found to be 7.4±1.8 Pg C yr-1. In general, climate was the dominant control factor of the annual trends, IAV and seasonality of China's GPP. The overall rising CO2 led to enhanced plant photosynthesis, thus increasing annual mean and IAV of China's total GPP, especially in northeastern and southern China, where vegetation is dense. LULCC decreased the IAV of China's total GPP by ∼7 %, whereas rising CO2 induced an increase of 8 %. Compared to climate change and elevated CO2, LULCC showed less contributions to GPP's temporal variation, and its impact acted locally, mainly in southwestern China. Furthermore, this study also examined subregional contributions to the temporal changes in China's total GPP. Southern and southeastern China showed higher contributions to China's annual GPP, whereas southwestern and central parts of China explained larger fractions of the IAV in China's GPP. © Author(s) 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Land use; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; CO2 concentration; Gross primary productivity; Interannual variation; Land use and land cover change; Southeastern china; Temporal variation; Terrestrial biosphere; Terrestrial models; Climate change; annual variation; carbon dioxide; land cover; land use change; primary production; seasonal variation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081630150

We aimed to assess whether greenness protects against air pollution-related mortality. Methods: We used data from the 2008 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. We calculated contemporaneous normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the 500 m radius around each participant's residence. Fine particulate matter (PM2·5) concentration was calculated using 3-year average concentrations in 1 km × 1 km grid resolution. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the effects of NDVI, PM2·5, and their interaction on all-cause mortality, adjusted for a range of covariates. Findings: The cohort contained 12 873 participants, totalling 47 884 person-years. There were 7426 deaths between 2008 and 2014. The mean contemporaneous NDVI was 0·42 (SD 0·21), and the mean 3-year average PM2·5 was 49·63 μg/m3 (13·72). In the fully adjusted model, the mortality hazard ratio for each 0·1-unit decrease in contemporaneous NDVI was 1·08 (95% CI 1·03–1·13), each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2·5 was 1·13 (1·09–1·18), and the interaction term was 1·01 (1·00–1·02) with a p value of 0·027. We observed non-linear associations in our stratified analyses: people living in urban areas were more likely to benefit from greenness, and people living in rural areas were more likely to be harmed by air pollution. Interpretation: Our study showed some indication of a synergistic effect of greenness and air pollution, suggesting that green space planning and air pollution control can jointly improve public health.

This work demonstrates that the high activity and selectivity of Cu to C2+ products can be achieved by atomic-scale spacings between two facets of Cu particles. These spacings are created by lithiating CuOx particles, removing lithium oxides formed, and electrochemically reducing CuOx to metallic Cu. Also, the range of spacing (ds) is confirmed via the 3D tomographs using the Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (3D tomo-STEM), and the operando X-ray absorption spectra show that oxidized Cu reduces to the metallic state during the CO2RR. Moreover, control of ds to 5–6 Å allows a current density exceeding that of unmodified CuOx nanoparticles by about 12 folds and a Faradaic efficiency of ≈80% to C2+. Density functional theory calculations support that ds of 5–6 Å maximizes the binding energies of CO2 reduction intermediates and promotes C–C coupling reactions. Consequently, this study suggests that control of ds can be used to realize the high activity and C2+ product selectivity for the CO2RR. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Until recently, ensembles of coupled climate simulations producing temporal dynamics of climate en route to stable global mean temperature at 1.5 and 2°C above preindustrial levels were not available. Hence, the few studies that have assessed the ecological impact of the Paris Agreement used ad-hoc approaches. The development of new specific mitigation climate simulations now provides an unprecedented opportunity to inform ecological impact assessments. Here we project the dynamics of all known emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colonies under new climate change scenarios meeting the Paris Agreement objectives using a climate-dependent-metapopulation model. Our model includes various dispersal behaviors so that penguins could modulate climate effects through movement and habitat selection. Under business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions, we show that 80% of the colonies are projected to be quasiextinct by 2100, thus the total abundance of emperor penguins is projected to decline by at least 81% relative to its initial size, regardless of dispersal abilities. In contrast, if the Paris Agreement objectives are met, viable emperor penguin refuges will exist in Antarctica, and only 19% and 31% colonies are projected to be quasiextinct by 2100 under the Paris 1.5 and 2 climate scenarios respectively. As a result, the global population is projected to decline by at least by 31% under Paris 1.5 and 44% under Paris 2. However, population growth rates stabilize in 2060 such that the global population will be only declining at 0.07% under Paris 1.5 and 0.34% under Paris 2, thereby halting the global population decline. Hence, global climate policy has a larger capacity to safeguard the future of emperor penguins than their intrinsic dispersal abilities. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Antarctica; climate change mitigation; dispersion; emission reduction pledges; seabirds","climate change; climate effect; dispersal; emission control; environmental policy; metapopulation; population decline; seabird; Antarctica; Aptenodytes forsteri; Spheniscidae; animal; Antarctica; climate change; forecasting; France; penguin; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Climate Change; Forecasting; Paris; Spheniscidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074847954

Yet while the risk is clear, with climate impacts occurring there more rapidly than many regions on Earth, integrated policy and planning for climate adaptation often remains a low priority for decision-makers. In an effort to extend the discussion and contribute to scholarship in this area, this paper explores climate change stressors and policy response in the coastal town Nome, Alaska. Through narratives of local government key actors and informed by strategic planning documents, this study sheds light on the decision dynamics around local climate change actions as well as preparedness for climate variability in general. In particular, this work highlights that thinning sea ice and thawing permafrost are both having an influence on life in Nome. Yet climate change adaptation remains a low priority for decision-makers, with the link to strategic policy often peripheral and not solutions orientated. As Nome is not unique in its need to adapt to climate change, findings from this work may provide communities experiencing similar climate stressors with awareness for the importance of incorporating adaptation thinking with long-term strategic policy and planning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate adaptation; climate change resilience; Coastal towns; community planning; local government decision-makers","adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone management; community resource management; decision making; environmental planning; local government; permafrost; sea ice; thawing; Alaska; Nome; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068573327

The physical-mechanical characteristics (density, moisture, and ash content) of chopped and milled reeds were investigated. The investigation of mill fractional compositions determined the largest amount of mill-reed mill, collected on the sieves of 0.63 mm (40.0%). The pellet moisture ranged from 10.79% to 6.32%, while the density was 1178.9 kg m−3 for dry matter (DM) of reed. The ash content of reed, bulrush and reed canary grass pellets was 3.17%, 5.88%, and 7.99%, respectively. The ash melting temperature ranged from 865 to 1411 ◦C; these temperatures were high enough for ash melting. The determined pellet calorific value varied from 17.4 to 17.9 MJ kg−1 DM. The disintegration force, indicating pellet strength, ranged from 324.25 N for reed canary grass to 549.24 N for reed. The determined emissions of harmful pollutants-CO2, CO, NOx, and unburnt hydrocarbons (CxHy)-did not exceed the maximum permissible levels. The assessment of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from technology showed that the CO2 equivalents ranged from 7.3 to 10.1 kg CO2-eq.

A particular kind of the sharing economy is bike-sharing systems which provide benefits for users, societies and the environment, suggesting sustainability could play an important role in their use. With this in mind, the purpose of this paper is to examine bike-sharing users through a three-tier framework, where sustainability is considered at multiple tiers, that is, micro (personality), mezzo (relations) and macro (system) tiers. In line with this proposition, the conceptual model is an extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), representing factors at the macro tier, that is, perceived sustainable usefulness and ease-of-use, influenced by bike quality. The effect of sustainable subjective norms on loyalty plays out at the mezzo tier, while sustainable extraversion is linked to loyalty at the micro tier. The model was tested on a sample of bike-sharing system users. The results show that bike quality positively influences perceived sustainable usefulness, but not ease-of-use; however, ease-of-use positively influences loyalty among users, while usefulness does not. In addition, sustainable subjective norms and sustainable extraversion have a significant positive effect on user bike-sharing system loyalty.

Spatially-resolved energy service demands were obtained for the city of Sao Paulo, and six scenarios were modelled. Results show that district cooling is cost-effective in the highest linear cooling density zones, with full penetration in zones with over 1100 kWh/m by 2050. This threshold diminishes with tighter carbon constraints. Heating is electrified in all scenarios, with electric boilers and air-source heat pumps being the main supply technologies for the domestic and commercial sectors respectively by 2050. In the most carbon constrained scenario with a medium decarbonised electricity grid, ground source heat pumps and hydrogen boilers appear as transition technologies between 2030 and 2045 for the commercial and domestic sectors respectively, reaching 95% and 40% of each sector's heat installed capacity in 2030. In the transport sector, ethanol cars replace gasoline, diesel, and compressed natural gas cars; compressed natural gas buses replace diesel and electric buses; and lorries continue using diesel. In carbon constrained scenarios, higher penetrations of electric cars and buses are obtained, while no change is observed for lorries. Finally, the most expensive scenario was only 6% more expensive than the reference scenario, meaning that achieving decarbonisation targets is not much costlier when comparing scenarios from a system-wide perspective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonisation; District cooling; Energy systems modelling; Heating; Spatially-resolved; Transport","Boilers; Buses; Carbon; Compressed natural gas; Cooling; Cooling systems; Cost effectiveness; Decarbonization; Diesel engines; District heating; Electric automobiles; Geothermal heat pumps; Heating; Urban transportation; Vehicle-to-grid; Decarbonisation; District cooling; Energy systems; Spatially resolved; Transport; Air source heat pumps; cooling; electricity; energy resource; ethanol; heating; hydrogen; natural gas; threshold; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079148224

The Appalachian Mountain region in the eastern United States is a global biodiversity hotspot for woodland salamanders (genus Plethodon), many of which are high-elevation endemic species. Robust assessments of the vulnerability of high-elevation endemic salamanders to climate change, including delineation of future potential climate refugia, are needed to guide climate change adaptations strategies. The Cow Knob Salamander (Plethodon punctatus) is a species of conservation concern found at high elevations in the Valley and Ridge Province of western Virginia and eastern West Virginia. We used habitat suitability models to examine relationships between landscape characteristics, climate variables, and P. punctatus occurrence, and estimated effects of future climate scenarios on the species’ climatic niche. We found that elevation, slope, aspect, and hillshade were influential landscape predictors of species occurrence, and that mean annual temperature was the most influential climate variable. Future climate projections indicated this species will likely lose most of its climatic niche by mid-century, and that amount of suitable habitat will continue to decline through 2100. We identified several pockets of habitat that may represent climate change refugia for P. punctatus due to cooler microclimates from greater hillshade and aspects that receive less direct solar radiation; however, we found these refugia exist in small, isolated habitat patches. Our study provides quantitative estimates that support the general concern that high-elevation endemic salamanders are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Our models can be used by natural resource managers to guide current P. punctatus monitoring and habitat conservation efforts, as well as to identify focal areas that will likely serve as refugia for the species as the climate continues to change over this century. © 2019 The Authors","Amphibian; Appalachia; Climate change; George Washington National Forest; Habitat suitability model; MaxLike",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076926933

For many rural communities, challenges to available capital, infrastructure and knowledge systems need to be identified to adequately address climate change adaptability. In this study, social capital and information networks are examined as local adaptation strategies to mitigate specific risks and vulnerabilities to wildfire. We examine survey data collected from 683 owner-occupied rural central Oregon households, where localized climate change manifestations present risks to residents through increased wildfire occurrence and severity. Results indicate that social network ties to professionals knowledgeable on climate change and/or wildfires have no statistical impact on perceptions of climate change or associated local risks. Such social network ties are, however, mediated by a social capital measure of governmental trust for climate change. Results also indicate residents with higher perceptions of adaptation capacity to mobilize for collective action had greater concern for localized risks while residents with higher views of community solidarity had less concern. Clarifying these relationships adds to our understanding of social networks, community level social capital, and concerns for generalized climate change versus localized manifestations of risk as adaptation strategies for forested rural communities. © 2020, AESS.","Climate change; Oregon; Rural communities; Social capital; Social networks; Wildfires","adaptive management; climate change; collective action; rural politics; rural population; social capital; social network; strategic approach; wildfire; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077604869

The author analyses eco-anthropocentric approach to city territories development in Russia and European countries. Now that ecological problems are becoming more acute and the climate is changing, this approach is the only possible for creation of comfortable and safe environment. This is the way to preserve biosphere for the next generations too. The article observes the legislation in Russia, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands in terms of obligatory measures to preserve the environment and people's participation in decision-making. The author has conducted sociological studies using questionnaire, focus-groups and interview to find out the respondents' attitude to actions of city government on developing the territories as well as the respondents' recommendations on organizing public hearings concerning city problems. City planners - scientists from research institutes and Master students from Moscow State University of Civil Engineering were the respondents. The author's conclusion is: the legislations of the observed European countries are more developed in terms of environmental protection and concern for people's well-being as compared to Russia. Russia doesn't have separate law on climatic changes. The sociological studies show critical attitude of Russian people to laws and governmental actions, though they haven't showed high activity and determination to act, which means the social consciousness hasn't yet become the base for transformations. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

In the last decade, an effort has been made to build city resilience and improve cities' capacity to respond to, recover from and adapt to climate change. However, certain city stakeholders' lack of proactive behavior has resulted in less effective city resilience-building strategies. In this sense, the importance of developing stakeholders' awareness of climate change in order to ensure proactivity is documented in the literature. However, there is a lack of studies that define how, when and what should be done to develop stakeholders' climate change awareness at a city scale. This paper presents a framework to develop stakeholders climate change awareness as a result of a systematic literature review and a co-creation process with the participation of 47 experts through a focus group and a Delphi study. The framework defines a four-step process and includes nine policies that seek to develop stakeholders' climate change awareness. The framework concludes determining the responsibilities of each stakeholder by defining the policies they should implement, and the effect one policy might cause on other stakeholders and among policies. © 2020 by the author.","Awareness development; City resilience; City stakeholders; Climate change; Co-creation; Framework; Policies","climate change; Delphi analysis; expert system; literature review; policy making; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082941408

Several ground-improvement techniques can be employed to counteract this issue. However, these methods are impractical in certain situations and unsustainable in others due to their economic and environmental impacts. Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) could provide a more sustainable alternative. Researchers have successfully used MICP to alter specific geotechnical properties of sands and silts. This research investigates the applicability of MICP via biostimulation to treat clayey soils with low to high plasticity. The goal is to determine the viability of this technique to alter the engineering behavior of clayey soils, especially given the low permeability of these soils. For this purpose, four soils were selected from four different locations in Idaho and Montana. The soils were selected such that their plasticity varied from low to high to study the effect of plasticity index on the effectiveness of MICP treatments. In addition to the four soils, three additional artificial mixes were studied to study the effect of clay content on MICP effectiveness.

Thirteen different future climate projection realizations from two general circulation models (GCMs: ECHAM5 and CCSM3) based on four emission scenarios (SRES A1B, A1FI, A2, and B1) were dynamically downscaled to 9-km resolution grids over eight watersheds in Northern California for a period of 90 water years (2010–2100). Analysis of daily precipitation over the eight watersheds showed that precipitation values obtained from dynamical downscaling of the 1981 to 1999 control runs of ECHAM5 and CCSM3 GCMs compared well with the PRISM data. Long-term future trends of annual and seasonal basin-average precipitation were investigated. Although a large variability exists for the projected annual basin-average precipitation within each of the 13 individual realizations, there was no significant long-term trend over the eight study watersheds except for the downward trend in the A1FI scenario. On the other hand, significant upward and downward trends were detected in the seasonal basin-average precipitation except in the winter months (January, February, and March). The trend analysis results in this study indicated the importance of considering seasonal variability, scenario, and model uncertainty. © IWA Publishing 2020.","Annual and seasonal precipitation; Dynamical downscaling; Future climate change; Regional climate model (RCM); Trend analysis; Watershed-scale","Climate change; Uncertainty analysis; Watersheds; Daily precipitations; Dynamical downscaling; Emission scenario; Future climate projections; General circulation model; Model uncertainties; Seasonal precipitations; Seasonal variability; Climate models; annual variation; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; downscaling; future prospect; general circulation model; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis; watershed; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083735524

About 90% of ammonia in the atmosphere comes from agricultural sources, so that improving farm practices in order to reduce these emissions is a priority. Airborne ammonia is the key precursor for particulate matter (PM2.5) that impairs human health, and ammonia can contribute to excess nitrogen that causes eutrophication in water and biodiversity loss in plant ecosystems. Reductions in excess nitrogen (N) from ammonia are needed so that farms use N resources more efficiently and avoid unnecessary costs. To support the adoption of ammonia emission mitigation practices, new sensor developments are required to identify sources, individual contributions, to evaluate the effectiveness of controls, to monitor progress towards emission-reduction targets, and to develop incentives for behavioural change. There is specifically a need for sensitive, selective, robust and user-friendly sensors to monitor ammonia from livestock production and fertiliser application. Most currently-available sensors need specialists to set up, calibrate and maintain them, which creates issues with staffing and costs when monitoring large areas or when there is a need for high frequency sampling. This paper reports advances in monitoring airborne ammonia in agricultural areas. Selecting the right method of monitoring for each agricultural activity will provide critical data to identify and implement appropriate ammonia controls. Recent developments in chemo-resistive materials allow electrochemical sensing at room temperature, and new spectroscopic methods are sensitive enough to determine low concentrations in the order of parts per billion. However, these new methods still compromise selectivity and sensitivity due to the presence of ambient dust and other interferences, and are not yet suitable to be applied in agricultural monitoring. This review considers how ammonia measurements are made and applied, including the need for sensors that are suitable for routine monitoring by non-specialists. The review evaluates how monitoring information can be used for policies and regulations to mitigate ammonia emissions. The increasing concerns about ammonia emissions and the particular needs from the agriculture sector are addressed, giving an overview of the state-of-the-art and an outlook on future developments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia; Fertiliser Application; Livestock production; Nitrogen losses; Sensors","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Emission control; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Monitoring; Nitrogen; Reduction; Sensors; Spectroscopic analysis; Agricultural activities; Agricultural monitoring; Electrochemical sensing; Emission reduction targets; High-frequency sampling; Livestock production; Nitrogen loss; Selectivity and sensitivity; Ammonia; ammonia; adaptive management; agricultural land; ammonia; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; fertilizer application; future prospect; livestock farming; mitigation; nitrogen; pollution policy; sensor; agriculture; air pollutant; colorimetry; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; fluorescence; human; interpersonal communication; nonhuman; photoacoustics; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; spectroscopy; technology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076459304

In this paper, we identify clusters of CO2 emissions across 72 countries. First, using the stochastic version of the IPAT and employing the dynamic common correlated effects technique, we identify three key determinants affecting CO2 emissions (non-renewables, population, and real GDP). In the second step, both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering methods are considered to identify the optimal number of clusters. We identify two to four clusters with different member countries, and in particular establish that in most cases, a 2-cluster solution appears to be optimal. The contents of clusters vary slightly according to the clustering methods for each period. The clustering results from using only the overall CO2 emissions indicate that the countries we consider form three clusters, with China and the USA each within a single member cluster. The remaining 70 countries form the third cluster. Our findings reflect the prominent roles of China and the USA in overall CO2 emissions. Analyses with sub-period and largest emitters reflect a different clustering structure. Some policy recommendations in setting emission reductions are made, considering different clusters across countries. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cluster analysis; CO2 emissions; Key determinants; Stochastic version of IPAT","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cluster analysis; empirical analysis; Gross Domestic Product; hierarchical system; pollution policy; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077083177

An automatic control system with a novel electronic circuit has been proposed to achieve this aim. This system consists of an on-line conductivity sensor and a conductivity monitor connected to an additional resistance to measure the concentrations of dissolved solids in boiler water. A square wave feedback has been employed to determine the levels of solid concentrations and controls the surface blow down process through electronic circuit. This circuit consists of a D.C power supply, an amplifier, a rectifier, comparators and a driver sub-circuits for solenoid valve. The driver sub-circuit consists of two transistors and three relays. The solenoid valve is used with throttle valve to control the flow rate of boiler blow down water. Two flow meters are used to measure blow down and feed water flow rates. The design and implementation of a heat recovery unit is also included. It consists of a heat exchanger (shell and coiled tube) type used to recover heat energy from blow down water. To measure the inlet and outlet temperatures of feed water and blow down water, four (k-type) thermocouples were used. A pump was used to pump feed water from the storage tank in to the boiler. To automatically control water level inside the boiler two electrodes (water level sensor) were used integrated with the float less level switch circuit. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the innovative control system in improving boiler efficiency and in fouling control through enhancing the blow down process and reducing indirect losses. The blow down quantity reduced from 2244.897 kg/h to 1111.111 kg/h. Which provided 27210.864 kg/day of blow down water. Hence, saved 158450201.2 ID/year or 83.16% of the energy lost with blow-down water can be recovered using heat-recovery unit with an energy saving of 103411.8 MJ/day. Which will save a mass of fuel equals to 482.46 ton/year. The automatic control system proved to be a good solution for saving energy and reducing harmful emissions to the environment and it contributes to the maintenance of sewage pipes from damage caused by the heat of discharged water. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082575342

Green technology implementation, based on optimal pricing decisions, has become an inevitability due to rising carbon emissions. We studied the profit-maximizing behavior of a firm considering whether to implement of green technology due to subsidies offered on emission-reduction rates. In order to achieve the desired results, we used a simulation-based model and developed a conceptual model for the verification of functions. When the product price was high, the firm achieved a high profit, which was the main focus of the firm. The firm thus had sufficient resources to implement green technology. However, when the product price was low, the firm could achieve its goal of profit maximization, but did so without implementing green technology. To solve this problem, we studied government involvement in the market to incentivize emissions reduction and to benefit the firm. We decided to model emissions-reduction policy to encourage the implementation of green technology and support firm profits. We found that subsidies enabled a firm to maximize its profits while ensuring green technology implementation, while the firm would not have adopted green technology without subsidies or mandates. This study should help decision makers understand pricing strategies in the maximization of the profit. Additionally, this study helps demonstrate that the government plays an important role in monopolized markets by reducing negative externalities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions-reduction policy; Green innovation; Monopoly; Pricing","Carbon; Commerce; Competition; Costs; Decision making; Emission control; Profitability; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Generating companies; Green innovations; Monopoly; Negative externalities; Profit maximization; Simulation-based modeling; Environmental technology; emission control; implementation process; innovation; monopoly; pollution policy; price dynamics; state role; subsidy system; sustainable development; article; conceptual model; government; profit; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076901628

Political actors across different ideological camps and parties are employing dispositional blame attribution, emphasizing the non-responsiveness of ‘corrupt elites’ to the needs of ‘good and honest’ people. In this paper, we focus on one specific and common area of blame attribution; climate change. In particular, in the United States, a central player in global climate governance, climate change is a very contested issue. The successes of populist candidates in both major US parties suggest that populism could affect citizen support for climate mitigation policies. The often abstract, elite-driven, and technical nature of climate change makes this issue an ideal target for populist critique. Our paper offers an empirical assessment of this claim. First, we test whether populism truly has an independent effect on people’s climate attitudes. Second, we assess to what extent frames about elite responsiveness are important heuristics for individuals in their formation of preferences concerning climate policies. To accomplish this goal, we fielded representative US surveys (N = 3000) and collected both observational and experimental data. Results suggest that populist attitudes enhance the effects of partisanship, rather than creating an independent, orthogonal dimension. Populist Democrats support climate policies more than non-populist Democrats do, whereas populist Republicans oppose such policies more than non-populist Republicans do. Additionally, while our experimental results indicate that populist treatments blaming elites for being non-responsive to citizens’ preferences do not affect policy support, we also find that reassuring individuals that political elites care about citizens’ needs and preferences in relation to climate policy increases support for the latter. Key policy insights Citizens’ support is central for implementing ambitious climate policies. Populist attitudes amplify partisanship effects on public opinion about climate policy. Populist discourse per se is not an obstacle to adopting ambitious climate policy in the US. Political entrepreneurs can foster support for climate policies by emphasizing elite responsiveness to citizens’ needs and preferences. Populist attacks on established elites are unlikely to derail support for climate policy. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; climate policy; Populism; public opinion; survey experiment","climate change; environmental policy; experimental study; populism; public attitude; survey method; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082430134

However, fractures or faults commonly exist in the rock mass, which provides the potential for CO2 leakage. To better understand the reactivation of preexisting fractures, it is essential to investigate fracture development and its effect on the stability of the rock. In this study, uniaxial compression tests were carried out on sandstone specimens by using a SANS rock mechanics servocontrolled testing system (MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN). Three kinds of Zunyi quartz-rich sandstone cylindrical specimens were tested, i.e., dry intact specimens, and both dry and brine-saturated specimens containing two preexisting faults. Based on the experimental results, the stress-strain curves and mechanical properties were analyzed and were closely related to the fault angle under both dry and saturated conditions. The macrofailure patterns can be classified into three modes: tensile coalescence failure, shear coalescence failure, and no coalescence failure. During the testing, a three-dimensional digital image correlation method was applied to the sandstone cylinders that contained two preexisting faults. Furthermore, acoustic emission (AE) sensors and strain gauges were bonded on the specimens to measure the AE signal and local strain in real time.

Energy integration in process plants effectively reduces energy consumption and pollutant emission. In a traditional energy integration concept, a heat exchanger network (HEN) is typically constructed for heat recovery between process streams. However, a large amount of medium-to-low-temperature surplus heat usually occurs in hot streams, where further internal heat integration is impossible, and is inevitably cooled by external cold source. Integrating organic Rankine cycle (ORC) into the process HEN is an effect way in further enhancing the energy recovery. However, the HEN, utility plant, and ORC are traditionally designed and optimized separately or sequentially, resulting in local energy integration or optimization. In the present study, ORC is integrated into a HEN to generate power energy from surplus heat. An improved superstructure is constructed and a mixed integer non-linear programming model is developed for the synthesis and simultaneous optimization of the integration system containing process-process HEN, hot utility-cold stream HEN, process hot stream-ORC HEN, steam utility plant, and cold utility plant. Two case studies of different scale in complexity are elaborated to validate the proposed methodology.

Existing studies make great effort to build and analyze ship emission inventory in a variety of ports by applying this method to historical ship trajectory data. This kind of static emission inventory however, cannot meet the needs of real-time ship emission monitoring. This article proposes a method of dynamic calculation of ship exhaust emissions based on real-time ship trajectory data. Firstly, real-time ship AIS messages are partitioned into continuous data blocks and go through a series of pre-processing operations, including trajectory extraction, association and interpolation. Ship activity parameters are then determined by database querying and regression analysis based on ship attributes. Subsequently, an improved activity-based methodology is employed to estimate exhaust emissions from ships in a distributed way. Based on the grid model, regional ship exhaust emissions can be statistically and dynamically calculated by the spatial allocation of all ship emissions. In a case study, a real-time monitoring platform for ship exhaust emissions in Shenzhen port is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AIS data stream; Dynamic inventory; Real-time calculation; Ship exhaust emission","Data streams; Query processing; Regression analysis; Trajectories; Dynamic calculations; Emission inventories; Exhaust emission; Improved activities; Pre-processing operations; Real time monitoring; Real-time calculations; Trajectory extraction; Ships; emission inventory; exhaust emission; monitoring; port; real time; tracking; vessel; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079660997

Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of R&D activities was ignored and the effect of domestic R&D on carbon intensity was discussed homogenously, that is, as a whole. Since R&D activities can be distinguished from stages and actors, we cannot obtain additional details such as the stages of R&D activities influencing carbon intensity. Additionally, regional differences were neglected. With these gaps in mind, the roles of R&D activities played in carbon intensity are deeply investigated by classifying them into different stages and actors. The empirical results based on a unique panel dataset from 2000 to 2016 imply that R&D can reduce carbon intensity and that carbon intensity is affected by R&D activities depending on its different stages and actors. The major positive role of R&D activities played in decreasing carbon intensity is generated through the activities at the experimental and developmental stages and industrial enterprises.

One of the methods for estimating climate change is the use of the simulation outputs of general circulation models (GCMs). However, due to the low resolution of these models, they are not applicable to regional and local studies and downscaling methods should be applied. The purpose of the present study was to use GCM models’ outputs for downscaling precipitation measurements at Amameh station in Latyan dam basin. For this purpose, the observation data from the Amameh station during the 1980–2005 period, 26 output variables from two GCM models, namely, HadCM3 and CanESM2 were used. Downscaling was performed by three data-driven methods, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), nonparametric K-nearest neighborhood (KNN) method, and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system method (ANFIS). Comparison of the monthly results showed the superiority of KNN compared to the other two methods in simulating precipitation.

In this study, statistical downscaling algorithms, based on both weather regimes and past analogues, are operated for 18 Israeli rain gauges with an altitude ranging between −200 and ~1,000 m above sea level (ASL). To project seasonal precipitation over Israel and its hydrologic basins, the algorithms are applied to six Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models for the end of the 21st century, according to the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The downscaled models can capture quite well the seasonal precipitation distribution, though with underestimation in winter and overestimation in spring. All models display a significant reduction of seasonal precipitation for the 21st century according to both scenarios. The winter reductions for the end of the century and the RCP8.5 scenario are found to be ~22 and ~37% according to the weather regimes and the analogues downscaling methods, respectively. Spring reductions are found to be ~10–20% larger than winter reductions. It is shown that the projected reduction results from a decrease in the frequency of the rain-bearing systems, as well as a decrease in the average daily precipitation intensity. The areas with the largest reductions in seasonal precipitation are found over the central mountains, the Mediterranean coastal area, and the Sea of Galilee hydrologic basins, which are the main fresh-water aquifers and reservoirs of Israel. The statistical downscaling methods applied in this study can be easily transferred to other regions where long-term data sets of observed precipitation are available. This study and others may serve as a basis for priority and policy setting toward better climate adaptation with associated uncertainties related to the methods used and nonstationary of the climate system. © 2019 The Authors.

High impervious cover exacerbates impacts of climate warming through urban heat island effects and of heavy rainfall by magnifying runoff and flooding. Concentration of human settlements along rivers and coastal zones increases exposure of people and infrastructure to climate change hazards, often disproportionately affecting those who are least prepared. Nature-based strategies (NBS), which use living organisms, soils and sediments, and/or landscape features to reduce climate change hazards, hold promise as being more flexible, multi-functional and adaptable to an uncertain and non-stationary climate future than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, future research should address the effectiveness of NBS for reducing climate change impacts and whether they can be implemented at scales appropriate to climate change hazards and impacts. Further, there is a need for accurate and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses that consider disservices and co-benefits, relative to grey alternatives, and how costs and benefits are distributed across different communities. NBS are most likely to be effective and fair when they match the scale of the challenge, are implemented with input from diverse voices and are appropriate to specific social, cultural, ecological and technological contexts. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Cities; Climate change adaptation; Green infrastructure; Nature-based strategies; Urban ecosystems","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; flooding; hazard assessment; heat island; mitigation; nature-society relations; population growth; rainfall; runoff; strategic approach; urban area; warming; city; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; flooding; heat; procedures; Cities; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Floods; Hot Temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078331215

Evacuated tube solar collectors are distributed over the villas’ roofs, while the hot water Lithium Bromide absorption chillers and hot phase change material thermal storage tanks are located in a centralized plant. Electrical heating elements embedded in the thermal storage tanks are considered as back up auxiliary sources in case of shortages. Using the “Design Builder” energy simulation program, a typical villa constructed as per the local thermal standard has been modeled to calculate the hourly thermal loads. These hourly profiles are the initial inputs for a Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) model integrated with the Generic Optimization Program (GenOpt). The interaction between these two programs is used to find the optimized sizing of the solar collectors’ area and the hot thermal storage volume which could achieve the maximum thermo-economic performance with a 100% solar fraction. The hourly transient simulations over a one-year period show that this system can achieve up to 82.67% reduction in the annual electrical consumption as well as carbon dioxide emissions if compared to conventional district thermal plants. Furthermore, the smart network benefits have been revealed from three different aspects: generation source, transmission loop network, and end-user consumer. The feasibility analysis performed shows that adopting the smart network can enhance the profitability of the project by 34.89% if compared to central solar plants.

The effects of power plant capacity, cooling system, solar multiple, and hours of thermal energy storage on the techno-economic performance of the power plants are examined. In addition, the environmental metrics including reduction of CO2 emissions, fossil fuel saving, and energy payback time are evaluated. Four power plant capacities of 20, 50, 100, and 200 MWe along with two cooling options, including dry and wet are investigated. Besides, the solar multiple and capacity of thermal energy storage are varied from 1.0 to 4.0 with a step of 0.1, and from 0 to 18 h with a step of 1 h, respectively. The ground weather data from the meteorological organization of Iran are used as input data in the System Advisor Model software. Based on the results, the optimal configurations for the studied power plants concerning the techno-economic parameters are determined. It is revealed that the dry-cooled solar tower power plant with a capacity of 100 MWe, 14 h storage system, and solar multiple of 3.0 is the most efficient configuration under the studied climatic conditions. For this concentrating solar power plant, the levelized cost of electricity and solar-to-electricity efficiency are 11.3 ¢/kWhe and 14.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the energy payback time is about 15 months, annual CO2 emissions reduction is 399 kilotons, and annual fossil fuel saving is 190 million cubic meters of natural gas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Environmental impact; Iran; Parabolic trough; SAM software; Solar tower; Techno-economic analysis","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Heat storage; Meteorology; Natural gasoline plants; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Thermal energy; Concentrating solar power; Iran; Parabolic trough; Solar towers; Techno-Economic analysis; Fossil fuel power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076759065

Shallow bottom boundaries reflect energy to the surface, which along with the lack of geothermal heat flux in current land surface models, alter the surface energy balance and therefore affect some feedback processes between the ground surface and the atmosphere, such as permafrost and soil carbon stability. To evaluate these impacts, we modified the subsurface model in the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) by setting a non-zero crustal heat flux bottom boundary condition uniformly across the model and by increasing the depth of the lower boundary from 42.1 to 342.1&thinsp;m. The modified and original land models were run during the period 1901-2005 under the historical forcing and between 2005 and 2300 under forcings for two future scenarios of moderate (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5; RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) emissions. Increasing the thickness of the subsurface by 300&thinsp;m increases the heat stored in the subsurface by 72&thinsp;ZJ (1&thinsp;ZJ&thinsp;Combining double low line&thinsp;10<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">21</span>&thinsp;J) by the year 2300 for the RCP4.5 scenario and 201&thinsp;ZJ for the RCP8.5 scenario (respective increases of 260&thinsp;% and 217&thinsp;% relative to the shallow model), reduces the loss of near-surface permafrost area in the Northern Hemisphere between 1901 and 2300 by 1.6&thinsp;%-1.9&thinsp;%, reduces the loss of intermediate-depth permafrost area (above 42.1&thinsp;m depth) by a factor of 3-5.5 and reduces the loss of soil carbon by 1.6&thinsp;%-3.6&thinsp;%. Each increase of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">20 mW m-2</span> of the crustal heat flux increases the temperature at 3.8&thinsp;m (the soil-bedrock interface) by <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">0.04±0.01</span>&thinsp;K. This decreases near-surface permafrost area slightly (0.3&thinsp;%-0.8&thinsp;%) and produces local differences in initial stable size of the soil carbon pool across the permafrost region, which reduces the loss of soil carbon across the region by as much as 1.1&thinsp;%-5.6&thinsp;% for the two scenarios. Reducing subsurface thickness from 42.1 to 3.8&thinsp;m, used by many LSMs, produces a larger effect than increasing it to 342.1&thinsp;m, because 3.8&thinsp;m is not enough to damp the annual signal and the subsurface closely follows the air temperature. We determine the optimal subsurface thickness to be 100&thinsp;m for a 100-year simulation and 200&thinsp;m for a simulation of 400 years. We recommend short-term simulations to use a subsurface of at least 40&thinsp;m, to avoid the perturbation of seasonal temperature propagation. © Author(s) 2020.

We addressed this question using a mouse model of cardiovascular disease by contrasting the health outcomes of exposures to particles formed or aged during periods of relatively high photochemical activity (i.e. spring/summer), which has increased ambient O3 concentrations, with outcomes of exposures to fall/winter particles which are associated with lower O3 concentrations. Electrocardiographs (ECGs) and blood pressures (BPs) were acquired following exposures to concentrated ambient particles (CAPs). ECGs were analyzed to changes in specific waveform parameters and changes in heart rate variability (HRV). Exposures elicited several types of waveform abnormalities that were associated with seasonal differences in particle constituents. Alterations in R-R interval and P-R interval were seen following exposure to summer CAPs but not fall CAPs and differential responses were seen in the corrected Q-T interval following the two seasonal exposures. Measures of HRV increased after exposure to summer CAPs compared to air-exposed controls but not following the winter CAPs exposure. There were chemical differences with respect to the organic constituents in ambient particles between summer and fall aerosol. The oxygen to carbon ratios (O:C) were generally higher in the spring and summer than in the fall, consistent with seasonal differences in atmospheric photochemical activity. Seasonal differences in atmospheric photochemical activity can modify ambient aerosol composition and can alter biological responses in the cardiovascular system. The results from this study confirm that ambient photochemical activity can alter the toxicity of ambient PM. Regional and seasonal differences in PM2.5 composition should be important considerations when evaluating the effects of PM exposure on cardiovascular health. Implications: Particles formed during periods of high photochemical activity (e.g. spring/summer) elicit more adverse cardiovascular health effects than particles formed during periods of low photochemical activity (e.g. fall/winter). Seasonal differences in atmospheric photochemical activity modified ambient aerosol composition and worsened cardiovascular responses. These results can inform regulatory agencies and may help design air quality regulations for PM2.5 that consider seasonal and regional variations. © 2020, © 2020 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Blood pressure; Health; Mammals; Air quality regulations; Cardio-vascular disease; Compositional difference; Differential response; Heart rate variability; Organic constituents; Oxygen-to-carbon ratio; Photochemical activity; Atmospheric aerosols; carbon; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; ozone; very low density lipoprotein; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air pollution; ambient air; animal experiment; animal model; atmosphere; cardiovascular effect; cardiovascular response; cardiovascular system; comparative study; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiography; environmental exposure; heart rate variability; heart rhythm; hyperlipidemia; mouse; nonhuman; outcome assessment; particle size; particulate matter; photochemistry; PR interval; priority journal; QT interval; RR interval; seasonal variation; spring; summer; systolic blood pressure; waveform; winter; air pollutant; animal; apolipoprotein E knockout mouse; cardiovascular system; drug effect; heart rate; hyperlipidemia; particulate matter; pathophysiology; season; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Animals; Cardiovascular System; Heart Rate; Hyperlipidemias; Mice, Knockout, ApoE; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079393134

The predominant biofuel in North America is ethanol produced from corn Zea mays. Corn is grown on ∼360,000 km2 of land in the U.S. and ∼40 % of the yield is used for ethanol production. Despite its prevalence, corn ethanol is a poor climate change mitigator and the spread of intensive corn agriculture also leads to the loss of biodiversity and an unknown complement of associated ecosystem services. To test for effects of land use intensity on the provision of ecosystem services from biofuel crops, we compared insect communities inhabiting long-term experiments in which land use intensity varied from annual corn production to less intensive native perennial biofuel crops (switchgrass and restored prairie) and unmanaged native forests. Within the experiments we focused on ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera), including their diversity, abundance, functional traits, and predation of biofuel crop pests. Native perennial biofuel crops supported up to 185 % more ant species than corn fields and provided up to 55 % more natural pest suppression. They also contained higher functional richness by supporting social parasites and seed dispersing ants that were absent in corn. Biofuel crops did not differ in ant activity or the prevalence of introduced ants. Our results highlight tradeoffs in bioenergy production and suggest ways to maximize benefits for wildlife and people. Converting some corn fields to prairie or other native vegetation could restore landscapes while mitigating climate change and meeting energy needs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cellulosic ethanol; Formicidae; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Pest suppression; Seed dispersal; Social parasites","ant; biodiversity; bioenergy; cellulose; climate change; ecosystem service; ethanol; experimental study; global climate; greenhouse gas; land use change; landscape ecology; maize; pest control; seed dispersal; social insect; trade-off; North America; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Hymenoptera; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075910331

The Amazon Vision programme, launched by the Colombian government in 2016, seeks to contribute to forest conservation, climate mitigation, poverty reduction and peace building. The Amazon Vision fundamentally reframes the Colombian Amazon from a 'narco frontier' that needs to be liberated from guerrilla influence, organized crime and peasants destroying forests for coca cultivation, to a net CO2 sink with enormous potential for green growth and poverty reduction. Drawing on historical and empirical qualitative research in Guaviare and complemented by a quantitative land cover classification, this article builds on the concept of 'green territoriality' to investigate the extent to which the shift towards conservation affects property rights and the ability of indigenous groups and peasants to access land and natural resources. We illustrate how the reframing of peasants from protagonists of development and frontier expansion to villains, and of indigenous communities from 'underdeveloped' forest dwellers to environmental guardians, has created land conflicts and affected the legitimacy of their respective property rights. In both cases, the Amazon Vision strengthens conservation policies and challenges existing land rights but also creates new windows of opportunity for the land claims of indigenous communities while reinforcing conceptualizations of social differentiation among dwellers of the Amazon. © 2020 Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin.

The present research investigated the dynamic operation of a solar desiccant cooling system coupled with a ground source heat exchanger (GSHE). Solar energy and GSHE were used as a heat source for regenerating the desiccant and a pre-cooling component, respectively. Simulations were conducted in hot-humid and moderate-humid climates. In hot-humid regions, the aim was to investigate the system operation, while the required regeneration temperatures were controlled to be below a maximum value. In moderate-humid regions, the objective was to regenerate the desiccant wheel entirely by solar energy. The effect of GSHE was evaluated on the provided thermal comfort. Moreover, the impact of desiccant wheel performance and the maximum regeneration temperature was assessed on the dehumidification of the desiccant wheel, system COP, established thermal comfort, and the solar fraction (SF). Results reveal that GSHE dramatically increased the achieved thermal comfort in both climatic conditions. Reduction in the desiccant wheel performance reduced the system COP and provided thermal comfort and daily-averaged SF. The decline in the maximum regeneration temperature decreased the established thermal comfort, but increased the system COP and daily-averaged SF. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Desiccant cooling system; Dynamic operation; Ground source heat exchanger; Solar energy; Thermal comfort","Driers (materials); Energy utilization; Heat exchangers; Humidity control; Solar energy; Solar water heaters; Thermal comfort; Thermoelectric equipment; Vapor compression refrigeration; Wheels; Climatic conditions; Desiccant cooling systems; Dynamic operations; Environmental issues; Ground source; Regeneration temperature; Total energy consumption; Vapor compression refrigeration system; Cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074842367

Recent warming is accelerating peatland permafrost thaw and thermokarst collapse, exposing previously frozen peat to microbial decomposition and potential mineralization into greenhouse gases. Here, we show from a site in the sporadic-discontinuous permafrost zone of western Canada that thermokarst collapse leads to neither large losses nor gains following thaw, as deep carbon losses are offset by surficial accumulation. We collected peat cores along two thaw chronosequences, from peat plateau, through young (~30 years since thaw), intermediate (~70 years), and mature (~200 years) thermokarst bog locations. Macrofossil and 14C analysis showed synchronicity of peatland development until recent thaw, with wetland initiation ~8,500 cal yr BP followed by succession through peatland stages prior to permafrost aggradation ~1,800 cal yr BP. Analysis and modeling of soil carbon stocks indicated 8.7 ± 12.4 kg C m−2 of carbon accumulated prior to thaw was lost in ~200 years post-thaw. Despite these losses, there was no observed increase in peat humification as assessed by Fourier transform infrared and C:N ratios. Rapid peat accumulation post-thaw (9.8 ± 1.6 kg C m−2 over 200 years) offset deeper losses. Our approach constrains the net carbon balance to be between uptake of 27.3 g C m−2 yr−1 and loss of 106.6 g C m−2 yr−1 over 200 years post-thaw. While our approach cannot determine whether thermokarst bogs in the sporadic-discontinuous permafrost zone act as long-term carbon sinks or sources post-thaw, our study better constrains post-thaw C losses and gains. ©2020.

To address this problem, this study aims to develop an implementation plan of low-carbon resilient cities. A theoretical framework is designed to analyze integrated strategies and key performance indicators for low-carbon resilient cities. Two related schemes, the “SIEGE” scheme and “5P” scheme, are provided to assist in the planning and governance. Challenges for implementing a low-carbon resilience approach are discussed from institutional, regulatory, financial, technical and communication perspectives. Guided by the theoretical frameworks and practical strategies, cities will be able to move towards social equality, energy-efficiency, hazards preparedness, governing-effectiveness and innovation. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Climate change; Low-carbon resilient city; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)","Benchmarking; Carbon; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Energy efficiency; Hazards; Planning; Sustainable development; Integrated strategy; Key performance indicators; Low carbon; Theoretical framework; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; communication; disaster management; energy efficiency; mitigation; natural disaster; performance assessment; policy implementation; strategic approach; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080855802

Oxygen availability and the presence of co-contaminants are potentially important factors affecting CH4 oxidation rate and the fate of CH4-derived carbon. In this study, microbial populations that oxidize CH4 and the subsequent conversion of CH4-derived carbon into CO2, soil organic C and biomass C were investigated in landfill cover soils at two O2 tensions, i.e., O2 concentrations of 21% (“sufficient”) and 2.5% (“limited”) with and without toluene. CH4-derived carbon was primarily converted into CO2 and soil organic C in the landfill cover soils, accounting for more than 80% of CH4 oxidized. Under the O2-sufficient condition, 52.9%–59.6% of CH4-derived carbon was converted into CO2 (CECO2-C), and 29.1%–39.3% was converted into soil organic C (CEorganic-C). A higher CEorganic-C and lower CECO2-C occurred in the O2-limited environment, relative to the O2-sufficient condition. With the addition of toluene, the carbon conversion efficiency of CH4 into biomass C and organic C increased slightly, especially in the O2-limited environment. A more complex microbial network was involved in CH4 assimilation in the O2-limited environment than under the O2-sufficient condition. DNA-based stable isotope probing of the community with 13CH4 revealed that Methylocaldum and Methylosarcina had a higher relative growth rate than other type I methanotrophs in the landfill cover soils, especially at the low O2 concentration, while Methylosinus was more abundant in the treatment with both the high O2 concentration and toluene. These results indicated that O2-limited environments could prompt more CH4-derived carbon to be deposited into soils in the form of biomass C and organic C, thereby enhancing the contribution of CH4-derived carbon to soil community biomass and functionality of landfill cover soils (i.e. reduction of CO2 emission). O2-limited environments could prompt more CH4-derived carbon to be assimilated and sequestered in landfill cover soils, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Landfill cover soils; Methane oxidation; Methane-derived carbon; Methanotrophs; Oxygen concentration; Stable isotope probing","Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Growth rate; Isotopes; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Soils; Toluene; Derived carbons; Landfill-cover soils; Methane oxidation; Methanotrophs; Oxygen concentrations; Stable-isotope probing; Soil pollution; carbon; isotope; methane; oxygen; toluene; carbon; methane; oxygen; landfill; methane; methanotrophy; microbial community; oxidation; oxygen; soil carbon; soil cover; soil pollution; stable isotope; biomass; concentration (parameter); controlled study; growth rate; landfill; methanotroph; Methylosinus; microbial community; nonhuman; soil chemistry; chemistry; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; waste disposal facility; Methylocaldum; Methylococcaceae; Methylosarcina; Methylosinus; Carbon; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076239719

Variation in KS has implications for plant transpiration and photosynthesis, growth and survival, and also the geographic distribution of species. Clarifying the global-scale patterns of KS and its major drivers is needed to achieve a better understanding of how plants adapt to different environmental conditions, particularly under climate change scenarios. Here, we compiled a xylem hydraulics dataset with 1,186 species-at-site combinations (975 woody species representing 146 families, from 199 sites worldwide), and investigated how KS varied with climatic variables, plant functional types, and biomes. Growing-season temperature and growing-season precipitation drove global variation in KS independently. Both the mean and the variation in KS were highest in the warm and wet tropical regions, and lower in cold and dry regions, such as tundra and desert biomes. Our results suggest that future warming and redistribution of seasonal precipitation may have a significant impact on species functional diversity, and is likely to be particularly important in regions becoming warmer or drier, such as high latitudes. This highlights an important role for KS in predicting shifts in community composition in the face of climate change. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biome; climate; functional types; hydraulic diversity; species distribution; water transport","biome; climate change; community composition; community response; functional role; future prospect; geographical distribution; global perspective; growing season; hydraulic conductivity; photosynthesis; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; transpiration; warming; xylem; water; evapotranspiration; season; temperature; xylem; Plant Transpiration; Seasons; Temperature; Water; Xylem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076357753

In this paper, we investigate how import tariff reduction in CAFTA affects the importers' pollution emissions, using the firm-level data of Chinese manufacturing from 2002 to 2007. The mechanisms of import tariff reduction in CAFTA on pollution emissions are divided into technique, composition and scale effects. Our results indicate that import tariff reduction in CAFTA on final goods is conductive to importers' pollution reduction, whereas that on intermediates significantly aggravates importers' pollution emissions. Moreover, import tariff reduction has heterogeneous impacts on different types of enterprises in terms of industries, ownership, and region. Our results also find that the state-owned importers' emissions can hardly be affected through technique, composition and scale effects. © 2020 by the authors.

Considering the carbon trading scheme and different air pollutant control technologies, this paper proposes an environmental economic dispatch model for the coordinated operation of an integrated regional energy system, which consists of a regional electricity supply network and a natural gas network, along with district energy hubs. Each energy hub contains a combined heat and power unit, a CO2-capture-based power to gas facility, a heat pump, a gas furnace and different energy storage facilities. To achieve an optimized balance between operational cost and emissions during the environmental economic dispatch of this integrated regional energy system, a price-based integrated demand response program is introduced in the energy hub. Then the proposed model is converted into a mixed-integer linear programming problem to find solutions efficiently. Case studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed environmental economic dispatch model of the integrated regional energy system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy hub; Environmental economic dispatch; Integrated demand response; Integrated regional energy system","Air pollution; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Scheduling; Combined heat and power units; Demand response; Demand response programs; Electricity supply network; Energy hubs; Environmental economics; Mixed integer linear programming problems; Regional energy systems; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072014035

But plenty of equipment in monitoring network inevitably result in financial costs. With this consideration, this study aims to explore some strategies for prediction instead of measurement. To do so, the relationships within PM2.5 and PM10 monitoring networks are first explored respectively. Then the relationship between PM2.5 with PM10 monitoring networks is also investigated. Based on these identified relationships, three prediction strategies are proposed and PM2.5 concentration is selected for predictions. The results verified that PM2.5 concentration can be well estimated under these strategies, in particular the local strategy based on the local pollutants and mixed strategy based on the local and surrounding pollutants. That means, without measurement, the pollution levels of some pollutants can be successfully determined through prediction. These findings provide a possibility to estimate the missing or unmonitored values in term of the available data at surrounding stations. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air quality monitoring network; Cluster analysis; Generalised regression neural network; PM10; PM2.5",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076847356

The modeling system, a coupled regional climate-air quality model (CWRFCMAQ; Climate-Weather Research Forecast and the Community Multiscale Air Quality), captured well the summer surface ozone pollution during the past decades, having a mean slope of linear regression with AQS observations of ~ 0.75. While the AQS network has limited spatial coverage and measures only a few key chemical species, CWRF-CMAQ provides comprehensive simulations to enable a more rigorous study of the change in ozone pollution and chemical sensitivity. Analysis of seasonal variations and diurnal cycle of ozone observations showed that peak ozone concentrations in the summer afternoon decreased ubiquitously across the United States, up to 0.5 ppbv yr-1 in major non-attainment areas such as Los Angeles, while concentrations at certain hours such as the early morning and late afternoon increased slightly. Consistent with the AQS observations, CMAQ simulated a similar decreasing trend of peak ozone concentrations in the afternoon, up to 0.4 ppbv yr-1, and increasing ozone trends in the early morning and late afternoon. A monotonically decreasing trend (up to 0.5 ppbv yr-1) in the odd oxygen (Ox=O3+NO2) concentrations are simulated by CMAQ at all daytime hours. This result suggests that the increased ozone in the early morning and late afternoon was likely caused by reduced NO-O3 titration, driven by continuous anthropogenic NOx emission reductions in the past decades. Furthermore, the CMAQ simulations revealed a shift in chemical regimes of ozone photochemical production. From 1990 to 2015, surface ozone production in some metropolitan areas, such as Baltimore, has transited from a VOC-sensitive environment (&gt; 50 % probability) to a NOx-sensitive regime. Our results demonstrated that the long-term CWRF-CMAQ simulations can provide detailed information of the ozone chemistry evolution under a changing climate and may partially explain the US ozone pollution responses to regional and national regulations. © Author(s) 2020.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; mesoscale meteorology; numerical model; ozone; regional climate; summer; trend analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082039990

We have reported in previous work that organic matter was generated in micro-orifices after water flowed through the orifice, and we proposed that the organic matter was synthesized from nonorganic materials, including CO2 and N2 dissolved in water from air, and water via the action of hydroxyl radicals produced by the flow through the micro-orifice. In the present study, we examined whether organic materials are produced in the water outside of the orifices in addition to that in the orifice. We used the decrease in water volume to measure the organic synthesis because water should be consumed during the synthesis, and thus the decrease in water volume should reflect the organic synthesis. We let ultrapure water containing dissolved air flow through a micro-orifice as a pre-flow, we stopped the flow, and then we measured the volume of water enclosed in the mount in which the micro-orifice was set over more than 100 h. The volume of water decreased gradually and substantially over time. We used Raman and infrared spectroscopy to analyze the residue obtained by evaporating the water present around the orifice. The residue contained organic matter, including carotenoids, amides, esters, and sugars, which were similar to those found in the membranes generated in the orifice in our previous paper, suggesting that the organic matter was synthesized in a wide region of water around the orifice as well as in the orifice. These results may be relevant to the origins of life and biology, and may lead to the development of a technology for reducing CO2 in air, as well as applications in many scientific and engineering fields. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon dioxide; Carotenoid; Chemical engineering; Materials chemistry; Micro-orifice; Organic chemistry; Organic matter; Physical chemistry; Synthesis; Water flow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082013658

Unresolved aspects of this relationship include what causes it, whether it permeates to community diversity at smaller spatial scales, whether it is accompanied by patterns in functional and phylogenetic diversity as some hypotheses predict, and whether it is paralleled by climate-driven changes in diversity over time. Here, studies of Californian plants are reviewed and new analyses are conducted to synthesize climate-diversity relationships in space and time. Across spatial scales and organizational levels, plant diversity is maximized in more productive (wetter) climates, and these consistent spatial relationships are mirrored in losses of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity over time during a recent climatic drying trend. These results support the tolerance and climatic niche conservatism hypotheses for climate-diversity relationships, and suggest there is some predictability to future changes in diversity in water-limited climates. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Tropical coastal wetlands are considered important in this context, yet knowledge of their dynamics and quantitative data are still scarce. In order to quantify the C accumulation rate and understand how it is influenced by land use and climate change, a palaeoecological study was conducted in the mangrove-fringed Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL) in Java, Indonesia. A sediment core was age-dated and analyzed for its pollen and spore, elemental and biogeochemical compositions. The results indicate that environmental dynamics in the SAL and its C accumulation over the past 400 years were controlled mainly by climate oscillations and anthropogenic activities. The interaction of these two factors changed the lagoon's sediment supply and salinity, which consequently altered the organic matter composition and deposition in the lagoon. Four phases with varying climates were identified. While autochthonous mangrove C was a significant contributor to carbon accumulation in SAL sediments throughout all four phases, varying admixtures of terrestrial C from the hinterland also contributed, with natural mixed forest C predominating in the early phases and agriculture soil C predominating in the later phases. In this context, climate-related precipitation changes are an overarching control, as surface water transport through rivers serves as the “delivery agent” for the outcomes of the anthropogenic impact in the catchment area into the lagoon. Amongst mangrove-dominated ecosystems globally, the SAL is one of the most effective C sinks due to high mangrove carbon input in combination with a high allochthonous carbon input from anthropogenically enhanced sediment from the hinterland and increased preservation. Given the substantial C sequestration capacity of the SAL and other mangrove-fringed coastal lagoons, conservation and restoration of these ecosystems is vitally important for climate change mitigation. © 2019 The Authors.

However, urban PM is affected by local primary emissions, transport, and secondary formation; therefore, advanced methods are needed to elucidate the complex sources and transport patterns. Here, an improved source apportionment method was developed by incorporating the receptor model, Lagrangian simulation, and emissions inventories to quantify PM2.5 sources for an industrial city in China. PM2.5 data including ions, metals, organic carbon, and elemental carbon were obtained by analyzing 1 year of sampling results at urban and rural sites. This method identified coal combustion (30.64%), fugitive dust (13.25%), and vehicles (12.51%) as major primary sources. Secondary sources, including sulfate, nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols also contributed strongly (25.28%–30.76% in total) over urban and rural areas. Hebei Province was the major regional source contributor (43.05%–57.51%) except for fugitive dust, on which Inner Mongolia had a greater impact (43.51%). The megacities of Beijing and Tianjin exerted strong regional impacts on the secondary nitrate and secondary organic aerosols factors, contributing 11.32% and 15.65%, respectively. Pollution events were driven largely by secondary inorganic aerosols, highlighting the importance of reducing precursor emissions at the regional scale, particularly in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. Overall, our results demonstrate that this novel method offers good flexibility and efficiency for quantifying PM2.5 sources and regional contributions, and that it can be extended to other cities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","FLEXPART; PM2.5; Positive matrix factorization (PMF); Secondary sources; Source apportionment","Aerosols; Coal combustion; Coal dust; Factorization; Industrial emissions; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Rural areas; Sulfur compounds; Urban growth; Urban transportation; FLEXPART; PM2.5; Positive Matrix Factorization; Secondary sources; Source apportionment; Air pollution; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; industrial location; Lagrangian analysis; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; sampling; source apportionment; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077465019

The results show that increased FDI can reduce environmental pollution, confirming the existence of the “pollution halo hypothesis”; technological innovation can reduce the emissions of sulfur dioxide and smoke dust but increase the chemical oxygen demand. Therefore, vigorous introduction of foreign capital is good for sustainable development for government, but it is also necessary to pay attention to screening and identifying environment-friendly enterprises with advanced production technology and management experience and to reject high-pollution and high-energy-consuming enterprises eliminated by developed countries. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental pollution; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Spatial Durbin model; Spatial interdependence; Technological innovation","economic conditions; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental quality; foreign direct investment; spatial analysis; China; carbon dioxide; chemistry; China; economic development; international cooperation; investment; pollution; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Internationality; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077208464

Due to limited space available in landfills, as well as difficulties involved in using excess sludge in agriculture, there is a need for alternative disposal methods. Although anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used in processing sludge, only partial energy recovery from methane and sludge volume reduction can be achieved, resulting in a substantial amount of sludge remaining, which needs to be disposed of. Direct incineration after sludge drying is one possible option, a practice that is already in place in some cities in China. A comparison between direct incineration and conventional AD (with or without pretreatment by thermal hydrolysis) has to be made with respect to the energy balance and investment & operational (I & O) costs. This comparison reveals direct incineration to have the lowest energy deficit and I & O costs. Therefore, it is expected that direct incineration without AD will become the preferred sustainable approach to handling sludge. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Direct incineration; Energy deficit; Investment & operational costs; Sludge disposal; Sludge drying","Anaerobic digestion; Costs; Drying; Incineration; Investments; Sludge disposal; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Disposal methods; Energy deficit; Energy recovery; Limited space; Pre-Treatment; Sludge drying; Sludge volumes; Thermal hydrolysis; Sludge digestion; methane; nitrogen oxide; anaerobic digestion; energy balance; hydrolysis; incineration; methane; sludge; sustainability; waste disposal; wastewater treatment; anaerobic digestion; bottom ash; China; controlled study; energy balance; energy consumption; energy recovery; environmental impact; hydrolysis; incineration; moisture; priority journal; Review; sludge dewatering; sludge disposal; sludge drying; sludge reduction; urban area; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; city; sewage; China; Anaerobiosis; China; Cities; Incineration; Methane; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075015769

The actual fuel and electricity energy consumption of PHEVs has recently attracted increasing attention. Distance-based average electricity or fuel consumption is commonly adopted to evaluate the energy efficiency of a vehicle. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on the ratio of electric drive distance to fuel drive distance and did not consider the difference between the electricity generated from onboard engine and offboard grid charging. This study proposes a grid electric driving ratio (grid-EDR) based on the battery energy variation under real road operation conditions for a more accurate calculation of the PHEV electric distance ratio. The method is validated by the actual vehicle driving data of 49 PHEVs in Shanghai and compared with other methods. To evaluate its application, the fuel substitution was calculated using grid-EDR combined with the new European driving cycle fuel consumption calculation method. PHEVs with higher grid-EDRs demonstrate better fuel economy. More than half the PHEVs in this study saved 50–80% of their onboard fuel. By improving the charging frequency, such as constructing more charging infrastructure, grid-EDR can be increased to 0.88 to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Battery state of charge (SOC); Fuel substitution; Grid electric driving ratio; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)","electric vehicle; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; model validation; smart grid; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073973055

The ice-storage district cooling system is believed as an effective approach to provide flexibility for hydropower utilization. However, the existing ice-storage operation strategies in demand-side management cause that the ice storage cannot be adjusted in real-time to match the surplus hydropower, which brings difficulties for large-scale hydropower utilization. Therefore, this paper proposed the integration of ice-storage district cooling systems into power dispatch based on smart grid. Two operation strategies were developed for the integration to achieve power supply-side management of ice-storage district cooling system. One is the new ice-storage power-linked operation strategy, which was proposed to determine the ice storing/ melting capacity in the power dispatch. The other one is the cooling pipelines dynamic-characteristics-considered operation strategy, which was applied in the power dispatch. The dynamic characteristics were calculated based on a linear model to be compatible with the linear constraints in power dispatch models. Finally, effects of two strategies were studied by taking scenes in Chongqing as the example. Results showed that the application of the first strategy only reduces the hydropower curtailment frequency, while application of the second strategy reduces both the curtailment frequency and amount.

This study explores the effect of multiple injections on knock, engine efficiency and stability, and particulate number and gaseous emissions on a single-cylinder DISI research engine. Work to date on multiple injections in the literature is reviewed, and then two aspects of multiple injection strategies are experimentally investigated: the number of injections (up to five times in a cycle); and the timing of the injections (classified relative to the timing of intake valve opening and closing). A boosted, single-cylinder research engine equipped with a state-of-the-art piezoelectric hollow cone spray direct injector and research-grade E10 gasoline was used for the study. The results show multiple injections maintain torque and combustion stability compared with single injection and slightly increase the knock limits and indicated thermal efficiencies (maximum 0.7% absolute, 2.8% relative compared with single-injection baseline) due to improved heat release phasing, especially with an additional late injection during the intake valve closed (compression stroke) period. The gaseous pollutant emissions including nitrogen oxides and unburned hydrocarbons were reduced by 25% with multiple injections, particularly with injection during the compression stroke. In contrast, carbon monoxide emissions increased with multiple injections for all conditions. Increasing the number of injection events significantly reduced particulate number emissions (half with each additional injection), and the decrease in particulate number was not sensitive to the injection timing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Injection region; Knock limit extension; Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions; Number of injections; Particulate number; Split injection","Carbon monoxide; Combustion knock; Efficiency; Engine cylinders; Fog; Intake valves; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Carbon monoxide emissions; Direct injection spark ignition engines; Indicated thermal efficiency; Knock limits; Particulate matter emissions; Particulate number; Single-cylinder research engines; Split injection; Direct injection; carbon monoxide; combustion; emission; engine; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; performance assessment; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078830671

However, the abundance, diversity and succession of denitrifying bacteria and their association with farming systems are largely unknown. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were: (1) to unravel the influence of long-term organic farming on diversity of nirK-, nirS- and nosZ-type denitrifying microorganisms; and (2) to analyze the association of diversity and abundance of these denitrifying microorganism with the emission of N2O from soil. The abundance and diversity of denitrifying bacteria with nirK, nirS and nosZ were compared among organic (ORG), integrated (INT), and conventional (CON) vegetable greenhouses located in northern China over four growing seasons using quantitative PCR and high-throughput DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified products. As compared to CON, the abundance of nosZ gene was significantly higher in the ORG, in which the N2O emission was 35% lower. In general, both abundance and diversity of nitrite reducing populations (nirK- and nirS-type) was influenced by growing seasons rather than farming systems. Additionally, dominant denitrifying populations displayed irregular, periodical, or persistent succession patterns. Co-occurrence network revealed that nirK-, nirS- and nosZ-type denitrifying bacteria formed microbial hubs associated with soil temperature, NO3 −-N content, or pH. In summary, long-term organic farming enriched N2O reducing bacterial populations, while having little effect on nitrite reducing populations which mainly succeeded seasonally. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Abundance; Denitrifying bacteria; Diversity; High-throughput sequencing; Organic farming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078461311

Many countries are looking for more effective solutions and methods to reduce carbon emissions. There are effective factors in the scheduling passenger and freight trains in the inter-city rail transport industry such as number of trains requested at the station, the number of stops, delays and waiting times for trains at the station which lead to increased fossil fuel consumption and carbon emission. In this paper, we want to present a new mixed integer non-linear model that can choose the best schedule for movement of passenger and freight shuttle trains on a single-line route of the railway network with the least environmental pollution. In this model, the carbon emission factor is based on the weight and prioritization of passenger and freight trains. Also, the average number of demands for using trains at a station and the number of planned or non-planned stops and delays at the middle stations are considered. Also, the proposed model selects the best plan for moving trains with the lowest carbon emissions caused by fuel consumption. To validate the proposed model, a case study of a crowded passenger and freight route of an inter-city railway network in Iran will be solved. We solve the real studied problem using the GAMS v24.9.1 optimization software with BARON solver. Finally, after sensitivity analysis of the results, we demonstrate the convenient and efficient performance of the same model in solving the raised problems in an applied manner. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Inter-city rail transport network; Prioritization of trains; Shuttle train single-line route; Stop and delay times; Sustainable development; Trains trip planning","Carbon; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Scheduling; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Delay Time; Prioritization; Rail transport; Shuttle train single-line route; Trip planning; Freight cars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075833872

The bioavailable iron fraction depends on the emission source and the dissolution during transport. The impacts of anthropogenic combustion and land use change on emissions from industrial, domestic, shipping, desert, and wildfire sources suggest that Northern Hemisphere soluble iron deposition has likely been enhanced between 2% and 68% over the Industrial Era. If policy and climate follow the intermediate Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 trajectory, then results suggest that Southern Ocean (&gt;30°S) soluble iron deposition would be enhanced between 63% and 95% by 2100. Marine net primary productivity and carbon export within the open ocean are most sensitive to changes in soluble iron deposition in the Southern Hemisphere; this is predominantly driven by fire rather than dust iron sources. Changes in iron deposition cause large perturbations to the marine nitrogen cycle, up to 70% increase in denitrification and 15% increase in nitrogen fixation, but only modestly impacts the carbon cycle and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (1–3 ppm). Regionally, primary productivity increases due to increased iron deposition are often compensated by offsetting decreases downstream corresponding to equivalent changes in the rate of phytoplankton macronutrient uptake, particularly in the equatorial Pacific. These effects are weaker in the Southern Ocean, suggesting that changes in iron deposition in this region dominates the global carbon cycle and climate response. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Organic additives (OAs) have emerged as highly efficient and environment-friendly immobilizers to eradicate Cd contamination in a wide range of environments. This review article is intended to critically illustrate the role of different OAs in Cd immobilization and to highlight the key findings in this context. Owing to the unique structural features (high surface area, cation exchange capacity (CEC), presence of many functional groups), OAs have shown strong capability to remediate Cd polluted soils by adsorption, electrostatic interaction, complexation and precipitation. Research data is compiled about the efficiency of different OAs (bio-waste, biochar, activated carbon, composts, manure, and plant residues) applied alone or in combination with other amendments in stabilization and renovation of contaminated sites. In addition to their role in remediation, OAs are widely advocated for being classical sources of essential plant nutrients and as agents to improve the soil health and quality which has also been focused in this review. OAs may contain considerable amounts of metals and therefore it becomes essential to assess their final contribution. Elimination of Cd contamination is essential to attenuate the contaminant effect and to produce the safe food. Therefore, deployment of environment-friendly remediation strategies (alone or in combination with other suitable technologies) should be adopted especially at early stages of contamination. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Animal waste; Biochar; Metal uptake; Precipitation; Soil amelioration; Stabilization","Activated carbon; Additives; Agricultural wastes; Cadmium; Composting; Contamination; Fertilizers; Precipitation (chemical); Remediation; Soils; Stabilization; Animal wastes; Bio chars; Cation exchange capacities; Environment friendly; Metal uptake; Remediation strategies; Soil amelioration; Structural feature; Soil pollution; biochar; cadmium; charcoal; unclassified drug; cadmium; additive; biochar; cadmium; contaminated land; feces; immobilization; organic soil; precipitation (chemistry); soil pollution; soil remediation; soil stabilization; bioremediation; biosolid; controlled study; manure; microbial community; nonhuman; organic waste; phytotoxicity; plant; priority journal; Review; soil; ecosystem restoration; pollution; soil; soil pollutant; Animalia; Cadmium; Charcoal; Environmental Pollution; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076835666

Methods This retrospective study analyzed data from the National Emergency Department Information System of Korea. We retrospectively reviewed cases of acute poisonings between April 2006 and March 2015 recorded at 13 emergency departments in eight different cities of Gyeong-gi-do province in Korea. The differences in the incidence, age distribution, causative agent, and clinical course of poisonings among regions were the main outcomes measured. Results The proportion of poisonings in the ≤ 9 age group was high in Yongin (17.44%) and that in ≥ 65 age group was high in Gwangmyeong (21.76%). The proportion of cases involving carbon monoxide was high in Ansan (8.82%) in patients hospitalized and the proportion of cases involving pesticides was high in Pyeongtaek (52.78%) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The admission rate of poisoned patients was high in Osan (36.02%). Conclusion In this study, differences in the characteristics of poisoned patients between 8 cities were noted. Therefore, hospitals need to arrange treatment resources for poisoned patients according to the characteristics of the specific region. The results of this study may serve as evidence for new strategies to prepare for the acute poisonings in hospitals. © 2020 The Korean Society of Emergency Medicine.","Acute disease; Epidemiologic studies; Poisoning; Republic of Korea","acute disease; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; disease course; drug intoxication; emergency ward; female; human; intensive care unit; Korea; major clinical study; male; retrospective study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083293678

The Cheliff is under the influence of a semi-arid climate with precipitation that ranges from about 600 mm year−1 to the northeast and 300 mm year−1 to the west and south of the basin. The daily rainfall data used in this study concern eleven stations covering varying periods representative of different rainfall regimes in the Cheliff basin. The results obtained showed that the monthly dry sequences encountered during the rainy season decrease when the number of dry days increases, and the maximum values have been observed for the number of 1 to 7 consecutive dry days and the values were observed for a number greater than or equal to 21 consecutive dry days. It is important to say that the month of February recorded the lowest value of consecutive dry days for all stations. Also, the western stations of the study area display the largest values of the lengths of the dry sequences.

PM2.5 samples were collected on quartz filters during cold (December 2018–February 2019) and warm (May 2019–July 2019) seasons at the Municipality of Bareggio, a small town located approximately 14 km northwest of the Milan city center. The PM2.5 constituents were chemically analyzed, and its corresponding oxidative potential was measured by means of the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Total PM2.5 mass concentration was significantly higher in winter (71.82 ± 4.17 μg/m3) compared to summer (16.67 ± 0.27 μg/m3), mainly a result of enhanced biomass burning emissions combined with higher atmospheric stability and lower mixing during the cold season. The enhanced biomass burning activities during the winter period also resulted in very high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations (72.81 ± 16.59 ng/m3) which were more than 150-fold higher than the warm period values (0.40 ± 0.07 ng/m3). PAH concentrations were highly correlated with chemical markers of biomass burning (i.e., levoglucosan (R2 = 0.79), and K+/K (R2 = 0.87)) in the winter period. Spearman correlation analysis between DTT and PM2.5 chemical species showed a dominant role of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and vehicular emissions in summer-time PM2.5 oxidative potential (i.e., the capacity of PM2.5 species to oxidize target molecules), while in the wintertime, the DTT values were highly correlated with chemical markers of biomass burning, vehicular activities, and re-suspended road dust. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis identified biomass burning (41%) as the dominant contributor to DTT, followed by SOA (20%), re-suspended road dust (18%), and vehicular emissions (16%). Our results underscore the importance of biomass burning to the overall oxidative potential of PM2.5 in the metropolitan area of Milan, urging the need to promulgate effective mitigation policies targeting these emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass burning; Dithiothreitol (DTT); Milan; Oxidative potential; Po valley; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)","Biomass; Chemical analysis; Dust; Linear regression; Mineral oils; Molecules; Roads and streets; Biomass-burning; Dithiothreitol; Milan; Oxidative potential; PO Valley; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; dithiothreitol; levoglucosan; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; concentration (composition); filter; metropolitan area; oxidative stress; PAH; particulate matter; quartz; small town; Article; biomass; chemical analysis; cold climate; combustion; concentration (parameter); correlation coefficient; exhaust gas; Italy; multiple linear regression analysis; oxidation reduction potential; particulate matter; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; summer; urban area; winter; Italy; Milan [Milano]; Po Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078965520

They also represent a large potential form of climate mitigation and adaptation via reforestation, and this investment may contribute to restoration efforts and reverse mangrove decline. There has been significant (c. 200,000 ha) mangrove reforestation and restoration activity in Vietnam, and these projects provide indicators of the causes of project failure or success, and what is required for more complex restoration of ecosystem services. Failure in mangrove programs can be attributed to lack of understanding of the reasons for the loss of mangroves, poor site and species selection, and lack of incentives to engage local residents in the long-term management of restored areas. Overcoming these impediments and adopting monitoring and reporting procedures that consider both areal success and ecosystem function will provide a more robust approach for future mangrove restoration projects. Context: Over the last three decades there has been considerable (c. 200,000 ha) state and non-government investment in mangrove programs in Vietnam. The main objectives have been coastal protection and stabilization and the production of forest products, with fisheries, climate mitigation, and adaptation and ecosystem restoration as minor objectives. These have had reportedly varied success in terms of long-term survival rates. Much focus has been on the use of mono-species rather than restoring functioning mangrove ecosystems. Aims: This paper provides an overview of the status of mangroves in Vietnam and considers the effectiveness of mangrove restoration efforts based on an analysis of these reports. We develop and recommend approaches to make future mangrove restoration programs more effective. Result: First, we provide an overview of mangrove distribution and mangrove deforestation in Vietnam. Second, we analyse major mangrove projects by investigating their objectives and exploring reasons for their success or failure. Third, we suggest approaches for successful mangrove restoration activities in the context of current international agreements on climate change. Failure in some mangrove restoration programs in Vietnam can be attributed to lack of understanding of the reasons for the loss of mangroves and of site hydrology, poor site and species selection, lack of long-term monitoring and management, and lack of incentives to engage local communities in the long-term management of restored areas. Removal of these impediments will increase restoration success. Conclusion: The widespread and varied mangrove reforestation and restoration activities in Vietnam allow the analysis of different approaches and identification of the key factors leading to restoration success. These include care with species selection, having clear protocols for monitoring and reporting and implementing a co-management approach that provides incentives for local communities to benefit from the management of restored mangroves. © 2020, The Author(s).","Community-based restoration; Deforestation; Management; Mangrove forests; Reforestation; Rehabilitation; Restoration; Vietnam","coastal protection; deforestation; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; forest management; mangrove; population decline; reforestation; survival; Viet Nam; Rhizophoraceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079441076

By relating the water usage to renewable water resources, we define three stages from sustainable to unsustainable water resources: (1) sustainable, where water use is matched by renewable water capacity, ensuring sustainable water resources; (2) transitional, where water use occasionally exceeds renewable water capacity; and (3) unsustainable, with lack of water resources for agriculture, society, and the environment. Using available drought indicators (standardized precipitation index (SPI) and streamflow drought index (SDI) and two new indices for agricultural drought (overall agricultural drought index (OADI) and agricultural drought index (ADI), we evaluated these stages using the example of Fars province in southern Iran in the period 1977-2016. A hyper-arid climate prevailed for an average of 32% of the province's spatio-temporal coverage during the study period. The area increased significantly from 30.6% in the first decade (1977-1986) to 44.4% in the last (2006-2015). The spatiotemporal distribution of meteorological drought showed no significant negative trends in annual precipitation during 1977-2016, but the occurrence of hydrological droughts increased significantly in the period 1997-2016. The expansion of irrigated area, with more than 60% of rainfed agriculture replaced by irrigated agriculture (especially between 1997 and 2006), exerted substantial pressure on surface water and groundwater resources. Together, climate change, reduced river flow, and significant declines in groundwater level in major aquifers led to unsustainable use of water resources, a considerable reduction in irrigated area, and unsustainability in agricultural production in the period 2006-2015. Analysis of causes and effects of meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought in the area identified three clear stages: before 1997 being sustainable, 1997-2006 being transitional, and after 2006 being unsustainable. © 2020 by the authors.","Drought index; Drought severity; Fars; River flow; Socioeconomic impacts","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Aquifers; Arid regions; Climate change; Drought; Hydrogeology; Stream flow; Surface water resources; Surface waters; Water conservation; Drought indices; Drought severity; Fars; River flow; Socio-economic impacts; Groundwater resources; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; arid region; drought; groundwater; index method; meteorology; rainfed agriculture; river flow; semiarid region; socioeconomic impact; streamflow; surface water; water use efficiency; Fars; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082720584

Number of deaths and YLL were estimated with AirQ + software tool using available concentration-response functions and life table approach. Furthermore, the value of lost life in each city were calculated using the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) method. Two scenarios were defined; Scenario A, considering actual observed concentrations to estimate the real health effects of PM2.5, and Scenario B, controlling for the effect of air pollution episodes. The results showed that the annual average concentrations of PM2.5 in cities were 1.5–6.1 times higher than the guideline value of WHO (10 μg/m³). The total number of all-cause deaths due to long-term exposure exceeding WHO air quality guideline level was 13321 (95% C.I.: 8837–17378) cases per year in all cities. The total numbers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and stroke deaths attributed to the exposure were 274, 315, 1536, and 963 cases, respectively. The total number of YLL over 10 years period in all 25 cities was 486,289 years and the loss of life expectancy ranged from 0.43 to 1.87 years. The sum of economic losses due to lost life exceeded 5.8 billion USD. Except for some cities, avoiding highly polluted days in Scenario B would result in only 5% reduction in overall health or economic effects. These results indicate an urgent need for new comprehensive plans to tackle air pollution in Iranian cities focused on reduction of long term average pollution levels since programs for avoiding highly polluted days lead to a limited health benefits only. © 2020","AirQ+; Dust; Fine particles; Life expectancy; Particulate matter","Air quality; Dust; Losses; Population statistics; Air pollution episodes; AirQ; Annual average concentration; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Fine particles; Life expectancies; Particulate Matter; Value of statistical lives; Pulmonary diseases; air quality; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; life expectancy; life table; mortality; particulate matter; urban area; air pollution; air quality; all cause mortality; ambient air; Article; cause specific death; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; death; economic evaluation; human; Iran; ischemic heart disease; life expectancy; life table; long term exposure; lung cancer; mortality; particulate matter; population exposure; priority journal; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079907866

Through its interaction with other stressors, climate change accelerates existing risks while also creating new obstacles. A more considerable focus is needed in both research and practice to explore proactive measures for combatting this issue (e.g., mitigation and actions prior to impacts occurring). World Heritage values in climate change decision-making processes is an important factor in this regard. This paper explores a discussion of climate change within the WH monitoring system. It offers an overview of practice based on the extent to which WH properties (natural, mixed and cultural) implement landscape-based approaches alongside the conservation and management of their outstanding universal value within the context of climate uncertainty and environmental change. Landscape approaches are gaining importance in the WH conservation system, where they aim to provide concepts and tools for managing heritage toward sustainable practices. This research analyses the state of conservation reports and provides an overview of practice across time, categories and geographical regions. Based on a theoretical approach, empirical analyses identify four landscape principles that are increasingly shaping the debate around climate change issues in WH properties. Although these are highly relevant to advancing much-needed collaboration among scientific disciplines and governance sectors, we argue that further understanding is required on the transformational process of heritage values, as well as on the nature-culture relationship, in order to underpin heritage as a source for local resilience and climate mitigation. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Integrative heritage management; Monitoring; Nature culture divide; State of conservation reports; World heritage: landscape approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083790546

The booming of the vehicle population has worsened the environment and has caused severe air pollution problems, especially in urban areas. The utilization of hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas in internal combustion engines shows abundant prospects for improved performance and reduced on-road emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. This study aims to provide an insight to well-to-wheels environmental implications of the 20%HCNG fuel mixture in terms of total energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions per megajoules (MJ) of thermal energy output. The well-to-tank (WTT) impacts were evaluated using GREET 1 (2017). GREET 1 is a fuel cycle modeling tool developed by ‘Argonne national laboratory.’ GREET® is extensively used by researchers worldwide to analytically simulate energy use and emission output of various vehicle and fuel combinations. This study uses 12 prospective pathways of gaseous hydrogen production for analysis purposes. In the tank-to-wheels (TTW) phase, the 20%HCNG@EEV reduces the brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) by approximately 5%, and also decreases GHG emissions by 14% compared with 0%HCNG@EURO3. For simplicity, EURO5 is entitled as ‘EEV’ and has been excluded in most of the discussion, only highlighting ‘EEV,’ which abbreviates as ‘Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicles.’ For the entire well-to-wheels phase, this research work shows that all of the 20%HCNG@EEV pathways have lower total energy use and GHG emissions than 0%HCNG@EURO3 except the two pathways, such as grid electricity-to-hydrogen (without CO2 sequestration) and coal gasification-to-hydrogen (without CO2 sequestration). The WTW total energy and GHG emissions reduced by approximately 14% and 13%, respectively, with 20%HCNG@EEV based on the coke oven gas pathway compared with 0%HCNG@EURO3. It is essential to note that the use of cleaner feedstock for hydrogen, such as power-to-gas (P2G), biomass, coke oven gas (by-product), and natural gas shows tremendous prospects for realizing and practicing sustainable ‘hydrogen economy’ in China. Further technological advancement and reduction in total costs of HCNG utilization in powertrains will increase the number of HCNG vehicles decreasing the burden of air pollution, climate change, and energy crisis threats. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","20%HCNG; COG; EEV; Energy use; GHG emissions; Well-to-wheels","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Coke; Coke ovens; Compressed natural gas; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen production; Industrial ovens; Petroleum prospecting; Tanks (containers); Vehicle wheels; 20%HCNG; Argonne National Laboratory; Energy use; Environmental implications; Environmentally friendly vehicles; GHG emission; Specific energy consumption; Well-to-wheel; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078797074

Herein, we report a structurally transformative tetracationic cyclophane containing two 3,6-bis(4-pyridyl)-l,2,4,5-tetrazine (4-bptz) units, which are linked together by two p-xylylene bridges. The cyclophane, which possesses modular redox states and structural post-modifications, can undergo two reversibly consecutive two-electron reductions, affording first its bisradical dicationic counterpart, and then subsequently the fully reduced species. Furthermore, one single-parent cyclophane can afford effectively three other new analogs through box-to-box cascade transformations, taking advantage of either reductions or an inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction. While all four new tetracationic cyclophanes adopt rigid and symmetric box-like conformations, their geometries in relation to size, shape, electronic properties, and binding affinities toward polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be readily regulated. This structurally transformative tetracationic cyclophane performs a variety of new tasks as a result of structural post-modifications, thus serving as a toolbox for probing the radical properties and generating rapidly a range of structurally diverse cyclophanes by efficient divergent syntheses. This research lays a solid foundation for the introduction of the structurally transformative tetracationic cyclophane into the realm of mechanically interlocked molecules and will provide a toolbox to construct and operate intelligent molecular machines.

However, the small size of bacterial cells and environmental stress significantly affect microbial cell factory performance. Here, we engineered the Escherichia coli lifespan to improve the chemical production of poly(lactate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) and butyrate. The replicative lifespan was shortened by deleting a carbon storage regulator, and the chronological lifespan was extended by deleting a response regulator and overexpressing sigma-38 in Escherichia coli. The replicative lifespan was fine-tuned using a two-output recombinase-based state machine, and the cell size was enlarged 13.4-fold. The highest poly(lactate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) content of 52 wt% was achieved in a 5-l fermenter. The chronological lifespan was modulated through a multi-output recombinase-based state machine, resulting in the highest butyrate titre of 29.8 g l−1, by programming cell differentiation according to different fermentation stages. These results highlight the applicability of engineering the bacterial lifespan to increase microbial cell factory performance. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Cells; Cytology; Escherichia coli; Sustainable development; Bacterial cells; Cell differentiation; Chemical production; Environmental stress; Hydroxybutyrate; Microbial cell factories; Renewable feedstocks; Response regulators; Cell engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078444597

Though wind energy is one of the most cost-effective solutions and has been favored for climate policy development around the world, its high sensitivity to climate change raises some critical issues for the long-term effectiveness in providing sustainable energy supply. Particularly, how wind speed and its energy potential in China will change in the context of global warming is still not well understood. In this paper, we simulate the near-surface wind speed over China using the PRECIS regional climate modeling system under different RCP emission scenarios for assessing the possible changes in wind speed and wind energy availability over China throughout the 21st century. Overall, the PRECIS model can reasonably reproduce the mesoscale climatological near-surface wind speed and directions as documented in reanalysis data across most regions of China, while some local discrepancies are reported in the southwestern regions. In the future, the annual mean wind speed would be decreasing in most regions of China, except for a slightly increase in the southeast. The expected changes in wind speed are characterized with different amplitudes and rates under different RCP emission scenarios. The changes in the spatial distribution of wind speed seem to be sensitive for RCP climate emission scenarios, especially in the late 21st century. The spatiotemporal changes in wind energy potential exhibit a similar behavior to those in near-surface wind speed, but the magnitudes of these changes are larger. In general, the wind power density is expected to increase by over 5% in winter in the major wind fields in China (ie, Northwest, Northcentral and Northeast), while significant decreases (by about 6% on average) are projected for other seasons (ie, spring, summer and autumn). By contrast, the wind energy potential in the northeast would increase over most months in the year, especially in winter and summer. The results of this research are of great importance for understanding where and to what extent the wind energy can be utilized to contribute renewable energy system development in China in support of its long-term climate change mitigation commitment. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","China; high resolution; regional climate model; wind; wind energy potential","Cost effectiveness; Energy policy; Global warming; Speed; Wind; Wind power; China; Climate change mitigation; Cost-effective solutions; High resolution; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate modeling systems; Renewable energy systems; Sustainable energy supply; Climate models; alternative energy; climate change; climate modeling; environmental policy; global warming; regional climate; seasonal variation; spatial distribution; wind power; wind velocity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077153767

Previous studies have investigated the universal physical laws during LST modeling. However, spatial patterns of the driving forces and their temporal differences have not been well examined. In this study, spatially heterogeneous effects of two important urban biophysical compositions, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and impervious surfaces, on LST are determined by a regression tree model. The results showed that LST patterns varied on different dates. Additionally, nonlinear relationships existed between LST, NDVI, and impervious surfaces. The regression tree model outperformed the multiple linear regression in modeling LST variations. Furthermore, the “rules” derived from regression tree indicated the forces that are driving LST locally. These results suggest that the “rules” can be used as urban planning indicators and provide insights into the variations in driving forces linked to the urban landscape. We found that the regression tree is an important approach to adopt for conducting studies on urban heat and provides insight into complex and hierarchical LST patterns and processes, thus facilitating urban heat island mitigation in terms of reducing energy use and air pollution in urban areas. © 2019","Land surface temperature (LST); Regression tree model; Spatially heterogeneous driving forces; Urban biophysical composition","Forestry; Land surface temperature; Linear regression; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban planning; Driving forces; Heterogeneous effects; Multiple linear regressions; Non-linear relationships; Normalized difference vegetation index; Regression tree models; Temporal differences; Urban heat environment; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077369158

Model intercomparison studies are a valuable support to this work, being useful for identifying any issues with air quality models, and benchmarking their performance against international standards, thereby increasing confidence in their predictions. This paper presents the results of a comparison study of six chemical transport models which have been used to simulate short-term hourly to 24 hourly concentrations of fine particulate matter less than and equal to 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) for Sydney, Australia. Model performance was evaluated by comparison to air quality measurements made at 16 locations for O3 and 5 locations for PM2.5, during three time periods that coincided with major atmospheric composition measurement campaigns in the region. These major campaigns included daytime measurements of PM2.5 composition, and so model performance for particulate sulfate (SO4 2-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4 +) and elemental carbon (EC) was evaluated at one site per modelling period. Domain-wide performance of the models for hourlyO3 was good, with models meeting benchmark criteria and reproducing the observed O3 production regime (based on the O3/NOx indicator) at 80% or more of the sites. Nevertheless, model performance was worse at high (and low) O3 percentiles. Domain-wide model performance for 24 h average PM2.5 was more variable, with a general tendency for the models to under-predict PM2.5 concentrations during the summer and over-predict PM2.5 concentrations in the autumn. The modelling intercomparison exercise has led to improvements in the implementation of these models for Sydney and has increased confidence in their skill at reproducing observed atmospheric composition. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality modelling; Model evaluation; O3; PM2.5","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Benchmarking; Forecasting; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Quality assurance; Sulfur compounds; Air quality measurements; Air quality modelling; Chemical transport models; Composition measurements; Intercomparison exercise; Model evaluation; PM2.5; Regional air quality models; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; concentration (composition); ozone; particulate matter; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082306998

The first scenario is that the driver does not know in advance the state of the traffic lights. The second scenario assumes that the driver knows the state of the traffic lights but has no modelling nor computation capabilities to solve the associated optimal control problem. In the third scenario, the driver knows in advance the state of the traffic lights and is also able to solve the corresponding optimal control problem that leads to fuel consumption or NOx emission minimisation. In this study, the vehicle-speed trajectories associated with the previously described three scenarios have been computed and then tested in a Euro 5 Diesel vehicle installed in a chassis dynamometer. The obtained results show that traffic light information is essential for fuel minimisation in urban conditions, promoting reductions of 7.5–12% and 13–32% for fuel consumption and NOx emissions in the studied case. In addition, differences in the engine-operating conditions for high efficiency and low NOx emissions may lead to extremely high fuel consumption when NOx minimisation is foreseen or viceversa. © IMechE 2019.","Eco-driving; fuel consumption optimisation; NOx emissions optimisation; optimal control; real driving cycle; velocity profile optimisation","Diesel engines; Dynamometers; Nitrogen oxides; Optimal control systems; Vehicles; Chassis dynamometers; Eco-driving; Engine operating conditions; Information availability; Optimal control problem; Optimal controls; Optimisations; Real drivings; Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070358574

However, there are, to date, no reports on adverse effects related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments from aquaculture wetlands in metropolitan areas. The characterization, sources, and incidence of adverse effects on aquatic biota of PAHs were studied in the riverine and estuarine sediments of the Rongjiang River in an aquaculture wetland in Chaoshan metropolis. The total PAH concentrations varied from 46.0 to 1665.2 ng/g (dry weight), with a mean of 246.4 ng/g, indicating lower concentrations than those of other comparable rivers and estuaries worldwide. High-molecular-weight PAHs were the major PAH species, with fluorene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, and benzo(a)pyrene as the dominant components. These PAHs are likely to be mainly derived from oil and coal/biomass combustion. Probability risk assessment indicated a moderate PAH ecological risk in the Rongjiang River and its estuary (RJE). Accordingly, a comprehensive management plan should be established to ensure sustainable aquaculture wetlands. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Aquaculture wetland; Nonmetric multidimensional scaling; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Rongjiang River","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; aquaculture; aquatic organism; concentration (composition); estuarine sediment; fluvial deposit; human activity; PAH; pollution effect; scale effect; sediment pollution; urban area; wetland; aquaculture; aquatic flora; Article; China; controlled study; largemouth bass; Lateolabrax japonicus; multidimensional scaling; particle size; Penaeus vannamei; priority journal; quality control; risk assessment; river; Scylla paramamosain; sediment; surface property; wetland; biota; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; sediment; water pollutant; wetland; China; Aquaculture; Biota; China; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077464891

This study examined the potential for clay addition to reduce CO2 emissions from plant residues and soil organic matter in a sandy soil. Soils were sourced from a 15-year-old field trial where claying (200 t ha−1) had already demonstrated improvements in water infiltration, grain yield and profits. Isotopically labelled plant residues (wheat, canola, or pea) were used to separate residue-derived and soil-derived CO2 sources from a nil-clay control, a historically clayed, and two freshly created soils with either high (10%) or low (3%) subsoil clay additions. Laboratory incubations demonstrated that historically clayed soils released less CO2 from plant residues and soil organic matter. Clay addition also decreased the priming effect of adding fresh residue to soils. The results from clay experimentally added in the laboratory varied. Differences in chemical and biological indicators (pH, microbial biomass C and N, extractable organic C and N, NO3 −, NH4 +, abundance of bacterial, archaeal, fungal, LMCO, GH48 and CbhI genes) did not correlate with patterns of CO2 emissions across treatments. While claying practices have previously demonstrated benefits to crop productivity, this research demonstrates long-term changes in carbon-cycling that could promote greater carbon sequestration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Clay; Climate change; Food production; Microbial community; Priming; Soil organic matter","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Clay; Climate change; Food supply; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Indicators (chemical); Organic compounds; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage in soils; Chemical and biologicals; Food production; Microbial biomass C and N; Microbial communities; Priming; Soil organic matters; Soils; carbon; kaolin; agricultural practice; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; climate change; food production; food security; kaolinite; microbial community; mineralization; sandy soil; soil carbon; soil organic matter; subsoil; agricultural procedures; Article; carbon sequestration; climate change; controlled study; crop; food security; mineralization; priority journal; sandy soil; agriculture; catering service; clay; sand; soil; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Brassica napus var. napus; Pisum sativum; Triticum aestivum; Agriculture; Carbon; Clay; Food Supply; Kaolin; Sand; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076967483

This is indeed the case of functional data in medical imaging. This motivates the use of component-tree-based approaches for analyzing Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images in the context of oncology. In this article, we present a simple, yet efficient, methodological framework for PET image analysis based on component-trees.

This work focuses on the details of the onset of the carbon detonation in the double detonation sub-Chandrasekhar model. In order to simulate the influence of core-shell mixing on the carbon ignition mechanism, the helium shell and its detonation are followed with an increased resolution compared to the rest of the star treating the propagation of the detonation wave more accurately. This significantly improves the predictions of the nucleosynthetic yields from the helium burning. The simulations were carried out with the AREPO code. A carbon-oxygen core with a helium shell was set up in one dimension and mapped to three dimensions. We ensured the stability of the white dwarf with a relaxation step before the hydrodynamic detonation simulation started. Synthetic observables were calculated with the radiative transfer code ARTIS. An ignition mechanism of the carbon detonation was observed, which received little attention before. In this ""scissors mechanism"", the impact the helium detonation wave has on unburnt material when converging opposite to its ignition spot is strong enough to ignite a carbon detonation. This is possible in a carbon enriched transition region between the core and shell. The detonation mechanism is found to be sensitive to details of the core-shell transition and our models illustrate the need to consider core-shell mixing taking place during the accretion process. Even though the detonation ignition mechanism differs form the converging shock mechanism, the differences in the synthetic observables are not significant. Though they do not fit observations better than previous simulations, they illustrate the need for multi-dimensional simulations. © ESO 2020.","abundances; Hydrodynamics; Methods: numerical; Nuclear reactions; nucleosynthesis; Radiative transfer; Supernovae: general; White dwarfs","Carbon; Detonation; Helium; Hydrodynamics; Mixing; Nuclear reactions; Nucleosynthesis; Numerical methods; Oxygen; Radiative transfer; Shells (structures); Shock waves; Supernovae; abundances; Accretion process; Ignition mechanisms; Methods: numericals; Multidimensional simulation; Radiative transfer codes; Supernovae: general; Transition regions; White dwarfs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082922142

In several regions, the projected changes in total rainfall and seasonal rainfall patterns will lead to lower soil water storage (SWS), which in turn affects crop water uptake, crop yield, water use efficiency (WUE), grain quality and groundwater recharge. Effects of climate change on those variables depend on the soil properties and were often estimated based on model simulations. The objective of this study was to investigate the response of key variables in four different soils and for two different climates in Germany with a different aridity index (AI): 1.09 for the wetter (range: 0.82 to 1.29) and 1.57 for the drier (range: 1.19 to 1.77) climate. This is done by using high-precision weighable lysimeters. According to a ""space-for-time"" (SFT) concept, intact soil monoliths that were moved to sites with contrasting climatic conditions have been monitored from April 2011 until December 2017. Evapotranspiration (ET) was lower for the same soil under the relatively drier climate, whereas crop yield was significantly higher, without affecting grain quality. Especially ""non-productive"" water losses (evapotranspiration out of the main growing period) were lower, which led to a more efficient crop water use in the drier climate. A characteristic decrease of the SWS for soils with a finer texture was observed after a longer drought period under a drier climate. The reduced SWS after the drought remained until the end of the observation period which demonstrates carry-over of drought from one growing season to another and the overall long-term effects of single drought events. In the relatively drier climate, water flow at the soil profile bottom showed a small net upward flux over the entire monitoring period as compared to downward fluxes (groundwater recharge) or drainage in the relatively wetter climate and larger recharge rates in the coarser-as compared to finer-textured soils. The large variability of recharge from year to year and the long-lasting effects of drought periods on the SWS imply that long-term monitoring of soil water balance components is necessary to obtain representative estimates. Results confirmed a more efficient crop water use under less-plant-available soil moisture conditions. Long-term effects of changing climatic conditions on the SWS and ecosystem productivity should be considered when trying to develop adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector. © 2020 Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle.

Traditional LIBS for equivalence-ratio measurements employ nanosecond (ns)-laser pulses, which generate excessive amounts of continuum, reducing measurement accuracy and precision. Shorter pulse durations reduce the continuum emission by limiting avalanche ionization. Furthermore, by contrast the use of femtosecond lasers, plasma emission using picosecond-laser excitation has a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), allowing single-shot measurements suitable for equivalence-ratio determination in turbulent reacting flows. We carried out an analysis of the dependence of the plasma emission ratio Hα (656 nm)/NII (568 nm) on laser energy and time-delay for optimization of S/N and minimization of measurement uncertainties in the equivalence ratios. Our finding shows that higher laser energy and shorter time delay reduces measurement uncertainty while maintaining high S/N. In addition to atmospheric-pressure flame studies, we also examine the stability of the ps-LIBS signal in a high-pressure nitrogen cell. The results indicate that the plasma emission and spatial position could be stable, shot-to-shot, at elevated pressure (up to 40 bar) using a lower excitation energy.

However, the concomitant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains unavoidable under aqueous conditions. In this work, a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) setup has been developed to study quantitatively the role of mass transport in the competition between these two reactions on the Au surface in 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolyte. Interestingly, while the faradaic selectivity for CO formation was found to increase with enhanced mass transport (from 67% to 83%), this effect is not due to an enhancement of the CO2RR rate. Remarkably, the inhibition of the competing HER from water reduction with increasing disk rotation rate is responsible for the enhanced CO2RR selectivity. This can be explained by the observation that, on the Au electrode, water reduction improves with more alkaline pH. As a result, the decrease in the local alkalinity near the electrode surface with enhanced mass transport suppresses HER due to the water reduction. Our study shows that controlling the local pH by mass transport conditions can tune the HER rate, in turn regulating the CO2RR and HER competition in the general operating potential window for CO2RR (-0.4 to -1 V vs RHE). © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Alkalinity; Carbon dioxide; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Gold; Hydrogen; Surface reactions; Aqueous condition; Electrochemical reductions; Electrode surfaces; Gold electrodes; Hydrogen evolution; Potential windows; Rotating ring-disk electrode; Selective catalysts; Hydrogen evolution reaction; bicarbonate; carbon monoxide; gold; water; alkalinity; Article; carbon dioxide reduction; chemical reaction; hydrogen evolution; hydrogen evolution reaction; mass transport; pH; reduction (chemistry); transport kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080036378

Homogeneous charge compression ignition is characterized by compression-induced autoignition of a lean homogeneous air–fuel mixture. Combustion timing is highly dependent on the in-cylinder state including pressure, temperature and trapped mass. To control homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion, it is necessary to have an accurate representation of the gas exchange process. Currently, microprocessor-based engine control units require that the gas exchange process is linearized around a desired operating point to simplify the model for real-time implementation. This reduces the models’ ability to handle disturbances and limits the flexibility of the model. However, using a field programmable gate array, a detailed simulation of the physical gas exchange process can be implemented in real time. This paper outlines the process of converting physical governing equations to an offline zero-dimensional gas exchange model. The process used to convert this model to a field programmable gate array capable model is described. This model is experimentally validated using a single cylinder research engine with electromagnetic valves to record real-time field programmable gate array gas exchange results and comparing to the offline zero-dimensional physical model. The field programmable gate array model is able to accurately calculate the cylinder temperature and cylinder mass at 0.1 °CA intervals during the gas exchange process for a range of negative valve overlaps, boost conditions and engine speeds making the model useful for future real-time control applications. © IMechE 2018.","Field programmable gate array; gas exchange model; gasoline-controlled autoignition; homogeneous charge compression ignition; zero-dimensional engine simulation","Engine cylinders; Gases; Ignition; Logic gates; Real time control; Structural geology; Controlled autoignition; Engine simulation; Experimental validations; Gas exchange model; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Homogeneous charge compression ignition combustions; Real-time implementations; Single-cylinder research engines; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050690223

These changes, their behavior, and magnitude depend on the original soil characteristics and also on the effect of forest plantations being grown. In the steppe zone of Ukraine, Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Quercus robur L. are the woody species most widely used in planting of forest plantations on chernozem soil. Chernozem soil formed exclusively under zonal steppe vegetation and chernozem soil under Robinia pseudoacacia and Quercus robur plantations were studied in this work to analyze the changes in soil properties caused by growth of these tree species. Dry aggregate size distribution, density, particle density, total porosity, organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity, pH values, hydrolytic soil acidity and dry residue, and the available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content were analyzed. The studies found that Robinia pseudoacacia and Quercus robur plantations contribute to an increase in the share of aggregates 2-1 mm in size, as well as formation of aggregate fraction >10 mm, which are completely absent in the Calcic chernozem developed under the steppe vegetation. An increase in the density and particle density, as well as a decrease in the total porosity values were observed under the influence of forest stands studied. This is more common with chernozem under Q. robur plantation. It was found that the carbon percentage decreased in chernozem under the influence of Robinia pseudoacacia growth (on average, 0.4% by a meter-deep layer), but under Quercus robur planting it increased (on average 0.3% by meter-deep layer). Effect of Robinia pseudoacacia plantings on chernozem was also manifested by a decrease in cation exchange capacity (on average, 11 cmol/100 g by a meter-deep layer). The growth of R. pseudoacacia and Quercus robur plantations results in decrease of pH values (0.2 by a meter-deep layer) and increase of hydrolytic soil acidity and dry residue in chernozem water extract. Effect of Robinia pseudoacacia planting leads to a decrease in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content in chernozem. The change in chernozem properties under the influence of Quercus robur plantation is reflected in accumulation of these nutrients. Growth of Robinia pseudoacacia and Quercus robur plantations leads to a decrease in potassium reserves in chernozem, which may indicate its active uptake by these woody species. In general, Q. robur planting is characterized by a large positive effect on the physical and chemical properties of chernozem than Robinia pseudoacacia planting. The findings obtained serve as a ground for making a recommendation for growing Quercus robur plantations under climate conditions of the steppe zone of Ukraine in order to improve the zonal chernozems' state and fertility. © 2020 Sciendo.

IFFIP extends upon the existing full-infinite programming (FIP) by allowing uncertainties expressed as crisp intervals, functional intervals and dual-functional intervals to be effectively incorporated within a general framework. Then, an IFFIP-RES model is formulated for planning RES of Hebei province (China) through considering energy transitions in industrial, transport, and residential sectors. Scenarios related to coal/oil reduction and electricity/nature gas growth in final energy demand are designed to evaluate the impact of final energy substitution on RES. The results reveal that (i) final energy substitution would bring about 7.0% increase in clean energy (including nature gas and renewable energy) and 8.9% reduction in coal over the planning horizon; (ii) electricity demand would increase 38.4% with final energy substitution, and the increased electricity would be converted by coal (57.2%) and renewable resources (26.1%); (iii) pollutants (including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter) from RES would reduce 20.1%; pollutants discharged from industrial, transport and residential sectors would decrease 32.6%, 39.9% and 62.1%, respectively; (iv) nature gas demand would raise rapidly with the energy substitution, and the proportion of imported nature gas would reach up to 97.4%.

We collected measurements from a temporarily flooded subtropical wetland over 3 years to investigate environmental drivers impacting CO2 and CH4 fluxes. The wetland was a sink of CO2 (−469 to −380 g C-CO2 · m−2 · year−1) and a source of CH4 (25.1 to 32.1 g C-CH4 · m−2 · year−1) to the atmosphere. Dry season CH4 emissions represented 41 to 49% of the annual budget, reflecting the importance of continuous CH4 flux measurements. Gross primary productivity (GPP) increased with temperature and radiation, and the influence of VPD on GPP varied with soil inundation. Higher water tables decreased Reco and increased GPP, and a higher GPP in turn lead to enhanced Reco likely through enhancements of GPP on autotrophic respiration. This suggests that the impact of the water table on Reco depends on the cancelling effects of hydrology and GPP. Emissions of CH4 increased with soil temperature, water table, and GPP until soils were inundated at which point temperature and GPP became the main drivers. Water table and temperature influenced GPP and CH4 fluxes, and increases in GPP directly enhanced CH4 emissions. In addition to impacting C fluxes directly through water table depth, hydrology also determined the hierarchy of the dominance of factors controlling C fluxes and their response. The positive climate forcing of subtropical wetlands may be dictated by plant-mediated and climate interactions, with hydrological factors playing a major role in determining the greenhouse gas sink or source strength of subtropical wetlands. ©2020.

This paper aims at investigating possible impacts of car powertrain technologies on future energy demand and its corresponding greenhouse gas emissions until 2030. A system dynamics model covering nine car technologies in China, France, Germany, India, Japan and the United States was applied, with a focus on electric cars. Four main scenarios are constructed and sensitivity analysis undertaken. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars in the six countries are simulated to reach up to 2.6 gigatonnes in 2030 (a 13–32% increase between 2020 and 2030, depending on the scenario). The main conclusion from model-based policy analysis is that electric cars may have a positive contribution to emissions mitigation in the passenger road transport system. However, greenhouse gas emissions from cars arising from the combined effect of car manufacturing and scrappage and electricity generation processes are expected to grow more dramatically. As a result, actions that support both low-emission (re-)manufacturing and clean electricity generation are needed. These results complement accurate but static life cycle assessments and open the discussion for dynamic model assumptions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Greenhouse gas emissions; Scenario analysis; Simulation; System dynamics","Electric automobiles; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Manufacture; Powertrains; Sensitivity analysis; System theory; Electricity generation; Emissions mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Road transport systems; Scenario analysis; Simulation; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Gas emissions; car use; carbon emission; electric vehicle; electricity generation; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; road transport; traffic emission; travel behavior; China; France; Germany; India; Japan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078208927

Two quantitative factors characterizing the population welfare are considered: the total wage fund and the regional public financial fund from own revenues per capita. As key environmental indicators, the authors chose eco-intensity indicators for regional economic systems. Our estimates show substantial heterogeneity of the Russian sub-federal units on socio-environmental characteristics. It is shown that the population of many regions not only lives under high anthropogenic pressure (overall and per capita), but they are also not provided with additional resources ""collective welfare"" at the expense of own budget revenues, despite the disadvantageous environmental conditions. It was noted that ""carbon regulation"", directed at development a low-carbon economy, should not be based on quantitative indicators, which is the same for the whole country. Due to the heterogeneity it will require fine-tuning, taking into account regional specificity of the relationships between factors of well-being and anthropogenic pressures. The aim to decline of carbon-intensity in local economies in different regions of the country will require different timelines, and the relevant ""road maps"" need to be taken into account. In public policy to reduce carbon emissions, special attention should be paid to the differentiation of transaction costs for managing, protecting and restoring forest ecosystems. In state policy on carbon reduction issues, one of the focuses of special attention should be on differentiating the transaction costs of managing, protecting and restoring forest ecosystems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082194753

We have developed MEMS structures of which the temperature can be increased locally by Joule heating while in a methane environment. For our MEMS structures, the thermal time constant is 28 μs. As a result, we have control over the carbon precipitation time, thereby governing how many graphene layers are formed. Bi-layer to multi-layer graphene was observed using micro-Raman spectroscopy, but not single-layer graphene, as it gives no Raman signal when coupled on a nickel surface. The corresponding precipitation control theory is also presented in this paper, in which we relate the out-diffusion of carbon atoms from the grains of the nickel structure to the resulting number of graphene layers. Our method provides regulated carbon segregation from nickel and allows a prescribed number of graphene layers to form by tuning the precipitation time. In this way, we enable the direct in situ synthesis of graphene locally on the top and sidewalls of nickel MEMS structures, so that e.g. such graphene-coated MEMS surfaces can contribute towards a promising solution against friction and wear for MEMS devices with sliding components. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon precipitation; Chemical vapor deposition; Graphene; MEMS; Micro-Raman spectroscopy; Thermal time response","Chemical vapor deposition; Graphene; MEMS; Raman spectroscopy; Carbon precipitation; Chemical vapor depositions (CVD); Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Micro electro mechanical system; Micro Raman Spectroscopy; Precipitation controls; Thermal time constants; Thermal time response; Precipitation (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078664356

To satisfy the EV load demand of the new EV models with larger battery capacities, public direct-current fast-charging stations (DCFCSs) are essential to recharge EVs rapidly. A stochastic planning method of the DCFCSs is presented considering user behaviour and the probabilistic driving patterns in order to predict EVs charging demand. According to the stochastic method, a coordinated charging demand and storage charging demand are proposed with the objective of minimising peak load from EVs and charging-infrastructure costs. The proposed planning method can prevent additional grid-reinforcement costs due to EV demand during peak hours. In the coordinated charging demand, the peak load from EVs is managed by controlling the DCFCSs. Instead, in the battery energy storage (BES) charging demand, an optimal BES is proposed as an alternative solution to reduce the peak demand of EVs as well as DCFCSs operational costs. Finally, an economic analysis is carried out to evaluate the technical and economic aspects related to DCFCSs, the BES life-cycle costs as well as the financial performance of BES costs versus grid-reinforcement costs. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.",,"Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Costs; Economic analysis; Life cycle; Reinforcement; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Alternative solutions; Battery energy storages (BES); Charging infrastructures; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Fast charging stations; Financial performance; Infrastructure planning; Sustainable transportation; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079436286

Simulated results and statistical multivariate analysis showed that the high ozone concentrations did not seem to be closely related to local emissions but rather were related to pollutant transport and low measured NOx levels and were triggered by photochemical activity. The differences between weekdays and weekends were also investigated, showing that ozone concentrations were also higher during weekends, mainly on Sunday, when the diesel heavy vehicle fleet was reduced and lower NO emissions were observed.

Then the CNN is designed as a three-layer structure and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is introduced to achieve better generalization capability and stability with boiler fluctuations in the petrochemical industry. The developed method has better performances of modeling accuracy and applicability than that of the back-propagation (BP) neural network and the extreme learning machine (ELM) on University of California Irvine (UCI) benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the developed method is applied to establish an energy optimization and prediction model of ethylene production systems in the petrochemical industry. The experimental results testify the capability of the proposed method. Meanwhile, the average relative generalization error is 2.86%, and the energy utilization efficiency increases by 6.38%, which leads to reduction of the carbon emissions by 5.29%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions reduction; Convolutional neural network; Cross-feature; Energy optimization; Petrochemical industry; Production prediction modeling","Backpropagation; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Ethylene; Forecasting; Petrochemical plants; Petrochemicals; Predictive analytics; Carbon emissions reductions; Cross-feature; Energy optimization; Petrochemical industry; Production prediction; Learning systems; artificial neural network; benchmarking; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; energy efficiency; numerical model; optimization; petrochemical industry; prediction; sustainable development; California; Irvine; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077449731

A field experiment at two Midwest U.S. sites on contrasting soils revealed that feedstock yields of seven potential bioenergy cropping systems varied substantially within sites but little between. Bioenergy produced per hectare reflected yields: Miscanthus &gt; poplar &gt; switchgrass &gt; native grasses ≈ maize stover (residue) &gt; restored prairie ≈ early successional. Greenhouse gas emission intensities for ethanol vehicles ranged from 20 to-179 g CO2e MJ-1: Maize stover ≫ miscanthus ≈ switchgrass ≈ native grasses ≈ poplar &gt; early successional ≥ restored prairie; direct climate benefits ranged from â&amp;circ;80% (stover) to 290% (restored prairie) reductions in CO2e compared to petroleum and were similar for electric vehicles. With carbon capture and storage (CCS), reductions in emission intensities ranged from 204% (stover) to 416% (restored prairie) for ethanol vehicles and from 329 to 558% for electric vehicles, declining 27 and 15%, respectively, once soil carbon equilibrates within several decades of establishment. Extrapolation based on expected U.S. transportation energy use suggests that, once CCS potential is maximized with CO2 pipeline infrastructure, negative emissions from bioenergy with CCS for light-duty electric vehicles could capture &gt;900 Tg CO2e year-1 in the U.S. In the future, as other renewable electricity sources become more important, electricity production from biomass would offset less fossil fuel electricity, and the advantage of electric over ethanol vehicles would decrease proportionately.

As a result of this activity, the State is faced with significant challenges of systemwide resource adequacy, power quality and grid reliability that could be addressed in part with demand responsive (DR) load modifying strategies using controllable building technologies. Dynamic facades have the ability to potentially shift and shed loads at critical times of the day in combination with daylighting and HVAC controls. This study explores the technical potential of dynamic facades to support net load shape objectives. A model predictive controller (MPC) was designed based on reduced order thermal (Modelica) and window (Radiance) models. Using an automated workflow (involving JModelica.org and MPCPy), these models were converted and differentiated to formulate a non-linear optimization problem. A gradient-based, non-linear programming problem solver (IPOPT) was used to derive an optimal control strategy, then a post-optimization step was used to convert the solution to a discrete state for facade actuation. Continuous state modulation of the façade was also modeled. The performance of the MPC controller with and without activation of thermal mass was evaluated in a south-facing perimeter office zone with a three-zone electrochromic window for a clear sunny week during summer and winter periods in Oakland and Burbank, California. MPC strategies reduced total energy cost by 9–28% and critical coincident peak demand was reduced by up to 0.58 W/ft2-floor or 19–43% in the 4.6 m (15 ft) deep south zone on sunny summer days in Oakland compared to state-of-the-art heuristic control. Similar savings were achieved for the hotter, Burbank climate in Southern California. This outcome supports the argument that MPC control of dynamic facades can provide significant electricity cost reductions and net load management capabilities of benefit to both the building owner and evolving electrical grid. © 2020","Building energy efficiency; Controller in the loop; Daylighting; Dynamic facades; Model predictive controls; Switchable windows; Windows","Controllers; Cost reduction; Daylighting; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Facades; Greenhouse gases; Model predictive control; Nonlinear programming; Optimal control systems; Predictive control systems; Windows; Building energy efficiency; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Management capabilities; Model predictive controllers; Non-linear optimization problems; Nonlinear programming problem; Optimal control strategy; Switchable windows; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078165861

Based on the Chinese province-industry-level panel data in the period 2001 to 2015, we use a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) model to evaluate pollution haven behavior in the context of China's 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans SO2 emissions reduction policy. The results show that the policy leads to fewer FDI inflows to its highly-polluting industries in provinces with tougher pollution reduction targets. In addition, the environmental policy has significantly inhibited FDI inflows in provinces with stricter environmental enforcement, while investment in provinces with worse environmental enforcement is insensitive to environmental policy. These findings are consistent with pollution haven behavior. In contrast, FDI in industries with high levels of technology is not significantly influenced by the policy, whereas the FDI in industries with low levels of technology shows a negative response to environmental policy. This is overall evidence confirming a pollution haven effect (PHE), although technology differences could alleviate the negative effects of environmental regulation on inward FDI. © 2020 by the authors.","11th five-year plan and 12th five-year plan; Environmental regulation; FDI; Pollution haven effect","emission control; environmental impact; environmental technology; foreign direct investment; panel data; pollution policy; regulatory framework; sulfur dioxide; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082976908

They are also inefficient, with relatively low productivity for the inputs used although the climate, soil and water resources of the region indicate that greater productivity is achievable. In on-farm experiments conducted across three countries (Bangladesh, India, Nepal) we compared the performance of traditional and improved management practices to understand which better facilitated the production of food-grain crops while reducing energy and water demands, thus improving the sustainability of cropping system energy requirements. Benefits of improved over traditional management practices included increases of up to 10% in crop grain yields; up to 19% in water productivity; up to 26% in energy productivity; and reductions of up to 50% in labor. These metrics combined to reduce the cost of production under improved management by up to 22% and to increase gross margins by up to 100% (although in most instances gross margins increased by 12–32%). CO2-equivalent emissions reduced by 10%–17% compared to traditional practices. The principles behind the improved management practices, which we demonstrate improve the food-energy-water nexus while concurrently promoting more sustainable use of energy resources, are applicable across smallholder farming systems throughout South Asia and in many emerging-economy countries. These improvements to traditional management practices combined with our approach of supporting farmers through the implementation of new methods has widespread applications and the potential to assist many countries transitioning to low-energy, sustainable food production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation agriculture-based sustainable intensification; Cropping systems; Energy efficiency; Meta-analysis; South Asia; Water efficiency","Crops; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Grain (agricultural product); Productivity; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water resources; Conservation agricultures; Cropping systems; Meta analysis; South Asia; Water efficiency; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076550379

Yet, much of the evidence for this is anecdotal, with a shortage of standardised long-term data to investigate temporal changes in abundance. We present an 18-year time series of standardised transect surveys for glowing adult females at 19 sites within south-east England (Essex) from 2001 to 2018. We used generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to control for varying sampling effort, temporal autocorrelation, non-stationarity of seasonal phenology and non-linearity of temporal trajectories across sites. We found a significant long-term reduction in counts of glowing female glow-worms, after accounting for a significant shift in seasonal phenology across years, and a negative effect of warmer climatic conditions on glow-worm abundance. Average glowing counts in south-east England declined by ca. −3.5% per annum from 2001 to 2018, and this result held true even after a range of sensitivity tests to account for potential methodological artefacts in citizen science data collection. Temporal trajectories in abundance were strikingly out of phase across the 19 sites, suggesting that local-scale factors in addition to climate are driving greater reduction in numbers at some sites than others. These standardised surveys present the first quantitative evidence that numbers of glow-worms could well be declining in the United Kingdom. There is a clear signal of climate warming and drying effects on glow-worm numbers, but a substantially greater proportion of variation in glowing female counts is explained by local-scale site factors, such as unmanaged scrub encroachment. Conservation strategies that can mitigate local population losses could be an essential buffer against climate-driven declines in south-east England. © 2020 The Royal Entomological Society","Beetle; citizen science; climate change; Coleoptera; conservation; firefly; insect decline; Lampyridae; Lampyris noctiluca",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080992772

The Mediterranean Sea is considered a laboratory to examine global processes, and the fan mussel Pinna nobilis a sentinel species within it. Since September 2016, fan mussels suffer a die-off, very likely provoked by the protozoan Haplosporidium pinnae. Population dynamic surveys, rescue programmes, larvae collector installation and protection of infected adults from predators, have increased knowledge about the factors conditioning the spread of the die-off; previous model simulations indicate that water temperature and salinity seem to be related to the manifestation of the disease, which at the end are strongly influenced by climate change and anthropogenic actions. The absence of natural recruitment implies that fan mussel populations are not recovering, but the survival of populations living in paralic environments provides an opportunity to study the disease and its conditioning factors. The fan mussel disease outbreak provides a case example for how climate change may mediate host-protozoan dynamics and poses several questions: are we witnessing the potential extinction of a sentinel species? Can we avoid it by applying active measures? If so, which measures will be more effective? How many other more overlooked species might experience a massive and unnoticed die-off before it is too late to implement any preservation action? This is especially relevant because the loss of keystone species can drive to community effects that influence marine ecosystem processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Haplosporidium pinnae; Mass mortality; Mediterranean endemism; Parasite; Pinna nobilis; Protozoan","ecosystem management; extinction risk; installation; keystone species; mass mortality; protozoan; recruitment (population dynamics); survival; water temperature; waterborne disease; Mediterranean Sea; Haplosporidium; Pinna nobilis; Protozoa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081197428

Undisturbed systems are capable of efficiently exchanging heat with the subsurface and transferring it to human infrastructures, providing the basis for the successful decarbonisation of heating and cooling demands of cities. Unmanaged intensive use of groundwater for thermal purposes as a shallow geothermal energy (SGE) resource in urban environments threatens the resources' renewability and the systems' performance, due to the thermal interferences created by a biased energy demand throughout the year. The exploitation regimes of 27 groundwater heat pump systems from an alluvial aquifer were firstly examined using descriptive statistics. Linear relationships between abstraction and injection temperatures of the systems were assessed by calculating Pearson's r correlation coefficient, and used as an evidence of thermal interferences. Then, time series of flow rate, operation temperature and energy transfer were modelled by means of spectral analysis and sinusoidal regression methods, followed by the definition of the relative exploitation patterns. The exploitation regimes examined presented a clear cooling bias and a similar cyclicality. The amplitudes correlated with the different end-user's activities (e.g. medical centres) when high frequency cycles were observed, while climatization strategies (e.g. constant flow rates and modulation of injection temperatures) did so when low frequency cycles were detected. The time series models allowed defining the relative operational pattern of a system and the groups of systems following such patterns. The biases in exploitation regimes of groundwater heat pump systems existing in Mediterranean areas require correction measures to ensure a more balanced exploitation of the SGE resources. The definition of the characteristic exploitation pattern proposed could be applied to guide resource managers by identifying unbalanced systems, understanding existent exploitation strategies and proposing corrective alternative plans. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Exploitation curve; Groundwater heat pump systems; Renewable energy; Shallow geothermal energy","Air conditioning; Aquifers; Cooling systems; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; Geothermal fields; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Spectrum analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Correlation coefficient; Descriptive statistics; Exploitation curve; Groundwater heat pumps; Injection temperature; Renewable energies; Shallow geothermal energies; Shallow geothermal systems; Groundwater resources; ground water; amplitude; aquifer; cooling; correction; correlation; exploitation; geothermal energy; pump; spectral analysis; time series analysis; amplitude modulation; Article; climate; controlled study; energy transfer; environmental exploitation; environmental sustainability; flow rate; geothermal energy; heat; priority journal; recycling; seasonal variation; Spain; spectroscopy; thermostability; water supply; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077431221

However, despite the HO• quenching effect of carbonate species, the contribution of CO3•− to the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) was observed in UV/sodium percarbonate (UV/SPC). In order to study the performance of UV/SPC for BPA degradation and the role of CO3•− in this process, the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of BPA in UV/SPC and in UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) were compared at equivalent concentration of H2O2. In this study, the observed degradation rates of BPA by UV/SPC and by UV/H2O2 in Milli-Q water were similar. Variation of the BPA degradation rates in the presence of radical quenchers, tert-butanol and phenol, suggested that both CO3•− and HO• contributed to the degradation of BPA in UV/SPC. Second order rate constant of CO3•− towards BPA (kCO3•−+BPA = 2.23 × 108 M−1 s−1) and steady state concentrations of CO3•− ([CO3•−]ss = 2.3 × 10−12 M) and HO• ([HO•]ss = 1.82 × 10−14 M) in UV/SPC were determined with competition kinetics at 1 mM SPC and pH 8.5. The high [CO3•−]ss observed in UV/SPC compensated for the smaller kCO3•−+BPA compared to kHO•+BPA and the consumption of HO• making the degradation rate of BPA in UV/SPC comparable to that in UV/H2O2. Detailed studies on identification of transformation products (TPs) of BPA in UV/SPC revealed that phenol ring and isopropylidene bridge were the main reactive sites of BPA. Degradation pathways were proposed accordingly. The results of kinetic and mechanistic studies provide better fundamental understanding of the degradation of BPA in UV/SPC and HCO3−&amp;CO32− impact on BPA degradation by HO•−AOPs. This also demonstrates potential for CO3•− based water purification technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bisphenol A; Carbonate radical anion; Kinetics and mechanism; UV/sodium percarbonate","Carbonation; Degradation; Ions; Kinetics; Phenols; Rate constants; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Bis-phenol a; Carbonate radical anion; Kinetics and mechanism; Second-order rate constants; Steady state concentration; UV/sodium percarbonate; Water purification technologies; Biodegradation; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; carbonic acid derivative; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxyl radical; phenol; sodium derivative; tert butyl alcohol; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; carbonic acid; hydroxyl radical; phenol derivative; sodium percarbonate; anion; carbonate; degradation; dye; energy efficiency; kinetics; oxidation; performance assessment; radical; transformation; ultraviolet radiation; Article; biotransformation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; degradation; degradation kinetics; electrospray mass spectrometry; photolysis; priority journal; productivity; quadrupole mass spectrometry; rate constant; role playing; time of flight mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; ultraviolet radiation; waste water; waste water management; kinetics; oxidation reduction reaction; ultraviolet radiation; water management; water pollutant; Benzhydryl Compounds; Carbonates; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydroxyl Radical; Kinetics; Oxidation-Reduction; Phenols; Ultraviolet Rays; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076669640

This study analyzes China's energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the economic sectors and their driving forces among three full cycles of the 10th, 11th and 12th FYPs, by applying the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. Our results show that the total emissions began to drop in 2014 and 2015 after a continuous increase from 2001 to 2013, making emission growth during the 12th FYP less than half of the previous two periods. Energy efficiency has been the main player in limiting the emission growth associated with economic activities. The emission mitigation effect of energy structure change became noticeable during the 12th FYP while that from the economic structure change is still marginal, suggesting structure decarbonization as the focal point of future plan design and implementation. We found strong diversities in the emission scale and growth patterns among the 30 provinces (except Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao where no data are available), and a significant switch from high emission growth mode to low emission growth mode in a number of eastern and central provinces. The latter suggesting that the measures taken during the 11–12th FYPs to control emission growth have been effective. Results from this study sheds light on how future FYP may shape low-carbon strategies in China, which may also benefit other emerging economies, especially the “Road and Belt Plan” related regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; China'S five-year strategic plan; Driving forces; LMDI model","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Strategic planning; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Design and implementations; Driving forces; Economic and social development; Low-carbon strategies; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Strategic plan; Highway planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076507983

Since the private car ownership rate in China has not reached its saturation level, limited and outdated data used in previous studies has resulted in high uncertainties regarding the functions of car ownership and significantly reduced the robustness of the projection of private car stocks. In this work, we estimate China’s current growth pattern of private car ownership by analyzing more than 6300 pairs of private car ownership and income data collected from various official statistics at the national, provincial, and city levels in the period of 1997–2017. The dataset covers a much wider per-capita disposable income range than national-level data alone and allows us to make satisfactory projections of private car stocks in China up to 2040. We project that the private car stock in China could reach 403 million in 2040, if the current growth pattern of car ownership continues. Significant discrepancies in private car ownership curves are observed for cities with and without car sales restrictions. Without car sales restrictions, we estimate that the private car stock would be even higher at 455 million by 2040, demonstrating the effectiveness of the current restriction policy in controlling car stocks in China. We further quantify the potential impacts of car sales restrictions on future car stock levels by implementing hypothetical national car sales caps. Results show that, although the private car stocks would still continue to grow before 2030, the stock levels would be stable at ~ 280 and ~ 350 million by 2040 for scenarios of 20 and 25 million sales caps, respectively. The impact of private car stock growth on energy consumption in China is also examined. Pump-to-wheels energy consumption of the private car fleet is projected to be 131, 147, 90, and 113 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2040 for scenarios of the current growth pattern, no sales restriction, the 20 million sales cap, and the 25 million sales cap, respectively. Analysis reveals that private car sales restriction and vehicle population growth control could be an effective strategy for energy consumption reduction (thus greenhouse gas emission mitigation) in China, although the development of the automotive industry may be restrained. © 2019, UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.","Car sales; China; Energy consumption; Private car stock; Projection; Sales restrictions","automobile industry; car ownership; environmental impact; estimation method; fuel consumption; future prospect; growth rate; income; uncertainty analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070217802

It is based on the assumption that the land cover in the field neighborhood is an informative index of how much non-crop area might realistically be maintained or restored in the field itself; i.e., because neighboring lands will reflect the local environmental conditions that support the growth and establishment of non-crop vegetation as well as the likelihood that crop growers will remove areas from production. The model identified variation across the region in land cover distribution, with regions at latitudes between 52°N and 55°N demonstrating the greatest contrasts in the amount of non-crop land between the field and the field neighborhood scale. These findings suggest that there remains capacity for land use decision-makers to optimize the distribution of non-crop land covers in ways the reduce the differences between these scales (i.e., to increase non-crop covers within fields to better represent the neighborhood proportions). Modeling also revealed scale-dependent patterns, such as field margins without crops (400–500 m from field centers) broadly distributed across the region, and evidence that gradients in moisture and temperature have interacted with land use decisions to shape the proximity of non-crop area to fields. © Copyright © 2020 Galpern and Gavin.","agroecosystems; Canadian prairie; ecological intensification; ecosystem services; landscape simplification; perenniality; semi-natural habitat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083504710

Despite climatic constraints which cause undesirable physiological effects and long cropping cycles, subtropical banana yields can be quite high. Although ‘Grand Nain’ is the cultivar most planted in the subtropics, ‘Williams’ and some Dwarf Cavendish clones, like ‘Gruesa’, a Canary Islands selection, are also planted. Climatic constraints and water scarcity have led to protected cultivation of bananas, particularly in Morocco, Canary Islands, Turkey and more recently in Israel where all new plantings are established in greenhouses. Management of pests and diseases is generally easier and cheaper compared with the tropics, due to the limiting effect of low temperatures and humidity on pest and pathogen activities. Most of the subtropical belt is free of black leaf streak (Pseudocercospora fijiensis) and the burrowing nematode (Radopholus similis), although the incidence of Fusarium wilt and, particularly, the rapid spread of tropical race 4 (TR4) is a serious concern for the future. Although proximity to the market is an advantage for subtropical countries like Israel, Turkey or Morocco which sell their bananas locally, market difficulties are present for Canary Islands or Madeira which export their fruits to the Iberian Peninsula where they face the market competition of the so-called ‘dollar bananas’ arriving from Latin American countries. The actual importance of and future prospects for developing banana in the subtropics are analyzed in this paper. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

This paper presents an advanced computational intelligence technique based on an enhanced artificial immune system (EAIS) to improve the performance of the FFCS to support transportation electrification. FFCSs are optimally integrated with utility grid networks, where they offer loading balance and grid protection from any collapse. In addition, the FFCS can achieve a significant reduction in energy costs and maximize energy supply from clean energy resources.

We present morphological properties in the high-resolution (FWHM ∼ 0.″15) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1 mm map for an ultraluminous quasar at z = 6.30, SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 (hereafter J0100+2802), whose black hole (BH) mass M BH is the most massive (∼1.2 × 1010 M o&amp;dot;) at z &gt; 6 ever known. We find that the continuum emission of J0100+2802 is resolved into a quadruple system within a radius of 0.″2, which can be interpreted as either multiple dusty star-forming regions in the host galaxy or multiple images due to strong gravitational lensing. The Mg ii absorption and the potential Lyα line features have been identified at z = 2.33 in the near-infrared spectroscopy toward J0100+2802, and a simple mass model fitting well reproduces the positions and flux densities of the quadruple system, both of which are consistent with the latter interpretation. Although a high-resolution map taken in the Advanced Camera for Survey on board Hubble Space Telescope (HST) shows a morphology with an apparently single component, in our fiducial lens mass model it can simply be explained by a ∼50 pc scale offset between the ALMA and HST emission regions. In this case, the magnification factor for the observed HST emission is obtained to ∼450, reducing the intrinsic M BH estimate to below 109 M o&amp;dot;. The confirmation or the rejection of the gravitational lensing scenario is important for our understanding of the supermassive BHs in the early universe. © 2020. The American Astronomical Society.

However, data on the adverse event (AE) rates are heterogeneous. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, severity, management, and risk factors of AEs related to the use of LAMSs for drainage of PFCs in a large cohort of patients. Methods: This is a multicenter, international, retrospective review from 15 centers of all patients who underwent placement of LAMSs for the management of PFCs. A nested case-control study was conducted in patients with (case) or without (control) AEs. Results: Three hundred thirty-three procedures in 328 patients were performed (5 patients treated with 2 LAMSs). Technical success was achieved in 321 patients (97.9%). Three hundred four patients were finally included in the study (7 excluded for lost to follow-up information; 10 excluded for deaths unrelated to LAMSs). The rate of clinical success was 89.5%. Seventy-nine LAMS-related AEs occurred in 74 of 304 patients (24.3%), after a mean time of 25.3 days (median, 18 days; interquartile range, 6-30) classified as 20 (25.3%) mild, 54 (68.4%) moderate, or 5 (6.3%) severe. On multivariable analysis compared with control subjects, cases were more likely to have walled-off necrosis (WON) versus pancreatic pseudocysts (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-4.46; P = .028), whereas cases were less likely to have undergone tract (balloon) dilation (yes vs no; odds ratio, .47; 95% confidence interval, .22-.93; P = .034). Conclusions: Data from this large international retrospective study confirm that the use of LAMSs for management of PFCs has excellent technical and good clinical success rates. The rate of AEs, however, is not negligible and should be carefully considered before using these stents for drainage of PFCs and in particular for WON. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

In order to forecast such changes, the climate change velocity approach has been used to measure ecosystem exposure to this phenomenon. The Tropical Andes and the Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests (Central Chile) hotspots are priority for conservation due to their high species richness and threats, where climate change is one of the serious pressures to their ecosystems. Even though previous studies have forecasted future climate velocity patterns across the globe, these biodiversity hotspots lack a regional evaluation of the vulnerability to climate change to inform conservation decisions. In this study, we evaluated the vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change velocity at the Southern South America ecoregional system, by using regional climatic data that improves the accuracy of predictions. We estimated forward and backward velocities for temperature and precipitation, and we performed a protected area-level analysis of climate change vulnerability. Also, we compared our results with previous evaluations. We found that forward velocity was higher in the Tropical Andes hotspot for both climatic variables analyzed, whereas backward velocity was higher in the Central Chile hotspot considering just the temperature variable. Finally, we found that in the Central Chile hotspot, smaller protected areas are more vulnerable to climate change as measured by climate change velocity, whereas in the Tropical Andes hotspot, larger protected areas are more vulnerable. Several rapid change areas are expected along the two hotspots. These findings have important conservation implications in the region, especially for the protected areas. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biodiversity hotspots; Central Chile; Climate change velocity; Ecosystem vulnerability; Tropical Andes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079700564

Because of the late start, deficiencies still exist in the understanding, modeling, and exploration of China's carbon trading pilot market. Our goal is to model the carbon price dynamics and explore the regularities of seven city-based carbon trading pilots. Based on the daily carbon price time series, we analyzed the behavior of the carbon log-returns from 2013 to 2018, modeled them with the ARMA–EGARCH–SGED process, assessed the impact of news on volatility, and carried out the backtesting Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis. Statistical analysis shows that the log-returns are skewed kurtosis, fat tail, non-normal distribution, and have significantly volatility clustering. The estimated models perform well and capture the asymmetric impact of news on volatility. Positive news increases bigger volatility than a negative one, except for Hubei and Chongqing. The Shenzhen pilot shows the best performance in resisting markets’ risk, while lower-capability in that are found in Hubei and Tianjin. Moreover, the estimated models for seven pilots have adequate capital to cope with large unexpected losses and VaR estimates give a good prediction of market risk at 99%, 97.5%, and 95% confidence level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ARMA–EGARCH–SGED process; Asymmetric effect; Backtesting Value-at-Risk; Carbon emissions; Carbon price behavior; News impact curve","Autoregressive moving average model; Carbon; Normal distribution; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Time series analysis; Value engineering; Asymmetric effects; Carbon emissions; Carbon price; News impact curve; Value at Risk; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076472814

Urban areas represent between 60% and 80% of global energy consumption and are a significant source of CO2 emissions, making energy management at the urban scale an important area of research. Urban energy systems have a strong influence on the environment, economy, social dimensions and urban spatial planning. Energy consumption affects the urban microclimate, urban comfort, human health, and conversely, urban physical, economic and social characteristics affect the energy urban profile. In order to improve the quality of energy strategies, policies, and plans, local authorities need decision support tools, like energy potential mapping, which have risen significance in the last decades. Energy data are crucial for those tools. They can increase the quality and effectiveness of energy planning but also support the integration between energy and spatial planning. Energy data can also stimulate citizen engagement as well as encourage sustainable behaviours and CO2 emission reduction. This paper aims to increase the practice of data-aware planning, through the study of problems in energy data acquisition and processing observed in European projects focused on developing energy mapping tools. The problems observed attend to two main areas: technical and socio-economic issues. Those were derived from a comparison of energy mapping tools, and the work conducted for the PLANHEAT development. The scope of the research is to understand the main recurring issues in energy data acquisition and processing, in order to overcome the barriers in data availability. Increasing awareness of the relevance of energy data can foster the use of energy mapping tools, increasing the quality of energy policies and planning. © 2020 by the authors.","Data-aware planning; Energy data; Energy planning; Energy Potential Mapping; Spatial planning; Urban energy atlas; Urban energy transition","Carbon dioxide; Data acquisition; Data handling; Decision support systems; Economics; Emission control; Energy management; Energy utilization; Mapping; Urban planning; Energy data; Energy planning; Potential mapping; Spatial planning; Urban energy; Urban energy transitions; Open Data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081718769

Whereby, about seven percent by the gross weight of CO2 emissions resulted from cement production factories. Therefore, the usage of geopolymer binder, to produce pervious concrete, instead of Portland cement considers the one solution towards conserving the environment by reducing emission of carbon dioxide. In this paper, we investigate the production of local metakaolin (MK) as a geopolymer binder to produce Pervious Geopolymer Concretes (PGC). Also, the inclusion of recycled construction materials wastes as aggregates (RA) for production of (PGCs) was studied. PGC was produced from local metakaolin (MK), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) solution, and recycled concrete (RC) as a volumetric partial replacement from the natural coarse aggregate (NA). All PGC specimens cured at a temperature of 50°C for five hours after 24 hours from casting and tested after 28 days. Compressive strength, total void content, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, dry density and coefficient of water permeability for the PGCs were investigated. The results of mechanical properties were ranged from (12.23, 1.81 and 2.5) to (9.86, 1.3 and 1.95) MPa for compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths, respectively. The results articulate that the recycled concrete (RC) can be used as recycled coarse aggregates with a partial replacement for producing PGC with acceptable properties. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082073004

This is represented in the cyber-physical context, in which humans and technologies are allowed to coexist and learn from each other. Design/methodology/approach: The logistics and supply chain sector consists of numerous partners and stakeholders, and despite the limited inclusion of automation and AI within the sector, there are still many manual and repetitive tasks. Findings: Stakeholders in the logistics and supply chain sector are creating awareness and slowly implementing AI and automation within their operations. The majority of shipping and logistics is done through the maritime sector, and this is expected to increase in line with the world’s population. Research limitations/implications: Research was limited to Jamaica and a few other countries in the Caribbean. Broadening the scope to include other regional shipping and logistics industry stakeholders would be helpful. Practical implications: The removal of sometimes mundane and even more complex manual processes in the logistics supply chain will give rise to more efficiencies and possibly increased revenue. Social implications: Creating awareness in the Caribbean of international trends is a challenge. Empowering people to use automation and AI for the mitigation and adaptation of climate change and other disasters is yet to be fully realized. However, those who took part in the study did show a significant inclination toward the use of automation and AI in their every-day lives. Originality/value: The purpose of this paper is to examine statistical data on the understanding of automation and AI within education, the port authority and major operators in the shipping and logistics sector throughout the Caribbean. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Blue economy; Caribbean; Logistics; Shipping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079465946

These correlations generally suffer from covariation of other confounding variables related to climate and other growth-limiting factors, as well as large uncertainties in total (dryCwet) reactive nitrogen (Nr) deposition.We propose a methodology for untangling the effects of Ndep from those of meteorological variables, soil water retention capacity and stand age, using a mechanistic forest growth model in combination with eddy covariance CO2 exchange fluxes from a Europe-wide network of 22 forest flux towers. Total Nr deposition rates were estimated from local measurements as far as possible. The forest data were compared with data from natural or semi-natural, non-woody vegetation sites. The response of forest net ecosystem productivity to nitrogen deposition (dNEP= dNdep) was estimated after accounting for the effects on gross primary productivity (GPP) of the co-correlates by means of a meta-modelling standardization procedure, which resulted in a reduction by a factor of about 2 of the uncorrected, apparent dGPP=dNdep value. This model-enhanced analysis of the C and Ndep flux observations at the scale of the European network suggests a mean overall dNEP= dNdep response of forest lifetime C sequestration to Ndep of the order of 40 50 g C per g N, which is slightly larger but not significantly different from the range of estimates published in the most recent reviews. Importantly, patterns of gross primary and net ecosystem productivity versus Ndep were non-linear, with no further growth responses at high Ndep levels (Ndep >2.5 3 gNm2 yr1) but accompanied by increasingly large ecosystem N losses by leaching and gaseous emissions. The reduced increase in productivity per unit N deposited at high Ndep levels implies that the forecast increased Nr emissions and increased Ndep levels in large areas of Asia may not positively impact the continent s forest CO2 sink. The large level of unexplained variability in observed carbon sequestration efficiency (CSE) across sites further adds to the uncertainty in the dC=dN response. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

It is argued that community integration is a function of three structures: geographical, social and hierarchical. In order to establish hierarchy, the authors applied differentiation along three categorical variables, age (young vs. old), gender (male vs. female) and place of origin (locals vs. non-locals). It was found that diversity exists within the sample in terms of education, age, gender, occupation, religion, land tenure and place of origin. Youth had greater levels of education compared to older population members, and women had lower education levels than men. Integration may be affected by group membership, but women and strangers were less involved in decision-making. Strangers had additional barriers to accessing institutional processes, as well as forestlands and their resources. However, because integration does not vary between demographic groups, there is potential for individuals to generalize their interests as being synonymous with those of others in the community, which could aid in improving collective action, especially through educating community members about risks, opportunities, and their rights in relation to the REDD+ program if it becomes operational. © 2019, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Climate change; Deforestation; Forest degradation; Forest governance; Forest livelihoods","climate change; collective action; deforestation; emission control; ethnography; forest management; governance approach; heterogeneity; livelihood; national park; policy implementation; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; survey; Cameroon; Korup National Park; South West Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075888636

At the level of the individual citizen, the micromanagement of conduct has been established through complex procedures aimed at the rational administration of environmental regulation that intersects with techniques for the administration of ourselves. That is, such an ethopolitics (see Rose 2001) locates questions of government at the level of individual environmental rights, everyday morality, and the ethics of “going green,” as well as at the level of administration, through regulations aimed at reducing car emissions. Concomitantly, the “conduct of conduct” is aimed at corporate citizens that is administered at the level of emission regulatory regimes, as well as through an ethopolitical imaginary of corporate environmental rights and citizenship that is based on, inter alia, fostering environmentally-friendly corporate identities. Drawing on a governmentality analytic, green criminology, and the automobility literatures, we examine how emissions are governed in relation to automobile users and producers. Using the Volkswagen diesel emissions fraud case (also known as “Dieselgate” and “Emissionsgate”), which began in September 2015, as an entry point, this article examines the failure of the Canadian government to monitor and adequately punish emissions violators.

Weathering involves physical and chemical processes that are modified by biological activity of plants, microorganisms and animals. This article reviews recent progress made in understanding biological processes contributing to weathering. A perspective of increasing spatial scale is adopted, examining the consequences of biological activity for weathering from nanoscale interactions, through in vitro and in planta microcosm and mesocosm studies, to field experiments, and finally ecosystem and global level effects. The topics discussed include the physical alteration of minerals and mineral surfaces; the composition, amounts, chemical properties, and effects of plant and microbial secretions; and the role of carbon flow (including stabilisation and sequestration of C in organic and inorganic forms). Although the predominant focus is on the effects of fungi in forest ecosystems, the properties of biofilms, including bacterial interactions, are also discussed. The implications of these biological processes for modelling are discussed, and we attempt to identify some key questions and knowledge gaps, as well as experimental approaches and areas of research in which future studies are likely to yield useful results. A particular focus of this article is to improve the representation of the ways in which biological processes complement physical and chemical processes that mobilise mineral elements, making them available for plant uptake. This is necessary to produce better estimates of weathering that are required for sustainable management of forests in a post-fossil-fuel economy. While there are abundant examples of nanometre- and micrometre-scale physical interactions between microorganisms and different minerals, opinion appears to be divided with respect to the quantitative significance of these observations for overall weathering. Numerous in vitro experiments and microcosm studies involving plants and their associated microorganisms suggest that the allocation of plant-derived carbon, mineral dissolution and plant nutrient status are tightly coupled, but there is still disagreement about the extent to which these processes contribute to field-scale observations. Apart from providing dynamically responsive pathways for the allocation of plant-derived carbon to power dissolution of minerals, mycorrhizal mycelia provide conduits for the long-distance<span idCombining double low line""page1508""/> transportation of weathering products back to plants that are also quantitatively significant sinks for released nutrients. These mycelial pathways bridge heterogeneous substrates, reducing the influence of local variation in <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">C:N</span> ratios. The production of polysaccharide matrices by biofilms of interacting bacteria and/or fungi at interfaces with mineral surfaces and roots influences patterns of production of antibiotics and quorum sensing molecules, with concomitant effects on microbial community structure, and the qualitative and quantitative composition of mineral-solubilising compounds and weathering products. Patterns of carbon allocation and nutrient mobilisation from both organic and inorganic substrates have been studied at larger spatial and temporal scales, including both ecosystem and global levels, and there is a generally wider degree of acceptance of the ""systemic"" effects of microorganisms on patterns of nutrient mobilisation. Theories about the evolutionary development of weathering processes have been advanced but there is still a lack of information connecting processes at different spatial scales. Detailed studies of the liquid chemistry of local weathering sites at the micrometre scale, together with upscaling to soil-scale dissolution rates, are advocated, as well as new approaches involving stable isotopes. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Operating these communities with conventional assets requires constant resupply, which yields a significant logistical burden, creates negative environmental impacts, and increases costs. For example, a 2000-member isolated village in northern Canada relying on diesel generators required 8.6 million USD of fuel per year and emitted 8500 tons of carbon dioxide. Remote community planners can mitigate these negative impacts by selecting sustainable technologies that minimize resource consumption and emissions. However, the alternatives often come at a higher procurement cost and mobilization requirement. To assist planners with this challenging task, this paper presents the development of a novel infrastructure sustainability assessment model capable of generating optimal tradeoffs between minimizing environmental impacts and minimizing life-cycle costs over the community's anticipated lifespan. Model performance was evaluated using a case study of a hypothetical 500-person remote military base with 864 feasible infrastructure portfolios and 48 procedural portfolios. The case study results demonstrated the model's novel capability to assist planners in identifying optimal combinations of infrastructure alternatives that minimize negative sustainability impacts, leading to remote communities that are more self-sufficient with reduced emissions and costs. © 2020 by the authors.","Environmental impact; Infrastructure; Life-cycle cost; Optimization; Remote community; Sustainability","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact; infrastructural development; optimization; sustainability; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083046358

Among these, pigmented nanoflagellates 2–20 μm in size (PNF) are now known to be responsible for a significant part of consumption of bacteria in the open ocean. However, knowledge about the importance of the mixotrophic nutrition of these organisms in coastal upwelling systems, where autotrophy prevails, is very limited. Here we compile the limited available information about mixotrophy of PNF in coastal upwelling systems, focusing on the NW Iberian upwelling, to show that this type of nutrition is relevant in these productive systems and to urge for further studies. Several indirect approaches allow inferring that mixotrophy is significant for PNF in the NW Iberian upwelling, with heterotrophy supplying approximately seventy-five percent of the total carbon requirements in this plankton group. This new insight has major implications for our view of marine food webs in coastal upwelling regions, and must be taken into account to improve biogeochemical models of the transfer of matter and energy in these marine areas. © Copyright © 2020 Figueiras, Arbones, Castro, Froján and Teixeira.","coastal upwelling systems; fluorescence; growth and turnover rates; mixotrophy; NW Iberia; pigmented nanoflagellates",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082654845

CDC is achieved through the use of a carefully prepared oxidizer mixture of reduced oxygen concentration through added high temperature reactive species. In this study, a partially premixed, swirl assisted cylindrical combustor utilized a propane-air flame with either nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas in order to reduce the oxygen concentration of the oxidizer. OH* chemiluminescence signatures were used to determine transition to distributed combustion condition. The results showed transition to CDC at approximately 15% using N2, and 17% using CO2 dilution. Emission of NO and CO were determined under conditions approaching CDC. NO levels of only 2 or 1 ppm were achieved using N2 or CO2 dilution, respectively under CDC condition. In order to determine how the flow velocity structure and eddy size effect the stability and emissions a high speed (3 kHz) particle image velocimetry (PIV) system was used. Increase in dilution enhanced both the radial and axial mean and fluctuating velocities under CDC that foster mixing. Additionally, the Kolmogorov length decreased with increase in dilution resulting in smaller eddy size particularly in the swirl lobe region, which enhanced turbulent dissipation that resulted in lower peak temperatures and reduced thermal NOx emission. Investigation of Reynolds stress showed that dilution with CO2 provided stronger impact on stress than N2 due to the increased density and reduced viscosity of CO2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Colorless distributed combustion; Flow field; Gas turbine combustion; Particle image velocimetry; Ultra-low emission","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Computational complexity; Dilution; Flow fields; Flow velocity; Flow visualization; Oxygen; Reynolds number; Rhenium compounds; Turbulent flow; Velocimeters; Velocity measurement; Combustion efficiencies; Fluctuating velocities; Gas-turbine combustion; Low emission; Lower peak temperatures; Oxygen concentrations; Particle image velocimetries; Turbulent dissipation; Flame research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076026324

The construction or reinforcement of levees can attract more assets and people in flood-prone area, thereby increasing the potential flood damage when levees eventually fail. Moreover, structural protection measures can generate a sense of complacency, which can reduce preparedness, thereby increasing flood mortality rates. We explore these phenomena in the Jamuna River floodplain in Bangladesh. In this study area, different levels of flood protection have co-existed alongside each other since the 1960s, with a levee being constructed only on the right bank and its maintenance being assured only in certain places. Primary and secondary data on population density, human settlements, and flood fatalities were collected to carry out a comparative analysis of two urban areas and two rural areas with different flood protection levels. We found that the higher the level of flood protection, the higher the increase of population density over the past decades as well as the number of assets exposed to flooding. Our results also show that flood mortality rates associated with the 2017 flooding in Bangladesh were lower in the areas with lower protection level. This empirical analysis of the unintended consequences of structural flood protection is relevant for the making of sustainable policies of disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change in rapidly changing environments. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bangladesh; Flood risk management; Levee effect;; Socio-hydrology;",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078896346

In this study, daytime and nighttime PM2.5 samples of one summer (Jul-2016, C1) and two winters (Jan-2017, C2 and Jan-2018, C3, before and during the CRP, respectively) were collected in urban Tianjin. Concentrations of PM2.5 and water-soluble inorganic ions were analyzed, and δ15N and δ18O were used to calculate the contributions of different NOX sources to nitrate based on a Bayesian mixing model. The results showed that the average concentrations of PM2.5 and its dominant inorganic ions (SO4 2−, NO3 −, NH4 +) in C3 during the CRP, compared to C2, decreased by 62.13%, 79.69%, 55.14% and 38.84%, respectively, attesting the improvement of air quality during the CRP. According to the correlation between [NO3 −/SO4 2−] and [NH4 +/SO4 2−] as well as δ18O variations, the homogeneous formation pathway might be dominant in C1, while the heterogeneous pathway would be primary in C2 and C3 during the formation of nitrate. Moreover, the heterogeneous pathway contributed more in C3 than in C2. The dominant sources in C1 were biogenic soil emission (37.0% ± 9.9%) and mobile emission (25.7% ± 19.1%), while coal combustion (42.4% ± 13.8% in C2 and 34.9% ± 14.4% in C3) and biomass burning (31.0% ± 21.2% and 34.7% ± 22.7%) were the main sources in C2 and C3. In the winter, the contribution of coal combustion dropped by about 8% during the CRP (C3) in comparison with that in C2, suggesting the implementation of CRP played an important role in reducing NOX from coal combustion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian mixing model; Coal Replacing Project; Dual isotopes; Nitrate; PM2.5","Air quality; Coal; Isotopes; Mixing; Nitrates; Average concentration; Chemical compositions; Formation pathways; Mixing models; PM2.5; Pm2.5 pollutions; Transformation mechanisms; Water soluble inorganic ions; Coal combustion; ammonia; ion; nitrate; nitrogen 15; oxygen 18; sulfate; aerosol; aerosol formation; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; coal; concentration (composition); isotopic analysis; isotopic ratio; mixing; nitrate; particulate matter; source apportionment; urban area; aerosol; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; Bayes theorem; biogenic soil emission; biomass; burn; carbon footprint; chemical composition; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; correlation analysis; cosmological phenomena; day; night; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; sampling; soil; summer; urban area; winter; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077453121

On the supply side, there are now more and more clean energy sources of electricity such as wind and solar that are being developed and utilized. On the consumption side, electrical energy is continuing to replace fossil fuels. As electric engines, electric cooking and electric heating become more common, electricity will increasingly displace coal and oil. Currently, energy consumption levels are low in rural China, especially in the domestic sector, constraining rural-urban integration and development as well as improvement in the energy consumption of rural regions. Electrification is an effective way to make rural energy consumption cleaner and less carbon-intensive. It can significantly reduce pollution and emissions, thus improving the quality of life and the environment. The present paper discusses the main applications of electrification in rural energy consumption. As rural-urban integration continues to develop, rural energy consumption levels will gradually converge with urban energy consumption levels.

H2SO4 and HNO3, formed from the oxidation of SO2 and NOx, respectively, are the main sources of acid deposition through wet and dry depositions. NOx is also a precursor to the formation of tropospheric O3, which is an important atmospheric oxidant and is also essential for the formation of other atmospheric oxidants, such as OH and H2O2. In the past 26 years from 1990 to 2015, emissions of SO2 and NOx in the US were significantly reduced from 23.1 and 25.2 million t yr1 in 1990 to 3.7 and 11.5 million t yr1 in 2015, respectively. In Canada, SO2and NOx were reduced by 63% and 33% from 1990 to 2014. In response to the significant reductions of SO2and NOx emissions, air quality in the eastern US and Eastern Canada improved tremendously during 1990-2015. In this study, we analyzed surface air concentrations of SO24 , NO3, NHC4, HNO3, and SO2measured weekly by the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) in the US and measured daily from the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) in Canada to reveal the temporal and spatial changes in each species during the 25-year period. For the whole eastern US and Eastern Canada, the annual mean concentrations of SO24 , NO3 , NHC4, HNO3, SO2, and TNO3 (NO3 CHNO3, expressed as the mass of equivalent NO3) were reduced by 73.3 %, 29.1 %, 67.4 %, 65.8 %, 87.6 %, and 52.6 %, respectively, from 1990 to 2015. In terms of percentage, the reductions of all species except NO3 were spatially uniform. The reductions of SO2and HNO3 were similar in the warm season (May-October) and the cold season (November-April), and the reductions of SO24, NO3, and NHC4 were more significant in the warm season than in the cold season. The reductions of SO24 and SO2mainly occurred in 1990-1995 and 2007-2015 during the warm season and in 1990-1995 and 2005-2015 during the cold season. The reduction of NO3 mainly occurred in the Midwest after 2000. Other than in the Midwest, NO3 exhibited very little change during the cold season for the period. The reduction of NHC 4 generally followed the reduction trend of SO24 ; especially after 2000, the temporal trend of NHC4 was almost identical to that of SO24 . The ratio of S in SO24 to total S in SO24 plus SO2, as well as the ratio of NO3 to TNO3 increased by more than 50% during the period. This indicates that a notable change in regional chemistry took place from the beginning to the end of the period, with a higher percentage of SO2being oxidized to SO24 and a higher percentage of HNO3 being neutralized to NH4NO3 near the end of the period. © 2020.

Buildings deteriorate with age, which leads to a decrease in their energy performance. Therefore, it is significant to improve the energy performance of aging building block although it is challenging. The two main decision paths for municipalities are renovation and reconstruction. This study investigated the above options for the older housing stock in a densely populated urban centre in British Columbia, Canada. A scenario-based analysis approach was taken to evaluate the life cycle GHG emissions of six different renovation and reconstruction scenarios. The total life cycle emissions were calculated for each scenario including the embodied and operational emission, and the emissions from building construction and maintenance. A BIM-LCA combined approach was used to assess the embodied GHG emissions with the SimaPro software. HOT2000 software was used to model the operational GHG emissions. The results show that in the reconstruction scenarios, around 40% of the emissions are from the material manufacturing stage. The embodied emissions generated from the reconstruction scenarios are 5–6 times higher than the renovation scenarios. The life cycle GHG emissions of the existing house can be reduced by applying renovations, with the emissions saving gradually increasing with the level of retrofitting. The passive house reconstruction scenario delivers the greatest benefit in terms of life cycle emissions reduction compared to all other scenarios. In terms of the GHG emission intensity per unit area, the newly-built houses in scenarios 5 and 6 also have lower life cycle GHG emission per square meter than the renovated existing houses in scenario 1–4 after 15 and 10 years to breakeven respectively. Based on this, it can be concluded that when considering the older existing building stock, a careful weighing of options must take place before making the decision on replacing them with new construction. However, it is also important to consider the economic and social aspects before making decisions to renovate or replace existing houses. The study outcomes will support city planners and urban development planners to make decisions on BC aging building stock development, especially in high population density neighbourhoods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BIM; Building reconstruction; GHG emissions; Life cycle assessment; Renovation; Residential building","Architectural design; Construction; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Houses; Life cycle; Planning; Population statistics; Social aspects; Urban growth; Building reconstruction; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renovation; Residential building; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076513398

In this study, we used the dynamic climate capability of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to simulate future (100 year) forest conditions on four National Forests in the northwestern USA: Payette National Forest (NF), Ochoco NF, Gifford Pinchot NF, and Siuslaw NF. Using Forest Inventory and Analysis field plots, aboveground carbon estimates and species compositions were simulated with Climate-FVS for the period between 2016 and 2116 under a no climate change scenario and a future climate scenario. We included a sensitivity analysis that varied calculated disturbance probabilities and the dClim rule, which is one method used by Climate-FVS to introduce climate-related mortality. The dClim rule initiates mortality when the predicted climate change at a site is greater than the change in climate associated with a predetermined shift in elevation. Results: Results of the simulations indicated the dClim rule influenced future carbon projections more than estimates of disturbance probability. Future aboveground carbon estimates increased and species composition remained stable under the no climate change scenario. The future climate scenario we tested resulted in less carbon at the end of the projections compared to the no climate change scenarios for all cases except when the dClim rule was disengaged on the Payette NF. Under the climate change scenario, species compositions shifted to climatically adapted species or early successional species. Conclusion: This research highlights the need to consider climate projections in long-Term planning or future forest conditions may be unexpected. Forest managers and planners could perform similar simulations and use the results as a planning tool when analyzing climate change effects at the National Forest level. © 2020 The Author(s).","Climate change; Climate-FVS; dClim rule; Forest carbon planning; Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS); Modeling","carbon budget; climate change; community composition; disturbance; forest ecosystem; growth; mortality; sensitivity analysis; Idaho; Payette National Forest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082652599

However, the public reaction to the deployment of these technologies is still uncertain, and opposition may result in either cancellations or delays. This article provides quantitative insights into how social acceptance affects the design of a European CO2 infrastructure. A multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is developed to optimise the design the entire supply chain, by simultaneously addressing the minimisation of the costs to install and operate the infrastructure and the maximisation of its community acceptance. The goal is to provide optimal supply chains in terms of costs, whilst considering the social behaviour of inhabitants towards the installation and operation of either CO2 pipelines or injection wells. Results demonstrate how the methodology may be exploited to assess the response of local communities and identify design strategies aiming at a trade-off between economic objectives and social acceptance. Although the maximisation of social acceptance leads to a +34% increase in costs with respect to the economic optimum, it is shown that an intermediate solution between the two objectives (i.e., economics against acceptance) entails a just slight increase of +8% with respect to the cost of the best economic configuration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Mixed integer linear programming; Risk perception; Social acceptance; Supply chain optimisation","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Risk perception; Social aspects; Supply chains; Design strategies; Economic objectives; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Optimal supply chain; Reduction targets; Social acceptance; Supply chain optimisation; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077881025

Yet, we lack insights into how changes in climate interact with intraspecific genetic variation in shaping spring and autumn phenology, and how such changes in phenology will translate into seasonal dynamics of tree-associated organisms. To elucidate the impact of warming and tree genotype on spring and autumn phenology, as well as the consequences for the population dynamics of a fungal pathogen Erysiphe alphitoides and plant-feeding insect Tuberculatus annulatus, we conducted an active field heating experiment using grafts of five oak genotypes Quercus robur. We found that experimental warming generally advanced oak bud burst in spring and delayed leaf senescence in autumn, while additional variation was explained by tree genotype and warming-by-genotype interactions. Warming or tree genotype did not affect disease levels at the beginning of the season, but shaped both disease levels and aphid density during the latter part of the season. Overall, our findings demonstrate that elevated temperature and genetic variation affect spring and autumn phenology, as well as the seasonal dynamics of higher trophic levels. Such effects may be either direct (i.e. temperature affecting tree phenology and attack independently) or indirect (as due to climate-induced changes in plant traits or the synchrony between trees and their attackers). To achieve a predictive understanding of the ecological responses and potential evolutionary changes of natural food webs in response to climate warming, we should merge the frameworks of global warming and community genetics. © 2019 The Authors Oikos published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Nordic Society Oikos","aphid–climate interactions; disease; experimental heating; herbivore; host genotype; pathogen–climate interactions; phenology; plant–climate interactions; powdery mildew; Quercus robur","aphid; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; climate change; deciduous tree; experimental study; fungal disease; fungus; genetic variation; genotype; heating; herbivore; intraspecific variation; phenology; phenotype; population dynamics; trophic level; warming; Aphididae; Erysiphales; Erysiphe alphitoides; Hexapoda; Quercus robur; Tuberculatus annulatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076788852

The Data was collected by split plot Design based on randomized complete block design with four replications. The treatments consisted of a combination of three levels of the main tillage factor including conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), no-tillage (NT), and three levels of chemical fertilizer including no fertilizer or N0P0K0 (NPK)0, N50P50K50 (NPK)50 and N100P100K100 (NPK)100. The results of this study showed that the total input energy in CT systems, MT, and NT was 56113.24, 51403.70, and 49144.45 MJ ha−1, respectively. The output energy in this tillage systems was 111989.11, 113312.80 and 109516.68 MJ ha−1 respectively. By reducing the rate of fertilizer, the amount of input and output energy was decreased.

We find that the net storage efficiency (ratio between the stored and captured CO2) of the carbon capture and storage (CCS)-only projects is maximally 6–56% depending on the fuel used in the power plants. With the current state of technology, the CCS process will re-emit a minimum of 0.43–0.94 kg of CO2 per kg of CO2 stored. From thermodynamics point of view, CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with CCS option is not sustainable, i.e., during the life cycle of the process more energy is consumed than the energy produced from oil. For the CCS to be efficient in reducing CO2 levels (1) the exergetic cost of CO2 separation from flue gas should be reduced, and/or (2) the capture process should not lead to additional carbon emission. Furthermore, we find that the exergy recovery factor of CO2-EOR depends on the CO2 utilization factor, which is currently in the low range of 2–4 bbl/tCO2 based on the field data. Exergetically, CO2 EOR with storage option produces 30–40% less exergy compared to conventional CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects with CO2 supplied from natural sources; however, this leads to storage of &gt;400 kg of extra CO2 per barrel of oil produced. © 2019 The Authors","Climate change; CO2 storage; CO2 utilization factor; CO2-EOR; Exergy analysis","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Digital storage; Exergy; Fuel storage; Life cycle; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon emissions; CO2 storage; CO2-EOR; Enhanced oil recovery; Exergy Analysis; Storage efficiency; Utilization factor; Enhanced recovery; carbon sequestration; climate change; enhanced oil recovery; exergy; power plant; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077995921

Objectives: This study investigates the effects of low-concentration PM2.5 on the mortality of adults older than 65 using the closure of coal-fired power plants in the Eastern United States as a natural experiment. Methods: We investigated power plants in the Eastern United States (US) that had production changes through unit shutdown or plant retirement between 1999 and 2013. We included only non-clustered power plants without scrubbers and with capacities greater than 50 MW. We used instrumental variable (IV) and difference-in-differences (DID) approaches to estimate the causal impact of PM2.5 concentrations on mortality among Medicare beneficiaries. We compared changes in monthly age-adjusted mortality before and after the retirement of coal-fired plants between the treated and control counties; we accounted for annual wind direction in our selection of treated and control counties. In the models, we initially included only county and monthly fixed effects, and then adjusted for covariates including: 1) only weather variables (temperature, dew point, pressure); and 2) weather variables and socio-economic variables (median household income and poverty rate). Results: The monthly age-adjusted mortality rate averaged across all plants was approximately 423 per 100,000 (SD = 69) and was higher for males than females. Mean PM2.5 concentrations across all counties were 12 μg/m3 (SD = 3.78). Using the IV method, we found that reductions in PM2.5 concentrations significantly decreased monthly mortality among older adults. IV results show that a 1-μg/m3 reduction in PM2.5 concentrations leads to 7.17 fewer deaths per 100,000 per month, or a 1.7% lower monthly mortality rate among people older than 65 years. Using the DID approach, we found that power plant retirement significantly decreased: 1) monthly PM2.5 levels by 2.1 μg/m3, and 2) monthly age-adjusted mortality by approximately 15 people per 100,000 (or 3.6%) in treated counties relative to control counties. The mortality effects were higher among males than females and its impact was the greatest among people older than 75 years. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of local, plant-level control measures in reducing near-plant PM2.5 and mortality among U.S. Medicare beneficiaries. © 2020 The Author(s).","Causal Relationship; Coal-fired Power Plants; Mortality; Natural Experiment; Older Adults; PM2.5","coal; coal; adult; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); household income; mortality; particulate matter; pollution effect; aged; air pollution; Article; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; controlled study; electric power plant; environmental impact; female; human; male; medicare; mortality; mortality rate; particulate matter; pressure; priority journal; retirement; sex difference; social status; temperature; trend study; United States; weather; adverse event; air pollutant; electric power plant; environmental exposure; epidemiology; mortality; North Carolina; Ohio; particle size; particulate matter; risk assessment; Tennessee; very elderly; United States; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Coal; Environmental Exposure; Female; Georgia; Humans; Male; Mortality; North Carolina; Ohio; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Power Plants; Risk Assessment; Tennessee",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081041201

However, reliable prediction of Rd is difficult when lack of complete or previous climatic data at the target station. This study evaluated the performance of support vector machine (SVM) and four tree-based soft computing models, i.e. M5 model tree (M5Tree), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost), for prediction of daily horizontal Rd when using limited local (Scenario 1) and extrinsic (Scenarios 2 and 3) climatic data. Six input combinations of daily global solar radiation (Rs), sunshine hour (n), maximum/minimum temperature (Tmax/Tmin) and relative humidity (RH) during 1996–2015 at 15 weather stations across various climatic rons of China were considered. The results demonstrated that, when lack of Rs, the average root mean square error (RMSE) was considerably increased across China (42.4%) in Scenario 1, especially in the (sub)tropical monsoon ron (68.3%). SVM offered the best combination of prediction accuracy and generalization capability in all scenarios, followed by CatBoost. CatBoost produced the closest daily Rd estimates to SVM and satisfactory generalization capability. In Scenario 2, CatBoost and SVM models developed with climatic data from Beijing gave the overall best daily Rd estimates over the 15 stations, while models developed with data from 14 weather stations in Scenario 3 produced even better and steadier Rd estimates across China compared with those in Scenario 2. The average computational time of SVM (6.6 s) for a single sample was approximately 1.9 times that of CatBoost (3.5 s) in Scenarios 1 and 2, while the corresponding value (842.6 s) was approximately 33.9 times that of CatBoost (24.9 s) in Scenario 3. Comprehensively considering prediction accuracy, generalization capability and computational efficiency, CatBoost is highly recommended to develop general models for daily Rd prediction in various climatic rons of China, particularly when lack of previous local climatic data. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Computational costs; Diffuse solar radiation; Extreme gradient boosting; Global solar radiation; Gradient boosting with categorical features support","Computational efficiency; Decision trees; Forecasting; Mean square error; Soft computing; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Weather information services; Categorical features; Computational costs; Diffuse solar radiations; Global solar radiation; Gradient boosting; Support vector machines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075833381

Its medical benefits include nourishing the stomach and spleen to improve digestion, replenishing lung and kidney, etc., according to the TCM literature. As living standard rises and public health awareness improves in recent years, the potential medicinal benefits of CMY have attracted increasing attention in China. It has been found that the observed climate change in last several decades, together with the change in economic structure, has driven significant shift in the pattern of the traditional CMY planting areas. To identify suitable planting area for CMY in the near future is critical for ensuring the quality and supply quantity of CMY, guiding the layout of CMY industry, and safeguarding the sustainable development of CMY resources for public health. In this study, we first collect 30-year records of CMY varieties and their corresponding phenology and agro-meteorological observations. We then consolidate these data and use them to enrich and update the eco-physiological parameters of CMY in the agro-ecological zone (AEZ) model. The updated CMY varieties and AEZ model are validated using the historical planting area and production under observed climate conditions. After the successful validation, we use the updated AEZ model to simulate the potential yield of CMY and identify the suitable planting regions under future climate projections in China. This study shows that regions with high ecological similarity to the genuine and core producing areas of CMY mainly distribute in eastern Henan, southeastern Hebei, and western Shandong. The climate suitability of these areas will be improved due to global warming in the next 50 years, and therefore, they will continue to be the most suitable CMY planting regions. © 2019, The Author(s).","AEZ model; Chinese medicinal yam; Climate change; Suitable planting area","agroecology; climate change; climate conditions; living standard; medicinal plant; phenology; public health; sustainable development; China; Dioscorea alata; article; China; climate change; greenhouse effect; human; phenology; public health; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074515838

A proxy trait called local C source–sink ratio was defined as the ratio of flag leaf area to the number of spikelets on the corresponding panicle, and five genotypes differing in this ratio were grown in a controlled greenhouse. Differential CO2 resources were applied either during the 2 weeks following heading (EXP1) or during the whole growth cycle (EXP2). Under e-CO2, low source–sink ratio cultivars (LSS) had greater gains in photosynthesis, and they accumulated less nonstructural carbohydrate in the flag leaf than high source–sink ratio cultivars (HSS). In EXP2, grain yield and biomass gain was also greater in LSS probably caused by their strong sink. Photosynthetic capacity response to e-CO2 was negatively correlated across genotypes with local C source–sink ratio, a trait highly conserved across environments. HSS were sink-limited under e-CO2, probably associated with low triose phosphate utilization (TPU) capacity. We suggest that the local C source–sink ratio is a potential target for selecting more CO2-responsive cultivars, pending validation for a broader genotypic spectrum and for field conditions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","carbon assimilation; climate change; CO2; enrichment; L. phenotypic plasticity; local source–sink ratio; Oryza sativa; sink limitation; triose phosphate utilization","carbon dioxide; climate change; cultivar; genotype; phenotypic plasticity; photosynthesis; rice; source-sink dynamics; Oryza sativa; carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; analysis of variance; atmosphere; biomass; carbon sequestration; chemistry; drug effect; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; Oryza; photosynthesis; Analysis of Variance; Atmosphere; Biomass; Carbohydrates; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Oryza; Photosynthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078658123

In the Philippines, climate change related extreme weather events such as typhoons, floods, and droughts have detrimental impacts on crop production and have significantly affected the livelihoods of cash crop focused rural villages. A shift from crop to livestock production is emerging as a buffer activity to recover from crop losses; however, whether this adaptive response is viable is still unexplored. The aim of this study is to understand how farmers perceive water buffalo as a transformative opportunity and how they use water buffalo in the adaptation process to sustain their livelihoods when the climate becomes more volatile. Data were collected from farming villages in the Nueva Ecija province, the Philippines using mixed methods. It was found that farmers' livelihood patterns evolved as economic consequences of recurrent crop failures caused by typhoons, flooding, and dry spells. Farmers' changed their farming activities as an adaptive response driven by past experiences of climatic changes, farmers' social relations, household capacity, and resources available. The increasing trend of shifting to water buffalo dairying demonstrated farmers' preferences for less risky sources of income in lieu of the opportunities and options available. Thus, local adaptation can be understood to be an outcome of both farmers’ livelihood survival strategies and the institutional dynamics in their localities. The results imply a need to integrate adaptation programs that are linked to local livelihood development, particularly in the Carabao Development Program (CDP). This study concludes by suggesting issues to be considered for water buffalo dairying as a viable adaptation option for climate-resilient livelihoods. © 2019","Climate change adaptation; Climate-resilient livelihoods; Dairy production; Mixed crop-livestock; Mixed methods; Natural disasters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076210101

The cattle ranching sector represents a significant source of the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agricultural intensification has been highlighted as one of the main strategies in reaching global food security and reducing deforestation. The Sudden Death Disease (SDD) of pastures, which affects the most planted cultivar of Urochloa brizantha, is degrading pastures in the Amazon, contributing to low production yields and high emission rates. This paper discusses the intensification of pasture production systems and SDD, to examine the potential for pasture renovation to address livestock productivity and GHG balance, emissions and potential sinks. Does SDD represent a blessing or a curse to climate change mitigation in the Brazilian Amazon? A collection of pasture samples were assessed to measure wet and dry weight in areas with and without SDD, which were related to remote sensing data to provide an overall estimate of the total area affected by the SDD in Alta Floresta, a municipal county of southern Brazilian Amazonia. We found that 77.1% of all pastures had been committed to the syndrome, which has forced farmers to renew their pastures. This also has great potential in increasing soil carbon stocks, effectively reducing the CO2 footprint of meat production in those areas. Therefore, we firmly believe that SDD management has provided an opportunity to rebalance the emissions/sequestration equation associated with meat production by the cattle ranching sector in this Amazonin frontier. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","GHG emission; Land sparing; Land use change; Pasture intensification; Urochloa spp",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079137157

The proposed methodology is validated with an actual case study on an urban city in Egypt, with the developed HRE-MG comprising solar, wind, diesel, and fuel cell energies. Different hybridization scenarios are modeled, evaluated and compared to obtain the most practicable solution with minimum cost and emission impact. The obtained results reveal that solar, wind, fuel cell show optimal configuration plan that yields a minimum net present and energy costs.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating the performance of a parcel distribution network in city logistics. This methodology encompasses the main entities of a two-tier distribution system made up of carriers, huge shopping centers (multi-tenant buildings) and intermediate depots (urban consolidation centers), as well as the parcel flows between them. This methodology aims to optimize the transport flows (distance traveled) of a given distribution network while also quantifying the impact in terms of sustainable development by measuring gas emissions. Two different states of the network with different connectivity degrees are evaluated and compared: the current state of the network as well as its future state. The transport network modeling is based on a network flow, which is expressed in linear programming and implemented with an optimization solver. The validation of this methodology is based on the parcel distribution of the Multi-tenant Buildings of the city of Tokyo. The findings are that the network with greater connectivity between the entities brings significant traveled distance reduction as well as a reduction of emissions of CO2. Another finding is that the grouping of the parcels (i.e., pooling) brings a reduction of the distance traveled compared to the transport organization without grouping and contributes to a reduction in the number of trucks. © 2020 by the author.","City logistics; Freight distribution network; Linear programming; Multi-tenant buildings; Network flow problem; Urban consolidation centers","building; distribution system; flow modeling; methodology; optimization; sustainability; urban area; Tokyo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082924887

While studies have been conducted to assess the implications of climate change on nature resorts in the global north, there is little understanding of how climate change will affect these resorts across Africa, where tourism is a significant contributor towards livelihood security for many. This study examined the evidence for and potential impacts of climate variability and change on nature-based tourism activities in the Kariba resort in Zimbabwe. A case study approach was used, with both primary and secondary data analysed using ArcGIS 10.3. Content and thematic analysis and Mann-Kendall trend analysis were also performed. The study revealed that nature-based tourism in Kariba is under threat from increased and intense droughts, likely resulting from climate change. Extreme temperatures and droughts are critical threats to biodiversity and water levels in Lake Kariba, and they undermine both certain tourist activities and destination attractiveness. Increased incidents of drought, among other factors, have likely led to a reduced hotel occupancy over the last two decades threatening tourism business viability. The paper recommends that the tourism industry in Kariba should streamline its operations, retrofit and invest in green buildings to adapt to climate change. Further studies are suggested to quantify the economic impacts of climate variability and change on flora and fauna. The results provide tourism players and other agencies with information that can support various management decisions and represent a benchmark for future monitoring of climate change in Kariba in line with the dictates of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 on climate action. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Drought impact; Hydro electricity; Lake Kariba; Resort towns; Tourism southern Africa; Zambezi river",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078674796

In this work, we firstly report the successful synthesis of in situ epitaxial growth of g-C3N4 on carbon dots through a facile thermal polymerization technique. Characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to clarify the structure engineering and the electronic/chemical properties of the in-plane interconnected carbon dots/g-C3N4 (C-CN) heterostructures. With the optimal carbon dots content, the C-CN exhibited 3.2 times higher degradation rate for sulfadiazine (SDZ) than that of g-C3N4. Besides, the C-CN heterostructures displayed excellent stability and reusability in five consecutive cycles. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was related to the narrowed band gap and the local electronic density of valance band and conduction band orbitals of the unique plane heterostructures, corroborated by the spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations. Photogenerated holes dominated the degradation of SDZ, while [rad]OH showed a negligible contribution. Moreover, DFT calculation succeeded to predict that the atoms with high Fukin index (f0) on SDZ molecule were more vulnerable to radicals attack. SDZ degradation pathway mainly included smiles-type rearrangement, SO2 extrusion, ring hydroxylation and S[sbnd]N bond cleavage processes. The eco-toxicity assessment revealed the generation of less toxic intermediates after photocatalysis. Our findings not only afford a new technique for constructing g-C3N4-based in-plane heterostructures with high and stable photocatalytic efficiency, but also highlight the feasible application of metal-free photocatalysts in environmental remediation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon dot; Epitaxial grow; g-C3N4; In-plane heterostructures; Sulfadiazine degradation","Chemical bonds; Degradation; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Environmental technology; Photocatalytic activity; Photodegradation; Reusability; Toxicity; Environmental remediation; Epitaxial grow; g-C3N4; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Photocatalytic efficiency; Spectroscopic characterization; Theoretical calculations; Visible-light irradiation; Carbon nitride; carbon; graphite; graphitic carbon nitride; sulfadiazine; unclassified drug; carbon; graphite; graphitic carbon nitride; nitrogen derivative; quantum dot; sulfadiazine; Article; density functional theory; drug degradation; ecotoxicity; facial expression; hydroxylation; irradiation; photocatalysis; polymerization; priority journal; surface area; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; catalysis; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; light; metabolism; photochemistry; toxicity; water pollutant; Carbon; Catalysis; Density Functional Theory; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Graphite; Light; Nitrogen Compounds; Photochemical Processes; Quantum Dots; Sulfadiazine; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075840129

Here we present a precisely dated and highly resolved stalagmite δ18O record from the Yongxing Cave, central China. Our new record, combined with a previously published one from the same cave, indicates that the Meiyu rain has changed dramatically in association with the global temperature change. In particular, our record shows that the Meiyu rain was weakened during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) but intensified during the Little Ice Age (LIA). During the Current Warm Period (CWP), our record indicates a similar weakening of the Meiyu rain. Furthermore, during the MCA and CWP, our records show that the atmospheric precipitation is similarly wet in northern China and similarly dry in central China, but relatively wet during the CWP in southern China. This spatial discrepancy indicates a complicated localized response of the regional precipitation to the anthropogenic forcing. The weakened (intensified) Meiyu rain during the MCA (LIA) matches well with the warm (cold) phases of Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature. This Meiyu rain pattern also corresponds well to the climatic conditions over the tropical Indo-Pacific warm pool. On the other hand, our record shows a strong association with the North Atlantic climate as well. The reduced (increased)Meiyu rain correlates well with positive (negative) phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation. In addition, our record links well to the strong (weak) Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during the MCA (LIA) period. All abovementioned localized correspondences and remote teleconnections on decadal to centennial timescales indicate that the Meiyu rain was coupled closely with oceanic processes in the tropical Pacific and North Atlantic oceans during the MCA and LIA. © Author(s) 2020.",,"hydrological change; hydrological response; Little Ice Age; Medieval Warm Period; Northern Hemisphere; paleoclimate; stalagmite; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081567542

Several of these functions are highly dependent on soil microbes decomposing cover crop residues. Since cover crop species differ in their traits it is hypothesized that plant species residue mixtures with complementary characteristics perform better by stimulating soil microbial functional diversity. To test this, residues of cover crop monocultures and mixtures were mixed with agricultural soil in a microcosm experiment, and fungal and bacterial biomass, microbial metabolic potential, greenhouse gas emissions and soil nutrients were measured during 50 days. Fungal biomass increased for all treatments compared to the control (no additions). However, there were no significant differences between cover crop mixtures and monocultures. Biolog ECO plates were used as a proxy for the metabolic potential of the microbial community. The number of substrates used was significantly higher in soil amended with residues of cover crop mixtures indicating an increased number of substrate niches for microbes. C:N ratio of cover crop residues was shown to be an important variable in explaining dynamics of CO2 and N2O emissions. Mixtures of cover crops showed reduced N2O and CO2 emissions compared to monocultures at the start of the experiment, but did not reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the whole incubation period. Adding nitrogen to the cover crop treatment with the highest C:N ratio (oat) did increase N2O emissions, but not CO2 emissions suggesting that decomposition rate of oat residues is not limited by nitrogen availability. Overall, mixtures of cover crops stimulated microbial functional diversity in soil incubations. Although this may have positive implications for soil quality and functioning in agricultural fields, further studies are needed to verify if these results hold under field conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cover crops; Decomposition; Greenhouse gas emissions; Microbial functional diversity; Sustainable agriculture","Agricultural wastes; Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Mixtures; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Soils; Substrates; Complementary characteristics; Cover crops; Greenhouse gas production; Microbial communities; Microbial functional diversities; Nitrogen availability; Soil organic matter pools; Sustainable agriculture; Crops; agricultural soil; alternative agriculture; biomass; cover crop; crop residue; decomposition; fallow; greenhouse gas; microbial activity; species diversity; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076035902

The present study used mesocosms within a tropical lake in rural São Paulo-Brazil to test the hypothesis that free-floating macrophytes (FFM) reduce predation pressure on prey, as these aquatic plants provide refuge and shade. Fish predation by Astyanax lacustris was observed with the presence and absence of the FFM Eicchornia crassipes over a period of 5 weeks. FFM promoted a more diverse community structure by providing new habitats, especially for small- to medium-sized littoral cladocerans. Tropocyclops prasinus meridionalis were more abundant with the presence of macrophytes. Furthermore, the size distribution of zooplankton differed between treatments at the end of the experiment, in which the larger organisms were less abundant in the treatment with FFM. The present study suggests that FFM affected the interactions between zooplankton and predators, but this influence occurred due to the macrophytes acting as refuge to smaller organisms rather than large-sized individuals. The results also indicated that the macrophytes influenced the zooplankton community by contributing to an increased species richness. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Daphnia laevis; Eichhornia crassipes; Predation; Refuge; Trophic interactions","community structure; fish; lacustrine environment; macrophyte; predation; predator; refuge; size distribution; species richness; tropical region; zooplankton; Brazil; Astyanax; Daphnia laevis; Eichhornia crassipes; Tropocyclops prasinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079134143

I find that the value of the resulting emissions reduction from additional wind generation is approximately twice that of the fuel savings. Additionally, when incorporating the value of reduced emissions, increased generation from already existing wind turbines alone could offset about half of the annualized cost of this transmission expansion while using only 2% of the new transmission capacity. Incorporating the value of emissions reductions could make extending transmission lines to access high quality wind resources more viable, especially if production from already-existing wind turbines in the area are being non-trivially curtailed, as was true in this case. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CREZ; Renewable generation; Transmission; Wind generation","Electric lines; Emission control; Expansion; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Transmissions; Wind power; Wind turbines; CREZ; Emissions reduction; Fossil fuel generators; Renewable generation; Transmission capacities; Transmission costs; Transmission expansion; Wind generation; Cost reduction; accessibility; alternative energy; cost analysis; electricity generation; emission control; wind power; wind turbine; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078052720

Combining an LD-assisted air conditioning system with the ORC, which uses renewable or waste heat sources, may be beneficial in terms of energy saving and environment efficiency. However, only a few studies have addressed the benefits of integrating the ORC with this air conditioning system as the heat source for the ORC. A solar thermal system, district heat source, and conventional boiler were used respectively in a 2-kW ORC which was integrated with the LD-IDECOAS to establish three system cases, and a comparative investigation was conducted. The power and heat generated by the ORC are supplied to the LD-IDECOAS to satisfy the power and solution heating demands, respectively. By performing a detailed energy simulation, the primary energy consumption in each ORC-integrated case was calculated during the cooling season and compared with that of a conventional LD-IDECOAS driven by grid power and a gas boiler. The results revealed that three ORC-integrated system cases consumed additional electric power compared with the base case (21.6% more electric power consumed in case 1 and 20.0% more electric power consumed in cases 2 and 3). Additional heat input to the ORC evaporator was also required, however, the ORC-integrated LD-IDECOAS powered by a solar thermal system (case 1) and district heat source (case 2), which are renewable energy sources, achieved a primary energy saving of 15.7% and 35.4%, respectively, compared with the base case. In conclusion, the district heat source was more feasible than the other heat sources considered in this study, achieving the best primary energy saving (35.4%) and CO2 emission reduction (23.9%). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Liquid desiccant; Organic Rankine cycle; Renewable energy; Solar thermal system","Air conditioning; Boilers; Cooling; District heating; Driers (materials); Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Liquids; Renewable energy resources; Solar heating; Waste heat; Energy-saving and environments; Liquid desiccant; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Organic Rankine cycles; Primary energy consumption; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar thermal systems; Rankine cycle; air conditioning; alternative energy; cooling; electrical power; energy efficiency; heat source; heating; simulated annealing; simulation; solar power; thermal power; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073498142

The fabricated devices consist of a conductive glass photoanode coated with an electrochromic WO3 film of optical quality, including a mesoporous TiO2 layer (sensitized by the MK2 organic dye) that covers 20% of the device area. The liquid electrolyte is composed of 0.22 M Co(II)(bpy)3(PF6)2, 0.5 M LiClO4 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine. A platinized conductive glass cathode completes the cell set-up. The fabricated devices are almost transparent in the bleached state with a Tlum value above 50%. They exhibit coloration speeds in the order of minutes, with a maximum contrast ratio of 2.9:1 after 21 min of illumination at 1000 W m−2 under open circuit conditions (OC), and high reversibility to fully bleached state in short circuit conditions. They provide a maximum measured power conversion efficiency of 0.28% due to limitations imposed by conflicting requirements of the photovoltaic and electrochromic elements, which is nonetheless sufficient to drive the coloration process. Since only the reduced specie Co2+ is present, initial illumination under OC for 3 min at 1000 W m−2 is necessary, prior to measurements, to oxidize Co2+ to Co3+ through the dye regeneration process in the electrolyte. The higher recombination losses of the Co2+/3+ redox shuttle compared to I−/I3 −, which lead to a considerable reduction in coloration depth 20 days post fabrication due to loss of photoelectrons at the WO3/electrolyte interface, are suppressed by the use of a 35 nm thick ZnS barrier deposited on top of WO3. Remarkably, it results in a stabilized contrast ratio of 1.5:1, 23 days post fabrication. In addition, the color coordinates of the present devices resemble those of typical electrochromics: they exhibit blue coloration, as a result of the lack of the absorbing iodine in the electrolyte that produces a green tint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cobalt electrolyte; Photoelectrochromic; Titania; Tungsten oxide; ZnS barrier","Bleaching; Chlorine compounds; Cleaning; Electrochromism; Electrolytes; Fabrication; Glass; II-VI semiconductors; Lithium compounds; Photoelectric devices; Titanium dioxide; Tungsten compounds; Zinc sulfide; Open circuit conditions; Photoelectrochromic; Photoelectrochromic devices; Power conversion efficiencies; Short-circuit conditions; Titania; Tungsten oxide; ZnS barrier; Cobalt compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075818637

In recent studies afforestation is presented as a major solution to limit climate change. However, estimates of afforestation potential vary widely. Moreover, the risks in global mitigation policy and the negative trade-offs with food security are often not considered. Here we present a new approach to assess the economic potential of afforestation with the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model framework. In addition, we discuss the role of afforestation in mitigation pathways and the effects of afforestation on the food system under increasingly ambitious climate targets. We show that afforestation has a mitigation potential of 4.9 GtCO2/year at 200 US$/tCO2 in 2050 leading to large-scale application in an SSP2 scenario aiming for 2°C (410 GtCO2 cumulative up to 2100). Afforestation reduces the overall costs of mitigation policy. However, it may lead to lower mitigation ambition and lock-in situations in other sectors. Moreover, it bears risks to implementation and permanence as the negative emissions are increasingly located in regions with high investment risks and weak governance, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa. Afforestation also requires large amounts of land (up to 1,100 Mha) leading to large reductions in agricultural land. The increased competition for land could lead to higher food prices and an increased population at risk of hunger. Our results confirm that afforestation has substantial potential for mitigation. At the same time, we highlight that major risks and trade-offs are involved. Pathways aiming to limit climate change to 2°C or even 1.5°C need to minimize these risks and trade-offs in order to achieve mitigation sustainably. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","afforestation; climate change mitigation; food security; integrated assessment; land-based mitigation; negative emissions","afforestation; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; food security; land management; risk assessment; trade-off; Africa south of the Sahara; agriculture; catering service; climate change; Africa South of the Sahara; Agriculture; Climate Change; Food Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073747395

Recent evolutionary studies have suggested that terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of M dwarfs are probably tidally locked and have limited surface water inventories as a result of their host stars' high early luminosities. Several previous climate simulations of such planets have indicated that their remaining water would be transported to the planet's permanent nightside and become trapped as surface ice, leaving the dayside devoid of water. Here we use a three-dimensional general circulation model with a water cycle and accurate radiative transfer scheme to investigate the surface water evolution on slowly rotating tidally locked terrestrial planets with limited surface water inventories. We show that there is a competition for water trapping between the nightside surface and the substellar tropopause in this type of climate system. Although under some conditions the surface water remains trapped on the nightside as an ice sheet, in other cases liquid water stabilizes in a circular area in the substellar region as a wetland. Planets with 1 bar N2 and atmospheric CO2 levels greater than 0.1 bar retain stable dayside liquid water, even with very small surface water inventories. Our results reveal the diversity of possible climate states on terrestrial-type exoplanets and highlight the importance of surface liquid water detection techniques for future characterization efforts. © 2020.

High-resolution observations revealed relationships between the SSC and Chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration from seasonal to intratidal time scales. Local maxima of time-averaged Chla levels occurred at locations with relatively low SSC. In the upper (lower) part of the estuary, larger Chla concentrations were observed during the wet (dry) season. In contrast to longer time scales, SSC and Chla exhibited in-phase oscillations during the spring-neap cycle. Both SSC and Chla were found to peak at maximum ebb and flood. There was no positive correlation at certain apogean neap tides, and instead, Chla exhibited daily variations. An idealized model was developed, which mimicked and helped to explain SSC-Chla relationships at different time scales. The model accounts for the vertical advection of Chla and SSC, tidal resuspension, radiation-mediated growth, and effects of the change in stratification stemming from tides and SSC. The specific growth rate of the Chla biomass is inhibited due to high SSC throughout the year. The in-phase relationship at spring-neap and tidal scales seems to be due to resuspension of algal microorganisms attached to sediments. Daily variability of Chla during apogean neap tides emerges because tidal shear stress is low and the strong decline in the suspended particulate matter reduces the light attenuation. The light-mediated growth of part of the biomass, still remaining in the upper layers of the water column, is then driven by the day-night cycle. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

To aid decision-making under climate change, we developed a bottom-up approach for assessing the performance of flood management systems under climate uncertainty and nonstationarity. The developed bottom-up approach was applied to the American River, CA, USA flood management system by first identifying the sensitivity and vulnerability of the system to different climates. To do this, we developed a climate response surface by calculating and plotting Expected Annual Damages (EAD, $/year) under different flood regimes. Next, we determined a range of plausible future climate change and flood frequency scenarios by applying Bayesian statistical methods to projected future flows derived from a Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model forced with Global Circulation Model (GCM) output. We measured system robustness as the portion of plausible future scenarios under which the current flood system could meet its performance goal. Using this approach, we then evaluated the robustness of four proposed management strategies in the 2012 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan in terms of both flood risk and cost-effiectiveness, to assess the performance of the strategies in the face of climate risks. Results indicated that the high sensitivity of the expected damages to changes in flood regimes makes the system extremely vulnerable to a large portion of the plausible range of future flood conditions. The management strategy that includes a combination of nature-based flood management actions along with engineered structures yields the greatest potential to increase system robustness in terms of maintaining EAD below an acceptable risk threshold. However, this strategy still leaves the system vulnerable to a wide range of plausible future conditions. As flood frequency regimes increase in intensity from the current conditions, the cost-effiectiveness of the management strategies increases, to a point, before decreasing. This bottom up analysis demonstrated a viable decision-making approach for water managers in the face of uncertain and changing future conditions. Neglecting to use such an approach and omitting climate considerations from water resource planning could lead to strategies that do not perform as expected or which actually lead to mal-adaptations, increasing vulnerability to climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Bayesian statistics; Bottom-up risk assessment; Climate change adaptation; Climate uncertainty; Flood frequency analysis; Flood risk; Nonstationarity","Climate change; Climate models; Decision making; Flood control; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Water resources; Bayesian statistics; Bottom up; Climate change adaptation; Climate uncertainty; Flood frequency analysis; Flood risks; Non-stationarities; Floods; adaptive management; Bayesian analysis; bottom-up approach; climate change; flood frequency; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; vulnerability; water resource; American River; California; Central Valley [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082776378

Different management practices affected SOC mainly at the soil surface level. The different fractions of SOC viz. total SOC, particulate organic carbon, soil microbial biomass carbon, and potentially mineralizable carbon, were reported to be strongly correlated over a diversity of soils and management systems. Frequent tillage deteriorates soil structure and weakens soil aggregates, causing them to be susceptible to decay. The mixing of residues/surface retention into the soil increases SOM mineralization due to greater exposure to microbial decomposers and optimal moisture and temperature. Increased efficiency of N fertilizers use can result in reduced carbon footprints of field crops, because the contribution of N fertilizers is 36–52% of total emissions while increased soil C sequestration reduces the carbon footprint, because the input carbon as CO2 from atmospheric is converted into the plant biomass and eventually deposited to the soil. Decreasing soil tillage integrated with crop residues retention can increases SOC and decreases carbon footprint, and the mixing of key agricultural practices could increase the crop yields, reduce the emissions and carbon footprint respectively. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon footprint; Microbial community; Soil aggregates; Soil quality; Straw return; Tillage",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075884165

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may help plants to cope with expected changes but may also be impacted by changing rainfall, either via the direct effects of low soil moisture on survival and function or indirectly via changes in the plant community. In an Australian mesic grassland (former pasture) system, we characterized plant and AM fungal communities every 6 months for nearly 4 years to two altered rainfall regimes: (a) ambient, (b) rainfall reduced by 50% relative to ambient over the entire year and (c) total summer rainfall exclusion. Using Illumina sequencing, we assessed the response of AM fungal communities sampled from contrasting rainfall treatments and evaluated whether variation in AM fungal communities was associated with variation in plant community richness and composition. We found that rainfall reduction influenced the fungal communities, with the nature of the response depending on the type of manipulation, but that consistent results were only observed after more than 2 years of rainfall manipulation. We observed significant co-associations between plant and AM fungal communities on multiple dates. Predictive co-correspondence analyses indicated more support for the hypothesis that fungal community composition influenced plant community composition than vice versa. However, we found no evidence that altered rainfall regimes were leading to distinct co-associations between plants and AM fungi. Overall, our results provide evidence that grassland plant communities are intricately tied to variation in AM fungal communities. However, in this system, plant responses to climate change may not be directly related to impacts of altered rainfall regimes on AM fungal communities. Synthesis. Our study shows that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities respond to changes in rainfall but that this effect was not immediate. The AM fungal community may influence the composition of the plant community. However, our results suggest that plant responses to altered rainfall regimes at our site may not be resulting via changes in the AM fungal communities. © 2019 The Authors.

Here we focus on how the changing ice cover impacts transborder exchange of sea ice between the exclusive economic zones of the Arctic states. We use the Sea Ice Tracking Utility, which follows ice floes from formation to melt, in conjunction with output diagnostics from two ensembles of the Community Earth System Model that follow different future emissions scenarios. The Community Earth System Model projects that by midcentury, transnational ice exchange will more than triple, with the largest increase in the amount of transnational ice originating from Russia and the Central Arctic. However, long-distance ice transport pathways are predicted to diminish in favor of ice exchanged between neighboring countries. By the end of the 21st century, we see a large difference between the two future emissions scenarios considered: Consistent nearly ice-free summers under the high emissions scenario act to reduce the total fraction of transnational ice exchange compared to midcentury, whereas the low emissions scenario continues to see an increase in the proportion of transnational ice. Under both scenarios, transit times are predicted to decrease to less than 2 yr by 2100, compared to a maximum of 6 yr under present-day conditions and 2.5 yr by midcentury. These significant changes in ice exchange and transit time raise important concerns regarding risks associated with ice-rafted contaminants. ©2020.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper questions future availability of the physical and the human factors that foster ski tourism development in Arctic Sweden and suggests a comparative case study in relation to the already existing large resort-based ski destinations in Arctic Finland. Findings: Preliminary documentary analysis shows that the governmental and the industrial discourses over the past decade have acknowledged a competitive edge for Sweden and its northernmost regions in particular and may even propose a structural shift for ski tourism in the near future agenda. The visualisations based on natural snow projections presented in this paper confirm this comparative advantage but other technical and socioeconomic development factors are further discussed, in relation to Arctic Finland. Research limitations/implications: Future research agenda is suggested to cover, first, assessment of natural and technical snow reliability of existing and all potential ski areas in Sweden and within its competitive set extending to all the Nordics and the Alps, then, incorporation of adaptive capacities of the suppliers but especially the likely substitution tendencies of the consumers, and finally, evaluation of the overall situation in terms of the regional development needs. Social implications: It is apparent that land use conflicts will arise in case of large ski resort-based destination development in Arctic Sweden, especially around the environmentally protected areas, which are not only already important attractions for nature-based tourism but also traditional livelihoods for the Sami. Originality/value: This is the first paper to discuss a potential regional and structural shift of ski tourism in Sweden. © 2019, Osman Cenk Demiroglu, Linda Lundmark, Jarkko Saarinen and Dieter K.

We investigated the relationships between plant and soil microbial diversity and MWD of an ultramafic Ferralsol along a vegetational succession gradient in New Caledonia, where wildfires and extensive nickel mining have degraded the landscape. Methods: Five plant communities were studied. For each one, MWD, soil physicochemical parameters (e.g. soil organic carbon (SOC)), plant root traits and fungal abundance were measured. The diversity and structure of plant and microbial communities were respectively assessed via botanical inventories and a metagenomic approach. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to assess the influence of diversity indexes on MWD. Constrained ordinations (CCA) were performed to assess the influence of communities’ structures on MWD. Results: GLM highlighted the linkage between SOC and MWD but did not identify any significant influence of diversity indexes on MWD. CCA revealed a significant influence of communities’ structures, especially the abundance of saprotrophic fungi, on MWD. Conclusions: We showed that the structure, but not species richness and diversity of plants, soil fungi and bacteria influence aggregate stability on Ferralsols. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","New Caledonia; Saprotroph; Shannon index; Simpson index; Soil metagenomic; Ultramafic substrates","abundance; aggregate stability; bacterium; biodiversity; community structure; Ferralsol; fungus; soil aggregate; species diversity; succession; tropical region; New Caledonia [Melanesia]; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078191123

In this study we simultaneously addressed individual and combined effects of these factors on the soil microbial community structure and function. We tested linear as well as non-linear responses in a multifactorial climate manipulation experiment. After two years of climate change manipulations on a pre-Alpine managed grassland, topsoil samples were taken for analysis of functional enzyme activities, as well as microbial community structure. Besides, soil and vegetation parameters were measured to allow evaluation of direct and indirect effects. Pronounced and statistically significant spatial effects were observed on our field site for some variables. It is assumed that the history of site preparation could provide an explanation for the observed differences. Elevation of temperature or atmospheric CO2 did not induce strong shifts of soil fungal or bacterial communities. Only the inclusion of the spatial effects in the response surface regression model allowed the detection of subtle microbial responses to climate change scenarios. Mucor globulifera responded to temperature and CO2 in a pattern similar to soil water content. An increase in the relative abundance of coprophilous white rot fungi was observed upon warming, and this might be attributed to preferences of macrofauna for warmer plots. Specific extracellular enzyme activities were positively correlated with each other, especially within two groups of enzymes, which were involved in C-acquisition and in N-mining. The latter group responded positively to elevated CO2 concentrations. Chitinolytic activity increased with the relative abundance of the nematophagous and entomopathogenic ascomycete Purpureocillium lilacinum. We conclude that the indirect effects of future climate change scenarios prevail over direct effects on soil microbial community composition and function. Soil water content, nutrient pools, atmospheric CO2 and plant root identity were identified as drivers of the observed changes after removal of unintended spatial effects. Application of advanced statistical tools, which take spatial variability into account, was necessary to detect these effects. Minor changes in the fungal community occurred already after a short period of climate manipulation. More pronounced effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and surface warming on soil microbial community structure and function are expected on the longer-term, but indirect effects will most likely remain the dominant drivers. © 2020 The Authors","Alpine grassland; Bacteria; Climate change; Fungi; Soil enzyme activities; Soil microbial communities","Atmospheric structure; Atmospheric temperature; Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Enzymes; Forestry; Fungi; Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Statistical mechanics; Surface properties; Alpine grasslands; Climate change scenarios; Extracellular enzyme activity; Microbial community structures; Soil enzyme activity; Soil microbial community; Soil microbial community compositions; Soil microbial community structure; Climate change; alpine environment; bacterium; carbon dioxide; climate change; community structure; concentration (composition); enzyme activity; functional role; fungus; future prospect; grassland; microbial community; scenario analysis; site preparation; soil microorganism; surface temperature; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Mucor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077792729

LivingLab stories and the sociotechnical experiments being co-produced in these spaces in the context of energy transition can offer opportunities for advancing and reflecting upon how the energy transition agenda can be scaled and accelerated in the context of our temporally specific climate mitigation needs.

This asymmetry has been a factor in the debate about whether to use taxes or Tradable Permit Schemes (TPS) for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. We analyze the allocative efficiency of a TPS for a congestible facility such as an airport, a road, a recreational area, or a museum that experiences supply and demand shocks. The number of permits issued cannot depend on the state. We compare the efficiency of a TPS and a congestion fee when the level of the fee is similarly constrained to be the same across states. When demand and cost curves are linear, a fee outperforms a TPS for several combinations of additive and/or multiplicative demand and cost shocks. More generally, the ranking depends on the nature and magnitude of demand and cost shocks, the elasticity of the cost function, and whether or not the permit requirement always binds. A TPS tends to perform well when first-best usage levels are similar across states. Analogously, a fee is relatively efficient if first-best fees are similar across states. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Congestion fee; Market efficiency; Second-best; Tradable permit schemes; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077983120

This work evaluates the influence of PC (ASTM C150 Type III) content on the fresh (i.e. rheological behaviour) and hardened (i.e. compressive strength, dynamic and static modulus of elasticity, porosity and permeability) properties of concrete mixtures produced with low to moderate (54, 159 and 260 kg/m 3) PC amounts. Results show that it is possible to produce eco-efficient concrete without compromising the fresh and hardened states of the material. However, the durability and long-term properties of low cement content systems should be further appraised. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","permeability & pore-related properties; rheological/rheological properties; sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Compressive strength; Hardening; Portland cement; Sustainable development; Cement content; Hardened state; Long-term properties; Properties of concretes; Rheological behaviour; rheological/rheological properties; Static modulus of elasticities; Concrete mixtures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078206631

The effects of the H2O2 concentration and the specific rate of photon emission (EP,0) on BPA degradation were investigated. A kinetic model derived from a reaction sequence was employed to predict BPA and hydrogen peroxide concentrations over time using an annular photochemical reactor in batch recirculation mode. The local volumetric rate of photon absorption (LVRPA) inside the photoreactor was computed using a Line Source with Parallel Plane emission model (LSPP). From the proposed kinetic model and the experimental data, the second order rate constants of the reactions between hydroxyl radicals and the main reacting species (H2O2 and BPA) were estimated applying a nonlinear regression method. A good agreement between the kinetic model and experimental data, for a wide range of operating conditions, was obtained. For BPA, H2O2, and TOC concentrations, the calculated root means square errors (RMSE) were 2.3 × 10− 2, 9.8 × 10− 1, and 9.0 × 10− 2 mmol L− 1, respectively. The simplified kinetic model presented in this work can be directly applied to scaling-up and reactor design, since the estimated kinetic constants are independent of the reactor size, shape, and configuration. Further experiments were made by employing low BPA initial concentration (100 μg L− 1) in water and real wastewater. A lower degradation rate of BPA was observed in the real wastewater, although the UV/H2O2 process has also been able to completely degrade the target pollutant in less than 1 h. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Advanced oxidation process; Bisphenol A; Kinetic modeling; Optimization; UV/H2O2","bioreactor; degradation; dye; experimental study; hydrogen peroxide; optimization; oxidation; reaction kinetics; ultraviolet radiation; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; hydrogen peroxide; phenol derivative; chemistry; kinetics; ultraviolet radiation; water pollutant; Benzhydryl Compounds; Hydrogen Peroxide; Kinetics; Phenols; Ultraviolet Rays; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077034824

However, the lack of observational data and disagreement among the many available inventories makes it difficult for China to track progress toward these goals and evaluate the efficacy of control measures. To demonstrate the value of atmospheric observations for constraining CO2 inventories we track the ability of CO2 concentrations predicted from three different CO2 inventories to match a unique multi-year continuous record of atmospheric CO2. Our analysis time window includes the key commitment period for the Paris Agreement (2005) and the Beijing Olympics (2008). One inventory is China-specific and two are spatial subsets of global inventories. The inventories differ in spatial resolution, basis in national or subnational statistics, and reliance on global or China-specific emission factors. We use a unique set of historical atmospheric observations from 2005 to 2009 to evaluate the three CO2 emissions inventories within China s heavily industrialized and populated northern region accounting for33 % 41%of national emissions. Each anthropogenic inventory is combined with estimates of biogenic CO2 within a high-resolution atmospheric transport framework to model the time series of CO2 observations. To convert the model observation mismatch from mixing ratio to mass emission rates we distribute it over a region encompassing 90% of the total surface influence in seasonal (annual) averaged back-trajectory footprints (L_0.90 region). The L_0.90 region roughly corresponds to northern China. Except for the peak growing season, where assessment of anthropogenic emissions is entangled with the strong vegetation signal, we find the China-specific inventory based on subnational data and domestic field studies agrees significantly better with observations than the global inventories at all timescales. Averaged over the study time period, the unscaled China-specific inventory reports substantially larger annual emissions for northern China (30 %) and China as a whole (20 %) than the two unscaled global inventories. Our results, exploiting a robust time series of continuous observations, lend support to the rates and geographic distribution in the China-specific inventory Though even long-term observations at a single site reveal differences among inventories, exploring inventory discrepancy over all of China requires a denser observational network in future efforts to measure and verify CO2 emissions for China both regionally and nationally.We find that carbon intensity in the northern China region has decreased by 47% from 2005 to 2009, from approximately 4 kg of CO2 per USD (note that all references to USD in this paper refer to USD adjusted for purchasing power parity, PPP) in 2005 to about 2 kg of CO2 per USD in 2009 (Fig. 9c). However, the corresponding 18% increase in absolute emissions over the same time period affirms a critical point that carbon intensity targets in emerging economies can be at odds with making real climate progress. Our results provide an important quantification of model observation mismatch, supporting the increased use and development of China-specific inventories in tracking China s progress as a whole towards reducing emissions. We emphasize that this work presents a methodology for extending the analysis to other inventories and is intended to be a comparison of a subset of anthropogenic CO2 emissions rates from inventories that were readily available at the time this research began. For this study s analysis time period, there was not enough spatially distinct observational data to conduct an optimization of the inventories. The primary intent of the comparisons presented here is not to judge specific inventories, but to demonstrate that even a single site with a long record of high-time-resolution observations can identify major differences among inventories that manifest as biases in the model data comparison. This study provides a baseline analysis for evaluating emissions from a small but important region within China, as well a guide for determining optimal locations for future ground-based measurement sites. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Hydrogen as an energy carrier and energy storage medium has gained enormous interest globally in recent years. Its use in stand-alone or off-grid microgrids for both the urban and rural communities has commenced recently in some locations. Therefore, this research evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of renewable energy-based systems using hydrogen as energy storage for a stand-alone/off-grid microgrid. Three case scenarios in a microgrid environment were identified and investigated in order to select an optimum solution for a remote community by considering the energy balance and techno-economic optimization. The ""HOMER Pro"" energy modelling and simulating software was used to compare the energy balance, economics and environmental impact amongst the proposed scenarios. The simulation results showed that the hydrogen-battery hybrid energy storage system is the most cost-effective scenario, though all developed scenarios are technically possible and economically comparable in the long run, while each has different merits and challenges. It has been shown that the proposed hybrid energy systems have significant potentialities in electrifying remote communities with low energy generation costs, as well as a contribution to the reduction of their carbon footprint and to ameliorating the energy crisis to achieve a sustainable future. © 2020 by the authors.

But extending the progeny testing programmes to the farmer's herds will sort out the issue of less number of progeny per bull. The first lactation records of 4,782 crossbred cows which were daughters of 121 bulls and calved over a period of 12 years from 1996 to 2008 were used to determine the genetic worth of HF crossbred bulls under different agro-climatic conditions and to assess their ranking. The average first lactation milk yield in field HF crossbred cows was 2806.51±56.06 kg. In this evaluation average number of progeny per bull was 39.5. The breeding value of bulls was estimated as 2,920.59 kg for 1st ranked bull and 2662.58 kg for 121st ranked bull. A total of 47 bulls (38%) showed higher breeding values ranging from 2,807.91 to 2,920.59 kg over and above the herd average. Among the fixed effects, the centre of field progeny testing programme and year of calving had significant effect on first lactation milk yield of daughters.

The results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that profitability is positively significant with carbon disclosure while leverage is negatively significant. However, the governance structure does not seem to have any influence on the disclosure of carbon information. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions drawn from the study must be interpreted with caution as the sample companies only comprise of the top 100 public-listed companies in Malaysia to provide an initial insight into the situation in Malaysia. Furthermore, the interpretations and conclusions drawn from this study are based solely on a cross-sectional analysis of the data for only one year. Practical implications: This finding is a significant contribution to regulatory bodies and policymakers regarding the drivers of climate change initiatives in an emerging economy such as Malaysia. This finding suggests that in the Malaysian setting, financial structure influence decisions on climate change initiatives. Social implications: The commitment by business leaders of the impact on climate from the production processes would contribute towards a low carbon economy and subsequently improve the quality of life of the community. Originality/value: The findings of the study provide insight of the business attitude towards climate change in an emerging economy such as Malaysia. © 2019, Faizah Darus, Hidayatul Izati Mohd Zuki and Haslinda Yusoff.","Carbon disclosure; Corporate governance; Financial strength",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082423350

The authors investigate the short-run and long-run impact of agricultural contribution, renewable energy consumption, real income, trade liberalisation and urbanisation on carbon emissions for a balanced panel of five South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries spanning the period 1990-2013. Design/methodology/approach: Pedroni and Kao cointegration techniques have been used to test the existence of long-run relationship between the variables. The directions of causal relationships have been verified using Granger causality tests. Further, the long-run parameters of the baseline equation have been estimated by using the fully modified ordinary least squares, the technique developed by Pedroni, (2001a) for heterogeneous cointegrated panels. Findings: The result reveals that agricultural contribution and renewable energy consumption improve environmental quality in the long run, while urbanisation and per capita real income degrade it. The study did not find any evidence of “pollution heaven hypothesis” in the selected countries. The Granger causality tests confirm bidirectional causality between carbon emissions and income and between carbon emissions and urbanisation. In addition, there is unidirectional causality running from agricultural contribution to renewable energy consumption. Originality/value: This is the only study to investigate the role of agriculture sector in carbon mitigation from a panel of South Asian economies. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is also the first study to test the applicability of “pollution heaven hypothesis” for SAARC countries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agricultural contribution; Carbon emissions; Co-integration; Error correction models; FMOLS; Granger causality; Panel cointegration; Renewable energy; SAARC; Time series analysis; Unit root test","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Energy utilization; Error correction; Pollution; Statistical tests; Time series analysis; Agricultural contribution; Carbon emissions; Cointegration; Error correction models; FMOLS; Granger Causality; Panel co integrations; Renewable energies; SAARC; Unit root tests; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078005912

At the same time, there are growing concerns on when intervention is most appropriate, the transaction costs of coordination, and the adequacy of institutional capacity at local levels, especially in developing countries. This article examines entry points and mechanisms for integrating concerns with climate change into local development planning in Cambodia. An institutional ethnography of the planning process indicates that subnational planning is participatory and flexible; and thus, provides plausible entry points to integrate climate change concerns. Case study methods applied to two externally supported, climate-resilient development projects identify promising mechanisms and strategies, as well as obstacles to integration. A vulnerability reduction assessment tool and top-up grant scheme both included promising deliberative and participatory elements from which lessons for future and elsewhere can be drawn. At the same time, key stakeholders concede that local integration more widely is hampered by multiple obstacles, including weak institutional capacity, low community participation, and lack of resources and incentives. Addressing these challenges requires political commitments for good governance, capacity development, and additional resources. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization","climate change; developing countries; disaster & risk management; governance","climate change; developing world; integrated approach; local planning; participatory approach; vulnerability; Cambodia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078662770

The issue of COIs has recently become a contentious issue within the international negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Despite an emerging debate on COIs, key issues regarding engagement with certain non-state actors, and the reforms that could be implemented in response, remain to be systematically addressed. This article therefore examines best practice for addressing COIs in international fora to see how this might inform management of the issue within the UNFCCC. We find that protecting the integrity and legitimacy of the UNFCCC will likely require its Conference of the Parties to clearly define COIs and to adopt a process for their management. This reform will bring the UNFCCC into line with best practices in global governance and improve prospects for more effective international law on climate change. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Previous studies suggest a positive school climate may reduce students' risk for academic failure and contribute to academic success. The purpose of this study was to determine the longitudinal associations between school climate and academic grades in a group of middle school students who transition into high school. METHODS: Parallel latent growth curve modeling was used to examine changes among study variables longitudinally using a sample of 2604 in 6th, 7th, and 8th-grade students across 16 regional schools located in 3 counties in West Virginia. RESULTS: Students with higher perceptions of a positive school climate exhibited sustained or improved academic achievement over time (β = 0.22 to 0.30, p <.01). Higher positive perceptions of school climate appear to sustain students who earn As/Bs (β = 0.20 to 0.27, p <.01) and strengthen students who earn Cs/Ds/Fs (β = −0.16 to −0.46, p <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Positive student perceptions of school climate may sustain high academic performance while strengthening students who earn Cs/Ds/Fs.

Models are needed that incorporate dynamic processes within coupled economic and physical systems for decision-makers, including when to retreat from hazardous areas. This paper presents a coupled geo-economic model of beach width and property value with exogenous sea level rise. Discrete dynamic programming identifies optimal beach nourishment and managed retreat strategies. As a new contribution, we treat expected damages as costs, which demonstrates that increased damage offsets some benefits of development along hazardous coastlines. The model identifies managed retreat as preferable to beach nourishment when damages exceed a threshold. Regret associated with retreat depends on sea level rise damages and the timeframe of analysis. Considering dynamic complexity of coastal systems, as this model does, may produce climate adaptation plans that better address community needs and reduce risk over timescales of interest. © 2019","Beach nourishment; Climate change adaptation; Coastal management; Dynamic programming; Managed retreat; Sea level rise","Beaches; Climate change; Climate models; Decision making; Hazards; Sea level; Shore protection; Beach nourishment; Climate change adaptation; Coastal management; Managed retreat; Sea level rise; Dynamic programming; beach nourishment; climate change; complexity; decision making; flooding; sea level change; soil erosion; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076943758

To achieve this, where the H2/CO ratio in syngas changes in a wide range to further meet various downstream industrial processes, a highly efficient catalyst is concerned and required. Here, we introduce a series of CuZIF and their derived carbon catalysts to adjust the H2/CO ratio in syngas to meet the requirements of downstream processes in industry. The carbonization temperature for CuZIF is correlated with the CO2 adsorption ability, the local concentration of CO2, and mass transport. The current density reaches up to 7.91 mA cm-2 at -1.2 VRHE, corresponding to the enhanced production rate of the syngas. Furthermore, with copper doping, the carbon yield of samples has also been improved significantly, up to ∼30%.

Effective leadership entails preparing for and responding to increasing intensities and frequencies of extreme natural hazard events while managing and justifying suffering and loss that communities and individuals experience in case of failed protection. Insight is provided into this double challenge and how it is compounded by the concomitant ways modern societies engage with risk and construct vulnerability and resilience. A conceptual framework is used to show how the rise of modernity, today's risk society, neoliberalism, and governmentality as found in many western democracies, converge to constrain disaster leadership and management, illustrating how interpretations of responsibility and potential loss and suffering have shifted from organizations to individual actors, exacerbating the leadership dilemma in managing hazard-driven crises. This includes ways that neoliberal governmentality warp understandings of vulnerability and resilience by understating one and overstating the other. Through a heuristic, we explain mounting leadership challenges with increasing levels of disaster intensity and consequence, drawing upon natural hazard examples from Australia. Although recent literature on ethical and responsible leadership in disasters points toward tangible ways to overcome aspects of the leadership dilemma, preparing for and responding to increasing disaster intensity require additional leadership qualities.

In this respect, carbon capture technologies will play an important role in the decarbonization of fossil-based industrial processes. The most significant techno-economic and environmental performance indicators of various fossil-based industrial applications decarbonized by two reactive gas-liquid (chemical scrubbing) and gas-solid CO2 capture systems are calculated, compared, and discussed in the present work. As decarbonization technologies, the gas-liquid chemical absorption and more innovative calcium looping systems were employed. The integrated assessment uses various elements, e.g., conceptual design of decarbonized plants, computer-aided tools for process design and integration, evaluation of main plant performance indexes based on industrial and simulation results, etc. The overall decarbonization rate for various assessed applications (e.g., power generation, steel, and cement production, chemicals) was set to 90% in line with the current state of the art in the field. Similar non-carbon capture plants are also assessed to quantify the various penalties imposed by decarbonization (e.g., increasing energy consumption, reducing efficiency, economic impact, etc.). The integrated evaluations exhibit that the integration of decarbonization technologies (especially chemical looping systems) into key energy-intensive industrial processes have significant advantages for cutting the carbon footprint (60-90% specific CO2 emission reduction), improving the energy conversion yields and reducing CO2 capture penalties. © 2020 by the authors.","And process integration; Decarbonization technologies; Fossil-intensive industrial processes; Modeling; Reactive absorption/adsorption CO2 capture systems; Simulation; Techno-economic and environmental assessments","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cements; Conceptual design; Decarbonization; Emission control; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Industrial plants; Low carbon steel; Models; Petrochemicals; Renewable energy resources; Steelmaking; CO2 capture; Industrial processs; Process integration; Simulation; Techno-economics; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081749652

The newest campus is 20 miles southeast of central Berlin on the main railway line to Wroclaw, Poland. Three main features of the 'gigafactory' phenomenon, apart from their scale, are in the industry organisation of production, which thus far reverses much current conventional wisdom regarding production geography. Thus, Tesla's automotive facility in Fremont California reconcentrates manufacturing on site as in-house own brand componentry, especially heavy parts, or by requiring hitherto distant global suppliers to locate in proximity to the main manufacturing plant. Second, as an electric vehicle (EV) producer, the contributions of Tesla's production infrastructure and logistics infrastructure are important in meeting greenhouse gas mitigation and the reduction of global warming. Finally, the deployment of Big Data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and 'predictive management' are important. This lies in gigafactory logistics contributing to production and distribution efficiency and effectiveness as a primer for all future industry and services in seeking to minimise time-management issues. This too potentially contributes significantly to the reduction of wasteful energy usage. © 2020 by the author.","Gigafactory; Lithium-ion batteries; Predictive management; Supplier network; Vertical integration","artificial intelligence; best management practice; electric vehicle; electronic equipment; equipment; greenhouse gas; management practice; manufacturing; network analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082711669

Benzonitrile is suggested to be a low-temperature proxy for benzene, one of the simplest aromatic molecules, which may be a precursor to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to assess the robustness of benzonitrile as a proxy for benzene, low-temperature kinetics measurements are required to confirm whether the reaction remains rapid at the low gas temperatures found in cold dense clouds. Here, we study the C6H6 + CN reaction in the temperature range 15-295 K, using the well-established CRESU technique (a French acronym standing for Reaction Kinetics in Uniform Supersonic Flow) combined with pulsed-laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence. We obtain rate coefficients, k(T), in the range (3.6-5.4) × 10-10 cm3 s-1 with no obvious temperature dependence between 15 and 295 K, confirming that the CN + C6H6 reaction remains rapid at temperatures relevant to the cold ISM. © 2020.

In this work, a long-term analysis of 56 SD events recorded between 2013 and 2018 at the Environmental-Climate Observatory of Lecce (SE Italy) was performed to investigate the effects and the seasonality of dust advection on PM2.5 and PM10, on carbon content, and on number and mass size distributions. The average duration of events was 2.6 days (10% of days) with a pronounced seasonality, 12.5% during warm seasons and 7.5% during cold seasons. The average contribution to PM10 was 1.5 μg/m3, between 1.4 μg/m3 (cold seasons) and 1.8 μg/m3 (warm seasons). Contribution to PM2.5 was significantly lower and not negligible during warm seasons (0.5 μg/m3). The impact of SD in south-eastern Italy is comparable with that in central Italy rather than to that observed in south-western Italy. Looking at PM10, 70 days exceeding legislation threshold were observed (4.8% of days), 22.9% of these exceedances were during SD. Extreme SD events (contributions &gt; 100 μg/m3) cover 2% of the cases. Comparison of carbon content between SD and non-SD days shows that SD does not influence EC and eBC concentrations; however, SD contributes to secondary organic aerosol in the coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Size distributions (in number and mass) measured during SD and non-SD days show that SD increases the particle number concentrations for diameters (Dp) larger than about 0.9–1 μm. Maximum increase was for Dp 2.5–3 μm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","African dust advection; carbonaceous aerosol; dust size distribution; eBC; EC; OC","Advection; Aerosols; Air quality; Carbon; Dust; Size distribution; African dust; Carbonaceous aerosol; Dust size distribution; Long term analysis; Mass size distribution; Mediterranean region; Particle number concentration; Secondary organic aerosols; Particle size analysis; advection; carbon; concentration (composition); dust; particulate matter; seasonality; size distribution; Italy; Lecce; Puglia; Sahara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074404545

Such interventions, however, have resulted in insufficient reductions in HAP levels and respiratory health risks in children. In this study we determined how multiple HAP combustion sources and exposure-mitigation factors in the home environment influence child respiratory health alone and in combination. Methods: We carried out a case-control study to determine associations between multiple indicators of HAP and persistent cough among children (<15 years of age) seeking care at three primary-care clinics in Kampala, Uganda. HAP indicators included self-report of combustion sources inside the home (e.g., stove type, fuel type, and smoking); housing characteristics and cooking practices that mitigate HAP exposure (e.g., use of windows, location of cooking, location of children during cooking) and perceptions of neighborhood air quality. To explore joint associations between indicators of HAP, we applied a Bayesian clustering technique (Bayesian profile regression) to identify HAP indicator profiles most strongly associated with persistent cough in children. Results: Most HAP indicators demonstrated significant positive bivariate associations with persistent cough among children, including fuel-type (kerosene), the number of hours burning solid fuels, use of polluting fuels (kerosene or candles) for lighting the home, tobacco smoking indoors, cooking indoors, cooking with children indoors, lack of windows in the cooking area, and not opening windows while cooking. Bayesian cluster analysis revealed 11 clusters of HAP indicator profiles. Compared to a reference cluster that was representative of the underlying study population cough prevalence, three clusters with profiles characterized by highly adverse HAP indicators resulted in ORs of 1.72 (95% credible interval: 1.15, 2.60), 4.74 (2.88, 8.0), and 8.6 (3.9, 23.9). Conversely, at least two clusters of HAP indicator-profiles were protective compared to the reference cluster, despite the fact that these protective HAP indicator profiles used solid fuels for cooking in combination with an unimproved stove (cooking was performed predominantly outdoors in these protective clusters). Conclusions: In addition to cooking fuel and type of cook stove, multiple HAP indicators were strongly associated with persistent cough in children. Bayesian profile regression revealed that the combination of HAP sources and HAP exposure-mitigating factors was driving risk of adverse cough associations in children, rather than any single HAP source at the home. © 2020 The Authors","Africa; Clustering; Household air pollution; Lung; Respiratory; Urban","Air cleaners; Air quality; Cluster analysis; Combustion; Developing countries; Health risks; Kerosene; Africa; Clustering; Lung; Respiratory; Urban; Stoves; fuel; atmospheric pollution; child health; cluster analysis; combustion; developing world; health risk; indoor air; respiratory disease; urban area; adolescent; air pollution indicator; air quality; Article; case control study; child; combustion; controlled study; cooking; coughing; environmental exposure; environmental factor; female; health care need; health education; health hazard; high risk behavior; high risk population; home environment; household; housing; human; indoor air pollution; infant; male; newborn; parental attitude; population research; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; risk factor; self report; smoking; Uganda; urban area; adverse event; air pollution; Bayes theorem; coughing; rural population; Uganda; Nicotiana tabacum; Adolescent; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Bayes Theorem; Case-Control Studies; Child; Cooking; Cough; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Rural Population; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078962532

Given the complexity of different ecosystems, origins of CH4 present can be difficult to determine. This issue was realized in a situation where an antimethanogenic in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) remedial amendment containing organic carbon plus zero-valent iron was applied to treat chlorinated solvents in groundwater at a former dry cleaner facility. The technology rapidly and effectively reduced the concentration of tetrachloroethene in groundwater thus meeting project goals without the stoichiometric accumulation of catabolites such as trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethene, or vinyl chloride and without excessive methanogenesis (e.g., &lt;2 mg/L) in the treated area. However, approximately 9 months after treatment, increased levels of CH4 (from 5 to 10 mg/L) were observed downgradient from the treated area. The applied remedial amendment contained approximately 60% (weight basis) fermentation organic carbon and was therefore a potential source of this CH4. However, there was &lt;500 mg/L total organic carbon in groundwater emanating from the upgradient treatment area which was unlikely sufficient to produce that much CH4. Moreover, the soil gas also contained benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes and other gasoline constituents. These data suggested that the presence of three gasoline/diesel underground storage tanks that were previously closed in place with no active remediation performed could be the source of elevated CH4. Thirdly, there were sewer lines, utilities, multiple gasoline stations, and industrial activities in the immediate area. With an initial assumption that CH4 source(s) could include the ISCR amendment over stimulation of production, gasoline sourced CH4 from nearby leaking lines, or sewage from local fractured pipes, carbon isotope analyses—radiocarbon (Δ14C) and stable carbon (δ13C)—were coupled with CH4 and CO2 concentration data from groundwater samples to determine the origin of respired carbon. The δ13C range for carbon sources respired in the process would be approximately −26.5‰ to −33.0‰ for the ISCR amendment and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) residuals, respectively. Δ14C is approximately 0‰ and −999‰ for the ISCR amendment (young carbon) and TPH (old carbon), respectively. The isotopic signature of respired gasses confirmed that elevated CH4 downgradient of the treated area originated primarily from sewer gasses (or fermentation of liquids released from sewer lines). This study provides an overview of the capability to apply carbon isotope geochemistry to confirmation of remedial protocols and sources of anthropogenic carbon pools that conclusively identify the origin of CH4 in a complex ecosystem undergoing a remedial action. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080109850

However, they are subject to significant climate variability and will be under increasing pressure as the climate changes, potentially leading to loss of productivity. Pasture growth fluctuates greatly due to rainfall variability, which unfortunately is the climate variable with the largest uncertainties in future projections for northern and eastern Australia. This sensitivity study examines the effect of climate change and its interaction with soil fertility and trees on pasture and livestock production in Queensland. Nine climate change sensitivities were tested in various combinations; an increase in air temperatures by a median projected value of +3 °C, rainfall changes of -20 %, -10 % and +10 % and an increase of carbon dioxide concentrations to 700 ppm. The GRASP model was used to assess the responses of pasture growth, pasture quality and cattle liveweight change per head. The most arid areas in western and south-western Queensland were the most sensitive to changes in rainfall. In contrast, the tropical north was the most resilient region. Southern and south-eastern Queensland benefitted from higher air temperatures producing greater pasture growth, quality and liveweight gain per head by extending the growing season and reducing frost during the winter months. The presence of trees competing for water and nitrogen increased the sensitivity of pasture to climate change, especially at higher carbon dioxide levels and lower rainfall. Increased carbon dioxide enhanced pasture growth and mitigated rainfall reductions by improving the water use efficiency of the plants. Thus, a warmer climate may create new opportunities in the south and south-east, but a warmer and drier climate in the western regions of Queensland is likely to reduce pasture and livestock production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate variability; CO2; Forage production; Liveweight gain; Rangelands; Vulnerability","carbon dioxide; cattle; climate change; concentration (composition); food production; growing season; pastoralism; pasture; rainfall; rangeland; soil fertility; water use efficiency; Australia; Queensland; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077919679

The study area is covered by the Quaternary sedimentary deposits and the Cretaceous granites associated with unconformity. The thick sedimentary deposits consists of two aquifers, i.e., unconfined and confined aquifers on the basis of clay deposit. Groundwater samples were collected from seven boreholes: two from unconfined aquifer and five from confined aquifer systems during the wet season of 2017 year. ORP and DO indicates that the groundwater of the unconfined aquifer exists in the oxidization condition and that of the confined aquifer pertains in the reduction condition. Piper’s trilinear diagram shows CaSO4 type for groundwater of the unconfined aquifer, and NaCl type for that of the confined aquifer. Ionic concentrations of groundwater increase in the confined aquifer because of direct and reverse ion exchange processes. Carbonate weathering and evaporation are other mechanisms in the water-rock interaction. Saturation indices of dolomite and calcite are observed as oversaturated, while halite reveals undersaturation. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) exhibits that cluster 1 and cluster 2 represents the properties of groundwater in unconfined and confined aquifers, respectively. Factor analysis shows that groundwater of the confined aquifer is much influenced by seawater, and includes heavy metals of iron and aluminum. Groundwater samples in unconfined and confined aquifers are located at the rock weathering and evaporation zones in the Gibbs diagram. Inverse geochemical modeling of PHREEQC code suggests that carbonate dissolution and ion exchange of major ions are the prevailing geochemical processes. This comprehensive research provides the distinguished hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater in confined and unconfined aquifer systems of the Nakdong River Basin in Busan City, Korea. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Confined aquifer; Geostatistical analysis; Hydrogeochemical analysis; Inverse geochemical modeling; Nakdong River basin; Unconfined aquifer","confined aquifer; Cretaceous; dissolution; dolomite; halite; hydrogeochemistry; ion exchange; ionic composition; unconfined aquifer; weathering rate; wet season; Nakdong Basin; Pusan [Pusan (ADS)]; Pusan [South Korea]; South Korea; calcium carbonate; ground water; environmental monitoring; river; South Korea; water pollutant; Calcium Carbonate; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Republic of Korea; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077971432

The methane potential ranged from 418.3 to 13.9 mL CH4/g VSadded during the experiment. An average 54.8% reduction was observed in biogas production during the winter season compared with summer. Results showed that food wastes could be utilized in a low-Temperature range (0°C-15°C) as well as a high-Temperature range (15°C-27°C). The total microbial community analysis revealed mixed consortia representing acetotrophic, hydrogenotrophic, and methylotrophic archaea (e.g., Methanobacterium, Methanosarcina, and Methanospirillum), indicating a syntrophic pathway for methane production. The bacterial community was well represented by two major phyla: Proteobacteria (31.3%) and Bacteroidetes (14.92%). The highest maximum specific biogas production (Rm) and maximum biogas production potential (A) were 134.5 mL CH4/g VS/day and 34.1 L CH4/g VS for modified Gompertz and first-order equations, respectively.

Because of daily-used chemicals (e.g., pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)) used by residents in the area, generated sewage is considered as a point source in the Kongsfjorden. The aim of the present study was to identify and quantify organic pollutants in the effluent and along the shoreline and offshore via target, suspect, and non-target screening using liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. We tentatively identified 30 compounds using the suspect and non-target screening methods in effluent samples from our first visit to the settlement in 2016. Among these, 3 were false positive, 24 were confirmed, and the 3 remaining compounds were not confirmed because of a lack of reference standards. Of the confirmed, 21 were quantifiable and considered target compounds for the 2nd year study. The quantified compounds in the effluent samples in 2017 totaled 17, including PPCPs, pesticides, perfluorinated compounds, and their metabolites. Some of the compounds, such as caffeine, paraxanthine/theophylline, acetaminophen, cetirizine, diethyl toluamide (DEET), and icaridin, were also detected in the receiving seawater. The concentration range was from 4 to 280,000 ng/L in the effluent and 2–98 ng/L in the seawater. Other 24 compounds were tentatively identified in the second-year effluent samples. Five were further confirmed using reference standards. Prioritization was performed on the 47 substances screened in Ny-Ålesund using the exposure and toxicity index. As the result, the top seven substances of concern present were perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), irbesartan, DEET, acetaminophen, caffeine, and paraxanthine/theophylline. As the effluent was identified as a source of the concerned organic pollutants, an emission reduction strategy should take place for protection of Arctic Fjorden environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic; Effluent; LC-HRMS; Nontarget screening; Ny-Ålesund","Caffeine; Drug products; Effluents; Emission control; Flame retardants; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Offshore oil well production; Screening; Seawater; Sewage; Arctic; Emission reduction strategy; High resolution mass spectrometry; LC-HRMS; Non-target screenings; Organophosphate flame retardants; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Organic pollutants; caffeine; cetirizine; diethyltoluamide; icaridin; irbesartan; paracetamol; paraxanthine; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; sea water; theophylline; drug; sea water; effluent; organic pollutant; PPCP; seawater; sewage; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; persistent organic pollutant; quantitative analysis; sewage effluent; standard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; water analysis; water pollution control; water sampling; chemistry; city; environmental monitoring; pollutant; sewage; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; water pollutant; Arctic; Kongsfjorden; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Hexapoda; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Seawater; Sewage; Svalbard; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076683005

A conventional consumer model automobile has a battery capacity of 50Ah to 60Ah that generally lasts for several years.

In scenario of failure of the battery to provide sufficient charge, the above-mentioned device would be used. The project is focused elimination of automotive battery problems, which directly or indirectly revolves around the inability of the battery to produce enough charge to start the vehicle. The occurrence of such situations is generally high in regions with extreme temperature, since a battery failure can be caused by both high and low temperatures. The effectiveness as well as demand for such device will be significantly more in cold weathers (especially in areas with perpetual cold climate). The project also rules out the necessity of jump starting the vehicle with the help of another vehicle's battery. Since the uncertainty of availability of another vehicle for jump starting is one of the major causes of being stranded, the device will prove to be of much help in such cases. © 2020 IEEE.","Battery Indicator; Foot-pump; Fuel Cars","Automotive batteries; Ignition; Model automobiles; Starters; Battery capacity; Battery failures; Cold weather; Extreme temperatures; Low temperatures; Pumping systems; Starter motors; Starting current; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084667230

They can accommodate renewable energy sources and reduce carbon emissions more economically than in systems where each energy sector is planned and operated separately. This paper describes the optimal planning of two real-world district MESs in China: Tongli new energy town and Tongzhou subsidiary administrative center. In addition to the conventional economy objective, two kinds of low-carbon targets, including the carbon emission target and renewable penetration target, are taken into account. The results show that investment decisions on coal-fired units, combined heat and power plants and renewable energy sources are significantly influenced by the choices of different targets. Reducing carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy integration generally work in tandem, but result in a higher planning cost. The average cost of reducing carbon emissions by 40% is 528 CNY/tCO2 in Tongli and 327 CNY/tCO2 in Tongzhou. Meanwhile, the average cost of achieving a 25% penetration of renewable energy is 468 CNY/MWh in Tongli and 363 CNY/MWh in Tongzhou. As expected, the cost of carbon reduction and renewable energy integration gradually rises as the targets tighten. Only a small fraction of the available renewable energy is curtailed (2.9% in Tongli and 8.3% in Tongzhou) even when the renewable penetration reaches 40% in both two systems. Finally, a sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of planning parameters, including the carbon price, the capital cost of energy components and the fuel prices, on the planning results. © 2019","Carbon emission reduction; Empirical study; Energy hub; High renewable penetration; Multiple energy systems","Carbon; Coal industry; Cogeneration plants; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Zoning; Carbon emission reductions; Empirical studies; Energy hubs; Energy systems; High renewable penetration; Investments; carbon emission; combined heat and power; emission control; energy efficiency; energy market; energy planning; investment; sensitivity analysis; China; Jiangsu; Tongli; Tongzhou [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077429878

This study aims to comprehensively utilize multi-source spatiotemporal data on transportation—including fine-scale trajectories of HDDTs, road traffic conditions, and attribute data for road networks and HDDTs—supplemented by relatively mature vehicle pollution emissions models to establish a high spatiotemporal resolution emissions inventory for HDDTs in Beijing using a bottom-up approach. Spatial statistical techniques, including spatial autocorrelation, high/low clustering, and outlier analysis, are also used to explore the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of pollution emissions in the city. The results showed the following: (1) spatially, nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emission hotspots spread from the Beijing sixth-ring roads to the fourth-ring roads from daytime to nighttime. The road segments with high emissions intensities have pronounced spatial agglomeration effects at night, but these are scattered during daytime. (2) Temporally, total HDDT NOx emissions are consistent with the traffic volume trends and are lower during major festivals. The highest NOx emissions occur at intercity highways, and this reflects the severe impact that intercity freight traffic has on air quality. The dominant HDDT NOx emissions are from vehicles belonging to the China 4 emissions standard. (3) NOx and PM emissions have a significant spatial autocorrelation and exhibit high-value clustering as a whole. (4) At different time intervals, the distribution of High-High/Low-Low clustering and outliers of NOx and PM in the road network is consistent with the spatial distribution of the pollutant emission intensity. The High-Low outlier is mainly distributed within the fourth-ring roads, and the number gradually reduces between night and day. The Low-High outlier is affected by the heterogeneous distribution of HDDTs and exhibits discontinuous distribution characteristics. Our results effectively evaluate Beijing's emissions control measures for HDDTs and provide a scientific decision-making basis for developing targeted emission reduction strategies for HDDTs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy-duty diesel trucks; Spatiotemporal patterns; Traffic emissions; Vehicle emissions inventory","Air quality; Autocorrelation; Automobiles; Behavioral research; Decision making; Diesel engines; Emission control; Motor transportation; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Roads and streets; Spatial distribution; Spatial variables measurement; Statistics; Trucks; Distribution characteristics; Heavy-duty diesel; Heterogeneous distributions; Particulate matter emissions; Spatiotemporal distributions; Spatiotemporal patterns; Traffic emissions; Vehicle emission; Particulate emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076220586

However, due to the presence of crystal regions, semi-solid-state batch foaming of polypropylene (PP) is a challenge. In situ melting and rheological behaviors of PP were measured using high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry and high-pressure rheometer, respectively. Through the CO2 pressure swing saturation strategy, the PP matrix can dissolve more CO2 in a shorter time, thereby effectively widening the foaming temperature range, increasing the expansion ratio, and shortening the saturation time. The Gotsis' model was used to correlate the high-pressure rheological data to obtain the characteristic relaxation time and rigid modulus of PP, and then, the bubble growth stability during the foaming process was simulated.

Herein, a series of covalent bonding oxygen-doped carbon nitride/graphitic carbon nitride hybrids (O-CN/CN) have been synthesized via solvothermal treatment using cyanuric chloride, cyanuric acid (derived from hydrolysis of cyanuric chloride) and urea-derived graphitic carbon nitride as precursors. In O-CN/CN hybrids, guest O-CN was covalently bonded with incomplete polycondensation –NHx derived from the host CN surface as verified by XRD, FT-IR, XPS and solid-state 13C MAS NMR spectra. With assistance of Pt co-catalyst, the most efficient O-CN/CN-3 photocatalyst showed the highest H2 generation rate at 6.97 mmol g−1h−1 under visible light irradiation (λ &gt; 420 nm) by 12.4 times as that of pristine CN (0.56 mmol g−1h−1). Moreover, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was estimated as 21.4% at 425 nm irradiation for O-CN/CN-3. The improved photocatalytic performance was ascribed to the extended visible light absorption, the inhibited photo-induced charge carrier recombination and rapid charge carriers transfer that were confirmed by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence spectra, transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity displayed unnoticeable deactivation within five recycles, further verifying that O-CN/CN hybrids were stable for visible-light-driven H2 evolution.

China, as the largest carbon emitter, has committed to reaching the carbon peak by 2030 in Paris Agreement. This ambitious national goal requires the endeavors of individual sectors, particularly those carbon-intensive ones. Predicting the sectoral peaks under current endeavors and understanding driving forces for the carbon emission changes in the past years are substantial for guiding the allocation of the country's future efforts. In the past studies contextualized in China, the prediction of its carbon peaks seldom appeared at the sectoral level, which is considered as a research gap. Therefore, this study predicts the peaks at four carbon pillar sectors (i.e. industrial, building, transport and agricultural sectors) and identifies the driving forces for the carbon emission changes of them. This study hypothesized Carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) as the theoretical model for predicting the peaks and used Logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) as the method to identify the driving forces. The results show that the carbon emission in the country will peak in 2036, six years later than the agreed year. The lateness of the national peak can be attributed to the significant lateness of three pillar sectors' peaks, occurring in 2031 for the industrial sector, 2035 for the building sector, 2043 for the transport sector, peak for the agricultural sector occurs four years earlier in 2026 though. Furthermore, the results show that carbon emission is significantly driven by the booming economic output and inhibited by decreasing energy intensity, but the slight fluctuation of energy structure plays a minor role in the four sectors. Policy adjustments are proposed for effectively and efficiently urging the on-time occurrence of the national peak. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission peak; Carbon emission reduction; China; CKC; LMDI; Sectoral level","Agriculture; Emission control; Forecasting; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; China; LMDI; Sectoral level; Carbon; carbon; agricultural emission; building; carbon emission; emission control; industrial emission; Kuznets curve; Kyoto Protocol; traffic emission; agriculture; Article; building; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; China; concentration (parameter); industry; prediction; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); theoretical model; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076828300

To identity hot study regions, the spatiotemporal pollution variation of PM2.5 in 2016 was explored using multi-scale spatial autocorrelation analysis based on the ground monitoring data for Chinese 366 cities. In the identified study regions, the relationship of natural factors and PM2.5 was analyzed on annual and daily scales via the correlation analyses, and the multiple socioeconomic driving forces of PM2.5 were identified utilizing geographic weighted regression (GWR) and principal component analysis. Consequently, 111 cities were identified as the hot regions, where their annual means of PM2.5 (AM) were 60.40 ± 14.23 μg·m− 3 exceeding the Chinese level II standard and WHO Air Quality Guideline IT-1 (35 μg·m− 3). The elevation and annual accumulative rainfall were found to be negatively correlated with the AM (p &lt; 0.01). The increase of temperature and wind speed mainly helped daily PM2.5 reduce. Furthermore, the sensitive socioeconomic factors, mainly including the added value of the industry, the per capita gross domestic product and the per capital annual disposable income, were identified due to GWR. Then, based on the found spatial heterogeneity of sensitive factors, the selected 111 cities were identified into four types (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) and two sub-regions, Q1+Q2 (13+49 cities) and Q3+Q4 (27+22 cities). Finally, for multi-scale environmental sustainability and equity, the joint management strategies were formulated for each cities pattern based on their feature of sensitive pollution driving forces and city role positioning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Geographic weighted regression; Joint management strategies; Meteorological factors; PM2.5; Spatial autocorrelation analysis","Air quality; Autocorrelation; Principal component analysis; Scales (weighing instruments); Spatial variables measurement; Sustainable development; Wind; Management strategies; Meteorological factors; PM2.5; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Weighted regression; Factor analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076467664

This method can project SST directly to subsurface according to model ensemble-based correlations between SST and subsurface temperature. Results from a 50 year (1960–2009) assimilation experiment show the method can improve the subsurface temperature field up to 300 m compared to the quality-controlled subsurface ocean temperature objective analyses (EN4), through reducing the biases of the thermal states, improving the thermocline structure, and reducing the root mean square (RMS) errors. Moreover, as most of the improvements concentrate over the upper 100 m, the ocean heat content in the upper 100 m (OHT_100 m) is further adopted as a property to validate the performance of the ensemble-based correction method. The results show that RMS errors of the global OHT_100 m convergent to one value after several times iteration, indicating this method can represent the relationship between SST and subsurface temperature fields well, and then improve the accuracy of the simulation in the subsurface temperature of the climate model. © 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ECHAM5/MPI-OM; ensemble-based nudging method; simulation of subsurface temperature field; SST assimilation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083285883

This study investigates the fine-scale thermal environment within high density cities using multi-sourced open satellite data. The whole urban area was first classified based on the urban features such as building morphology and land cover, using the local climate zone scheme; then the thermal performance of different local climate zones was assessed using thermal satellite data. Experiments conducted in two high-density Chinese cities indicated that different urban structures have contrasting thermal conditions in the daytime and nighttime. Furthermore, the utility of different satellite data for detecting and monitoring intra-urban thermal environments was assessed. It was found that Landsat and ASTER satellite data have similar performance, and both datasets perform better than MODIS data, which tend to underestimate urban heat islands. The findings of this study can provide a fast and efficient way to understand the thermal environment within high-density cities, which will allow for better planning to improve urban thermal conditions and ensure more sustainable development. © 2019 The Authors",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075552213

In terms of metal nuclearity number, 1 is the second largest 3d-4f cluster to date. In the solid state, 1 is porous after removing the lattice guests. The N2 adsoption experiment reveals that the BET and Langmuir surface areas are 299.8 and 412.0 cm2 g-1, respectively. CO2 adsorption at 298 K gives the amount of 45 cm3 g-1 for 1. More importantly, 1 is soluble in common organic solvents and exhibits high solution stability revealed by high resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and low-dose transmission electron microscopy. The solubility and the potential open metal sites owing to the labile coordinating components prompted us to investigate the photocatalytic properties of 1, which displays high selectivity and efficiency for reduction of CO2 to CO with turnover number and turnover frequency of 29700 and 1.2 s-1, respectively. These values are higher than most catalysts working under the same conditions, presumably due to the strong Ni-CO2 binding effect.

It was found that when the sludge age during wastewater treatment extended from 5 d to 40 d, the VS reduction of sludge showed an “exponential” decrease, and the degradability of protein, polysaccharides and lipids in sludge all declined. Among them, the degradation of protein was the most affected (down-regulated by 35.8%), and the decrease in degradation of protein accounted for 80.4% of the decrease of VS conversion. Sludge age during wastewater treatment impact the distribution, occurrence state and structure of organic compounds in activated sludge. And it was clarified that instead of the changed amount and components of EPS, the increased molecular weight of EPS and more stable secondary structure of protein driven by α-helix and β-turn in EPS were mainly responsible for the declined degradability of protein and sludge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic digestion; Occurrence state; Organic compounds; Secondary structure; Sludge age","Activated sludge process; Anaerobic digestion; Organic compounds; Proteins; Reclamation; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Digestion performance; Influencing mechanisms; Methane production; Occurrence state; Secondary structure of proteins; Secondary structures; Sludge age; Wastewater treatment plants; Sludge digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074528563

Identifying the relationship between particulate matter (PM) and CVD in China is a significant challenge. In this study, daily CVD emergency room visit, environmental monitoring, and weather data from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, in Lanzhou were collected. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed to estimate the short-term effects of daily PM2.5, PMC, and PM10 concentrations on CVD emergency room visits with different lag structures after controlling for the influence of meteorological elements and gaseous pollutants. Stratified analyses were conducted according to age (≥ 65 years and &lt; 65 years), sex (male and female), cold season (from November to April), and warm season (from May to October). The results showed that each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 1.93% (95% CI 0.12–3.78%) increase in CVD emergency room visits at lag03, and no single lag model was statistically significant. The excess relative risks (ERRs) of PM10 and PMC were not statistically significant at any lag pattern. The exposure-response curves demonstrated a nonlinear upward trend for these three PM pollutants. When adjusting for other gaseous pollutants, such as NO2, SO2, CO, and O3, in the two-pollutant models, the associations between PM10 and PMC and CVD emergency room visits did not change compared with the single-pollutant models. The ERRs of PM2.5 were 1.67% (95% CI 0.03–3.34%) at lag02 after adjustment for NO2 and 1.65% (95% CI 0.02–3.30%) at lag02 after adjustment for SO2. The ERRs of PM2.5 were still statistically significant at lag03 when we adjusted for any one of the gaseous pollutants. Susceptibility to PM2.5 was increased in people aged &lt; 65 years, in males, and in the warm season. The findings are very important for local governments to develop environmental policies and strategies to reduce ambient PM2.5 levels. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cardiovascular disease; Emergency room visits; Particulate matter; Time series analysis","additive; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; environmental policy; particulate matter; time series analysis; China; Gansu; Lanzhou; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; cardiovascular disease; China; environmental exposure; female; hospital emergency service; human; male; particulate matter; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; China; Emergency Service, Hospital; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077589952

Munich Oktoberfest, the world's largest folk festival, is a potential source of CH4 as a large amount of natural gas for cooking and heating is used. In 2018 we measured the CH4 emissions of Oktoberfest using in situ measurements combined with a Gaussian plume dispersion model. Measurements were taken while walking and biking around the perimeter of the Oktoberfest premises (Theresienwiese) at different times of the day, during the week and at the weekend. The measurements showed enhancements of up to 100 ppb compared to background values and measurements after Oktoberfest. The average emission flux of Oktoberfest is determined as (6:7 ± 0:6) μ g.m2 s/-1. Additional analyses, including the daily emission cycle and comparisons between emissions and the number of visitors, suggest that CH4 emissions of Oktoberfest are not due solely to the human biogenic emissions. Instead, fossil fuel CH4 emissions, such as incomplete combustion or loss in the gas appliances, appear to be the major contributors to Oktoberfest emissions. Our results can help to develop CH4 reduction policies and measures to reduce emissions at festivals and other major events in cities. Furthermore, events with a limited duration have not yet been included in the state-of-the-art emission inventories, such as TNO-MACC, EDGAR or IER. Our investigations show that these emissions are not negligible. Therefore, these events should be included in future emission inventories. © 2020 Author(s).",,"emission inventory; festival; measurement method; methane; natural gas; Bavaria; Germany; Munich",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082971082

Without widespread and accurate BC measurements, it remains difficult to track incomplete combustion sources and reduce BC emissions. Currently commercial BC sensors remain too costly to be deployed widely. In this work, a fast, cost-effective, and easily accessible method based on a smartphone camera was used to quantify color information of PM collected on filters to estimate BC and elemental carbon (EC) loadings. A robust RGB (red, green, blue)-based linear interaction model was built and validated using 1878 PM samples collected in three different regions with collocated BC and EC measurements. After applying image correction methods, this model shows a good predictability with an R-squared (R2) of 0.904 with state-of-the-art BC measurement techniques, and a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV(RMSE)) of 25.3% despite the complex sources and different reference measurement techniques.

However, the simultaneous manipulation of photocharges in the two locations is challenging. Herein, the synchronous promotion of bulk and surface separation of photoinduced charges for prominent CO2 photoreduction by coupling macroscopic spontaneous polarization and surface oxygen vacancies (OVs) of BiOIO3 single crystals is reported. The oriented growth of BiOIO3 single-crystal nanostrips along the [001] direction, ensuing substantial well-aligned IO3 polar units, renders a large enhancement for the macroscopic polarization electric field, which is capable of driving the rapid separation and migration of charges from bulk to surface. Meanwhile the introduction of surface OVs establishes a local electric field for charge migration to catalytic sites on the surface of BiOIO3 nanostrips. Highly polarized BiOIO3 nanostrips with ample OVs demonstrate outstanding CO2 reduction activity for CO production with a rate of 17.33 µmol g−1 h−1 (approximately ten times enhancement) without any sacrificial agents or cocatalysts, being one of the best CO2 reduction photocatalysts in the gas–solid system reported so far.

We derive a Törnqvist-type productivity index in which CO2 emissions are undesirable outputs. The shadow price of CO2, required for calculating the index, is estimated based on the duality between a revenue and a directional output distance function. Productivity changes are measured using both estimated shadow prices and the actual trading prices of CO2 in six pilot emissions trading systems. We find that productivity measurement is highly dependent on the choice of CO2 prices. We also investigate the impact of emission intensity and emissions per se on productivity measurement.

These harmful effects occur whenever and wherever people come into direct contact with air pollution. Therefore, individual actions that reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of personal contact with air pollution can reduce health risks. We developed a system that empowers the public with personalized information on air quality and exposure health risk. This system, the Personalised Real-Time Air Quality Informatics System for Exposure – Hong Kong (PRAISE-HK, http://praise.ust.hk/), is embodied in an interactive mobile application. PRAISE-HK is based on real-time data on emissions, high resolution urban morphology, meteorology, physical and chemical processes affecting pollutant transport and transformations, extensive measurements of air pollution concentrations in typical locations such as homes, schools, offices, and transportation, and big data integration of sensor monitoring to accurately estimate current and short-term forecasted street-level air quality. The street-level air quality simulation has been validated against reference monitoring data. Ongoing and planned future enhancements to PRAISE-HK include prediction of personal exposure and health response. PRAISE-HK is an example of the use of collective intelligence in a smart city to engage citizens in learning about and managing their own exposure to air pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Citizen engagement; Individual health sensitivity; Personalized exposure","Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Data integration; Health; Medical informatics; Monitoring; Risk management; Urban transportation; Adverse health effects; Citizen engagements; Collective intelligences; Individual health sensitivity; Interactive mobile applications; Personalized exposure; Personalized information; Pollution concentration; Health risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078175966

Satellite observations of aerosols provide the coverage that fixed-site monitors lack, enabling more refined exposure assessments. Using aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument, we predicted fine particulate matter, PM2.5, and PM2.5 speciation concentrations and linked them to the residential locations of 1206 children enrolled in the Southern California Children's Health Study. We fitted mixed-effects models to examine the relationship between the MISR-derived exposure estimates and lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), adjusting for study community and biological factors. Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machines showed excellent predictive performance for PM2.5 (test R2 = 0.68) and its chemical components (test R2 = 0.53-0.71). In single-pollutant models, FEV1 decreased by 131 mL (95% CI:-232,-35) per 10.7-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, by 158 mL (95% CI:-273,-43) per 1.2-μg/m3 in sulfates, and by 177 mL (95% CI:-306,-56) per 1.6-μg/m3 increase in dust; FVC decreased by 175 mL (95% CI:-310,-29) per 1.2-μg/m3 increase in and by 212 mL (95% CI:-391,-28) per 2.5-μg/m3 increase in nitrates.

Observed precipitation and temperature data collected over the review period were compared with the trends in NDVI to understand the impact of climate change on plant species diversity over time. The nonaligned block sampling design was used as the sampling framework, from which 198 sampling plots were identified. Data sources included satellite images, field measurements, and direct observations. Temperature and precipitation had significant (p < 0.05) trends over the period under study. However, the trend for seasonal total precipitation was not significant but declining. Significant correlations (p < 0.001) were identified between various climate variables and the Shannon index of diversity. NDVI was also significantly correlated to the Shannon index of diversity.

In the study, the air quality and PM2.5 associated health co-benefits of China's national Emission Trading System to achieve the Nationally Determined Contribution is analyzed. The interdisciplinary integrated assessment model framework, named the Regional Emissions Air quality Climate Health Model, is applied. The results showed that substantial air quality improvement and health benefit will be achieved under the national Emission Trading System. But the cost and benefits varies according to the CO2 emission cap set. To peak CO2 emissions by 2025 will bring about more obvious improvement in air quality (ranging from 3% to 12% PM2.5 concentration reduction at provincial level compared with that to peak CO2 emission by 2030), more morbidities avoided from acute exposure and more mortalities avoided from acute exposure and chronic exposure. While the net health benefit to achieve peaking by 2025 is US$ 100 billion less than that to achieve peaking by 2030 due to greater GDP loss in 2030. The net benefit is subjected to the valuation of the health benefits.

We investigated the short-term association of ambient air pollution with daily counts of hospital admissions due to respiratory infection diseases with stratified analysis by age (0–18, 19–65, and &gt; 65 years old), gender (male, female), season (spring, summer, autumn, winter), and disease type (lung infections, asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive disease), URI (upper respiratory infections)) in heavy polluted city of Shenyang in China. Daily ambient air pollution concentrations, weather conditions, and hospital admission counts for 53 months (from November 1, 2013 to March 25, 2018) were extracted from related authorities in electronic databases. Associations between outdoor air pollution levels and hospital admissions were estimated for time lags of 0–7 days using quasi-Poisson additive regression models, adjusted for meteorological variables, holidays, day of week, and season, as well as eliminating autocorrelations. Single pollutant analysis results showed lung infection diseases were related to all pollutant concentration change with no lag effects. After adjusting for other pollutants and confounding factors, we found NO2 was associated with daily admissions of lung infections (ER = 6.75%, 95% CI 1.24, 12.55), asthma (ER = 20.36%, 95% CI 4.26, 38.95; lag day 5, ER = 18.48%, 95% CI 2.83, 36.51), and COPD (ER = 13.27%, 95% CI 0.46, 27.71); CO was associated with lung infections and asthma with lag effects on lag days 1 and 4; and PM2.5 was associated with COPD admissions on lag day 6. Respiratory hospital admissions in female over 65 years old and autumn were more associated with increased air pollutant levels.

However, the strategies available now for coupling suffer from multiple/complicated steps, which makes the carbon-conjugated microstructure and electronic structure of the carbon as well as the process difficult to be controlled. Herein, surface coupling engineering mediated by external gravity field enables the assembling of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with short-range periodicity on carbon sphere (CS) with long-range periodicity. The concentration gradient of CQDs on the surface of CS (CQDs/CS-x) can be finely controlled by the tuned gradient field strength, finally achieving the controllable regulation of defective density and electron transfer capability in carbon-conjugated CQDs. The resultant CQDs/CS-4 composite exhibits a high power conversion efficiency up to 8.42% with a low Epp value of 0.11 V, as probed by triiodide reduction. Taken together, density functional theory calculations and experimental results reveal that the edge/defective sites derived from CQDs modulate the charge density of local sites for enhanced capability of the adsorption for I2 molecule, and meanwhile the long-range π-π conjugated configuration of CS sites promotes the fast electron transfer in the carbon-conjugated CQDs. The design concept in this work presents a simple &amp; facile technology for integration of the micro/nano-structured carbon materials with different scales to achieve the delicate regulation. Also, this provides fundamental guidance towards the assembly of ultrafine structure especially small-sized/ultrathin materials at atomic scales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CQDs; Defective density; Edge carbon sites; Gravity field; Triiodide reduction","Carbon; Charge transfer; Economic and social effects; Electron transitions; Electronic structure; Nanocrystals; Semiconductor quantum dots; Concentration gradients; CQDs; Edge carbon sites; Electronic conductivity; Fast electron transfer; Gravity field; High power conversion; Triiodide; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076408426

Of particular interest are analysis and predictions of rainfall at pertinent spatial scales. An option is the use of regional climate models (RCMs) as a physics-based downscaling tool to retrieve higher spatial resolution information from coarser present and future climate datasets. In order to verify if simulations provide added values that result in an appropriate representation of the state of climate at finer spatial resolutions, the adoption of RCMs requires prior optimization. The performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model RCM in simulating precipitation over Indonesia is examined by a series of sensitivity experiments using different parameterized convective physics. Among four tested schemes, the best performance is provided by the Betts-Miller-Janjic (BMJ) parameterization. RCM multiannual seasonal rainfall bias outperforms or matches the reanalysis. Modeled results provide added value in simulating rainfall-related climate indices but show low skill in recreating the annual rainfall pattern at monthly resolution. RCM precipitation exhibits complex spatial response to different ENSO phases, with El Niño conditions resulting in a general loss of model skill during the southern hemisphere spring. A series of regional climate simulations using the BMJ convective scheme forced by a future climate projection dataset show changes in rainfall aligned with previous studies. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","climate; precipitation; regional and mesoscale modelling; tropics","Climate change; Electric power system interconnection; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Tropics; Weather forecasting; climate; Future climate projections; Mesoscale modelling; Quality information; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate models; Regional climate simulation; Weather research and forecasting models; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; mesoscale meteorology; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; regional climate; tropical environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074248991

In an effort to address this issue, the analysis of the luminescence measurements of ZnO Ncs in the presence of various organic substrates using a Langmuir adsorption model was carried out to determine for the first time the affinity constants and the number of binding sites as well as to rank the interaction strengths of these substrates with regard to ZnO Ncs. The results were confirmed by NMR spectroscopic studies, which, besides, provided a deep understanding of the substrate-ZnO Nc interactions. Analysis of the results using pKa and HSAB theory demonstrates that the interaction of a given substrate can be determined by its pKaversus the pKa of the organic molecules present at the surface of pristine Ncs and that the hard or soft character of the substrates can govern the emission intensity of the ZnO Ncs.

For instance, a MeV mass DM particle could scatter off a lattice electron, resulting in the transfer of sufficient energy to eject the electron from the CNT surface. The electron can eventually be detected whenever an external electric field is added to drive it from the open ends of the array. This detection scheme would offer an anisotropic response and could be used to select an orientation of the target with respect to the DM wind. A compact sensor, in which the cathode element is substituted with a dense array of parallel CNT, could serve as the basic detection unit which-if adequately replicated-would allow to explore a significant region of light DM mass and cross-section. A similar detection scheme could be used to detect DM particles with mass in the GeV range scattering off the surface of a CNT and ejecting a carbon ion.

The 2015 Paris Agreement arguably ended such division by introducing a bottom-up system of self-differentiated emission reduction commitments through countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions. This paradigmatic regime shift creates the opportunity to research to what extent it has been accompanied by a similar change in member states’ negotiation positions and policymaking. I explore whether key developing countries’ discourses regarding burden sharing of mitigation have changed pre- and post-Paris and how this relates to their own mitigation contributions. Has the Paris Agreement led to a new way of thinking regarding burden sharing? Do countries in favour of abolishing the Annex I–non-Annex I divide also propose more ambitious climate policies? I rely on text analysis of written position papers submitted to the negotiations, focusing on members of two coalitions at opposite extremes of developing countries’ positions: the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, a group of progressive countries arguing for more comprehensive climate agreements; and the Like-Minded Developing Countries, a coalition that aims to uphold the regime’s differentiation between developed and developing countries. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Burden sharing; Climate negotiations; Coalitions; Mitigation; Text analysis; UNFCCC","bottom-up approach; climate change; developing world; emission control; mitigation; top-down approach; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077529320

The first part diagnoses three limitations of current thought on the urban governance of climate change. First, current action emerges within a wave of urban optimism with limited historical sensitivity to previous climate change action. Second, the mobile nature of climate change policies is overlooked in studies that emphasize cities as the unit of analysis for climate action. Third, the focus on global cities or alternative locations that are constructed as exemplary sites takes attention away from the ordinary contexts of action where climate action is most needed. The second part of the paper uses this analysis as the main motivation for a call for studies of climate change governance to engage with the messiness of urban knowledge and action. Three theories of messiness are put forward. The first relates the idea of governance as messiness to postcolonial analyses of radical environmental action. The second emphasizes the messiness embedded in current methods of knowing the city, and the logic of situated knowledge. The third emphasizes messiness in the relations between the body, society and the emotions characterizing the interactions of everyday life. © 2019, © 2019 Regional Studies Association.","climate change governance; governmentality; messiness; urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068787742

The double-differential cross section is reported in terms of muon longitudinal (p) and transverse (p) momentum. Cross section contours versus lepton momentum components are approximately described by a conventional generator-based simulation, however, discrepancies are observed for transverse momenta above 0.5 GeV/c for longitudinal momentum ranges 3-5 and 9-20 GeV/c. The single differential cross section versus momentum transfer squared (dσ/dQQE2) is measured over a four-decade range of Q2 that extends to 10 GeV2. The cross section turnover and falloff in the Q2 range 0.3-10 GeV2 is not fully reproduced by generator predictions that rely on dipole form factors. Our measurement probes the axial-vector content of the hadronic current and complements the electromagnetic form factor data obtained using electron-nucleon elastic scattering. These results help oscillation experiments because they probe the importance of various correlations and final-state interaction effects within the nucleus, which have different effects on the visible energy in detectors. © 2020 authors.

Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction at a large scale is essential for the agricultural supply chain and global food security, especially in China as an important wheat producing and consuming country. The conventional approach using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical and crop models has prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, socio-economic (SC) factors may also improve crop yield prediction, but their contributions need in-depth investigation, especially in regions with good irrigation conditions, sufficient fertilization, and pesticide application. Here, we performed the first attempt to predict wheat yield across China from 2001 to 2015 at the county-level by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., Vegetation indices (VIs), and SC factors. The results show that incorporating all the datasets by using three machine learning methods (Ridge Regression (RR), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) can achieve the best performance in yield prediction (R2: 0.68~0.75), with the most individual contributions from climate (~0.53), followed by VIs (~0.45), and SC factors (~0.30). In addition, the combinations of VIs and climate data can capture inter-annual yield variability more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of climate and SC, and combinations of VIs and SC), while combining SC with climate data can better capture spatial yield variability than others. Climate data can provide extra and unique information across the entire growing season, while the peak stage of VIs (Mar.~Apr.) do so. Furthermore, incorporating spatial information and soil proprieties into the benchmark models can improve wheat yield prediction by 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. The optimal wheat prediction can be achieved with approximately a two-month leading time before maturity. Our study develops timely and robust methods for winter wheat yield prediction at a large scale in China, which can be applied to other crops and regions. © 2020 by the authors.

Oxidation Flow Reactors (OFR) intend to simulate gas/particle transformation and volatilization with time-scales of hours to days in order to estimate mass gains or losses due to atmospheric aging. The commercially-available Potential Aerosol Mass (PAM)-OFR (Aerodyne Research, LLC, Billerica, MA, USA) is evaluated for its feasibility in establishing an emission limit certification protocol for China and for determining changes to source marker abundances used in source apportionment model applications. The OFR without ultraviolet radiation is reasonably inert to the passage of reactive gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particles &gt;~100 nm. The largest uncertainty in estimating aging times is the commonly used assumption that the average atmospheric hydroxyl concentration (OHatm) is 1.5 × 106 molecules/cm3; measurements show that OHatm can vary by an order of magnitude in different environments. OH exposures (OHexp) estimated within the OFR are more precise than this assumption. Plug flow is a reasonable estimate of residence time within the OFR, as it does not differ much from the weighted-mean of the residence time distribution. A survey of previous studies shows that only a few examine the PAM-OFR performance, and that mass is both gained and lost with aging, depending on the combustion fuels, burning conditions, and aging times. At present, the OFR appears to be more practical for source profile aging than for emission certification, and further experiments are needed prior to application for multipollutant effects on particulate emission rates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol aging; Emission factors; Hydroxyl exposure; Multipollutant; Source characterization","Aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Particles (particulate matter); Residence time distribution; Sulfur dioxide; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol aging; Emission factors; Hydroxyl exposure; Multipollutant; Source characterization; Particulate emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; sulfur dioxide; aerosol composition; certification; flow pattern; hydroxyl radical; particulate matter; photochemistry; pollution exposure; residence time; source apportionment; transformation; ultraviolet radiation; volatilization; air pollution; combustion; concentration (parameter); evaluation study; gas; oxidation reduction potential; particle size; priority journal; retention time; secondary organic aerosol; suspended particulate matter; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075832679

Yet, little cross-fertilization between climate adaptation and strategy management literature has taken place. This study explores how strategy management theories focused on the role of business relations help to understand the influence of business networks on the adaptive behaviour of firms. As investigated through the business dynamics operating in Jamaica’s cassava value chain, companies are exposed to a series of trade-offs generated within their business environment. In particular, networks are shown to generate both opportunities and constraints that affect business adaptive behaviour and to be a mechanism to influence and be influenced by others. Two fundamental network-level actions that businesses can foster to increase their adaptive capacity and maintain local economic development can be drawn from this assessment. First, by effectively managing relationships, business can unlock access to valuable resources for adaptation. Second, the dynamic and interdependent nature of business relationships calls for business adaptation efforts to focus on the development of collaborative and joint problem-solving approaches. The relational strategy management view of climate adaptation introduced in this study opens interesting lines of inquiry on factors shaping the adaptation landscape of businesses. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business climate resilience; Caribbean; Jamaica; Private sector adaptation; value chain","adaptive management; climate change; economic development; firm size; private sector; strategic approach; trade-off; Caribbean Islands; Jamaica; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066107126

This study examines how differences in species and provenance performance are affected by plant community composition in a dry sclerophyll forest restoration experiment. Five indices were measured over 6 years post-establishment to evaluate the relative performance of community composition using 10 provenances of two focal eucalypts (Eucalyptus pauciflora and Eucalyptus tenuiramis) under six community treatments for E. pauciflora and five for E. tenuiramis. Community treatments varied according to the species planted as the immediate neighbor to the focal species, and included same species, same genus, or one of three different genera. Significant species and provenance differences were observed for all measured performance indices, with no evidence of interaction effects with community treatments. E. tenuiramis was more susceptible to insects and frost, and had poorer establishment but greater growth of the survivors than E. pauciflora. Generally, nonlocal provenances were more susceptible to insect herbivory and frost damage and had higher mortality than local provenances. At this early life-stage there was no evidence that co-planted species affected the relative performance of focal species or provenances, arguing transfer functions are likely stable across different planted communities. While species and provenance performance was not affected by community context, focal species differed in their response to upslope migration and any climate-adjusted provenancing may require staged transfers to avoid maladaptation under contemporary growing conditions. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration","assisted migration; climate-adjusted provenancing; Eucalyptus; GxE; species mixtures; transfer functions","community composition; ecological stability; evergreen tree; genotype-environment interaction; plant community; provenance; restoration ecology; transfer function; translocation; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus pauciflora; Eucalyptus tenuiramis; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077838400

The study illustrates the complementarity between modelling and observing the urban climate. Two different modelling approaches are used: 1 km resolution runs of the SURFEX land surface model and 100 m resolution runs of the computationally cheaper UrbClim boundary layer model. On the one hand, urban models are able to simulate the spatial variability of the urban climate. As such, these models serve as a tool to help deciding on the locations of the measurement stations. On the other hand, the MOCCA observations are used to validate the high-resolution urban model experiments for the summer (July-August-September) of 2016.

Methods: We compared microbial communities in soils and plant compartments of two contrasting quinoa cultivars, grown in low-input cropping systems along an elevation gradient in northwest Yunnan plateau, China. Results: With a compartment-dependent effect, alpha-diversity (Shannon and Chao1 indices) of both bacterial and fungal communities generally increased with increasing elevation. Both bacterial and fungal diversities decreased in the order of rhizosphere> root > leaf, but no significant difference was found between two plant genotypes or between bulk soil and rhizosphere. Representing a unique niche for microbial communities, leaf had a much stronger selection effect than root. With insignificant effect of plant genotype, local environmental filtering (i.e. climate, edaphic and plant traits) could have played an important role in structuring soil microbial communities, but they were weak for root and leaf endophytes, except for root fungi.

However, the differing effects of landscape patterns from various types of green spaces on PM2.5 are still not well understood. In addition, little information is available on individual and interactive effects of different green spaces and environmental factors on PM2.5. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between different green spaces, environmental factors, and PM2.5 in mid-winter (January) in southeastern China using redundancy analysis (RDA) and simple correlation analyses at landscape scales. PM2.5 distribution was dominated by meteorological factors (an average of 46.21 %), and green space showed immense potential for PM2.5 reduction, as indicated by strong interaction between green space–non green space on PM2.5 (33.66 % at the 5000 scale). The individual and interactive effects of forestland on PM2.5 were, on average, 1.6 times higher than those of grassland. But obvious interaction between grassland–non grassland on PM2.5 was also observed at large scales (19.16 % at the 5000 scale). This suggests that grassland has the ability to reduce atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations. Unfortunately, the effect of grassland on PM2.5 was overlooked among previous small–scale studies owing to neglecting the scale effect. In reality, the effects of different green spaces on PM2.5 are more accurately assessed at broader scales. Additionally, significant negative correlation existed between green space area and PM2.5, indicating that more green space can directly absorb and adsorb more PM2.5. The results demonstrate that planting more trees and grasses to improve urban air conditions is beneficial, effective, and recommended. Given the cost and benefit analysis, planting grasses is a more affordable option for PM2.5 reduction, particularly at the 1000–3000 m scales. Moreover, correlation analyses further indicated that as green space and forestland landscape fragmentation increased and aggregation was reduced, PM2.5 concentrations increased. Our results provide useful input for green space planning in this area. © 2020","Air pollution; Forestland; Grassland; Interactive effect; Landscape pattern; Scale effect","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); forest; grassland; greenspace; landscape change; particulate matter; scale effect; urban pollution; winter; China; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078440625

This study analyses the potential energy generation and cost-effectiveness of a proposed 1 MW PV power plant under several financial scenar-ios. Renewable energy project analysis software (RETScreen) is employed to evaluate the PV models. The economic indicators used are net present value ($203,609), internal rate of return (9.33%), and payback period (6.7 years). The simulation focuses on the power generation, profit, and expenses for the PV power station over a 30-year period. The analysis finds that the proposed PV system can produce 12,928, 12,051 and 11,233 MWh of electricity after 10, 20, and 30 years, respectively. In addition, the profit from the sale of this electricity is calculated to be 91.75% at the end of the first year and 79.39% at the end of 10 years. Furthermore, the reduction in C02 emissions resulting from the use of the PV power station is calculated to be 629.6 kg/year.

TPB was successfully decorated with three cluster units by an oxonium ring-opening reaction, while OVS was bonded to eight clusters by catalysed metathesis cross-coupling. The resulting compounds were spectroscopically characterised, and their solution-state photophysical properties analysed. For TPB, the presence of COSAN dramatically quenches the fluorescence emission (λem = 369 nm; ΦF = 0.8%), while B12-substituted TPB shows an appreciable emission efficiency (λem = 394 nm; ΦF = 12.8%). For octasilsesquioxanes, the presence of either COSAN or B12 seems to be responsible for ∼80 nm bathochromic shift with respect to the core emission, but both cases show low emission fluorescence (FF = 1.4-1.8%).

Here we report greenhouse gases (GHG) fluxes, measured by the eddy covariance method, from a commercial scale rain-fed sugarcane plantation representative of the leading bioethanol production area in southeast Brazil. The measurements covered two harvests, during which the field received nitrogen fertilization and trash was not removed. The cumulative fluxes for nitrous oxide (N2O) (62.4 ± 1.3 and 52.3 ± 1.8 g N2O[sbnd]CO2 eq. m−2 for the first and second years, respectively) and methane (CH4) (12.1 ± 1.7 and 10.4 ± 2.3 g CH4[sbnd]CO2 eq. m−2 for the first and second years, respectively) were minor sources to the atmosphere in comparison with the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2), whose sink dominated the balances (−7643. ± 129. and -4615. ± 124. g CO2 m−2 for the first and second years, respectively). Compared to the first year, the observed NEE in the second year decreased by 40%, as it covered the first re-growth from the stubble (ratoon) and exhibited a shorter growth cycle than the first year (304 versus 390 days). The second year also included the partial decomposition of the trash remaining on the soil after the first harvest (1581 ± 301 g CO2 m−2). The net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB), obtained as the cumulative fluxes of GHGs and the stalk dry biomass removed in the harvests (4923 ± 459 and 3929 ± 352 g CO2 m−2 for the first and second years, respectively) were -2646 ± 459 and -623 ± 352 g CO2 m−2 for the first and second years, respectively. Although the yields in stalk fresh weight (SFW) were representative of the region (9.9 and 8.2 kg SFW m−2, in the first and second year respectively) other factors caused a decrease of 76% in NECB, stressing the importance of the CO2 balance (assimilation versus respiration). Nevertheless, this sugarcane agro-system was an overall carbon sink with the N2O and CH4 emitted totals being offset by the net carbon gain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Sugar cane; Trash decomposition","biofuel; biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; eddy covariance; environmental assessment; flux measurement; global climate; greenhouse gas; methane; net ecosystem exchange; nitrous oxide; plantation; sugar cane; sustainability; Brazil; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075993477

Many studies identify negative emissions from bioenergy generation with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) as its key contribution, but assume that no other CO2 removal technologies are available. We use a global integrated assessment model, TIAM-UCL, to investigate the role of bioenergy within the global energy system when direct air capture and afforestation are available as cost-competitive alternatives to BECCS. We find that the presence of other CO2 removal technologies does not reduce the pressure on biomass resources but changes the use of bioenergy for climate mitigation. While we confirm that when available BECCS offers cheaper decarbonization pathways, we also find that its use delays the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels in industry and transport. Furthermore, it displaces renewable electricity generation, potentially increasing the likelihood of missing the Paris Agreement target. We found that the most cost-effective solution is to invest in a basket of CO2 removal technologies. However, if these technologies rely on CCS, then urgent action is required to ramp up the necessary infrastructure. We conclude that a sustainable biomass supply is critical for decarbonizing the global energy system. Since only a few world regions carry the burden of producing the biomass resource and store CO2 in geological storage, adequate international collaboration, policies and standards will be needed to realize this resource while avoiding undesired land-use change. © 2020 The Authors.

The approach does not anticipate exclusive off-grid communities but instead, diverse energy users taking advantage of the averaging effects of aggregation, the social benefits of a CPR and direct action on emissions. Design/methodology/approach: The study tested three groups of five adjacent − or same-building − neighbours for three months to measure how electricity demand (import) is affected by an in-home display issuing nudges and sanctions by the group around a simulated (limited capacity) shared solar and battery system. A control group of six homes’ energy data was obtained for the same period. Findings: Two groups reduced their energy demand with weak but significant correlation between stimulus and reduced energy demand and one group increased demand. There were no significant effects in time-of-use behaviours. Research limitations/implications: The study shows that the interaction between consumers and energy systems can in this instance be simulated with inexpensive equipment. Studying dynamic interactions between people and systems provides new data where supply simulations have been one-sided. There is support in this work that the energy supply can be presented as a rivalrous commons system. Practical implications: Urban adjacent neighbours (and apartment occupants in the same building or campus) exhibit emergent group behaviours around electricity use conservation and time-of-use. Managing energy demand is very difficult but very important for making consumer behaviour “fit” the future supply of energy which may be unreliable and limited. Social implications: There are likely social benefits and other overflow benefits when neighbours can share a critical resource. There are other critical services that may be managed according to the Ostrom commons principles. The sharing group will be more resilient in terms of electricity but also in terms of social capital. Originality/value: The work builds on the work of Rachel Coxcoon and others who have identified that groups perform better at certain challenges than individuals do. This aligns with scale and operational efficiencies in shared renewable energy infrastructure. Shaping behaviour and the generation systems together for optimal outcomes is new work. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behaviour change; Commons theory; Energy efficiency; Energy sharing; Microgrid; Solar power","consumption behavior; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy use; solar power; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071619016

Here, we identify forests in the western conterminous United States with high potential carbon sequestration and low vulnerability to future drought and fire, as simulated using the Community Land Model and two high carbon emission scenario (RCP 8.5) climate models. High-productivity, low-vulnerability forests have the potential to sequester up to 5,450 Tg CO2 equivalent (1,485 Tg C) by 2099, which is up to 20% of the global mitigation potential previously identified for all temperate and boreal forests, or up to ~6 yr of current regional fossil fuel emissions. Additionally, these forests currently have high above- and belowground carbon density, high tree species richness, and a high proportion of critical habitat for endangered vertebrate species, indicating a strong potential to support biodiversity into the future and promote ecosystem resilience to climate change. We stress that some forest lands have low carbon sequestration potential but high biodiversity, underscoring the need to consider multiple criteria when designing a land preservation portfolio.

In Denmark, the year 1900 has been set as a reference for water regulation purposes. Reliable measurements from this time are not available. To define reference conditions, we estimate point source emissions of nutrients from Danish towns in 1900 based on historic documentation and current quantitative data. The flow of nutrients emitted by humans and animals and in industrial wastewater is quantified based on the assessment of typical discharge routes in a set of model towns. We find that point source emissions were significant, with 4261 t nitrogen and 764 t phosphorous emitted from towns in 1900.

Further, 59% of nutrients were discharged directly to water, 22% were used as fertilizer on agricultural soil and 19% were emitted to soil via landfills and spills. Current point source emissions of nutrients to water (6600 t N/year and 900 t P/year) are significantly higher, revealing a need for radical reductions if historic emission levels should not be exceeded in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Emission requirements; Eutrophication; Historical environmental conditions; History of urbanisation; Point source emission; Sanitation; Water quality","Agricultural robots; Animals; Eutrophication; Industrial emissions; Sanitation; Water quality; Environmental conditions; Historic documentation; Industrial wastewaters; Natural circulation; Nutrient emissions; Point source emissions; Reference condition; Reliable measurement; Nutrients; agricultural soil; emission inventory; environmental conditions; eutrophication; fertilizer application; historical geography; landfill; point source pollution; sanitation; seasonality; urban atmosphere; urbanization; water quality; Denmark; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082654433

Interventions aiming at stabilizing slopes are thus common worldwide. The environmental monitoring of consequences of such interventions rarely consider the potential impacts on wild species, and especially on animal taxa. Birds are widely adopted as biological indicators thanks to their ecology and high sensitivity to environmental changes, and could represent an ideal subject also for monitoring the impacts of landslide stabilization. By monitoring birds for 8 years in a complex restoration intervention in the Italian Alps, I investigate their potential use for understanding the impacts of landslide rehabilitation at different scales, in a 350 ha-area. A BACI protocol was adopted, with bird data collected by means of point counts. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the potential impacts of restoration phases and intervention sites; analyses were developed for the breeding period and for the whole year, and for the local vs. large scale. I found evidence for different types of impacts, including the local impact of construction sites (e.g. negative for chaffinch Fringilla coelebs), of in operam phase (negative for mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus, Eurasian treecreeper Certhia familiaris and crested tit Lophophanes cristatus, positive for grey wagtail Motacilla cinerea and rock bunting Emberiza cia), as well as for a disturbance effect on species' detectability and for independent trends. The overall species richness was not (or very scarcely) affected by restoration works. This 8 yr-work provides an example of the potential efficacy of birds as indicators of the environmental impacts caused by landslide rehabilitation, which will likely become increasingly common in the next decades.

Methods This retrospective study was conducted in the ED of a rural hospital in the Rukungiri District of Uganda. A prospectively collected quality assurance database of ED visits was queried for poisonings in patients under the age of 5 who were admitted to the hospital. Cases were included if the chief complaint or final diagnosis included anything referable to poisoning, ingestion, or intoxication, or if a toxicologic antidote was administered. The database was coded by a blinded investigator, and descriptive statistics were performed. Results From November 9, 2009, to July 11, 2014, 3428 patients under the age of 5 were admitted to the hospital. A total of 123 cases (3.6%) met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-two patients were male (58.5%). The average age was 2.3 (SD, 0.97) years with 45 children (36.6%) under the age of 2 years. There were 19 cases (15.4%) lost to 3-day follow-up. The top 3 documented exposures responsible for pediatric poisonings were cow tick or organophosphates (36 cases, 29.2%), general poison or drug overdose (26 cases, 21.1%), and paraffin or hydrocarbon (24 cases, 19.5%). Of the admitted patients, 1 died in the ED and 2 died at 72-hour follow-up, for an overall 72-hour mortality of 2.4%. Patients who died were exposed to iron, cow tick, and rat poison.

The current work focuses on the experimental testing of an optimized two-stage combustor designed to operate with various fuel types, including natural gas and syngas produced via biomass gasification. Atmospheric experimental tests were performed and the results indicate larger flame lift-off heights and slightly higher CO gas emissions levels, while displaying lower NOx gas emissions levels for all thermal loads and air-To-fuel equivalence ratios tested, compared to that of the previous combustor designs. Additionally, steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted and the results are in general good agreement with the experimental data.

This task is even more complicated in transportation because of additional issues, such as minimum travel range at acceptable impact on payload and ensuring hazzle-free long-distance driving in case of regionally varying fuel economies. Biofuels were the first viable option for a large-scale partly renewable fuel economy. E10 and B7 fuels have been successfully and remarkably smoothly introduced, owing to the fact that these are liquid and can be used in conventional combustion engines with little impact on full-tank travel range. In contrast, the decision-making process on biofuels in the EU has been particularly turbulent, with an initially favourable assessment changing into controversial. Here the compatibility between the fuel economies of member states and avoidance of disruptive social effects are considered as essential pre-requisite of a viable transition pathway. Rebalancing three different aspects of the social dimension of sustainability is used to demonstrate that a succession of infrastructures based on liquid fuels, with biofuels as an interlock towards an economy that includes methanol-based eFuel, has the potential to bring continuity, reduce dependence on anticipated technological advances and improve cost management. Awareness of this underexposed prospect of biofuel may positively affect the assessment on its role in a low-carbon fuel economy, potentially influencing the current decision-making process on biofuels. © 2019 The Authors","Biofuel; EU decision-making; EU shared competence; Intra-European mobility; Methanol-based fuel economy; Non-disruptive infrastructural change","Bioethanol; Biofuels; Carbon; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Conventional combustions; Decision making process; Non-disruptive infrastructural change; Renewable sources; Social dimensions; Technological advances; Technological uncertainty; Transition pathway; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076677508

However, so far little is known about potential biogeochemical or thermodynamic indicators for the observed inhibition of further decomposition. For example, theoretical energy yields for methanogenesis, hydrogen partial pressures, stable isotope fractionation factors between CO2 and CH4, and electrochemical properties of dissolved organic matter have been proposed as thermodyamic indicators for such inhibition. To test the applicability and explanatory power of these indicators to identify conditions inhibiting organic matter decomposition, we incubated homogenized ombrotrophic peat for 300 days at 20 °C under diffusive flux conditions as control, and compared the observed effects to a treatment with vertical advective transport by water circulation and to a treatment in which both the unsaturated and water-saturated zone of the peat profile were kept anoxic. Results of energy yields of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were compared to hydrogen partial pressures, to 13C isotope fractionation factors and to redox properties of dissolved organic matter as obtained from mediated electrochemical oxidation and reduction. While CO2 and CH4 production slowed substantially in the deep peat profile, a concomitant decrease of Gibs free energy yields available to hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogensis and hydrogen and acetate concentrations over time supported a thermodynamic constraint on methanogenesis. Although, energy yields for the hydrogenotrophic pathway were close to or below the theoretical energy minimum levels already after 15 days. Transiently elevated H2 concentrations, not related to actual methanogenesis rates were observed for about 150–225 days. Thereafter, hydrogen concentrations diminished to levels below thresholds to thermodynamically support ongoing methanogenesis. Thus even on incubation timescales of 150–225 days, steady-state hydrogen concentrations as would be expected from thermodynamic considerations did not adjust on the bulk scale of observation. Gibbs free energy estimates for methanogenesis based on hydrogen partial pressures were consequently biased and did not reach the minimum required threshold despite ovious net CH4 production. Ratios between electron accepting (EAC) and donating (EDC) capacity of dissolved organic matter, however, turned out to provide suitable indicators of predominant redox conditions along gradients, stabilizing at low values upon onset of methanogenesis. Thus, our study demonstrated that the thermodynamically driven slow down of decomposition in deep peat deposits, preventing the peat to decompose further, cannot be easily identified based on a single indicator. However, constant and high concentrations of decomposition end-products, indicating zero net turnover and low energy yields, and constantly low EAC/EDC ratios, indicating no further availability of terminal electron acceptors, seem to be characteristic of the onset of conditions inhibiting further significant decomposition of peat. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electron acceptor capacity; Gibbs free energies; Hydrogen; Methanogenesis; Thermodynamic constraints","Anoxic water; Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Deposits; Dissolution; Electrochemical oxidation; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Hydrogen; Isotopes; Organic compounds; Partial pressure; Peat; Acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis; Electrochemical oxidation and reductions; Electron acceptor; Methanogenesis; Organic matter decomposition; Stable isotope fractionations; Terminal electron acceptors; Thermodynamic constraints; Chemicals removal (water treatment); biogeochemistry; decomposition; dissolved organic matter; electron; environmental indicator; experimental study; Gibbs free energy; hydrogen; isotopic fractionation; methanogenesis; peat; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075906613

In addition to the harmful impacts of dust storms on human health, they also have particular effects on socioeconomic and agroecological domains of human communities. Identify the sources of dust storms is the first step to combat against these devastating phenomena. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to determine dust sources of the Tigris and Euphrates basin using satellite and climatic data. Monthly LST and NDVI of MODIS, monthly wind speed, soil moisture, and absolute air humidity data from GLDAS, monthly TRMM precipitation, and soil texture data of FAO were used. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model was applied to determine the weights of the collected data (i.e. criteria or drivers for dust storms formation). Susceptible Areas to Dust Storm Formation (SADSF) were determined using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) model for months of June, July, and August from 2000 to 2017. After performing SADSF analysis, five main dust sources were identified in the whole basin. To evaluate the accuracy of the results, the number of real Observed Dust Storms (ODS) in each source was compared to the repetition of allocation in SADSF for each pixel over the 18-year period of this study from 2000 to 2017. Results indicated that the area of SADSF has significantly grown for all three months since 2008. The areas of SADSF in June and July were almost the same, while they were significantly bigger than August. Among identified dust sources, the highest SADSF repetition was in the northwest of Iraq followed by eastern Syria, southern Iraq, southeast border of Iraq, and east border of Iraq, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the SADSF repetition with the number of ODS events in those recognized dust sources was equal to 0.88, 0.76, and 0.74 for June, July, and August, respectively, that shows the accuracy of our results in comparison to actual data. © 2020","Dust sources mapping; Satellite and climatic data; Tigris and euphrates basin; Weighted linear combination","Analytic hierarchy process; Satellites; Soil moisture; Storms; Textures; Wind; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Climatic data; Correlation coefficient; Dust sources; Environmental challenges; Euphrates; Human communities; Weighted linear combinations; Dust; dust storm; eolian deposit; identification method; MODIS; NDVI; satellite altimetry; soil moisture; soil texture; TRMM; wind velocity; article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dust storm; human; humidity; Iraq; precipitation; process model; soil moisture; soil texture; Syrian Arab Republic; wind speed; Euphrates Basin; Iraq; Syrian Arab Republic; Tigris Basin; West Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079127821

Previous researchers have studied climate change news coverage to assess accuracy in reporting and potential sources of bias. These studies typically rely on manually coding articles from a handful of prestigious outlets, not allowing comparisons with smaller newspapers or providing enough diversity to assess the influence of partisan orientation or localized climate vulnerability on content production. Making these comparisons, this study indicates that partisan orientation, scale of circulation, and vulnerability to climate change correlate with several topics present in U.S. newspaper coverage of climate change. After assembling a corpus of over 78,000 articles covering two decades from 52 U.S. newspapers that are diverse in terms of geography, partisan orientation, scale of circulation, and objectively measured climate risk, a coherent set of latent topics were identified via an automated content analysis of climate change news coverage. Topic model results indicate that while outlet bias does not appear to impact the prevalence of coverage for most topics surrounding climate change, differences were evident for some topics based on partisan orientation, scale, or vulnerability status, particularly those relating to climate change denial, impacts, mitigation, or resource use. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive study of U.S. newspaper coverage of climate change and identifies specific topics where outlet bias constitutes an important contextual factor. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Newspaper coverage; Text analysis; Topic modeling","climate change; computer; data assimilation; literature review; media role; sampling bias; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079403297

Belite rich clinker, made more reactive by doping with combination of S and Li, could possibly be one of the low-energy alternatives for Portland cement clinker. Paper describes the preparation of doped belite and deals with its early hydration and reactivity. Belite rich clinkers were prepared in laboratory in high-temperature solid state synthesis. Pure substances were used for the preparation of raw meal and clinker. Early hydration heat flow development of cement pastes was monitored by isothermal calorimetry, changes in phase composition by “in situ” X-ray diffraction and TGA/DTA and microstructure by SEM-SE. Heat flow exotherms were correlated with quantified phase composition at given time. Intensity and position of main exothermic peak related to hydration of C3S is changing with increasing Li content. Doping of the C2S by the S or the combination of S and Li significantly increases the reactivity of the C2S-rich cement. The formation of C–S–H products is a continuous process that depends mainly on C3S during first 6 h and then is supported by slow reaction of β-C2S. The reactivity of C2S is affected by the timing of the hydration of other clinker phases. Two generations of portlandite formation detectable as a double endotherm on TGA/DTA can be attributed to hydration of C3S and β-C2S. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Belite clinker; Doping; Early hydration; Li; S","Cement industry; Energy conservation; Heat transfer; Hydrated lime; Hydration; Lime; Phase composition; Portland cement; Continuous process; Double endotherm; Exothermic peaks; High temperature; Isothermal calorimetry; Portland cement clinker; Pure substances; Solid-state synthesis; Lithium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100822840

This study assessed the effects of short-term iron chelation on markers of iron status, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy in the kidneys of old rats. Old Fischer 344 rats (24 months) were treated with deferoxamine (DFO; 200 mg/kg, twice daily for 4.5 days); saline-treated young (6 months) and old rats served as controls. Renal nonheme iron was significantly higher in the old rats, with iron localized in the renal cortex. Ferritin levels were elevated in the kidneys of old rats, while expression of several antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial proteins were reduced and protein carbonyls increased compared to young rats. DFO treatment significantly reduced ferritin levels, and increased transferrin receptor-1 protein, but did not affect nonheme iron content or protein carbonyls, nor did it reverse age-related changes in antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial proteins. Although short-term DFO treatment did not mitigate the age-related increase in iron content and oxidative damage, this work demonstrates that old rats respond appropriately to DFO, suggesting that optimization of iron chelation regimens could be useful in improving renal homeostasis with aging. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The effectiveness of the natural coastal defense by tidal marshes is closely related to their channel network which is in turn greatly influenced by their vegetation cover and shape. Previous research suggests a dual effect of vegetation on marsh topography; stabilizing sediment on the one hand versus promoting erosion and channel incision on the other hand. This study links these effects to different vegetation species, Salicornia procumbens, Spartina anglica, and Puccinellia maritima (further referred to as Salicornia, Spartina, and Puccinellia), by means of a coupled bio-hydromorphodynamic modeling study. Single species, species-assemblages, and species shifts were studied, incorporating both species-specific physical plant properties and spatiotemporal growth strategies. The results indicate the influence of vegetation on the marsh topography to be highly species-dependent, but also of a very complex nature. Both the presence of Spartina and Puccinellia resulted in significant channel development, whereas Salicornia did not induce topographic change. The combination of several species promoted or reduced channel development depending on the included species. Species-shifts linked with climatic changes resulted in increased erosion of the existing channel network potentially reducing the protective capacity of the marsh. © 2020.

In this paper, a climate model with a state-of-the-art contrail cirrus representation is used for fixed sea surface temperature simulations in order to determine the effective radiative forcing (ERF) from contrail cirrus. ERF is expected to be a good metric for intercomparing the quantitative importance of different contributions to surface temperature and climate impact. Substantial upscaling of aviation density is necessary to ensure statistically significant results from our simulations. The contrail cirrus ERF is found to be less than 50% of the respective instantaneous or stratosphere adjusted radiative forcings, with a best estimate of roughly 35%. The reduction of ERF is much more substantial for contrail cirrus than it is for a CO2 increase when both stratosphere adjusted forcings are of similar magnitude. Analysis of all rapid radiative adjustments contributing to the ERF indicates that the reduction is mainly induced by a compensating effect of natural clouds that provide a negative feedback. Compared to the CO2 reference case, a less positive combined water vapor and lapse rate adjustment also contributes to a more distinct reduction of contrail cirrus ERF, but not as much as the natural cloud adjustment. Based on the experience gained in this paper, respective contrail cirrus simulations with interactive ocean will be performed as the next step toward establishing contrail cirrus efficacy. ERF results of contrail cirrus from other climate models equipped with suitable parameterizations are regarded as highly desirable. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Clouds; Oceanography; Surface properties; Surface waters; Best estimates; Climate impacts; Climate model simulations; Global mean surface temperature; Radiative forcings; Sea surface temperature (SST); State of the art; Surface temperatures; Climate models; cirrus; climate effect; climate modeling; contrail; parameterization; radiative forcing; sea surface temperature; stratosphere; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080037808

Design/methodology/approach: A household survey with 300 interviewees and focus group discussions with key stakeholders were conducted and validated at two steps, using the climate data from the nearest weather stations and reviewing literatures, to correlate the local perceptions on climate change and its impacts. Findings: Majority of the respondents reported an increase in temperature and change in the precipitation pattern with increased hazardous incidences such as floods, avalanches and landslides. Climate change directly impacted plant distribution, species composition, disease and pest infestation, forage availability, agricultural productivity and human health risks related to infectious vector-borne diseases. Research limitations/implications: Because of the remoteness and difficult terrain, there are insufficient local weather stations in the mountains providing inadequate scientific data, thus requiring extrapolation from nearest stations for long-term climate data monitoring. Practical implications: The research findings recommend taking immediate actions to develop local climate change adaptation strategies through a participatory approach that would enable local communities to strengthen their adaptive capacity and resilience. Social implications: Local knowledge-based perceptions on climate change and its impacts on social, ecological and economic sectors could help scientists, practitioners and policymakers to understand the ground reality and respond accordingly through effective planning and implementing adaptive measures including policy formulation. Originality/value: This research focuses on combining local knowledge-based perceptions and climate science to elaborate the impacts of climate change in a localised context in Rakaposhi Valley in Karakoram Mountains of Pakistan. © 2019, Laxmi Dutt Bhatta, Erica Udas, Babar Khan, Anila Ajmal, Roheela Amir and Sunita Ranabhat.","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate change; Human-health; Karakoram mountains; Vulnerability","climate change; household survey; perception; policy making; precipitation (climatology); strategic approach; temperature effect; traditional knowledge; Baltistan; Gilgit-Baltistan; Gilgit-Baltistan; Karakoram; Pakistan; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078058148

The CFB of T1 consisted of 40% A. excelsa leaves, which was replaced at 50% level with phytochemical rich Z. nummularia leaves in T2 and P. cineraria leaves in T3. There was decline (p &lt; 0.05) in methane emission per kg digestible OM intake by 10.7 and 15.5% in T2 and T3 compared to T1. Rumen fermentation pattern showed an increased trichloroacetic acid precipitable N with decreased ammonia N and ciliate protozoa population in T3 compared to other two groups. Ruminal microbial protein synthesis as assessed from urinary purine derivatives excretion was higher (p = 0.012) in T3 than T1, while T2 had an intermediate value. There was decreased (p &lt; 0.05) digestibility of dry matter, organic matter (OM) and ADF in T3, and that of crude protein (CP) and NDF in both T2 and T3.

However, it is highly dependent of the ignition characteristics of the fuel and the air/fuel mixture preparation. Therefore, the proper selection of an injection strategy, of the combustion chamber design and of the air management strategy are critical to ensuring successful partially premixed combustion operation in the full engine map. The objective of the present investigation is to evaluate the use of multiple air management strategies over the air/fuel effective equivalence ratio (ϕeff) and cylinder charge reactivity and its consequent impact on particle number emissions and particle size distribution. Tests were carried out in a newly designed 2-stroke high-speed direct-injection compression-ignition engine operating with partially premixed combustion concept using 95-research-octane-number gasoline fuel. A scanning mobility particle sizer was used to measure the size distribution of engine-exhaust particles in the range from 6.3 to 237 nm. Three different steady-state operation modes in terms of indicated mean effective pressure and engine speed were investigated. The experiments showed an increase in the particle number emissions and a progressive shift in the particle size toward larger sizes, increasing the accumulation-mode particles and reducing the nucleation-mode particles with the decrease in the differential pressure between intake and exhaust (ΔP) and the valve overlap period. Finally, the particle formation process was limited by the increase in the exhaust gas recirculation rate. © IMechE 2018.","2-stroke engine; air management strategies; gasoline partially premixed combustion concept; particle number emissions; particle size distribution","Direct injection; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gasoline; Ignition; Light transmission; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Size distribution; Air management; Exhaust gas recirculation rates; High speed direct injections; Indicated mean effective pressure; Partially premixed combustion; Particle number emission; Particulate matter emissions; Scanning mobility particle sizer; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060152083

However, little is known on how plant responses to herbivory are modulated by environmental variation along ecological gradients. To investigate this question, we used bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) plants and an experimental treatment to induce plant defenses (i.e., application of methyl jasmonate; MeJA), to observe ecological responses and gene expression changes along an elevational gradient in a boreal system in western Norway. The gradient included optimal growing conditions for bilberry in this region (ca. 500 m a.s.l.), and the plant's range limits at high (ca. 900 m a.s.l.) and low (100 m a.s.l.) elevations. Across all altitudinal sites, MeJA-treated plants allocated more resources to herbivory resistance while reducing growth and reproduction than control plants, but this response was more pronounced at the lowest elevation. High-elevation plants growing under less herbivory pressure but more resource-limiting conditions exhibited consistently high expression levels of defense genes in both MeJA-treated and untreated plants at all times, suggesting a constant state of “alert.” These results suggest that plant defense responses at both the molecular and ecological levels are modulated by the combination of climate and herbivory pressure, such that plants under different environmental conditions differentially direct the resources available to specific antiherbivore strategies. Our findings are important for understanding the complex impact of future climate changes on plant–herbivore interactions, as this is a major driver of ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. © 2020 The Authors.

The process of a decrease in the energy during the propagation of ions through the material is considered on the basis of the previously proposed power-law approximation of the dependence of inelastic ion energy losses on the velocity. The dependence of the energy losses on the ion path is obtained for different initial energies and nuclear charges of ions during their propagation through carbon. The thickness of the material layer in which the energy losses reach their maximum value and also the distance from the carbon target surface to the region of maximum energy losses are determined. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","energy release; ion deceleration; ion energy losses; ion range","Carbon; Heavy ions; Carbon targets; Initial energy; Ion energy loss; Ion paths; Material layers; Nuclear charges; Power-law; Energy dissipation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084438967

Nature-based solutions (NBS) have emerged as sustainable solutions to contribute to urban resilience in order to meet the challenges of climate change. In order to promote the use of NBS for increasing urban resilience, tools that demonstrate the value of this type of solutions over the long-term are required. A performance assessment system provides an adequate basis for demonstrating this value, as well as for diagnosing the current city situation, selecting and monitoring the implementation of solutions. Regarding NBS management, some assessment approaches have been published, focusing on assessing the effectiveness of NBS in the face of climate change and supporting their design and impact assessment. Nevertheless, an integrated approach to assess the NBS contribution for urban resilience has not been published.

First, the “Big Green Deal” offers a positive story of the future, under the assumption that there will be a multilateral approach to tackling climate change. Second, “Dirty Nationalism” explores the fallout of nations choosing to turn inward and pursue a short-term, protectionist, and self-interested agenda. Third, “Technology Breakthrough” illustrates how a technological leap forward could lead to a great power rivalry and distinct regional energy blocs. Finally, “Muddling On” investigates the outcome of an energy transition that reflect business as usual.

Both approaches include multiple objectives such as carbon sequestration, livelihood improvement and forest tenure reform. New institutions, such as community-forest management boards or REDD+ implementation agencies, are being introduced to achieve sustainable development in the forestry sector. However, the way REDD+ affects local CBFM systems and community livelihoods remains understudied. This study analyzes the effects of REDD+ on CBFM systems in Vietnam. We selected four research communes (sub-district level units) and we conducted household surveys (n = 187), focus group discussions (n = 4), expert interviews (n = 8) and secondary data analysis (n = 23). Our findings show that in one commune REDD+ introduced CBFM and forestland allocation to communities in accordance with their customary boundaries. In another commune, REDD+ was implemented in a pre-existing CBFM and institutional landscape, and the program had little effect on households’ livelihoods. The implementation of CBFM in all four communes led to further consolidation of influence of formal institutions and a higher level of formalization among involved communities. Based on the results of this study, we propose a novel typology on CBFM systems in a post-REDD+ era. This typology takes the level of formalization, marketization, globalization and forest dependence of respective households, which make up a community, into account. We present CBFM systems on a spectrum from customary to formal, and we highlight the need to adapt REDD+ and CBFM to individual households’ livelihood trajectories. © 2020, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Community-based forest management; Forest governance typology; Forests and livelihoods; Indigenous communities","community resource management; emission control; forest management; forestry policy; indigenous population; livelihood; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078252062

It presents results from a comprehensive survey among approximately 400 small municipalities in Bavaria, Germany. The study analyzes the perception of climate change risks and the perceived need for response, the fields of action, the triggering and influencing factors in the political process, and the people and bodies involved. Our findings reveal that in most cases small municipalities do not follow a strategic and holistic approach for climate change adaptation. Especially among small and very small municipalities, the study shows a gap between discussing climate change and setting up mitigation or adaptation measures. In conclusion, we present three policy implications for increasing the adaptive capacity of small municipalities. These address the increase of awareness of adaptation needs, effective management structures and the mandatory integration of a climate strategy into the long-term local political agenda. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptive capacity; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Climate policy; Local communities; Small municipalities","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; holistic approach; perception; rural area; rural population; Bavaria; Germany; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082671158

To reduce industrial emissions with sufficient speed to meet the Paris goals, this review article argues for the rapid formation of regional and sectoral transition plans, implemented through comprehensive policy packages. These policy packages, which will differ by country, sector, and level of development, must reflect regional capacities, politics, resources, and other key circumstances, and be informed and accepted by the stakeholders who must implement the transition. These packages will likely include a mix of the following mutually reinforcing strategies: reducing and substituting the demand for GHG intense materials (i.e., material efficiency) while raising the quantity and quality of recycling through intentional design and regulation; removal of energy subsidies combined with carbon pricing with competitiveness protection; research and development support for decarbonized production technologies followed by lead markets and subsidized prices during early stage commercialization; sunset policies for older high carbon facilities; electricity, hydrogen and carbon capture, and storage infrastructure planning and support; and finally, supporting institutions, including for a “just workforce & community transition” and monitoring and adjustment of policy effectiveness.

The health impacts of air pollutants were estimated using the World Health Organization (WHO) AirQ + software updated in 2017. The results showed that the annual trend of PM concentrations was decreasing while O3 concentration was almost constant during the study period. The results indicated that in approximately 59 % and 4 % of the studied days for PM10, 48 % and 28 % for PM2.5, and 3 % and 0.3 % for O3, inhabitants of Tabriz city were exposed to the air pollutants in levels greater than the WHO AQG and National and U.S.EPA standard levels. Moreover, the highest monthly mean concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and O3 were respectively observed in May (80.4 μg/m3), December (42.5 μg/m3), and June (78.4 μg/m3). It was estimated that attributable proportions due to long-term exposure to PM10 were between 7.9 % and 28.7 % for post neonatal infant mortality and between 20.7 % and 61.5 % for incidence of chronic bronchitis in adults. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 was attributed to about 11.8 % from all-cause, 34.6 % from ischemic heart disease, 26.7 % from stroke, 23.4 % from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 24.2 % from acute lower respiratory infection, and 16.5 % from lung cancer mortalities.

The main objective of this case study was to address an integrated simulation-based research outcome to manage chicken skin waste (fat) for biodiesel, generate electricity from the biodiesel and present the potential of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction from environment by product implementation. Approximate electric load profile of Kuakata and comprehensive emission modeling for this region has been performed by fuel-switching model and RETScreen Expert software. The simulation outcomes presented that 492,695 L/year biodiesel can be produced from chicken skin waste in Kuakata and converted into 883 MWh electricity per annum. The operating cost was 188,062 $/year, and cost of energy production was 0.214 $/kWh. The outcomes from this simulation modeling also demonstrated that the annual fuel consumption for base case is 3.7 kWh/m2 while 1.5 kWh/m2 is for proposed case with the reduction of 2.2 kWh/m2 per year.

Regulatory bodies often establish the water allocation amount, but its distribution during the irrigation season is left to the land manager's discretion. We evaluated approaches to best manage water allocations to a warm-season turfgrass [Pennisetum clandestinum (Holst. Ex Chiov)] grown on a free-draining sand prone to surface (0–25 mm) soil water repellence in a Mediterranean climate in south-western Australia under ‘deficit irrigation’, in a two-year field study. The three factorial experiment consisted of three levels for each treatment applied to plots (10 m2) of kikuyugrass: water allocation (5000, 6250 or 7500 kL ha−1 yr−1), irrigation schedule, and soil wetting agent rate (nil, recommended ‘label’ rate, double recommended ‘label’ rate), and was replicated three times. The irrigation schedules were based on historical net evaporation at the site, and then refined monthly using in-season net evaporation data or measurements of soil water content. Kikuyugrass growth and color was adequate when irrigated using the current regional water allocation (7500 kL ha−1 yr−1) under a low wear situation and to a lesser extent when the water allocation was lowered to 6250 kL ha−1 yr−1. Application of a soil wetting agent diminished water repellence and improved kikuyugrass color for 7500 or 6250 kL ha−1 yr−1 water allocations. Distributing a water allocation based on historical monthly net evaporation rates was a simple and effective scheduling approach to maintaining a warm-season turfgrass. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deficit irrigation; Evapotranspiration; Soil moisture sensor; Soil water repellence; Soil wetting agent; Warm-season turfgrass","Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Moisture control; Scheduling; Soil moisture; Surface active agents; Water management; Water supply; Wetting; Deficit irrigation; Factorial experiment; Irrigation schedule; Mediterranean climates; Soil moisture sensors; Soil water repellence; Turfgrass; Water repellent soils; Wetting agents; evaporation; evapotranspiration; grass; irrigation; seasonality; sensor; soil moisture; water use efficiency; wetting; Australia; Pennisetum clandestinum; Pennisetum flaccidum; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076571884

Given the availability of supermarket food waste in the Umbria region (Italy), the logistics is optimized using a Vehicle Routing Problem Solver, mass and energy balances of the biogas plant are partly calculated and partly measured from a real biogas plant. The data obtained from food waste transport and anaerobic co-digestion process are used as input for LCA analysis. The aim of the methodology is to assess the environmental and economic benefit of the substitution of energy crops (like corn silage) with food waste in anaerobic digestion. Two approaches are adopted: consequential LCA and attributional LCA. Only one impact category is taken into account: climate change. This decision has been taken to focus on two decision making criteria (economic feasibility and GHG emissions reduction). The results show that a reduction of 42% in the carbon footprint of the electricity produced from the biogas plant can be obtained by substituting about 9900 t of corn silage with 6600 t of food waste. Through the combined use of economic analysis and consequential LCA it has been possible to identify an optimized scenario in which: food waste produced from food industries is collected and used to produce energy in Expired Food Energy chains (EFE), while the food obtained from supermarkets is used to promote charity initiatives in actions aiming at the Reduction of Expired Food waste (REF). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biogas; Co-digestion; Feasibility; Food; LCA; Tool; Waste","Biogas; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Crops; Decision making; Economic analysis; Emission control; Food products; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Retail stores; Solid wastes; Tools; Vehicle routing; Wastes; Anaerobic co-digestion; Codigestion; Consequential LCA; Decision making criteria; Economic feasibilities; Feasibility; Mass and energy balance; Vehicle Routing Problems; Anaerobic digestion; biogas; biofuel; biogas; business; decision making; food waste; innovation; life cycle analysis; waste disposal; waste technology; anaerobic digestion; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; decision making; economic aspect; energy balance; energy crop; energy yield; environmental aspects and related phenomena; Expired Food Energy; food industry; food waste; Italy; landfill; life cycle assessment; maize; priority journal; Reduction of Expired Food; silage; waste management; anaerobic growth; food; waste disposal; waste management; Italy; Umbria; Zea mays; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Food; Italy; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078727367

The findings are even stronger for firms operating in countries with high institutional qualities, in high emission and highly competitive industries. These results are important to lending institutions for making financing decisions. Policymakers and investors could also utilise ESP as a key distinguishing factor for firms to benefit from lower financial constraints.

In such context, highlighting the key ecological attributes of land degradation and the underlying processes are essential within the national adaptation and mitigation plans. This study analyzed the impacts of land use on plant biodiversity, stand structure and carbon storage. Inventories of ligneous species were conducted on 240 plots laid out along four levels of land disturbance in Burkina Faso. Dendrometric data collected from 6035 shrubs and trees were converted to aboveground biomass and carbon density. The results revealed a γ–diversity of 107 woody species belonging to 73 genera and 35 families. Significant effect of land use was found on species diversity, stand structure and carbon density (p &lt; 0.001). Agricultural lands had the lowest diversity, density and carbon stocks, whereas protected areas held the highest values. Carbon density ranged from 10.362 ± 1.209 Mg C.ha−1 in fallows to 42.663 ± 1.982 Mg C.ha−1 in protected areas. Principal Component Analysis showed tight links between carbon storage, species diversity and stand structure. The multiple linear regression revealed that tree density explained 21.25% of the variation in the plot-level total carbon stocks (α = 19.301; p &lt; 3.38e-14). Similarly, tree diameter and height together accounted for 45.43% of the variation in mean carbon stocks (α = 19.301; p &lt; 2.2 e−16). This study demonstrated that the higher the land use pressure, the lower the species diversity and carbon storage in woody vegetation. The findings highlight the importance of accounting for improved or smart agricultural practices within the intended nationally determined contributions’ framework. © 2019","Aboveground carbon stocks; Land disturbance; Stand structure; Sudanian region; Woody flora diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076824779

The Ali concentrations of 2 and 4 µmol L–1 corresponded to low-to-moderate and high mortality thresholds, but prolonged exposure to ≥1 µmol Ali L–1 also produced mortality. The variability, mean, and highest Ali concentrations in Buck Creek year round, and in several other streams during spring, have decreased significantly over the past 3 decades. Logistic models indicate that Ali surpassed highly toxic concentrations in Buck Creek for 3 to 4 mo annually during 2001 to 2003 and for 2 to 3 wk annually during 2015 to 2017. The loss of extremely high Ali episodes indicates that toxicity has declined markedly between the 1989 to 1990, 2001 to 2003, and 2015 to 2017 test periods, yet Ali concentrations can still cause moderate-to-high and complete (100%) mortality. The logistic models illustrate how mortality of brook trout in several Adirondack streams likely decreased in response to the 1990 Amendments to the United States' Clean Air Act (which decreased acidity, Ali concentrations, and duration of toxic episodes) and offer a means to predict how changes in US regulations that limit emissions of NOx and SOx (and N and S deposition loads) could affect fish survival and stream ecosystems in this region and across the Northeast.

It is revealed that CO2 can be captured and reduced into *CO on the Cut 0 site, owing to its zero oxidation state. More importantly, C–C coupling reaction of two *CHO species on the Cut 0–Cub x + atomic interface can occur with a rather low kinetic barrier of 0.57 eV, leading to the formation of the final C2 product, namely, C2H5OH. During the whole process, the limiting potential is just 0.68 V. These findings may open a new avenue for CO2 reduction into high-value fuels and chemicals. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, a novel yet practical method called diurnal-cycle-constrained empirical orthogonal function (DCCEOF) was developed to fill in data gaps present in data records with evident temporal variability. The hourly PM2:5 concentration data retrieved from the national ambient air quality monitoring network in China were used as a demonstration. The DCCEOF method aims to reconstruct the diurnal cycle of PM2:5 concentration from its discrete neighborhood field in space and time firstly and then predict the missing values by calibrating the reconstructed diurnal cycle to the level of valid PM2:5 concentrations observed at adjacent times. The statistical results indicate a high frequency of data gaps in our retrieved hourly PM2:5 concentration record, with PM2:5 concentration measured on about 40 % of the days suffering from data gaps. Further sensitivity analysis results reveal that data gaps in the hourly PM2:5 concentration record may introduce significant bias to its daily averages, especially during clean episodes at which PM2:5 daily averages are observed to be subject to larger uncertainties compared to the polluted days (even in the presence of the same amount of missingness). The cross-validation results indicate that our suggested DCCEOF method has a good prediction accuracy, particularly in predicting daily peaks and/or minima that cannot be restored by conventional interpolation approaches, thus confirming the effectiveness of the consideration of the local diurnal variation pattern in gap filling. By applying the DCCEOF method to the hourly PM2:5 concentration record measured in China from 2014 to 2019, the data completeness ratio was substantially improved while the frequency of days with gapped PM2:5 records reduced from 42.6 % to 5.7 %. In general, our DCCEOF method provides a practical yet effective approach to handle data gaps in time series of geophysical parameters with significant diurnal variability, and this method is also transferable to other data sets with similar barriers because of its self-consistent capability. © 2020 Author(s).",,"accuracy assessment; air quality; ambient air; concentration (composition); data quality; data set; diurnal variation; interpolation; particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081938728

In order to reflect the recent NOx emission reduction and to investigate its impact on surface O3 concentrations in Asian megacities, we adjusted two bottom-up regional emission inventories of which base years are 2006 (E2006) and 2010 (E2010), respectively. We applied direct and relative emission adjustments to both E2006 and E2010 to constrain NOx emissions using OMI NO2 vertical column densities. Except for the relative emission adjustment with E2006, modeling results with adjusted emissions exhibit that NOx emissions over East Asian megacities (Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo) in the bottom-up inventories are generally overestimated. When the direct emission adjustment is applied to E2006, model biases in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), South Korea are reduced from 24 ppb to 2 ppb for NOx (=NO+NO2) and from −9 ppb to 0 ppb for O3. In addition, NO2 model biases in Beijing and Shanghai in China are reduced from 8 ppb to 18 ppb–0 ppb and 1 ppb, respectively. Daily maximum 8-h average O3 model biases over the same places are decreased by 8 ppb and 14 ppb. Further analyses suggest that the reduction in domestic South Korean NOx emissions plays a significant role in increasing O3 concentrations in SMA. We conclude that the current strong drive to reduce NOx emissions as part of the strategy to lower particulate matter concentrations in South Korea can account for increased O3 concentrations in recent years and suggest that more aggressive NOx emissions will be necessary soon. © 2019 Elsevier LtdRecent reductions in NOx emissions over East Asian megacities may have promoted the increase of O3 concentrations.

The issues concerning environmental impacts are significant in cold supply chains due to substantial carbon emissions from storage and distribution of temperature-sensitive product. This paper investigates the impact of carbon emissions arising from storage and transportation in the cold supply chain in the presence of carbon tax regulation, and under uncertain demand. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to determine optimal replenishment policies and transportation schedules to minimize both operational and emissions costs. A matheuristic algorithm based on the Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm and a mixed integer programming is developed to solve the problem in realistic sizes. The performance and robustness of the matheuristic algorithm are analyzed using test instances in various sizes. A real-world case study in Queensland, Australia is used to demonstrate the application of the model. The results highlight that higher emissions price does not always contribute to the efficiency of the cold supply chain system. Furthermore, the analyses indicate that using heterogeneous fleet including light duty and medium duty vehicles can lead to further cost saving and emissions reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax regulations; Demand uncertainty; Matheuristic algorithm; Sustainable cold supply chain; Two-stage stochastic programming","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Fleet operations; Integer programming; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Carbon taxes; Demand uncertainty; Distribution of temperature; Iterated local search; Mixed integer programming; Storage and transportations; Supply chain systems; Two-stage stochastic programming; Supply chain management; algorithm; carbon emission; demand-side management; optimization; pollution tax; supply chain management; sustainability; Australia; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078993438

Most of the experimental work reported in this area has been limited to macroscopic and core scale measurements and these results consensually pointed out wettability alteration towards water-wet state to be the main recovery mechanism. It is widely believed that wettability is the macroscopic to core scale effect and the link between such effects with molecular scale interactions and phenomena occurring at both carbonate-oil/brine and oil-brine interfaces is not yet well understood. The current study aims to address this knowledge gap by acquiring data on various crude oil/brine/carbonate and crude oil-brine physicochemical interactions using several macroscopic, pore, and core scale experimental techniques. These techniques include contact angle, zeta potential, cryo-broad ion beam scanning electron microscope (BIB-SEM), sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, and core flooding relative permeabilities. Both high salinity water (HSW) and a controlled ionic composition low salinity water (CICLSW) containing sufficient amount of three key ions (sulfates, magnesium, and calcium) are used to delineate water chemistry effects on resulting physicochemical interactions and changes occurring at carbonate-oil/brine and oil-brine interfaces. The macroscopic contact angle data showed strongly oil-wet behavior with HSW and favorable wettability alterations towards water-wet conditions with CICLSW. The opposing polarity of zeta potentials is observed at calcite/brine and oil-brine interfaces with HSW, which can collapse the thin water film and cause the direct contact of crude oil on to the rock surface to result in oil-wetness. In contrast, CICLSW showed increasingly negative zeta potentials at oil/brine interface and the polarity reversal to negative zeta potentials across calcite/brine interface to stabilize the water-film on the rock surface and subsequently render water-wet conditions. The cryo-BIB-SEM imaging showed trapping of oil ganglia in larger pores and relatively less contact of crude oil with carbonate surface for CICLSW flooded sample. The phase distributions in the sample further confirmed less amount of oil trapped in carbonate pores, which provides a clear indication of CICLSW effect on wettability alteration and better oil mobilization in carbonates. It is also understood from sum frequency generation spectroscopy CH3/CH2 stretching results that CICLSW increased the conformation order of hydrocarbon chains to enhance the interactions at thin interfaces and ultimately alter the wettability. Significant increase in the intensities of free OH stretches and hydrogen bonding are observed at oil/water interface with CICLSW. Such result provides a direct indication that dissolved salt ions displace some water molecules at the interface, resulting in reduced free OH bond densities to correlate well with zeta potential drop observed in HSW. The shifts in relative permeability curves obtained by history matching the coreflood experimental data also confirmed the favorable effect of CICLSW in altering the wettability towards water-wet conditions. This study thereby establishes a good agreement between macroscopic to core scale effects and pore scale interactions occurring at carbonate-oil/brine and oil-brine interfaces to clearly demonstrate the beneficial effects of CICLSW on wettability alteration and oil recovery in carbonates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Contact angle; Controlled ionic composition low salinity water (CICLSW); Cryo-BIB-SEM imaging; High salinity water (HSW); Oil recovery; Relative permeability curves; Sum frequency generation spectroscopy; Wettability; Zeta potential","Calcite; Carbonation; Contact angle; Crude oil; Floods; Hydrogen bonds; Interferometry; Ion beams; Ions; Molecules; Scanning electron microscopy; Secondary recovery; Sulfur compounds; Wetting; Zeta potential; High salinity; Low-salinity water; Oil recoveries; Relative permeability curves; SEM imaging; Sum-frequency generation spectroscopy; Oil well flooding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076832692

Correspondingly, one-third of electricity is generated using CHP. In Finland, the market share of CHP derived electricity is significant, and therefore used technologies and fuels should be carefully chosen in terms of costs and emissions. In this paper we consider a case of Kuopio, which is the 9th biggest city in Finland. In the past few years, the total usage of fossil fuels has been decreasing and the use of renewable fuels has correspondingly been increasing. The amount of electricity produced with peat has gradually decreased during the last 15 years. The common explaining factor for these trends is the political will and national and municipal level shared common aim to reduce greenhouse gases and emissions. Furthermore, there are new technical innovations available, such as flue gas scrubber and district cooling system, which has been proven to be significant tools to reduce emission and at the same time investments into these innovations have been shown to save energy and money, meaning being greener has been also financially lucrative decision for these sustainability enhancing technology investors. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

With the advantage of horizontal drilling technology, Devonian and Mississippian mudrocks have become important topics for research to understand the petroleum system fundamentals, including sources of hydrocarbons for these unconventional reservoirs. In this study, organic geochemistry and petrography of Mississippian mudrocks and the Woodford Shale were examined. The key study core is from Lincoln County, Oklahoma, representing the Mississippian mudstone and Woodford Shale. Three additional cores in Payne County and one core fromLoganCounty were studied. Core sampleswere assessed for hydrocarbon generation potential using Rock-Eval pyrolysis together with biomarker analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Organic and thin-section petrography was performed to identify maceral composition and develop a sedimentary facies classification. Mudrocks within the Mississippian section exhibited adequate organic richness for petroleum generation, thereby augmenting the established generation potential of the Woodford Shale. Several unique Mississippian biomarkers were identified, including diterpenoids and extended tricyclic terpanes. Macerals of the Mississippian rocks exhibit dominance of lamalginite and bituminite, whereas Woodford macerals are high in telalginite. Based on the organic matter composition and sedimentology, six facies were identified within the Mississippian mudrocks. Furthermore, based on organic richness and key biomarker ratios, the Mississippian succession is divided into three units.

The study area is located at Karkh side in Baghdad City. The geographical area situated among several streets; 14th July Street (section in Ring road No. 1), Demishq Street, Mansure Street and 14th Ramadan Street. The main intersections in these streets are; Shaljya Intersection, Demishq Intersection, Dilal Intersection, Gailani intersection, and Topji Intersection. The proposed road starts from the Gailani intersection and jointed with 14th July Street (Ring road No. 1) with length (1.9 Km). The study area is facing a low level of service during traffic congestion resulting from an inefficient and poor road network. The main purpose is to study constructing a new road to reduce the environmental and congestion impacts on the transportation system at selected roads. The percentages of expected generated traffic that will be serviced in the suggested rout are 23% and 52 % from the peak hourly volume counting in location 1 (Shaljya Intersection). On the other hand, at location 2 (Demishq Intersection), the percentages of generated traffic transported to the suggested rout are 22% and 23%. By using Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), the required lanes for the suggested road are 3 lanes for each direction. According to findings, construction of the suggested road is important to improve the road network in term the traffic and reduction the vehicle emissions at present routs. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082977493

The potential impacts will result from sea level rise, salinity changes and ocean acidification. The Whin Estuary, located at longitude 10 48 W and latitude 40 56 N of the Western Region of Ghana, is one of the few pristine coastal wetlands in the region with live oyster populations and a potential for fisheries sustenance. This paper examines adaptation strategies to changes in climate among female and male oyster collectors, constraints in the choice of adaptation strategies and land use stressors affecting the oyster fishery in Ghana. Participatory approaches such as participant observation, focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used to gather data on the indigenous knowledge of the fishery and climate variability. In the fishery, 60 % of female oyster collectors adapt to prolonged dry periods through value chain addition practices and 45 % are practicing other indigenous practices. The men adapt to changes in climate mainly by diversification. Kendall tau-b correlation analysis performed on adaptation practices showed no significant correlation (r = −0.667; p = 0.174) between the adaptation practices ranked by male and female oyster collectors. There was a strong significant correlation (p = 0.05; r = 0.619) between constraints in the choice of adaptations among fishers. Presence of sewage outlets was the major threat (8), followed by uncontrolled mangrove cutting (7), sand winning (6) and the least of the threats were refuse dumps (4) and farming activities (3) following procedures of Battisti et al. (Biodiversity and Conservation 18 (11): 3053–3060, 2009) and Salafsky et al. (2003) ranking methods. In the context of climate variability, female oyster collectors may be more resilient in the oyster business than men; hence, they should be well resourced through capacity-building training programs. There is need for a redress of non-climate stressors by stakeholders through sensitization and strengthening of existing bye-laws. Proactive adaptive mechanisms blending both indigenous and scientific research-based strategies are essential for resilience in the phase of climate variability and sustainability of any management decision in fisheries. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate variability; Diversification; Oyster; Vulnerability","adaptation; adaptive management; climate variation; coastal fishery; indigenous knowledge; land use conflict; mangrove; oyster culture; questionnaire survey; vulnerability; Ghana; Western Region; Crassostrea tulipa; Ostreidae; Ulex europaeus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081259527

In two phases, we used co-designed instruments to conduct social valuation of biodiversity, and provisioning, cultural and regulating services. First, we conducted eight participatory fora, where experts and non-experts identified ecosystem aspects to which they ascribe value. We combined knowledge from the fora—expert and non-expert—and the literature to identify 45 ecosystem aspects of value—importance—to people. Second, we organized the valued aspects into four psychometric social valuation instruments that were reviewed and contributed to by experts and non-experts. We used those instruments in a survey questionnaire completed by 968 residents of Deschutes County, USA. Co-design led to high valuation reliabilities. The omission of either expert or non-expert knowledge would have resulted in suboptimal valuation. Unexpectedly, biodiversity was valued more than any category of ecosystem services, and urban sprawl regulation—a novel non-expert-identified function—was valued more than all aspects of climate regulation. These findings—directly resulting from co-design—illustrate that co-designed commensurable metrics are adaptable to various decision contexts; they can provide issue-specific valuations and comparisons, broader valuations, comparisons between specific and broader ecosystem services, and equity-based parameters for addressing distributional concerns vital to decision-making. Co-designed commensurable metrics lead to social valuations that are better suited for decision-making and for persuasive communication of those decisions to enhance social compliance. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","behavioral compliance; commensurability; legitimacy; psychometrics; reliability; validity","biodiversity; decision making; design; ecosystem service; equity; expert system; knowledge; stakeholder; urban sprawl; valuation; Deschutes County; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067639467

Several commodities and/or products have been assessed in recent years for urban mining and reuse potential viz. automobiles, electronic waste etc. Urban mining for buildings, the largest material sinks globally, however require considerations which differ from the product-centric urban mining approaches. This study proposes a methodological framework for estimating city-wide urban mining, recovery and reuse potential of building materials and components. First, it extends the material stock and flow assessment to urban mining potentials so that recoverable and reusable flows can be highlighted. Secondly, it expands potential applications of recoverable flows to provide an impactful representation to stakeholders such as policy makers, consumers, designers and practitioners. The proposed framework has been applied to the public residential buildings of Singapore, a city state in Southeast Asia, for assessing building components such as windows, doors, tiles, light fixtures, toilet and kitchen fittings. As a case study, construction of low-cost houses in neighbouring Indonesia was explored to receive building component flows. Results highlight that the reuse of building components could have supported construction in the range of 830–1910 houses in 2016 with more than 30,000 households getting benefit over the six years assessed in this study. Overall, outflows from the Singapore city can partly support the construction of 2200–6030 houses annually to resource-constrained housing sector in the surrounding developing region.

Current deployed ridesharing systems offer matches to participants based on trip details and on preferences. They do not optimise for system-wide objectives that generally incur a high computational cost. Academic studies tend to focus on specific single objectives, while stakeholders and policy-makers for practical deployments may have many different, possibly vague, objectives. In this paper, we try to reduce the gap between research and deployed applications, and tackle the problem of computing global plans for a flexible ridesharing scheme, for different objectives. In a flexible scheme, some drivers are willing to leave their cars and become passengers of other drivers. We consider objectives to improve access (maximising served passengers), reduce emissions and congestion (minimising total distance), and to sustain the long-term viability of the system (maximising served users). In the studied scheme, riders reach a meeting point and are picked-up along the intended routes of the drivers. We show that when drivers can change roles and become passengers, a state-of-the-art solver is not able to solve quickly ridesharing schemes optimizing for global sustainable objectives. To handle this issue, we introduce new spatio-temporal constraints, based on the notion of time-consistent sets of riders, from which we derive new logical rules and routing properties. We encode the new properties and the derived logical rules within new ridesharing problem formulations. We show that solving the introduced formulations encoding the routing properties and the logical rules are up to one order of magnitude faster than the basic model, and that even for the larger instances with 1000s of users, achieves results within 2% and 5% of the optimal value within a time limit of 300 seconds. Our study also shows the interaction between the different objectives and to which extent satisfying one objective also satisfies other objectives. This study demonstrates that the introduced method that integrates spatio-temporal constraints encoding the drivers’ shared paths using logical rules within ridesharing problem formulations, help to solve faster, larger ridesharing schemes satisfying various global sustainable objectives. The methods developed in this study are of particular interest to developers and researchers interesting in reformulation techniques using logical rules to speed-up the solving of real world applications. The outcomes of this study will also benefit a variety of stakeholders (users, companies, public institutes) that aim at offering or maintaining ridesharing schemes as a sustainable solutions. © 2019","Compatibility of sustainable objectives; Logical formulation; PDTW; Ride-sharing; Spatiotemporal constraints reformulation","Encoding (symbols); Signal encoding; Traffic congestion; Compatibility of sustainable objectives; Logical formulation; PDTW; Ride-sharing; Spatio-temporal constraints; Constraint satisfaction problems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072773283

Such features, coupled with a strong sensitivity to the environment, originate the interest in bringing together these two nanomaterials in order to combine their complementary properties. In this work, the investigation of a solid-phase composite of CDs deposited on Gr is reported. The CD emission efficiency is reduced by the contact of Gr. At the same time, the Raman analysis of Gr demonstrates the increase of Fermi energy when it is in contact with CDs under certain conditions. The interaction between CDs and Gr is modeled in terms of an electron-transfer from photoexcited CDs to Gr, wherein an electron is first transferred from the carbon core to the surface states of CDs, and from there to Gr. There, the accumulated electrons determine a dynamical n-doping effect modulated by photoexcitation. The CD–graphene interaction unveiled herein is a step forward in the understanding of the mutual influence between carbon-based nanomaterials, with potential prospects in light conversion applications. © 2020 by the authors.

Under CO2 limited conditions, C. reinhardtii cells display a wide range of adaptive responses including changes in photosynthetic electron transport, mitochondria localization in the cells, the structure of the pyrenoid starch sheath, and primary metabolism. In addition to these functional and structural changes, gene and protein expression are also affected. Several physiological aspects of the CO2 response mechanism have been studied in detail. However, the regulatory components (transcription factors and transcriptional regulators) involved in this process are not fully characterized. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of the C. reinhardtii nuclear proteome using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). The study aims to identify the proteins that govern adaptation to varying CO2 concentrations in Chlamydomonas.

Using this approach, we identified 1378 proteins in total, including 90 putative transcription factors and 27 transcriptional regulators.

Forestation projects have garnered wide public support, and research has focused principally on how soil C storage is affected. Nevertheless, our mechanistic understanding of how forestation, particularly with exotic woody species, affects ecosystem processes is not well understood. We took advantage of a land-use change in Patagonia, Argentina, that involved the simultaneous planting of a single conifer species (Pinus ponderosa) along a broad precipitation gradient [250–2200 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP)], replacing natural ecosystems from semi-arid steppe to broadleaf forest. Comparing C fluxes and stocks in five paired natural and planted forest sites during three consecutive years demonstrated that aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was consistently greater in forested areas along the gradient, while litter decomposition markedly decreased. Dramatic increases in leaf litter detritus, coupled with increased aboveground woody biomass, contributed to identical levels of C accumulation in pine plantations from 250 mm to 1350 mm MAP, without significantly detectable differences in surface soil C. The replacement of intact forest in the most humid site resulted in large decreases in vegetation C pools. The implications for ecosystem C cycling suggest that inhibition of C turnover, along with the aboveground woody growth, are key variables contributing to the observed patterns of C accumulation from exotic pine forestation along this precipitation gradient. Given the transient nature of these C stocks, vulnerable to loss as CO2 due to climatic or anthropogenic disturbances, these changes may not contribute to long-term C sequestration in these ecosystems. The conversion of natural ecosystems as a management tool for C mitigation should include a consideration of the realized sequestration potential but also the unintended consequences for changes in both C inputs and C turnover that determine the ecosystem C balance, as well as potential effects on biodiversity and long-term ecosystem functioning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; Land-use change; Litter decomposition; Pinus ponderosa; Precipitation gradient; Semi-arid ecosystems; Southern temperate forest","Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Land use; Reforestation; Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; Land-use change; Litter decomposition; Pinus ponderosa; Precipitation gradients; Semi-arid ecosystems; Temperate forests; Ecosystems; carbon; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coniferous forest; decomposition; environmental gradient; human activity; invasive species; land use change; litter; precipitation assessment; semiarid region; temperate forest; terrestrial ecosystem; wood; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystems; Land Use; Pinus Ponderosa; Reforestation; Argentina; Patagonia; Coniferophyta; Pinus ponderosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078457772

The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy has the potential to contribute significantly to the goals of the Paris Agreement (2015), particularly in the developing world. The recent evolution of total installed capacity of electricity mix in eight South American countries and the current renewable energy policy is considered. Indications of an energy paradox are seen: the installed share of thermal capacity increases as energy demand grows, decreasing the share of renewable energy despite the government's stated policy and commitment to increasing renewables in electricity generation through incentives and regulations. The share of installed hydro compared to thermal generation declined from 2007 to 2017 in Chile, Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. Furthermore, South American countries are unlikely to reach the aforementioned share of renewables in the energy matrix, with the exception of Uruguay. Thus, organic growth of renewables may not be enough in a region with high potential and a long history of low emissions from electricity. It may be necessary for governments to more actively prioritize, regulate, and support inclusive subsidies for both public and private investors in the electricity sector to reduce the risk of climate change and achieve greenhouse gas reduction goals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy paradox; Energy policy; Greenhouse emission; Renewable energy sources; South America; Thermal sources","Developing countries; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Privatization; Renewable energy resources; Energy paradox; Greenhouse emissions; Renewable energy source; South America; Thermal source; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075978376

Unstable climate during the planting period affected onion (Allium cepa L.) yield in Hokkaido, where the production shares more than 60% in Japan. In the Hokkaido production regions, onion seedlings are usually planted from late April to early May and onion bulbs are harvested from late August to mid-September. Before planting seedlings, the soil is tilled by a vertical harrow and up-cut rotary to crush finely for a smooth mechanical planting. The variation in onion yield was recorded in the recent 16 years with a coefficient of the variation of 18% in Iwamizawa area, one of the production areas in Hokkaido. Continuous rainfall from late April to mid-May led to the delay of planting operation because field machinery could not operate in wet soil, causing a delay of early growth and yield reduction in 2009, 2011 and 2013. Conversely, seedling growth was suppressed by low rainfall in 2014. Set cultivation, a planting system of small bulbs instead of seedling, began to be examined for obtaining standard yield even in unstable climate. This study evaluated the effect of soil moisture on onion ('Kitamomiji 2000') growth using two types of onion establishment methods, seedlings and sets. Both onion types were cultivated in Wagner pots with 3 ranges of soil moisture based on pF values, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.4. Onion plants emerged from sets had a higher number of expanded leaves and leaf length and increased bulb weight in every pF value as compared to seedlings. However, their leaf growth in dry soil (pF 2.4) was smaller than those in the soil with pF 2.0 and 1.6 in set cultivation. Set is an alternative nursery for the establishment of early growth in onion. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

In particular, communication to the commuters about the traffic ahead or occurrences of congestion has been envisioned to play a major role in outsmarting traffic through mobile applications giving rise to the emergence of the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT). However, the existing mobile applications that serve as traffic reporting solutions still face major issues such as fixed route suggestions, longer delays during busy hours or emergencies, inefficient prompting of road accidents and heavy traffic en route to a particular destination. This research aims at providing solutions for notifying the commuters with updates on the traffic based upon the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the routes towards the destination and also about the approach of emergency vehicles. The cross-platform mobile application in this way enables the user to opt for a route with good air quality so that the more congested routes are avoided thereby mitigating the air pollution induced by road traffic. The experimental testing and validation of the proposed methodology are applied for areas belonging to Greater Kuala Lumpur. The various timings divided according to peak and non-peak hours are experimentally tested for analyzing the parameters of traffic usage and pattern through the mobile application. The outcome of the experiments has showed that when traffic flow is modelled and governed through vehicular emissions and concentrations of air pollutants, nearly 75% of the congested traffic is reduced thereby, giving rise to pollution-free environment as well as mitigation of urban heat island (UHI) effect that is formed through vehicular heat generation and difference in temperatures. On the other hand, the approach of emergency vehicles also prompts the commuters to avoid panic. © 2020 ACM.","Air pollution; Air quality index; Internet of Things and traffic congestion; Road transportation","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Emergency vehicles; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Pollution control; Roads and streets; Air quality indices; Environmental pollutions; Experimental testing; Internet of thing (IOT); Mobile applications; Technological advancement; Transportation system; Vehicular emission; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092185172

Normally, the first 100 h are decisive for perceiving the risk in a more realistic dimension, but the support of methodologies that rely on computational simulations can be valuable when making key decisions. This work seeks to provide support for the early decision-making process by using a Gaussian model for the distribution of a quantity of Cs-137 spread by a radiological dispersive device (RDD). By sequentially joining two independent programs, HotSpot Health Physics codes and RESidual RADiation (RESRAD)-RDD family of codes, we came up with results that suggest a segmented approach to the potentially affected population. These results advocate that (a) the atmospheric stability conditions represented by the Pasquill-Gifford classes and (b) the population subgroups defined by radiation exposure conditions strongly influence the postdetonation radiological effects. These variables should be taken into account in the elaboration of flexible strategies that include many climatic conditions and to priori-tize attention to different groups of public at risk. During the initial phases of such an event, it is believed that simulations using Gaussian models may be of value in anticipating the possible changes in key variables during the decision-making process. These variables may severely affect the effectiveness of the actions of responders and the general public's safety. © 2020 Edson R.

One inconvenience in MoD-EV systems is the need of some customers to perform in-routing charging, which may cause delays in the trip time. Moreover, the customer choice of which station to charge at is an operational issue for the MoD-EV service operator due to the different pricing for the charging at different stations. Given a connected system, we propose a routing scheme that aims to reduce these inconveniences for both customers and the operator. By modeling the routing problem between multiple MoD-EV stations as a multi-server queuing system, we formulate the joint problem of minimizing the average trip time for all customers and the average cost of charging as a dual-objective convex optimization problem. Single and multiple servers per charging stations are considered. Optimal routing decisions are derived analytically for any arbitrary weighting of the two problem objectives and simulation results show the significant merits of our proposed solution as compared to shortest time and random routing decisions. They also illustrate the trade-offs between the two objectives. © 2016 IEEE.","charging; Electric vehicles; mobility-on-demand (MoD); routing; smart cities","Charging (furnace); Convex optimization; Economic and social effects; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Network routing; Sales; Smart city; Urban transportation; Arbitrary weighting; Convex optimization problems; Cost optimization; Global carbon emission; On demands; Operational issues; Routing; Urban transportation systems; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082631462

In order to extract it, a cross-correlation with gravitational tracers of matter in the Universe has been shown to be a promising tool. We report here the first identification of a cross-correlation signal between γ rays and the distribution of mass in the Universe probed by weak gravitational lensing. We use data from the Dark Energy Survey Y1 weak lensing data and the Fermi Large Area Telescope 9-yr γ-ray data, obtaining a signal-to-noise ratio of 5.3. The signal is mostly localized at small angular scales and high γ-ray energies, with a hint of correlation at extended separation. Blazar emission is likely the origin of the small-scale effect. We investigate implications of the large-scale component in terms of astrophysical sources and particle dark matter emission. © 2020 authors.

The present study was designed to decipher the impacts of the climate change on the farming communities residing in the rain-fed areas of Pakistan. For this purpose, 475 households were surveyed through a pre-tested structured questionnaire to know farmers’ perceptions about climate change and its impacts; available sources of information and strategies adopted to cope with climate-related events. The results indicated that 96% of the respondents perceive that the climate in their surroundings is not only changing rather aggressively denting on crop productivity, livestock sustenance and human health. These climatic variations are being realized in the form of rising temperature (61%), irregular pattern of precipitation (86%) hailstorm (73%), delay in the start of winter season (71%), incidents of the cold breeze (67%) and heat waves (65%), storms (64%), frost (59%) and an increase in the occurrences of drought conditions (39%). This factor by and large tantamount the overall depression in the rain-fed farming community pressing them to look for the alternative avenues for their livelihood. Nevertheless, the farmers rely on different adaptation strategies (changing planting decisions: 76%, changing cropping pattern: 46%, left land fallow: 24% etc.), but these are insufficient and less effective. In conclusion, only few farmers could adapted their agricultural strategies to changing climate due to limited resources and capacities and majority is vulnerable Therefore, the scenario demands for integrated technical, financial and institutional support to the farmers. This upcoming alarming situation requires potential measures be taken to ensure resilience of agriculture sector that may ultimate poverty reduction. © 2020, University of Agriculture.

Arid regions, especially calcareous sandy soil, where high rates of organic matter decomposition led carbon emission to increase, are poor in their content of organic matter and some nutrients as well as high phosphorus fixation in this soil. The objectives of this study were investigating effects of bagasse pith-vinasse biochar and incubation periods on: carbon (C) sequestration, carbon mineralization, and nutrients availability of calcareous sandy soil. The incubation experiment included four treatments: (1) unamended soil (control), (2) soil amended with 3% (w/w) bagasse pith-vinasse (BPV), (3) soil amended with 3% (w/w) biochar of bagasse pith-vinasse (BPVB), and (4) soil amended with 3% (w/w) BPV + BPVB (1:1) and incubated at 3, 7, 21 and 46 days. The results of this study revealed a decline in carbon emission with adding BPVB compared to BPV and BPV + BPVB this in turn leads to enhancing carbon sequestration. Available phosphorus improved significantly with adding bagasse pith-vinasse biochar compared with unamended soil. Phosphorus availability increases with increasing incubating durations for bagasse pith-vinasse biochar. At the end of the incubation, the phosphorus availability increased from 20.08 mg kg−1 soil for control to 20.36, 35.25, and 20.63 mg kg−1 soil for BPV, BPVB and BPV + BPVB, respectively. Moreover, potassium availability showed a significant improvement with BPVB application compared with unamended soil. We recommend adding biochar to low fertility soil because it plays an important role in the environmental management via improving soil fertility, local waste management, and climate change mitigation. © 2019, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.","Available phosphorus; Available potassium; Dissolved organic carbon; Emission CO2; Incubation periods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075914733

Here we evaluate the main water sources used by plants at the global scale and the effect of climate and plant groups on water uptake variability and depth distribution. The global meta-analysis is based on isotope data (δ2H and δ18O) extracted from 65 peer-reviewed papers published between 1990 and 2017. We applied a new direct inference method to quantify the overlap between xylem water and soil water sources used by plants. The median overlap between xylem water and soil water at different depths varied between 28% and 100%, but they were generally &gt;50%. The shallow (0-10 cm) soil water overlap with xylem water was largest in cold regions (100% ± 0%) and lowest at tropical sites (about 28%). Conversely, the median overlap between xylem water and deep soil water was largest in the arid and the tropical zones (&gt;75%) and much smaller in the temperate and cold zones. Our results suggest that the isotopic composition of xylem water reflects mostly the signature of shallow soil water (&lt;30 cm) in the cold and the temperate zones, whereas in the arid and the tropical zones, plants appear to exploit water in deeper soil layers.

This requires sustainable approaches and strategies when planning urban land use for our cities as the basis for the distribution of activities and services in the city and can be considered as the basis for the sustainability of the city. The mixed use strategy is one of the sustainability strategies. It has been adopted in our research and an equation Lum has been adopted in measuring the sustainability of the study area of the Holy City of Karbala. This equation is a measure of the extent to which uses compete with residential use, which is dominant in residential neighborhoods. This equation suggests five cases of sustainability (very unsustainable, unsustainable, low sustainability, sustainable, very sustainable). The important conclusion are 3% of the neighbourhoods are very unsustainable neighbourhood, 14% of the neighborhoods are unsustainable, 48% of the neighborhoods are Low sustainability, 34% of the neighborhoods are sustainable, 1.5% of the neighbourhoods are very sustainable. The main recommendations are to adopt a mixed use strategy in the future master plans in the planning of residential neighborhoods in the holy city of Karbala to reduce the time, distance and cost of trips by reducing the distance between uses to achieve the principles of sustainability in all its aspects (environmental, economic and social), relying on walking within neighborhoods for residents, reducing air pollution and noise by reducing the use of vehicles within neighborhoods. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082040066

We analyzed the variability in the expression of marker genes involved in ecologically relevant biogeochemical processes at a temperate Atlantic site over two consecutive years. Most of nifH transcripts, involved in nitrogen (N) fixation, were affiliated with the symbiotic cyanobacterium Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa, suggesting a key role as N providers in this system. The expression of nifH and amoA (i.e., marker for ammonia oxidation) showed consistent maxima in summer and autumn, respectively, suggesting a temporal succession of these important N cycling processes. The patterns of expression of genes related to the oxidation of carbon monoxide (coxL) and reduced sulfur (soxB) were different from that of amoA, indicating alternate timings for these energy conservation strategies. We detected expression of alkaline phosphatases, induced under phosphorus limitation, in agreement with the reported co-limitation by this nutrient at the study site. In contrast, low-affinity phosphate membrane transporters (pit) typically expressed under phosphorus luxury conditions, were mainly detected in post-bloom conditions. Rhodobacteraceae dominated the expression of soxB, coxL and ureases, while Pelagibacteraceae dominated the expression of proteorhodopsins. Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria were major contributors to the uptake of inorganic nutrients (pit and amt transporters). Yet, in autumn, Thauma- and Euryarchaeota unexpectedly contributed importantly to the uptake of ammonia and phosphate, respectively. We provide new hints on the active players and potential dynamics of ecologically relevant functions in situ, highlighting the potential of metatranscriptomics to provide significant input to future omics-driven marine ecosystem assessment. © Copyright © 2020 Alonso-Sáez, Morán and González.","bacterioplankton; coastal; functional marker genes; gene expression; metatranscriptomics","carbon monoxide; chlorophyll a; phosphate; phosphorus; sulfur; Article; Bacteroidetes; bioinformatics; controlled study; energy conservation; Gammaproteobacteria; gene expression; gene sequence; marine bacterium; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial gene; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; RNA analysis; RNA processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083055065

A major part of this pollution is due to emissions from vehicles. Intersections are considered as critical elements of road regarding the high level of air pollution which is due to the slow down and stop operations. Thus, the combustion of fuel is increased negatively as intersection compared with other types of road elements. The key focus of this paper is to estimate the negative impact of traffic congestion by calculating the quantities of gases emitted during the traffic congestion at the signaled intersection in Baghdad city. The traffic flow data was obtained by video recording of the study area. From these videos, data was analyzed by using Signalized and Un-signalized Intersection Design and Research Aid (SIDRA 8.0.) software. The selected emissions of HC, CO, NOX, and CO2 in (kg/hr) are based on delay and LOS computation at the signalized intersection.

However, the absence of reliable estimates of the usual streamflow descriptors, at the considered time horizons, renders common input–output modeling approaches inapt for extended forecasting. For such a problem, system recurrence information is vital to produce relatively improved forecasts. Like any time series generated by complex systems, river flow can be represented by a time-varying parameter (TVP) model. TVP modeling frameworks often assume that the system evolution exhibits superstatistical random walks, and a number of statistical assumptions is followed upon, to infer better forecasts from the system. Also, the TVPs should hone a model's ability to capture system recurrence, which in this case translates to a number of state-based model structures. In this work, we develop an ensemble-based computationally efficient method that extracts useful cyclic-type TVPs which are strongly coupled over extended, but more continuous and less aggregated, time horizons. A multi-level modeling framework is proposed to facilitate the creation and direct use of updated parameter states to produce more reliable forecasts on the considered temporal resolutions. A dummy-variable optimization technique is also proposed within the state-updating procedure to allow smooth state transition. We show that the modeling framework produces stable results of parameter variations at different time horizons when applied to estimate the streamflow of Clearwater River. The proposed framework can incorporate exogenous descriptors at different levels without loss of generality and can be used for various forecasting applications. © 2019","Dummy variable optimization; Ensemble Learning; Multi-level modeling; Streamflow forecasting; System Identification; Time-varying paramter (TVP)","Identification (control systems); Model structures; Stream flow; Dummy variables; Ensemble learning; Multilevel model; Streamflow forecasting; Time varying; Forecasting; climate change; flood control; flood damage; forecasting method; mitigation; optimization; parameterization; river flow; streamflow; temporal analysis; time series analysis; Clearwater River [Idaho]; Idaho; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077311836

The data obtained from the five fractions indicated that the concentration of metals varies among different locations in the study area. The total metal concentrations (%) in the exchangeable (F1), carbonate (F2), reducible (F3) and organic-bound (F4) fractions were measured to determine the mobility of each studied metal. The sum of the two fractions F3 and F4 represented 70% of the Cu, 72% of the Zn and 36% of the Pb. However, the sum of the three fractions F2, F3 and F4 represented 76%, 74%, 68% and 58% of the Cd, Ni, Fe and Mn, respectively. Approximately 46% of the total copper was related to organics, which could reflect a high mobility of copper in these sediments. The maximum mobility of metals in the sediments was confirmed by the bioavailability factor (BF), which was within the ranges of 0.47–0.93, 0.34–0.92, 0.62–0.95, 0.69–0.95, 0.24–0.82, 0.54–0.98, and 0.60–0.95 for Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni, respectively. Based on the BF, the metals exhibited the following order: Cu ≈ Zn &gt; Cd ≈ Ni ≈ Fe &gt; Mn &gt; Pb. The high levels of BF for the studied metals could reflect the potential for toxic metals to be easily released into the marine environment. The risk assessment code for Cd showed a medium risk in five sediment samples of the northern and southern regions and a high risk to the aquatic environment in the other sediment samples.

The methodology goes beyond “conventional” energy systems modelling, where the electricity grid is usually represented as a copper plate. The results show that within a climate policy scenario, the grid investment needs reach 454b$ for 2010–2080 as regions with high share of VREs require new interconnections. The role of the transmission grid in reducing variable system costs and VREs curtailment is also assessed.

Quantification of forest carbon has gained momentum after Paris Agreement in 2015. This information is a prerequisite for REDD+ implementation and carbon trading. Temperate and subtropical mountain systems of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province host about one third of Pakistan’s 4.51 million ha forests. Present study estimated forest carbon stocks in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The data was collected from 449 sites in different forests across the province using a stratified cluster sampling technique. Total carbon stock in the forests of the province was estimated at 144.71 million tons with an average of 127.66 ± 9.32 t/ha. Aboveground carbon stock was 68.15 million tons accounting for 48% of the total forest carbon stock of the province. Further, belowground biomass and litter accounted for 10% and 1% respectively. The mean aboveground carbon stock was 59.98 ± 4.26 t/ha. The highest aboveground carbon stock was found in dry temperate forests (99.41 t/ha) followed by moist temperate (85.04 t/ha). Overall, temperate forests have aboveground carbon stock of 90.52 t/ha. Temperate and subtropical forests of Pakistan with high carbon densities have ample potential for reducing forest sector emissions. Therefore, forests of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province having substantial carbon stocks must be conserved for climate change mitigation.

Environmental and climatic factors are relevant for the development, survival, and transmission of coccidiosis because Eimeria oocysts are able to survive in the environment for several weeks or months in favorable conditions of moderate heat and moisture. The aim of the present study was to georeference, for the first time, the locations of Eimeria occurrences in Mexico from 1961 to 2018. A dataset was created for 3414 reports of Eimeria occurrences in cattle, sheep, and goats in Mexico. Twelve species of Eimeria that infect cattle were recorded, 11 Eimeria species of sheep are present in Mexico, and eight species of goats are geographically distributed in the country. In the current findings, it has been observed that Eimeria colonizes mainly the temperate semihumid, temperate humid, warm humid, and warm semihumid areas during spring and summer in animals younger than 1 year of age. Macroenvironmental variables like temperature and rainfall influence the prevalence of Eimeria in cattle, sheep, and goats, and for some species, the rearing system, facility type, farm size, and altitude affect the occurrence of this parasite. Results may support future studies aimed at reducing the disease prevalence of the parasite in endemic regions of Mexico. The use of recorded cases and climate variables yields a more comprehensive perspective of the epidemiology of eimeriosis, which would be difficult to infer from laboratory studies alone. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cattle; Coccidiosis; Eimeria; Goats; Occurrences; Sheep","altitude; Article; bovine; climate; coccidiosis; data base; Eimeria; Eimeria ahsata; Eimeria alabamensis; Eimeria alijevi; Eimeria arloingi; Eimeria auburnensis; Eimeria bakuensis; Eimeria bovis; Eimeria brasiliensis; Eimeria bukidnonensis; Eimeria canadensis; Eimeria caprina; Eimeria caprovina; Eimeria christenseni; Eimeria crandallis; Eimeria cylindrica; Eimeria ellipsoidalis; Eimeria faurei; Eimeria granulosa; Eimeria hirci; Eimeria intricata; Eimeria jolchijevi; Eimeria marsica; Eimeria ninakohlyakimovae; Eimeria ovinoidalis; Eimeria pallida; Eimeria parva; Eimeria pellita; Eimeria subspherica; Eimeria weybridgensis; Eimeria wyomingensis; Eimeria zuernii; falling; goat; latitude; longitude; Mexico; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; sheep; species distribution; spring; summer; temperature; winter; animal; cattle disease; classification; coccidiosis; Eimeria; isolation and purification; parasitology; season; sheep disease; veterinary medicine; Animals; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Climate; Coccidiosis; Eimeria; Goats; Mexico; Seasons; Sheep; Sheep Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077626668

This reciprocal interaction is established by the portal vein which enables transport of gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feedback route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintaining homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of this bidirectional communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut microbiome, mucus barrier, epithelial barrier and at the level of antimicrobial peptide production, which increases microbial exposure and the proinflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidence indicates the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile acids, short-chain fatty acids and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated with profound alterations in gut microbiota and damage at the different levels of defence of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, vascular and immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities for intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centred on the gut include new generations of probiotics, bacterial metabolites (postbiotics), faecal microbial transplantation, and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new therapeutic approaches. © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver","Bile; Cirrhosis; Farnesoid X receptor; Intestinal barrier; Microbiome","ammonia; bile acid; farnesoid X receptor; polymer; probiotic agent; alcohol consumption; alcohol liver disease; bacteriophage; bile flow; fecal microbiota transplantation; human; hydrogel; immune system; intestine content; intestine epithelium; intestine flora; liver cirrhosis; liver disease; mucus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; Review; signal transduction; alcohol liver disease; animal; dysbiosis; intestine mucosa; liver; liver cirrhosis; metabolism; microbiology; molecularly targeted therapy; nonalcoholic fatty liver; procedures; Animals; Dysbiosis; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077708372

The performance of a chiller cooling system declines when operating away from the optimal design conditions, which is typically 75% of chiller capacity. One pathway has been found to overcome this problem using multiple smaller chillers within the same chiller plant, accompanied by a smart control system that is designed and constructed based on the cooling demand profile. Thermal energy storage integration with chiller cooling system is proposed to shave the cooling peak demand. This can be achieved by storing chilled water during the lower electricity-tariff period by the thermal energy storage system, which will then be discharged during the higher tariff-rate, thus, aiming for sustainable operating cost. The present paper studies the feasibility of sensible thermal energy storage to be integrated with two chillers, of 30-ton capacity each, under hot-and-humid climates. A computational model validated with experimental results is developed for three chiller cooling system case scenarios. The smart control scenario, as well as the thermal energy storage scenario results, showed great potential for energy and electricity cost saving. In addition, the carbon dioxide emissions reduction is calculated based on the amount of energy saving. © 2020, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

In this paper we evaluate a policy drafted in the Netherlands to close all its remaining coal-fired plants by 2030, which is well before the end of their technical and economic life spans. This plan is part of a package to reduce CO2 emissions with 25% by 2020 and 49% by 2030 in comparison to 1990. Under Dutch policy, all measures taken must meet three goals: CO2 emission reduction, cost-effectiveness and societal support. We will show that existing EU legal frameworks limit the effectiveness of the closure, because they allow for carbon leakage and lack a coordinated European strategy on the coal phase out, even though several EU member states have formulated similar plans. There is also no definitive answer as to whether the coal phase out is cost-effective. Dutch government will have to decide what the parameters of ‘cost-effective’ are. So far, the plan enjoys societal support. It is up to the Dutch government to decide what balance between CO2 emissions, costs and societal support is best. For further action, we recommend an EU strategy on the coal-phase out, in order to coordinate and to prevent carbon leakages. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Interdisciplinary policy analysis; Regulation; Renewable energy; Sustainability","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Emission control; Plant shutdowns; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Policy analysis; Regulation; Renewable energies; Economic and social effects; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; interdisciplinary approach; policy analysis; regulatory framework; sustainability; Netherlands",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078208279

However, as global temperatures rise, established climate ranges may no longer be applicable, as historic records for extremes such as heat waves and floods may no longer accurately predict the changing future climate. To assess extremes (present-day and future) over the contiguous United States, we used NOAA's Climate Extremes Index (CEI), which evaluates extremes in maximum and minimum temperature, extreme one-day precipitation, days without precipitation, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The CEI is a spatially sensitive index that uses percentile-based thresholds rather than absolute values to determine climate “extremeness” and is thus well-suited to compare extreme climate across regions. We used regional climate model data from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) to compare a late 20th century reference period to a mid-21st century “business as usual” (SRES A2) greenhouse gas-forcing scenario. Results show a universal increase in extreme hot temperatures across all models, with annual average maximum and minimum temperatures exceeding 90th percentile thresholds consistently across the continental United States. Results for precipitation indicators have greater spatial variability from model to model, but indicate an overall movement towards less frequent but more extreme precipitation days in the future. Due to this difference in response between temperature and precipitation, the mid-21st century CEI is primarily an index of temperature extremes, with 90th percentile temperatures contributing disproportionately to the overall increase in climate extremeness. We also examine the efficacy of the PDSI in this context in comparison to other drought indices. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","climate extremes; extreme events; indices; NARCCAP","Climate models; Disasters; Drought; Greenhouse gases; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Climate extremes; Extreme events; indices; Maximum and minimum temperatures; NARCCAP; Palmer drought severity indices; Regional climate changes; Regional climate modeling; Climate change; climate change; drought; environmental assessment; extreme event; regional climate; risk assessment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074166270

This study has examined the relationship among diversified remote sensing and GIS datasets such as GHG emission from cropland, rice cultivation area, agro-ecological region, Land use/ Land cover (LULC) categories, long-term NDVI (1982-2006) based negative changes, agriculture vulnerability, drought-prone area and future (2021, 2050) climate change anomalies (RCP-6) of India for better understanding and knowledge of the GHG emission scenario, vegetation health, LULC, agriculture vulnerability, and future climate change impact. The LULC analysis revealed that 49.6% (1 628 959 km2) of the geographical area was found to be under category 'cropland'. The 32.5% of the total cropland areas are used for rice cultivation whereas around 76% of this rice cultivation area is producing high GHG emission (&gt;1000 Mg CO2e/yr.). LULC categories 'Cropland' and 'Plantation' show the long-term (1982-2006) negative change equivalent to 19.7 and 70.2% respectively. Similarly, around 56% of LULC categories representing the forest show the long-term negative change whereas the maximum change (139 867 km2) was found in the category of 'Deciduous Broadleaf Forest'. The 30.6% of the LULC category of 'cropland' falls in very high agriculture vulnerable areas whereas 31.7% of the same category falls in the drought-prone area. The significant increase in temperature and abrupt rainfall patterns were observed during Kharif and Rabi seasons in the future. Such variation of climate parameter in the future not only adversely affect the agriculture crop production but also the natural vegetation of India. The outcomes of the present study would support the policymakers of India to implement the climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and REDD+ on an urgent priority based on a proper evaluation of the socio-economic condition of the poor people. It will certainly help in the reduction of GHG emission, forest amelioration, will bring the resilience in livelihood and mitigate the poverty among the rural communities for the betterment of people. © 2020 Sciendo.

A previous analysis of the environmental regulation of this system is extended here by considering complementary oceanographic information (sea level, stratification indexes) and additional reproductive traits, such as maximum (MaxEPR), median (MedianEPR) and prevalence of egg producing females over a period of six months. Furthermore, field minimum-maximum pH levels were reproduced in three 96-h incubation experiments conducted under variable salinity conditions to evaluate copepod mean EPR, egg size and hatching success. Supporting previous assertions, the warm-high salinity EN 2015 was observed in the study site separately from hydrographic conditions associated with upwelling to non-upwelling regimes. Analysis of similarity-distance (Distance based Linear Model (DistLM)) and normalized data (separate-slope comparison under a General Linear Model (GLM)) showed that reproductive traits were regulated by specific combinations of ambient conditions, and that this regulation was also sensitive to the prevailing hydrographic regime. Thus, upwelling to non-upwelling transitions changing the pH, and EN-associated salinity and stratification shifts, were significantly and strongly linked to almost all reproductive traits (DistLM). Slope comparison (GLM) indicated MaxEPR and MedianEPR variations also underlie the phenology, highlighting the relationship between pH and salinity with biological variations. In conjunction with experimental observations, the current study consistently suggests that pH-variations in the upwelling realm, and EN hydrographic perturbations might underpin responses of plankton populations to climate change in productive EBUS. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Eastern boundary upwelling systems; Inter-annual variations; Intra-seasonal variations; Ocean acidification; Zooplankton physiology","crustacean; egg size; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; hatching; hydrography; incubation; pH; reproductive success; upwelling; California; Humboldt Bay; United States; Acartia tonsa; Copepoda; Crustacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079670427

Since at a global scale there is an important number of people exposed to this pollutant, studies have focused on evaluating its possible effects on human population. Aburrá Valley Metropolitan Area (AMVA), in Antioquia-Colombia, is a region with about 3,909,729 inhabitants (2018), where 79% of PM2.5 present in the atmosphere is emitted by motor vehicles, with 1534 ton/year (AMVA, 2018). In the last decade, monitoring stations have reached daily mean concentrations of 113 μg/m3, which is 226% in excess of the maximum permissible daily level established at 50 μg/m3 by Colombian regulations (AMVA 2016; MinAmbiente, 2017). The object of the study was to evaluate the impact of PM2.5 concentrations in cases of premature mortality of urban population. To this end, the BenMap-CE v.1.1 model was used, together with Krewski et al. (2009) Health Impact functions to evaluate associations with adult mortality (&gt;30 years of age) due to All Causes (AC)—including natural and non-natural—(ICD-10: A00-Y98), Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) (ICD-10: I20–I25) and LungCancer (LC) (ICD-10: C34); and Woodruff et al. (2006) functions to explore associations with child mortality (population 0–1 year of age) due to All Causes (AC)—including natural and non-natural. Health impact was evaluated for year 2016 (baseline) and estimated for 2020 and 2030, from annual mean concentrations reported and projected by the environmental authority. The study was carried out based on annual mean mortality rates reported for the period 2007–2016. Among the most relevant results, it was found that for 2016 the areas with the highest annual concentrations of PM2.5 were Medellín (downtown area), Caldas, and Medellín (northern area) (39.4 μg/m3, 33.7 μg/m3, and 33.2 μg/m3, respectively). Consequently, health impact estimations (mortality due to all causes in adults) showed the highest associations: 15.70% (676 cases; CI: 470.29–873.06), 12.90% (32 cases; CI: 22.04–41.34) and 12.63% (736 cases; CI: 508.65–954.76), respectively. For the Aburrá Valley Metropolitan Area in 2016, it was found that death cases attributable to PM2.5 levels were: 1971 cases (CI: 1362.96–2558.62) for adult mortality due to AC, 194 cases (CI: 92.04–284.17) due to LC and 932 cases (CI: 791.33–1063.56), figures comparatively lower than the estimates for 2030, where death cases attributable to the same pollutant were: 5867 cases (CI: 4190.12–7410.53) for adult mortality due to AC, 497 cases (CI: 265.47–666.77) due to LC and 2415 cases (CI: 2157.06–2632.99). These values were calculated from the sum of the estimations given by the BenMap model for each municipality in the Metropolitan Area. Finally, avoidable death cases were calculated for a scenario with the implementation and execution of 100% of the measures for the prevention and control of emissions from motor vehicles, as defined by the Integral Plan for Air Quality Management (PIGECA, AMVA, 2017a) for year 2030: 55.93% of infant mortality cases due to AC; 50.32% in adults due to AC; 55.73% in adults due to LC and 60.87% in adults due to IHD associated with PM2.5. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aburrá Valley; Atmospheric pollution; BenMAP; Colombia; Health impact functions; PM2.5","Air quality; Function evaluation; Health; Landforms; Quality management; Tropics; Atmospheric pollution; BenMAP; Colombia; Health impact; PM2.5; Quality control; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; child mortality; concentration (composition); health impact; metropolitan area; mortality; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; public health; urbanization; air monitoring; air pollution; all cause mortality; ambient air; American; Article; childhood mortality; controlled study; human; incidence; ischemic heart disease; long term exposure; mortality; mortality rate; particulate matter; premature mortality; priority journal; tropics; urban population; Aburra Valley; Antioquia [Colombia]; Caldas; Colombia; Medellin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079664912

The demand for three sectors are taken into account: power, non-energetic industrial gas and seawater desalination. Three strategical scenarios are discussed, namely Region, Area and Integrated, mainly differing in level of regional grid interconnection and sector coupling. Solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind energy are found to be the most cost-competitive RE sources with the highest potential in the region covering more than 90% of the generation capacity in all the considered scenarios. The variability of RE is solved via energy storage, surplus electricity generation and electricity grids. The estimated overall levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) lies between 40.3 and 52.8 €/MWh, depending on the scenarios. The total LCOE decreased by 17% as a result of sector coupling compared to the interconnected power sector alone. Power-to-gas technology not only functions as a seasonal storage by storing surplus electricity produced mainly from wind power and partially from solar PV, but provides also the required gas for the non-energetic industrial gas sector. Battery storage complements solar PV as a diurnal storage to meet the electricity demand during the evening and night time. Seawater reverse osmosis desalination powered by renewables could potentially be a proper solution to overcome the water challenges in the MENA region at affordable cost of 1.4 €/m3. A comparison with a BAU strategy shows that a 100% renewable energy-based power system is 55–69% cheaper than a BAU strategy without and with greenhouse gas emission costs. © 2020","100% renewable energy; Energy system model; Grid interconnection; Large-scale integration of renewable energy; Middle East and North Africa","Desalination; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Reverse osmosis; Seawater; Solar power generation; Wind power; Energy system model; Grid interconnections; Middle East and North Africa; Renewable energies; Scale integration; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080895091

Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration requires countries to ensure that each individual has appropriate access to public environmental information. Kenya has anchored the right to information in its constitution and the 2016 Access to Information Act. However, this legalist approach has left a translation gap since climate change information is availed in a form and language that is largely inaccessible to the public. To address the gap, this study reviewed the effectiveness of dissemination and access to climate change information among Kenyans as a measure of the country's fidelity to the decisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other Multilateral Environmental Agreements, to which it is party. The study, guided by the diffusion of innovations theoretical framework and the encoding/decoding model, adopted a qualitative research design. Desk research and in-depth interviews were used to collect data. Results revealed that the current dissemination practices of climate change information in Kenya were not effectively reaching grassroots communities due to socio-economic and language barriers. The study recommends repackaging the information into vernacular and non-scientific narratives that resonate with the daily experiences of local Kenyan communities. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change governance; Dissemination of climate change information; Environmental communication; Right of access to climate change information","climate change; communication; decision analysis; governance approach; information system; innovation; international agreement; legal system; local participation; questionnaire survey; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082950249

The region has joined the rest of the world on the global strides to mitigate against global warming in terms of decoupling carbon dioxide emissions from economic growth. This is the motivation for the present study to consider the interaction between economic growth, pollutant emissions, coal rent while accounting for the role of other covariates like regulatory quality. The study is conducted in a balanced panel setting over annual frequency data from 1990 to 2014. To this end, Pooled mean group with dynamic autoregressive distributed lag [PMG-ARDL (1,1,1,1,1)] was conducted to explore the coal-rents-energy nexus. The empirical study shows that for BRICS countries, unlike coal consumption, coal rents have a significant but negative impact on CO2 emissions. Also, in contrast to expectation, regulations on coal rents in form of carbon damage costs have a significant but positive impact on CO2 emissions. This suggest that in line with the drive for growth by BRICS countries, and to achieve a reduction in the levels of CO2 emissions for green growth and sustainable development, more stringent environmental-energy-related regulations are inevitable. Thus, for policymakers it is vital to reinforce the use of stringent regulations as these economies opens up to more use of coal energy. However, the need to shift, the energy mix in BRICS to renewables is pertinent in a time of global environmental consciousness for cleaner energy sources and environmentally friendly ecosystem. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","BRICS; CO2 emissions; Coal rents; Energy consumption; Regulatory quality","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Sustainable development; BRICS; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cleaner energies; CO2 emissions; Empirical studies; Environmental energy; Pollutant emission; Stringent regulations; Economics; coal; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal; economic geography; environmental economics; global warming; modeling; regulatory framework; sustainable development; Article; carbon footprint; coal power; economic aspect; economic development; energy consumption; energy resource; green chemistry; greenhouse effect; mathematical model; pollutant; priority journal; renewable energy; sustainable development; Brazil; China; India; Russian Federation; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077400931

This process has a substantial contribution to climate change and biodiversity reduction. Therefore, the monitoring and early detection of deforestation is an essential process for preservation. Techniques based on satellite images are among the most attractive options for this application. However, many approaches involve some human intervention or are dependent on a manually selected threshold to identify regions that suffer deforestation. Motivated by this scenario, the present work evaluates Deep Learning-based strategies for automatic deforestation detection, namely, Early Fusion (EF), Siamese Network (SN), and Convolutional Support Vector Machine (CSVM) as well as Support Vector Machine (SVM), used as the baseline. The target areas are two regions with different deforestation patterns: the Amazon and Cerrado biomes in Brazil. The experiments used two co-registered Landsat 8 images acquired at different dates. The strategies based on Deep Learning achieved the best performance in our analysis in comparison with the baseline, with SN and EF superior to CSVM and SVM. In the same way, a reduction of the salt-and-pepper effect in the generated probabilistic change maps was noticed as the number of training samples increased. Finally, the work assesses how the methods can reduce the time invested in the visual inspection of deforested areas. © 2020 by the authors.","Brazilian biomes; Deep learning; Deforestation detection; Optical imagery","Biodiversity; Climate change; Deforestation; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Biodiversity reductions; Brazilian biomes; Deforestation patterns; Human intervention; Learning techniques; Natural ecosystem; Optical imagery; Remote sensing imagery; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082296085

Many assert that society has exceeded sustainable ecological planetary boundaries and that altered biogeophysical processes are no longer reversible to natural rates of ecosystem functioning. To properly and successfully address societal needs for the future, more holistic and complex methods need to be applied at various spatial and temporal scales. The increasingly interconnected nature of human and natural environments—from individuals to large megacities and entire continents and from cells through ecosystems to the biosphere as a whole (e.g., as seen in the carbon cycle)—demand new and often interdisciplinary and international approaches to address emerging global challenges.

Greening the building sector is feasible through various policy measures and incentives to deal with recycling and waste treatment, reduction in energy use, emissions and the use of other hazardous substances, which have several public and private benefits. The objective of this study is to understand whether or not and by how much would the consumers be willing to pay for green buildings if the information asymmetry is reduced by information provisions of benefits from green buildings. This paper uses a choice experiment to evaluate the firms’ willingness to pay for green-certified office spaces in the Indian city of Bengaluru. The study relied on primary survey data drawn from around 115 firms working in rented office spaces in Bengaluru, who were asked to choose between status quo and different levels of green certification. The Tobit model was used for estimation, and the results show that firms value private benefits like reduction in electricity and water bills, water and waste recycling significantly. The willingness to pay of firms is negatively related to rent of the office space and positively related to annual turnover of the firm and prior knowledge on the green building certification. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Discrete choice experiment; Green building certification; Green buildings; Tobit; Willingness to pay","adaptive management; building; certification; climate change; ecological footprint; emission control; environmental economics; incentive; mitigation; recycling; willingness to pay; Bengaluru; India; Karnataka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054738132

As a result, there has been a failure to take a holistic view of the range of drivers and barriers to CSA implementation. Many aspects of technologies or practices that may encourage or inhibit the implementation of CSA and define its applicability are, therefore, not systematically considered in the design of interventions. The uptake of any practice should depend on both farmers’ characteristics and factors inherent in the practice itself. This paper, therefore, examines procedures for incorporating the applicability of CSA practices in a farm-level analysis based on the investigations conducted in King Cetshwayo District Municipality (KCDM) of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. How the farmers perceived the social, technical, economic, and environmental compatibility of the practices constituted the key goal of the inquiry. Data were collected through structured interviews using close-ended questionnaires, from a sample of 327 small-scale farmers (farmers with farm sizes of less than or equal to 5 hectares). The analysis made use of the Acceptance Level Index (ALI) and Composite Score Index (CSI). This paper establishes that, based on social compatibility, the farmers showed high acceptance for cultivation of cover crops (ALI = 574), agroforestry (ALI = 559), and diet improvement for animals (ALI = 554), based on technical compatibility, the use of organic manure (ALI = 545), rotational cropping (ALI = 529), mulching (ALI = 525) and cultivation of cover crops (ALI = 533) were highly accepted. With economic compatibility in perspective, the farmers showed high preference for mulching (ALI = 541), organic manure (ALI = 542) and rotational cropping (ALI = 515), while the use of organic manure (ALI = 524) was highly embraced based on environmental compatibility. Consequently, it is recommended that policies aimed at mainstreaming CSA technologies should pay adequate attention to their applicability in locations under consideration and emphasize the critical role of the provision of information on CSA technologies or practices. © 2020 by the authors.

Four hundred (400) structured questionnaires was administered and Volumetric traffic count was conducted along seven (7) major junctions across the study area. E. View 8 was adopted for the analysis. Carbon Sensing results depict that Fagge local government area recorded the highest out door CO of 012Ppm. On the other hand, Gwale local government is the top indoor carbon emitters with10Ppm. The field survey indicates that types of land uses, densities and nature of socio-economic activities significantly affect both CO and CO2 in the metropolis. It indicates that Tarauni local Dangi Junction's average daily carbon sensed records is the highest with exactly 19.5 Ppm. Fagge, Dala and Gwale local governments areas precisely record the same of 14 Ppm. The quantitative air quality indicators demonstrate that, the coefficient of determination (R2) reveals that relatively 84% of the changes in the dependent variable (DV) environmental impact was fully captured in the study and therefore changes within the explanatory variables have significant environmental impacts. Traffic count result shows that, Nasarawa local governemnt maintains the most traffic flow with 18957 vehicles records within the study days and the study indicates that interaction of traffic flow in the metropolis significantly increases the air pollution. Recommendation is drawn from the identified issues. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Air Quality; CO emission; Environmental Implication; Kano Metropolis; Traffic count","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Land use; Coefficient of determination; Dependent variables; Environmental implications; Experimental approaches; Explanatory variables; Local government; Local government areas; Quality indicators; Surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083234053

Historical weather data of Fredericton (New Brunswick) and Charlottetown (Prince Edward Island), the two coastal cities of Atlantic Canada, were analyzed using RClimDex, Mann-Kendall test, and Sen's slope estimates for potential scenarios and causes of floods. Flood hazard analyses were conducted using GIS (Geographical Information System) and ArcSWAT software. The watersheds of Fredericton and Charlottetown were delineated from 25 x 25 m resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) of the two cities followed by percent watershed area calculations for different elevation classes for flood generation. Over the past 100 years, there was a significant decreasing trend in the high intensity precipitation in Charlottetown supported by a significant decrease in the number of heavy precipitation days. However, maximum one-day precipitation and maximum five-day precipitation significantly increased in Charlottetown and Fredericton, respectively. Charlottetown received more annual precipitation than Fredericton. In the last 30 years, there was an event exceeding 50mmprecipitation (considered as a threshold for the return period of urban floods) in Charlottetown; Fredericton experienced such events for more than 1.5 times. For twelve times, these events occurred more than once in a year in Charlottetown as compared to fourteen times in Fredericton. Despite statistically proven similarities in the occurrence of extreme events in the two cities, the visualized flood hazards, and the mapping of watershed characteristics, no devastating floods were reported for Charlottetown. This does not necessarily mean that there had never been risks of flooding in Charlottetown. These findings may help policymakers for future developments. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Climate extremes; Flood management; Hydrological regimes","Flood control; Floods; Hazards; Information use; Watersheds; Annual precipitation; Climate extremes; Digital elevation model; Flood management; Historical weather datum; Hydrological regime; Prince edward islands; Watershed characteristics; Climate change; climate change; flood control; flooding; GIS; hydrological regime; mapping method; policy making; return period; risk assessment; watershed; Canada; New Brunswick; Prince Edward Island [Prince Edward Islands]; Prince Edward Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082652595
