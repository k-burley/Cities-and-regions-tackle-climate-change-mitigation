However, it generates huge amounts of off-spec products, and causes negative environmental and social impacts, as well as results in tremendous raw material and energy losses which could be saved to generate much more needed products. Thus, cost-effective start-up flare minimization strategies which is a double-win practice, simultaneously benefiting both the industrial and environmental sustainability, are becoming more and more important and attractive to the industries. The chilling train is a very important section for the ethylene plants and accounts for more than 50% of the total start-up time and flare emissions of the whole ethylene plants. Within this section, the charge gas from the upper stream process is refrigerated to a very low temperature (lower than -160°C) to separate hydrogen and methane. Meanwhile, the left charge gas is liquidized for cryogenic separation. The chilling train system consumes over 40% of the refrigerating capacity of an ethylene plant. During the chilling train start-up, different operational conditions with different compositions and flowrate of precooling process will affect both product separation efficiencies, start-up stability time and flare emission. Traditional start-up scenarios are developed based on experience and improved by trial and error, which is inefficient and dangerous. In this study, a general methodology on flare minimization for chilling train start-up operations via rigorous dynamic simulation is presented. The methodology starts with setup and validation of chilling train steady-state and dynamic simulation models. The initial state of start-up in the real plant is achieved through systematically transforming from the validated dynamic model, and several operation conditions with different compositions and flowrate of precooling stream are examined to identify an optimal initial state of start-up based on the obtained initial state. Thereafter different flare minimization strategies for the chilling train start-up are conducted on the optimal initial state model. Also, emission source characterization under different flare minimization strategies for chilling train start-up is investigated. Deep insights of the start-up strategies, emission source distribution and dynamic emission profiles are provided. This study provides detailed technical support for both the industry and environmental agencies on evaluating and developing cost-effective flare minimization strategies in the future.

These innovations include carsharing; bikesharing; microtransit services; and, most notably, transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft. These services are being embraced by millions of travelers who are using their smartphones to arrange for trips by car, shuttle, and public transit, as well as for short-term rental of cars and bicycles. The rapid growth in these services follows and amplifies a rebound in travel by taxis and public transit that began more than a decade ago. The new services epitomize today's sharing economy and allow an increasing number of people to enjoy the mobility benefits of an automobile without owning one, and may encourage others to leave their personal vehicle at home for the day, reduce the number of vehicles in their household, or even forgo having one at all. Notably, most of these innovations are occurring and being deployed in the private sector without public financial support, with the exception of bikesharing, which is typically publicly subsidized. Whereas TNCs have received the lion's share of media attention to date, the other innovative mobility services are growing, evolving, and expanding mobility while also reducing personal vehicle travel, greenhouse gas emissions, and possibly automobile ownership. Although travel using innovative mobility services still represents a small share of total trips, a continued increase in customers and trips has substantial implications for the future. To date, the most rapidly growing forms of shared mobility entail sequential sharing of vehicles, with each user in turn having exclusive use of a motor vehicle or bicycle. Potentially more consequential, but still in its infancy, is concurrent sharing of vehicles among strangers. By increasing vehicle occupancy, this form of shared services may collectively have greater effects - in terms of affordable personal mobility, vehicle use, energy consumption, traffic congestion, and environmental benefits - relative to today's most popular new sequential mobility options. At the same time that innovative mobility services are being enthusiastically embraced by tech-sawy travelers, they do raise public policy issues. For example, those without credit accounts and smartphones cannot access many of these new services, and helmet requirements may increase safety but can discourage bikesharing. The most controversial new services to date are clearly TNCs, which are growing rapidly in popularity, spreading to cities around the globe, disrupting the regulated for-hire taxi industry, and posing a series of challenges to transportation and regulatory policy makers. These challenges include • An uneven regulatory playing field affecting competition in jurisdictions that impose substantial regulations on taxis and lesser requirements on TNCs, an issue magnified by the national scale andinfluence ofTNCs compared withmostly local taxi companies; • Inconsistent requirements for drivers and for vehicle safety and insurance for taxis and TNCs, requirements whose efficacy, in any case, lacks systematic assessment; and • The implications of a decline in or even the demise of taxi companies in places where low-income, disabled, and older persons rely on taxis, including wheelchair-accessible taxis, for lifeline services. Coupled with these issues are the varying requirements for TNCs, taxis, and limousines imposed by different regulatory bodies within the same geographic area. A key challenge for policy makers at all levels of government, then, is to both encourage and facilitate innovations that meet the public's mobility needs while achieving greater public policy consistency among these new services and between them and traditional taxi and livery services. Addressing the above challenges in such rapidly growing and evolving industries is itself challenging. Doing so will require political will; more information about the scale and nature of the services being provided; and insightful, effective public policies to guide the evolution of these innovative services so as to enhance mobility, sus-tainability, and public safety. Although it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the development of such public policies will require careful analysis of both the potential benefits and risks of evolving and expanding shared mobility services. In particular, the continued expansion of these services has potentially important implications for the location preferences of households and firms, and for their travel patterns generally and their use of public transit specifically in the years ahead. In addition, substantial growth in the concurrent sharing of vehicles could meaningfully contribute to the attainment of resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable lifestyles. The committee that conducted this study concludes that innovative mobility services can provide broad mobility benefits while serving other societal goals, but that reaping these benefits will require informed policy making. The committee favors a carefully calibrated regulatory approach for both innovative mobility services and the traditional services with which they frequently compete - an approach that accomplishes public policy goals and creates a level playing field while still allowing the full spectrum of mobility services ample opportunity to innovate and compete. The committee's recommendations, elaborated in Chapter 9 of this report, are intended to provide guidance to policy makers and regulators in addressing the issues associated with the new mobility services.and taxi drivers.

Hence, it is highly desirable to develop efficient adsorbents for mitigating climate change with possible energy savings. Here, we report the design of a facile one pot catalyst-free synthetic protocol for the generation of three different nitrogen rich nanoporous amide networks (NANs) based on tetraphenyladamantane. Besides the porous architecture, CO2 capturing potential and high thermal stability, these NANs possess notable CO2/N2 selectivity with reasonable retention while increasing the temperature from 273 K to 298 K. The quantum chemical calculations also suggest that CO2 interacts mainly in the region of polar amide groups (-CONH-) present in NANs and this interaction is much stronger than that with N2 thus leading to better selectivity and affirming them as promising contenders for efficient gas separation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Amides; Chemical stability; Climate change; Energy conservation; Quantum chemistry; Anthropogenic CO; Catalyst-free; Gas separations; High thermal stability; Porous architectures; Post-combustion; Quantum chemical calculations; Synthetic protocols; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973160620

According to these directives the greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 20% and the share of energy produced from renewable sources should simultaneously be increased by the same percentage. The use of solar collectors can both improve energy security and reduce the environmental impact caused by the thermal energy industry. An ability to reduce the pollutants, which can be achieved using devices for converting solar radiation into the heat, was determined in this paper. The environmental effect, discussed in the present work, is caused by reducing the demand for domestic water heating. This effect results from the application of thermal solar collectors. The amount of pollutants that are released into the air, emitted from combustion of fuels, was estimated on the basis of the annual energy gain from the solar radiation and emission factors of the selected pollutants recommended by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Net gain of energy from solar panels was determined on the basis of experimental data. The object of the study was the solar domestic hot water (SDHW) system located on the roof of the Hotel for the staff of Bialystok University of Technology (Poland). Experimental studies were carried out under the project financed by the Regional Operational Program of Podlasie Province – stage 1.1 named “Study of the effectiveness of active and passive methods to improve the energy efficiency of infrastructure supported by renewable energy sources”. The construction of the research object was the target of the stage – 5.2 named “Im-proving the energy efficiency of Bialystok University of Technology infrastructure by use of renewable energy sources” (V. Development of environmental protection infrastructure”). The system consists of two parallel-connected installations. The first includes 21 tube collectors with a total gross area of more than 74 m2 . The second unit consists of 35 flat plate collectors with a total gross area of about 72 m2 . Eight storage tanks with the capacity of 1000 liters each were placed in the basement of the Hotel. The monitoring system was used to record the installation parameters during its operation. It consists of 17 heat meters, 4 electricity recorders, and 42 platinum resistance temperature sensors. The weather station that captures the basic parameters of outside air and insolation is located near the solar collectors. As a result of studies, it was found that the solar system produced 230.61 GJ heat energy throughout the year. The equation necessary to determine an equivalent amount of energy that is produced in a power plant was presented in this paper. Subsequently, the value of a possible reduction of selected pollutant emissions, which are released into the air, was calculated. Moreover, ΔPj coefficients were proposed for determination of the emissions reduction related to 1 m2 gross area of a solar panel. The main conclusions from the assessment of the impact of applying SDHW system to reduce the air pollution in the urban area were presented at the end of the paper. © 2018, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

In this study, we incorporated a water transfer scheme into the regional climate model RegCM4 and investigated the climatic impacts of the MSWTP over the Haihe River Basin in North China. Four 10 year simulation tests were conducted from 2001 to 2010 where different volumes of water were transferred. The results demonstrated that before the MSWTP was conducted the original groundwater exploitation and consumption over the Haihe River Basin led to wetting and cooling at the land surface with rapidly falling groundwater depth. The extra water input from the MSWTP slightly enhanced the wetting and cooling effects over the basin, as well as reduced the falling rate in the groundwater depth along the conveyance line. However, the weak climatic effects of the MSWTP were limited at a local scale and had no obvious interannual trends, because the transfer volume of the MSWTP was far lower than the total demand which has been conventionally satisfied through local water exploitation. In terms of seasonal variations, the greatest changes due to the MSWTP occurred in the summer for precipitation and soil moisture and in the spring for energy-related variables (heat fluxes and 2 m air temperature). © 2016.

Expanding road capacity engenders more traffic through the induced demand effect and raising fuel economy encourages more use through the rebound effect. Research on each feedback effect is evident in the sustainable transportation literature. However, research on their interaction is lacking. To fill this void, this article analyzes how additional road capacity and higher fuel economy interact to affect individual vehicle kilometers of travel (VKT) in metropolitan areas across the United States. The article pools individual data from the respective 2001 and 2009 National Household Travel Surveys (NHTS) and adopts a novel methodological approach known as multilevel modeling to estimate a three-level VKT model that nests individuals within vehicles within metropolitan areas. Data on fuel economy at the vehicle level provide an accurate estimate of the rebound effect and data on additional capacity at the metropolitan area level provide an accurate estimate of the induced demand effect. Results indicate that the feedback effects do indeed interact to affect individual travel behavior. Further research with three time points of individual data from the NHTS is necessary to establish a trend, but the empirical results suggest that the interaction between these feedback effects decreases their efficacy to mitigate GHG emissions. However, some of these effects could be offset by higher road and fuel prices. © 2016 by American Association of Geographers.","Fuel economy; Induced demand; Multilevel model; Rebound effect; Road capacity","emission control; environmental effect; greenhouse gas; metropolitan area; pollution policy; road traffic; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971455007

These positive effects include increasing the interception capacity due to increasing vegetation cover, increasing of storage capacity and infiltration of the soil, thus reducing storm water runoff, producing substantial improvements in the urban drainage system, whose infrastructure is very difficult and expensive to be modified. In this paper an indicator based on the runoff coefficient, which allows quantifying the impact on runoff due to increase of GI is presented. In a second step, a way for relating the indicator with the risk of flooding is proposed. The complete methodology was applied on an urban basin located in the north of Rosario city, Argentina. Four scenarios were evaluated: baseline scenario (current scenario), and three hypothetical (future) scenarios, considering a moderate and severe waterproofing situation respectively, and one green scenario with increased GI. The results show that the moderate and severe waterproofing scenarios produce an increased risk of flooding from 1.9 times to 4 times, respectively. This implies a necessary reinvestment in urban storm water infrastructure in order to keep the original security levels. The green scenario does keep the runoff coefficient, even considering the major increases in population and urbanization. Improving the GI constitutes a strong strategy to adapt to climate and urban changes, to cope with upcoming increases in precipitation and urbanization. © 2016 The Authors.","climate change; Risk assessment; urban hydrology","Ecosystems; Floods; Hydrology; Investments; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Runoff; Storms; Urban planning; Waterproofing; Adaptation to climate changes; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Runoff coefficients; Storm water runoff; Urban drainage systems; Urban flood risks; Urban hydrology; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997834641

Efforts to improve vehicle transportation efficiency and curb associated environmental emissions had led to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for passenger cars and light trucks initially introduced in 1975. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has phased in new standards recently that require an average combined fleet-wide fuel economy of 35.1 - 35.4 mpg by 2017, 40.3 - 41.0 mpg by 2021, and 48.7 - 49.7 mpg by 2025. The new legislation has the potential to reduce overall U.S. emissions by close to 6% should the 2025 goals be attained. To reach these targets, compliance levels set to begin in 2017 will require a fine to be paid for every 0.1 mpg a manufacturer's fleet average is below the compliance target. The goal of this study was to assess the potential for CAFE to achieve the desired average fleet fuel economy goals set forth in the U.S., and evaluate its past effectiveness at reducing actual on-road fuel consumption. The possibility of the 2017-2025 CAFE standards to be more or less successful than the 2011-2016 standards at meeting fuel economy goals were evaluated together with strategies that auto manufacturers would most likely use to meet the 2017 - 2025 CAFE standards. The study analyzed past transportation efficiency trends and future projection models, and explored the industry and consumer-side impacts of the CAFE standard within the proposed timeframe. The possibility of automakers adapting to presented changes quickly to meet the increasingly strict CAFE standards and keeping up with improving the average fleet fuel economy seem difficult at best. While the effectiveness of allowances and credits similar to a cap and trade mechanism has prevented a major shortfall between CAFE standards and average fleet fuel economy to date, it is likely that most manufacturers will not be able to adapt in time to avoid facing fines moving into the future. © 2016 The Authors.","CAFE; fuel economy; vehicle transportation efficiency","Automobile manufacture; Automobiles; Crashworthiness; Efficiency; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Highway accidents; Manufacture; Standards; Sustainable development; Auto manufacturers; CAFE; Corporate average fuel-economy standards; Environmental emissions; Future projections; National highway traffic safety administrations; Transportation efficiency; Transportation sector; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999828364

For the first time, these SnNb2O6 nanosheets are applied to the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4 in the absence of co-catalysts and sacrificial agents under visible light irradiation. The structural features, morphology, photoabsorption performance, and photoelectric response have been investigated in detail. Results show the as-prepared SnNb2O6 samples with typical 2D nanosheets in the thickness of about 1 nm. Owing to the unique features of the nanosheets, the surface area, photoelectrical properties and the surface basicity of SnNb2O6 are greatly improved compared with the counterpart prepared by traditional solid state reaction. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity of CO2 on SnNb2O6 nanosheets is much higher than that of layered SnNb2O6. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of SnNb2O6 nanosheets for the reduction of CO2 is about 45 and 4 times higher than those of the references (layered SnNb2O6 and common N-doped TiO2), respectively. To understand the interactions between the CO2 molecule and the surface of the photocatalyst, and the reactive species in the reduction process, the intermediates have also been detected by in situ FTIR with and without visible light irradiation. Finally, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4 on SnNb2O6 nanosheets is proposed. We believe this work will provide new opportunities for expanding the family of visible-light driven photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959265019

Inspired by natural photosynthesis in green plants, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels couples the reductive half-reaction of CO2 fixation with a matched oxidative half-reaction such as water oxidation to achieve a carbon neutral cycle, mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of future fossil fuel. The scientific challenge is to develop a class of photocatalysts made of earth abundant, low cost, non-toxic, sunlight stable and highly active materials.

Currently, the improved bright pixel sub-algorithm (BPSA) is a unique algorithm employed by VIIRS to routinely generate LSA EDR from VIIRS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations. As a product validation procedure, LSA EDR reached validated (V1 stage) maturity in December 2014. This study summarizes recent progress in algorithm refinement, and presents comprehensive validation and evaluation results of VIIRS LSA by using extensive field measurements, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product, and Landsat-retrieved albedo maps. Results indicate that: (1) by testing the updated desert-specific look-up-table (LUT) that uses a stricter standard to select the training data specific for desert aerosol type in our local environment, it is found that the VIIRS LSA retrieval accuracy is improved over a desert surface and the absolute root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced from 0.036 to 0.023, suggesting the potential of the updated desert LUT to the improve the VIIRS LSA product accuracy; (2) LSA retrieval on snow-covered surfaces is more accurate if the newly developed snow-specific LUT (RMSE = 0.082) replaces the generic LUT (RMSE = 0.093) that is employed in the current operational LSA EDR production; (3) VIIRS LSA is also comparable to high-resolution Landsat albedo retrieval (RMSE < 0.04), although Landsat albedo has a slightly higher accuracy, probably owing to higher spatial resolution with less impacts of mixed pixel; (4) VIIRS LSA retrievals agree well with the MODIS albedo product over various land surface types, with overall RMSE of lower than 0.05 and the overall bias as low as 0.025, demonstrating the comparable data quality between VIIRS and the MODIS LSA product. © 2016 by the authors.","Accuracy assessment; Albedo; Landsat; Suomi NPP; VIIRS","Image reconstruction; Infrared imaging; Landforms; Mean square error; Pixels; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Snow; Solar radiation; Surface measurement; Table lookup; Thermography (imaging); Accuracy assessment; Albedo; LANDSAT; Suomi NPP; VIIRS; Radiometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962603542

Evaluating the relationship among land use, modal split, and traffic emission can help propose regional optimal land use pattern by modal shift strategy to reduce carbon emissions. Data were collected from seven medium-sized cities in China. The study first evaluated the land use that influences mode split and the relationship between modal split and traffic emission. Then a sustainable mode shift strategy was provided to reduce emissions. Lastly, we provided constructive suggestions for sustainable land use pattern by mode shift strategy. To reduce emission per trip, nonmotorized trip modes and public transit should be increased, and, accordingly, the residence-industry and residence-retain mix entropy should be increased. The study found that the regions with job-housing balance or retail-housing mix could increase the mode share of nonmotorized vehicle traffic and reduce car use.

In fact, however, a large amount of air pollutant emission is provided by agricultural activities (e.g., biomass burning, animal-feeding operation as well as fertilizer application). Such air pollutant emissions include ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as well as nitrous oxide (N2O), which play an important role in the formation of fine particulate matter PM2.5. In this study, an agro-ecosystem model called Environment Policy Impact Calculator (EPIC) model is improved and tested for the calculation of agricultural fertilizer application (N and P) in China for the first time. Besides, the EPIC is also introduced with necessary modification of soil and fertilizer parameters so that the fertilizer used in the whole China during 2010 and NH3 emissions caused by fertilizer application to two major crops, corn and winter-wheat, can be calculated. The result shows that most of China's fertilizer application is excessive. Therefore, it is suggested that the total changes of N and P fertilizer in six major regions including the Northeast, Huang-Huai area, Yangtze River, the Southwest, the South as well as the Northwest can be reduced by 128.9 and 105.4 million tons respectively from the model. Over fertilization is both wasteful and harmful, as it cannot only bring harm to crop growth but also pollute the environment, which is especially true with PM2.5. One case of fertilizer emissions affecting the air quality (PM2.5) in Suzhou, one of the most developed cities in Yangzi River Delta (YRD), is also included in this study. The result shows that NH3 has a nonlinear positive effect on the concentration of PM2.5. What's more, as SO2, NOx, NH3 and VOC are all important precursors of secondary fine particles, it will be better to estimate the PM2.5-SO2-NOx-NH3-VOC relationship in future studies.

The river is only navigable during the summer months, from mid-June until sometime in late-September to mid-October, when it is clear of ice. However, the water conditions of the river have changed significantly in recent years. Although water levels always decrease as the delivery season moves into fall, these reductions have been occurring much faster, in turn reducing barge loading capacities as well as operational speeds. In addition, based on simulations of ice breakup and water volumes in the Mackenzie River basin, the sailing season opening dates are anticipated to shift earlier in the future. In the end, the main impact of climate change on river transport is not definitive events but rather, increased variability in events. This research aims to account for those abovementioned climate changes in the freight volume scheduling process, and conducts a numerical analysis based on the projections of future water conditions from climate simulation models as well as predicted freight volumes from time-series analysis and forecast models. The results of the numerical analysis can help local government and waterway transportation companies to better understand how freight scheduling strategies could account for climate changes that affect regional waterway transportation and, hence, optimize their operational schedules to take advantage of good water conditions while reducing financial cost.","Climate Change; Freight Transportation; Transport Schedule; Water Transportation","Climate models; Freight transportation; Inland waterways; Numerical analysis; Rivers; Scheduling; Time series analysis; Transportation; Transportation routes; Water levels; Water resources; Waterway transportation; Climate change impact; Climate simulation; Mackenzie river basin; Remote communities; Scheduling process; Scheduling strategies; Transportation network; Water transportation; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030872700

Yet little literature has studied this topic from the city level. This paper first measures CO2 emission of 73 Chinese cities. We find heterogeneity embedded in the cross-city distribution of CO2 emission per capita and a nonlinear structure in the relationship between carbon emission and GDP per capita. To describe such multimodality and examine the determinants of CO2 emission in these cities, this article applies a linear mixed effect model covering the quadratic term of GDP per capita to extend the stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model. The empirical results demonstrate that population size, secondary industry proportion, energy consumption structure, urbanization level and economic level have generally shown a positive influence on CO2 emissions in Chinese cities. However, the urbanization level is of no significance. The phenomenon of the environmental Kuznets curve varies across Chinese cities, according to which three city groups are formed. Specific policy recommendations are given to each city group in light of their unique influencing modes on carbon emissions. © 2016 by the author.","Carbon dioxide emission; Environmental kuznets curve; Extended STIRPAT model; Linear mixed effect model","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; Gross Domestic Product; heterogeneity; Kuznets curve; literature review; policy making; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007387180

As one of the largest GHG emitters in the world, China aims to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of GDP to 60 to 65 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. However, city GHG inventories in China have not yet been published by the city governments. Furthermore, previous studies on city inventory accounting are neither complete nor globally comparable. Hence, a case study of Beijing was conducted for the purpose of reporting the city inventory completely and enabling data to be comparable internationally. This research quantifies Beijing's latest emissions based on available data through multiple methods, including Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas emissions inventories (GPC), a method devised by the Japanese Ministry of Environment (Japanese Ministry of Environment, 2010) and a method from recent academic research on CO2 emissions in the Chinese iron and steel industry (Zhao, Y. Q., Li, & Li, 2012). According to these methods, Beijing's GHG emissions were 373,558,617 t CO2 in 2012. Additionally, comparisons between Beijing and six other mega-cities of Shanghai, Tokyo, New York, Washington D.C., London and Paris show that Beijing's 2012 GHG emission per capita and per 10,000 CNY GDP ranked the highest. This study creates a timely and relatively complete GHG emission inventory that can be widely applied for comparisons and presents recommendations for city inventory building. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","Beijing; Chinese cities; GHG emission; GHG inventory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992736422

Compared with bituminous coal-fired boilers, there is a big difficulty for low volatile coal boilers to retrofit. In addition, the tertiary air in tangentially lean coal-fired boiler will affect mixing of coal and air, combustion atmosphere and combustion temperature, these have significant influences on both coal combustion process and NOx formation. Therefore, optimal tertiary air arrangement modes should be explored at retrofitting project design to get low-NOx emissions and high combustion efficiency. In this paper, based on a 300-MWe tangentially lean coal-fired boiler, the influences of tertiary air arrangement on combustion parameters were studied by means of numerical simulation. Then slag, fly ash carbon content, NOx, furnace outlet temperature, and other parameters were measured at hot states. The results show that when tertiary air at the bottom of the furnace, the fire center is elevated and resulting in a lower burnout rate, the NOx generated early in tertiary air has a longer reducing zone so that the NOx formation is relatively lower. When tertiary air in the middle of primary combustion zone, the combustion temperature decreases, the NOx formation is moderate for the opposite function of weaker reducing atmosphere and lower temperature and the coal burns out well because a good mixture of coal and air in primary combustion zone. As tertiary air is above primary combustion zone, the burnout rate and NOx emission fall off with tertiary air location moving up higher. In addition, the simulation results were highly consistent with the hot tests. The findings of this study provide guidance for the tertiary air arrangement of tangentially lean coal-fired boilers with low-NOx combustion system. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore and Tsinghua University Press 2016.","CFD; Hottests; Low-NOxcombustion; Tangentially fired boiler; Tertiary air arrangement","Air navigation; Atmospheric temperature; Bituminous coal; Coal fired boilers; Computational fluid dynamics; Fly ash; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuel systems; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Planning; Retrofitting; Slags; Sustainable development; Combustion parameters; Combustion temperatures; High combustion efficiency; Hottests; Low-NOxcombustion; Reducing atmosphere; Tangentially-fired boilers; Tertiary air; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048470474

It is still mainly used for water supply and drainage of buildings and municipal utility industry as well as for safe drinking in rural areas, about half of all plastic pipelines are used for buildings, and the proportion of these pipelines used in other fields is also increasing. Plastic pipeline system's influence on the environment within its life cycle is the focus of researches in recent years. Based on life cycle assessment (LCA), this paper assesses the common water supply and drainage pipelines (PPR, PE and PVC-U) for buildings for resource and energy consumption, non-renewable resource consumption (ADP)of pollution gas emission, greenhouse effect (GWP), acidification effect (AP) and eutrophication (EP) and inhalable inorganics (RI) generated in the process of life cycle from raw material exploitation to produce production and other environmental influence closely related to the national energy conservation and emission reduction policy. The result shows that the influence indexes of non-renewable resource consumption for functional unit of PPR pipe, PE pipe and PVC-U pipe are 2.22×10-5 Kg antimony eq./ kg, 1.51×10-5 Kg antimony eq./ kg, 6.82×10-6 Kg antimony eq./ kg; those of acidification effect are 1.92×10-2kg SO2 eq./ kg, 1.96×10-2g SO2 eq./ kg, 3.90×10-2kg SO2 eq./ kg; those of eutrophication are 2.39×10-3kg PO43-eq./ kg, 2.36×10-3kg PO43-eq./ kg, 3.40×10-3kg PO43-eq./ kg; those of inhalable inorganics are 6.46×10-3 kg PM2.5 eq./ kg, 6.30×10-3 kg PM2.5 eq./ kg, 1.91×10-2 kg PM2.5 eq./ kg; those of greenhouse effect are 3.72kg CO2 eq./ kg, 3.60kg CO2 eq./ kg, 7.93kg CO2 eq./ kg. This result shows that the environmental influence of PPR, PE and PVC-U pipes mainly depends on the raw materials required for producing pipes, so the key of plastic pipeline greening is to reduce the consumption of virgin resin.

The presence of capillary pressure significantly affects both the thermodynamic behavior of fluid mixtures and the fluid flow process. Although there have been some attempts to study the effect of capillary pressure on phase behavior, it has not been clearly understood in the application considering multiple components in tight oil reservoirs. In this work, we present a methodology to calculate the phase behavior of CO2/hydrocarbon systems in the presence of capillary pressure. We modify the Peng-Robinson equation of state considering inequalities of hydrocarbon liquid and vapor pressures. The criterion of Gibbs free energy minimization and Rachford-Rice flash calculation are applied in the phase equilibrium calculation. The Young-Laplace equation is utilized to calculate capillary pressure. The Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the nonlinear phase equilibrium equations. We validate the methodology against two experimental measurements and a published numerical model. Subsequently, binary mixture and one typical fluid from the Bakken Formation are used to study the influence of capillarity in the unconventional reservoir. The simulation results indicate that capillary pressure plays an important role in the phase equilibrium calculation when pore size is less than 50 nm. Additionally, the bubble-point pressure of Bakken oil reduces nearby 500 psi when the nano-pore size is 10 nm. The developed method can address the thermodynamics governing unconventional reservoirs and provide better understanding of the phase behavior of CO2/hydrocarbon systems in the case of CO2 injection into unconventional reservoirs.

On the basis of the research about infrared polarization imaging theory, the characteristics of long-wave infrared polarization detection was analyzed in this paper. Firstly, the paper studied long-wave infrared polarization state and interaction effect which coming from the spontaneous emission of target and environment, then designed the analysis experiment about long-wave infrared polarization characteristics that coming from spontaneous radiation, further and verified the forming mechanism of long wave infrared polarization.

The future decadal simulations show that future climate features with stronger radiation, higher surface temperature and planetary boundary layer height, and enhanced precipitation under all scenarios, with less warming and drier atmosphere by RCP4.5 than 8.5 and by TDM B2 than A1B. The simulations under RCP8.5/TDM A1B show the enhanced future O3 levels, which are attributed to warmer climate, higher emissions of methane (CH4) and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and dis-benefit of nitrogen oxides (NOx) reduction in VOC-limited regime. The latter factor offsets the benefits of reduced emissions of NOx and anthropogenic VOCs. Future air quality features greater reduction in PM2.5 by RCP4.5/8.5 than TDM B2/A1B and decreased O3 over most areas by RCP4.5 and TDM B2, indicating the benefits of carbon policy and technology changes with greater emission reductions and the importance of win-win emission control strategies in mitigating air pollution and adverse climate change. © 2016 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.","Climate Change; Climate Scenarios; Decadal Application And Evaluation; Future Air Quality; Technology-Driven Model; WRF/Chem.","Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Carbon; Climate models; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Quality control; Volatile organic compounds; Weather forecasting; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Climate scenarios; Comprehensive evaluation; Coupled meteorology and chemistry models; Decadal Application And Evaluation; Planetary boundary layers; Weather research and forecasting models; WRF/Chem; Climate change; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon footprint; climate change; decadal variation; emission; emission control; future prospect; ozone; pollution policy; radiative forcing; satellite altimetry; technological change; weather forecasting; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991607855

In order to explore a low carbon urbanization pathway by reducing carbon emissions of the power sector, the Chinese government launched an international low carbon city (ILCC) project in Shenzhen. This paper presents a feasibility analysis on the potential hybrid energy system based on local renewable energy resources and electricity demand estimation over the three planning stages of the ILCC project. Wind power, solar power, natural gas and the existing power grid are components considered in the hybrid energy system. The simulation results indicate that the costs of energy in the three planning stages are 0.122, 0.105 and 0.141 $/kWh, respectively, if external wind farms and pumped storage hydro stations (PSHSs) exist. The optimization results reveal that the carbon reduction rates are 46.81%, 62.99% and 75.76% compared with the Business as Usual scenarios. The widely distributed water reservoirs in Shenzhen provide ideal conditions to construct PSHS, which is crucial in enhancing renewable energy utilization. © 2016 by the authors.","Hybrid energy system; Low-carbon urbanization; Renewable energy","carbon; carbon emission; demand analysis; electricity generation; energy planning; feasibility study; industrialization; optimization; renewable resource; urbanization; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970990719

U-Pb detrital zircon analyses of 38 sandstones from southern Taimyr were conducted using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to investigate late Paleozoic to Mesozoic sediment provenance and the tectonic evolution of Taimyr within a regional framework. The Pennsylvanian to Permian sandstones contain detrital zircon populations of 370-260 Ma, which are consistent with derivation from the late Paleozoic Uralian orogen in northern Taimyr and/or the polar Urals. Late Neoproterozoic through Silurian ages (688-420 Ma), most consistent with derivation from Timanian and Caledonian age sources, suggest an ultimate Baltica source. Southern Taimyr represents the proforeland basin of the bivergent Uralian orogen in the late Paleozoic. Triassic sedimentary rocks contain detrital zircon populations of Carboniferous-Permian (355-260 Ma), late Neoproterozoic to Early Devonian (650-410 Ma), and minor Neoproterozoic (1000-700 Ma) ages, which suggest a similar provenance as the Carboniferous to Permian strata. The addition of a Permian-Triassic (260-220 Ma) zircon population indicates derivation of detritus from Siberian Trap-related magmatism. Jurassic samples have a dominant age peak at 255 Ma and a distinct reduction in Carboniferous-Permian and late Neoproterozoic to Early Devonian input, suggesting that erosion and contributions from Uralian sources ceased while greater input from Siberian Trap-related rocks of Taimyr dominated. © 2015 Geological Society of America.","Diabetes mellitus; Exercise test; Myocardial infarction; Rehabilitation","Laser ablation; Lead; Mass spectrometry; Patient rehabilitation; Sandstone; Sedimentary rocks; Silicate minerals; Strike-slip faults; Tectonics; Zircon; Diabetes mellitus; Exercise test; Fold-and-thrust belts; Laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometries; Late neoproterozoic; Myocardial Infarction; Strike slip faulting; Tectonic evolution; Geochronology; compression; continental margin; fold and thrust belt; Mesozoic; orogeny; Paleozoic; provenance; sandstone; strike-slip fault; tectonic evolution; tectonic reconstruction; uranium-lead dating; zircon; Arctic; Krasnoyarsk [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation; Siberia; Taymyr Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953747524

Prevalence of childhood asthma varies significantly among regions, while its reasons are not clear yet with only a few studies reporting relevant causes for this variation. Objective. To investigate the potential role of city-average levels of air pollutants and climatic factors in order to distinguish differences in asthma prevalence in China and explain their reasons. Methods. Data pertaining to 10,777 asthmatic patients were obtained from the third nationwide survey of childhood asthma in China's urban areas. Annual mean concentrations of air pollutants and other climatic factors were obtained for the same period from several government departments. Data analysis was implemented with descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis. Results. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the situation of childhood asthma was strongly linked with SO2, relative humidity, and hours of sunshine (p &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that, among the predictor variables in the final step, SO2 was found to be the most powerful predictor variable amongst all (β = - 19.572, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, results had shown that hours of sunshine (β = - 0.014, p &lt; 0.05) was a significant component summary predictor variable. Conclusion.

The purpose of this work is to assess the nitrous oxide emission from the intensively fertilized bamboo plantations to better understand the mitigation potential of fertilizer management, and to develop an approach for advancing the site-specific emission factors considering influences of climate and soil conditions. Based on the commonly adopted fertilization practices, the biogeochemical model DeNitrification-DeComposition was adjusted and validated to estimate and analyze nitrous oxide emission under four typical fertilizer management scenarios, namely fertilizer input reduction, split fertilization, deeper placement, and slowrelease fertilizers. The simulation results show that the tested fertilizer management practices present great potential for reducing nitrous oxide emissions whereas mitigation effect of each adaptation depends on the site-specific conditions. In the cases of China, fertilizer reduction and adaptation with slowrelease fertilizers application are shown to be the most cost-beneficial fertilization options for nitrous oxide mitigation in humid and arid regions, respectively. The highest mitigation achievable ranged from 60.3% (humid coast) to 92.9% (arid inland) compared to the current practice with excessive fertilization. If these adapted fertilization practices are implemented at the national scale, approximately 8.02 -11.38 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents per year of nitrous oxide emission could be reduced in 2030, which is 4.0%-5.7% of the total nitrous oxide emission from China's upland cropping system. The results indicate the critical importance of site-specific fertilizer management on reducing nitrous oxide emission in bamboo production. By considering the site-specific conditions, the overall biogeochemical modelling approach could serve as a more effective tool than the commonly used emission factors to quantify emission and screen fertilizer management options in cleaner agricultural production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The agencies proposed that vehicle manufacturers would certify vehicles to the standards by using the agencies’ Greenhouse Gas Emission Model (GEM). The agencies also proposed a steady-state engine test procedure for generating GEM inputs to represent the vehicle’s engine performance. In the proposal the agencies also requested comment on an alternative engine test procedure, the details of which were published in two separate 2015 SAE Technical Papers [1, 2]. As an alternative to the proposed steady-state engine test procedure, these papers presented a cycle-average test procedure. The papers also explored how a range of vehicle configurations could be defined and selected for generating the engine duty cycles for this test procedure. In addition, these papers described and used a simple interpolation-based numerical algorithm for determining the fuel consumption of a vehicle configuration based on a cycle-average engine “fuel map” that was generated via the cycle-average engine test procedure. This paper is a continuation of this earlier work [1], and this particular paper presents a more comprehensive evaluation of a range of numerical algorithms for determining fuel consumption values from a cycle-average engine fuel map. These numerical algorithms include interpolation and extrapolation schemes as well as different linear and non-linear equations, where the equations’ coefficients were fitted via least-squares regression. The selection of independent and dependent variables for all of these numerical methods was explored in detail. It is shown that the most robust numerical algorithm that we explored specifies fuel mass as the dependent variable, and a linear combination of the ratio of average engine speed to average vehicle speed and cycle work as the two independent variables. It is demonstrated that the cycle-average test procedure, combined with a robust numerical algorithm for interpreting the cycle-average fuel map, can effectively predict the fuel consumption of an engine in different vehicle configurations, including configurations with different parent and child engine ratings and a wide range of transmissions.

Based on the tax preference of enterprise income for comprehensive utilization of resources, the constraints to achieve completely successful equilibrium are studied in the single period and multiple periods. In the single period, the key to achieve separating equilibrium is analyzed carefully by constructing a signaling game model of enterprises and government on tax preference of enterprise income. In the multiple periods, with the stochastic evolutionary game model based on the stochastic differential equation (SDE) theory, the constraints of keeping the separating equilibrium stable and continuing in a long term will be further investigated. It gives the optimal number of tax preference of enterprise income, camouflage cost and expected cost of risk under the state of separating equilibrium. The optimal result of completely successful equilibrium is obtained in single period by the analysis of numerical example for enterprises and government signaling game model. The simulation experiment is successfully finished to test the effectiveness of the stochastic evolutionary game model by using mathematical software MATLAB. © 2016, University of Nis.

Rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and atmospheric dynamics fields from reanalyses are used to evaluate the 1998-2013 climatology and a case study for 2006. In both the climatology and the 2006 case study, most regions of West Africa are shown to have a single diurnal peak of rainfall either in the afternoon or at night. Averaging over West Africa produces a diurnal cycle with two peaks, but this type of diurnal cycle is quite atypical on smaller space scales. Rainfall systems are usually generated in the afternoon and propagate westward, lasting into the night. Afternoon rainfall peaks are associated with an unstable lower troposphere. They occur either over topography or in regions undisturbed by nocturnal systems, allowing locally generated instability to dominate. Nocturnal rainfall peaks are associated with the westward propagation of rainfall systems and not generally with local instability. Nocturnal rainfall peaks occur most frequently about 3°-10° of longitude downstream of regions with afternoon rainfall peaks. The diurnal cycle of rainfall is closely associated with the timing of extreme rainfall events. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Climate variability; Convection; Diurnal effects; Extreme events; Precipitation; Rainfall","Climatology; Heat convection; Precipitation (chemical); Precipitation (meteorology); Atmospheric dynamics; Climate variability; Diurnal effects; Extreme events; Lower troposphere; Observational analysis; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Warm season rainfall; Rain; atmospheric convection; climate variation; climatology; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional climate; temporal cycle; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996837251

Nevertheless, our target Cambrian-Ordovician carbonate reservoirs are usually buried deeply (generally more than 6000 meters) with strong later diagenesis, strong heterogeneity and anisotropy, complex hydrocarbon accumulation periods and complicated oil-gas-water distribution. All these issues make it a world-class challenge for complex carbonate reservoir characterization. Timefrequency (TF) analysis has been widely used in seismic data interpretation and reservoir characterization. The local frequency variation of seismic data with high resolution in both time and frequency can be captured by the synchrosqueezing wavelet transform (SSWT). Thus, in this paper we for the first time utilize a physical model to demonstrate the superior performance of SSWT. We then introduce a novel application of SSWT on a deep complex carbonate reservoir. The application of SSWT is compared with commonly-used continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which indicates significant potential of SSWT for better characterizing complex carbonate reservoirs via the more obvious low-frequency anomalies. Four production wells also demonstrate the validity of SSWT. We expect that SSWT will be taken fully consideration for further large-scale applications in industry, which are especially beneficial to complex carbonate reservoir characterization.",,"Carbonation; Geophysical prospecting; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum reservoirs; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Water supply systems; Continuous wavelet transforms; Hydrocarbon accumulation period; Hydrocarbon resources; Large-scale applications; Reservoir characterization; Seismic data interpretations; Strong heterogeneities; Time frequency analysis; Wavelet transforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088772168

In addition, the carbon loss and CO2 exchange flux at the water-gas interface were also estimated. The results showed that the pH value and DO in the stream varied regularly on a daily basis with the temperature of stream water, suggesting that the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and algae is the controlling factor for the diel variations of the pH and DO. During the monitoring period, while the DIC (mainly in HCO3−) input (at spring) was relatively stable at about 4.46 mmol L−1, the concentrations of HCO3− and Ca2+ at downstream showed a diel cycle of daytime decrease and nighttime increase, with an amplitude of 22.4 %. We also found out that the CO2 degassing mainly occurred in the upper reach of the surface stream right after groundwater is exposed to the surface. The total CO2 exchange flux of the entire monitoring stream section was calculated to be 29.83 kg d−1, accounting for 17.8 % of the DIC loss, which means that approximately 4/5 of the loss was converted into organic carbon or calcite precipitation. Compared with the total carbon input at spring, this carbon loss only accounts for 6.5 % of the total carbon amount (1.4 % of which was converted into organic carbon and 1.1 % of which was degassed to the atmosphere), indicating that the DIC of karst groundwater in low order surface stream of Guancun is stable in general, with 1 % being lost to the atmosphere. This suggests that on a daily timescale, carbon loss in the form of CO2 of low order karst streams with lower gradient is much less pronounced. © 2016, Zalozba Z R C.

A coal mine mobile refuge chamber is a new class of device for miners those who are unable to escape after an accident which can provide basic survival conditions. In this paper, in order to study the propagation law of an underground methane/air mixture explosive wave, and check the failure mode of a coal mine mobile refuge chamber, a full-sized underground tunnel model and a refuge chamber model have been established in ANSYS/LS-DYNA (LSTC, R7.0.0, Livermore, CA, USA, 2014). The simulation results show that the reflected wave pressure on the front surface of the refuge chamber was about twice as high than the incident wave. The pressure on various locations of the chamber was also analyzed. When the peak pressure of the explosive shockwave reached 0.64 MPa, the maximum displacement and stress occur at the center of the front door and the joint of stiffeners and the front plate, respectively. Most parts of the coal mine mobile refuge chamber were in a plastic failure state and the refuge chamber could be defined as damaged. The front door, the front plate, the connecting flange, and the stiffeners on each side were the primary key components. In the end, suggestions were proposed for the refuge chamber. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Blast impact; Dynamic response; Failure mode; Gas explosion; Refuge chamber",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967167557

Unfortunately, detailed studies quantifying the influence of earthquake on forest mortality are currently rare. The committed forest biomass carbon loss associated with the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China is assessed by a synthetic approach in this study that integrated field investigation, remote sensing analysis, empirical models and Monte Carlo simulation. The newly developed approach significantly improved the forest disturbance evaluation by quantitatively defining the earthquake impact boundary and detailed field survey to validate the mortality models. Based on our approach, a total biomass carbon of 10.9 Tg·C was lost in Wenchuan earthquake, which offset 0.23% of the living biomass carbon stock in Chinese forests. Tree mortality was highly clustered at epicenter, and declined rapidly with distance away from the fault zone. It is suggested that earthquakes represent a significant driver to forest carbon dynamics, and the earthquake-induced biomass carbon loss should be included in estimating forest carbon budgets. © 2016 by the authors.","Biomass carbon loss; Earthquake; Forest mortality; Remote sensing; Synthetic approach","Biomass; Budget control; Earthquakes; Ecosystems; Geophysics; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Remote sensing; 2008 wenchuan earthquakes; Carbon loss; Forest carbon budgets; Forest mortality; Remote sensing analysis; Synthetic approach; Temperate forest ecosystems; Wenchuan Earthquake; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962559317

Assessments are often qualitative, as emissions from modern industrial facilities are too low to deposit substantial levels of contaminants. However, concerns over contaminant deposition occasionally arise and demand quantitative evaluation. Case studies are presented that evaluated the potential for air pollutants to affect soils at levels that could present human health and ecological risks. One case examines fugitive dust emissions from an aggregate material storage facility. Dust deposition into a shallow soil was found to insubstantially increase contaminant concentrations in soils relative to background levels. In this case, electron microscopy analysis found evidence of aggregate particle deposition too small to distinguish with conventional sampling. In a similar study, deposition modeling of airborne emissions from a Portland cement facility also indicates insubstantial increases in soil contaminant levels. A third study models nitrogen deposition to soil due to emissions from a proposed power plant. Excessive nitrogen loading could endanger restoration of a tallgrass prairie by encouraging invasive plant species incapable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. The increased level of nitrogen deposition, when added to the background rate, was found to be lower than that associated with invasive species proliferation. In general, these studies indicate that very high emissions are needed to effect noticeable changes in soil contaminant levels. Examples in which atmospheric deposition substantially impacted soils are the historic use of lead as a gasoline additive and a former municipal solid waste incinerator with very high dioxin emissions. In both cases, simple accumulation models indicate substantial increases in soil concentrations due to atmospheric deposition capable of endangering health.

While most of the academic and industrial institutions have been focused on the development of procedures to recycle hot asphalt mixes with up to 40% RAP content, a few industry innovators have refined 100% recycling technologies over the past four decades to a level where routine production of 100% recycled mixes is in clear sight. The main hindrance in the widespread use of 100% recycling is the unproven performance of 100% RAP pavements and lack of a unified and rational system for selection of materials and mix design. The objective of this research was, therefore, to critically investigate the concept of 100% recycling, determine whether such mixtures can perform as well as conventional asphalt mixes and if yes, develop a mixture design method for 100% recycled asphalt. This article presents a summary of the research, demonstrating that with adequate mixture design 100% recycled asphalt mixtures can perform equally to conventional asphalt. The available production technologies are also shortly summarized.

Using different customer densities, drop sizes, and distribution center distances obtained from a sample survey, as well as Daganzós continuous approximations for trip lengths and the NTM method, trade-off curves have been constructed.

The early Earth was warm, perhaps with higher concentrations of greenhouse gases compensating for a solar output smaller than present. Intermittent ice ages began ~2.5. billion years ago, perhaps associated with oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere and reduction in methane levels; these included more or less worldwide 'Snowball Earth' events, with ice extending to low latitudes. From the beginning of the Phanerozoic, the Earth has alternated between 'icehouse states' - albeit of lesser severity than the 'Snowball' events - and 'greenhouse states', such as that of the Mesozoic Era. The Earth is currently in an icehouse state marked by geologically closely spaced fluctuations of climate, largely paced by astronomical variations and amplified by changes in greenhouse gas levels. The present interglacial state of the Holocene is very likely to soon attain levels of climatic warmth not seen for several million years, because of human modification of climate drivers, notably greenhouse gases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to review the paleoclimate methods used and to add the coexistence approach (CA) method to estimate paleotemperature for the Florissant site. The basis of the CA method is the dependence on overlapping climatic requirements for different taxa in the flora and their nearest living relatives. These relationships tie the fossil identities to the actual plant habitats and climatic requirements of close relatives. Based on the CA method, we conclude that the mean annual temperature ranged between 14.3 and 18.2 °C. These results support the conclusions offered by several other studies that the Florissant was a warm temperate to subtropical flora, and they are consistent with recent conclusions by structural geologists as well as other studies, indicating that the Florissant site was deposited at a relatively low elevation, probably between 1 and 1.5 km. © 2016, National Research Council of Canada.

Therefore we have been developing a multiple-injection burner for hydrogen-rich syngas fuel in order to achieve high efficiency and low environmental load. This burner consists of a perforated plate with multiple air holes and fuel nozzles. The multiple air holes and the fuel nozzles are arranged coaxially. The burner is based on the concept of premixed combustion configured by mixing fuel and air in the each air hole rapidly and dispersing fuel with multiple fuel-air jet. This rapid mixing can reduce NOx emissions by getting homogeneous lean premixed combustion, and preventing flashback despite the high flame speed for hydrogen-rich syngas fuels. The unsteady phenomena that occur in the combustion field should be understood in detail in order to confirm this burner concept. However, their measurement under high pressure is difficult. Meanwhile computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is able to investigate the detailed distributions of various emissions and temperature even though under combustion fields of high pressure and high temperature. The purpose of this paper is to validate this concept of the multiple-injection burner by using CFD. The burner can change the combustion form between premixed and non-premixed combustion by controlling the mixing, so the combustion field coexisting with premixed combustion and non-premixed combustion is complicated. Therefore, we have developed a hybrid turbulent combustion (HTC) model applicable to both non-premixed and premixed flames. The HTC model is hybridized with the flamelet progress variable (FPV) model and a flame propagation model. The FPV model is based on the laminar flamelet concept. The flame propagation model considers the flame stretch effect, diffusion enhancement effect, and increasing rate of flame surface area. The turbulent flow model adopts large eddy simulation (LES) with a dynamic sub-grid scale (SGS) based on the local inter-scale equilibrium assumption (LISEA4). Both the turbulent combustion model and turbulent flow model were programmed into a simulation tool based on the OpenFOAM library. We validated the concept of this burner for hydrogenrich syngas fuel by using the simulation tool. The simulation results showed the rapid mixing of fuel and air in the air holes, and by using HTC model we confirmed that premixed combustion is the combustion configuration of this multiple-injection burner. In addition, the multiple-injection burner has high flame stability. There is no zone of high temperature in the air hole and high temperature is maintained near the burner. The multiple-injection burner can thus maintain flame stability without any flashback.

Also, the conflict of such an industry is becoming serious in many regions of China. Greenhouse effects of the region’s industrial activities are significantly linked with the transportation for supplying raw materials and paper products. In this research, to comprehensively support the decision-making in the supply-chain management and GHG reduction for the industry, a hybrid life-cycle and inexact programming approach was proposed. The approach can reflect the uncertainty of the supply and demand in real industrial activities. The interval linear programming model could help the solutions for the supply chains in mitigating the greenhouse effect. The developed method was then applied to a pulp and paper mill in the Shandong Province of China for demonstrating its application. The results indicated that the amount of copying paper production in each month would be in the range of 200-800 t.

The hybrid model can effectively assess the low-carbon performance of an urban water resources system in the framework of life-cycle analysis. The environmental impacts and GHGs reduction of urban water resources were firstly considered as the objective and constraint for solving the water allocation problems. The results indicated that the first-stage solutions of surface water conveyance of Dalian could be [3.83×108, 8.25×108] in 2015, and [3.83×108, 9.21×108] in 2020; Meanwhile, the first-stage solutions of surface water conveyance of Dalian could be [4.26×108, 8.68×108] in 2015, and [5.35×108, 10.7×108] in 2020. © 2016 SERSC.","Life-cycle analysis; Two-stage stochastic programming; Urban; Water resources","Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Population statistics; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Surface waters; Economic development; Life cycle analysis; Population growth; Two-stage stochastic programming; Urban; Urban water resources; Water allocations; Water resources systems; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979937071

Changes in solid waste composition and disposal methods, along with urbanisation, can certainly affect greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste. In this study, we analysed the changes in the generation, composition and management of municipal solid waste in Beijing. The changes of greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste management were thereafter calculated. The impacts of municipal solid waste management improvements on greenhouse gas emissions and the mitigation effects of treatment techniques of greenhouse gas were also analysed. Municipal solid waste generation in Beijing has increased, and food waste has constituted the most substantial component of municipal solid waste over the past decade. Since the first half of 1950s, greenhouse gas emission has increased from 6 CO2-eq Gg y-1 to approximately 200 CO2-eq Gg y-1 in the early 1990s and 2145 CO2-eq Gg y-1 in 2013. Landfill gas flaring, landfill gas utilisation and energy recovery in incineration are three techniques of the after-emission treatments in municipal solid waste management. The scenario analysis showed that three techniques might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 22.7%, 4.5% and 9.8%, respectively. In the future, if waste disposal can achieve a ratio of 4:3:3 by landfill, composting and incineration with the proposed after-emission treatments, as stipulated by the Beijing Municipal Waste Management Act, greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste will decrease by 41%. © The Author(s) 2016.","greenhouse gas emission reduction; incineration; landfill; waste composition; Waste generation","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Land fill; Solid wastes; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Waste management; Waste treatment; Disposal methods; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Mitigation effects; Municipal solid waste generation; Scenario analysis; Treatment techniques; Waste composition; Waste generation; Municipal solid waste; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon emission; chemical composition; composting; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; waste disposal; waste treatment; Article; carbon footprint; China; energy recovery; food waste; gas flaring; greenhouse gas; human; incineration; landfill; municipal solid waste; priority journal; solid waste; trend study; waste disposal; air pollutant; analysis; city planning; greenhouse effect; procedures; statistics and numerical data; waste disposal facility; Beijing [China]; China; air pollutant; carbon dioxide; methane; solid waste; Air Pollutants; Beijing; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Urban Renewal; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977616754

Yet due to a lack of legally binding mechanisms and the huge discrepancy between developed and developing countries in their respective responsibilities, little progress has been made in international climate negotiation over the past decade. With the joint endeavor of major greenhouse gas emitters, especially emerging economies like China, the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal, the Paris Climate Agreement, was adopted in December 2015, setting up the legal framework of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and relevant international institutions to combat climate change on a reinterpreted principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR).” Conducive as it is to the institutions and working model of global climate governance, the agreement will attach more responsibilities to developing countries including China.

Energy consumption attributed to water services in urban areas constitutes a significant portion of total energy resources around the world. Since energy is mostly extracted from fossil fuels, urban water infrastructure can be a major contributor to global CO2 emissions. Worldwide, a significant need exists to develop mitigation strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of water consumption, thereby mitigating climate change. This chapter provides an overview of the nexus between water and energy in urban areas and estimates energy consumption in urban water infrastructure and the associated carbon footprint of water consumption. Specific mitigation strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of water consumption discussed in this chapter include water conservation measures, energy-use efficiency in municipal water utilities, and the potential for decentralized water infrastructure in reducing energy consumption. Finally, the chapter discusses the potential for integrating renewable energy resources into urban water infrastructure in order to reduce dependence on fossil fuel-based energy and, thus, reduce the carbon footprint of water consumption. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Climate change; Decentralized water infrastructure; Energy-use efficiency; Renewable energy use; Water conservation; Water infrastructure",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042136369

However, there are conflicting reports on the effects of grazing management on soil carbon. Most comparisons have involved some combination of no grazing, rotational grazing and set stocking. In the present study we compared two adjacent commercial grazing systems, distinguished on the basis of inputs and livestock productivity, located on New England basaltic landscapes experiencing a cool temperate climate. The high-intensity (H) system sustains an average stocking rate of 18 dry sheep equivalents (dse) ha-1, with a turnoff rate of 9dseha-1year-1, with high levels of investment in assets, management and fertiliser. The low-intensity (L) system, with less intensive management and half the fertiliser of the H system, sustains a stocking rate of 9dseha-1, with a turnoff rate of 3dseha-1year-1, which is slightly higher than the regional average. Pasture biomass production was inferred (back-calculated) from stocking rates and animal feed requirements using published data. From the H and L systems, seven paired landscapes from valley floor to upper hillslopes and plateaux were selected. The seventh included a forest reserve. One hundred and eighty-six undisturbed soil cores (0-0.5m depth) were assessed for bulk density, total C and N, particulate C and a range of plant nutrients. There were few differences in CS, soil pH and nutrient levels between H and L grazing systems. Average CS (0-0.3m) in pasture soils was 103Mgha-1, but was higher in the forest soil at 190Mgha-1. Regression of CS versus soil mass was a satisfactory method of dealing with the bias introduced by the higher soil bulk density in perennial pasture systems compared with the forest. The similarity of CS in H and L pasture soils was despite inferred net primary production being 1.9-3.6MgCha-1year-1 greater in H than L systems, implying higher rates of C turnover in the former. The global warming potential of the inferred annual emissions of CH4 and N2O in the H and L systems was equivalent to approximately 19% and 13% of the cycling atmospheric-plant CO2 carbon respectively. © The Authors 2016.","grazing animal emissions; particulate soil carbon","Agriculture; Animals; Fertilizers; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nutrients; Plants (botany); Soils; Biomass productions; Global warming potential; Grazing animals; Grazing management; Intensive management; Net primary production; Particulate soil; Perennial pastures; Soil pollution; biomass; bulk density; climate effect; grazing management; livestock farming; net primary production; particulate organic carbon; pasture; soil carbon; soil emission; stocking density; Australia; New England Tablelands; New South Wales; Animalia; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991491369

Here, we focus specifically on the trade-off between local power saving and increased execution time when work is offloaded from a user’s PC to a cloud environment. We have set up a 14-node private cloud and have executed a variety of applications with different processing demands. We have measured the energy cost at the level of the individual user’s PC, at the level of the cloud, as well as at the two combined, contrasted to the execution time for each application when running on the PC and when running on the cloud. Our results indicate that the tradeoff between energy cost and performance differs considerably between applications of different types. In most cases investigated, the total increase in energy consumption, incurred by running that additional application, was reduced significantly. This shows that research on using cloud computing as a means to reduce the overall carbon footprint of IT is warranted. Of course, the energy gains were more pronounced for energy-selfish users, who are only interested in reducing their own carbon footprint, but these savings came at the expense of performance, with execution time increase ranging from 1% to 84% for different applications. © The Author(s) 2016.","Cloud; Computation offloading; Energy; OpenStack; Performance","Carbon footprint; Cloud computing; Clouds; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Information science; Personal computing; Cloud environments; Computation offloading; End-to-end performance; Energy; Energy efficiency evaluation; OpenStack; Performance; User communities; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989347346

In this study, we focused on a systematic evaluation of TMPA's error characteristics over mainland China, with an improved error-component analysis procedure. We performed the analysis for both the TMPA real-time and research product suite at a daily scale and 0.25° × 0.25° resolution. Our results show that, in general, the error components in TMPA exhibit rather strong regional and seasonal differences. For humid regions, hit bias and missed precipitation are the two leading error sources in summer, whereas missed precipitation dominates the total errors in winter. For semi-humid and semi-arid regions, the error components of two real-time TMPA products show an evident topographic dependency. Furthermore, the missed and false precipitation components have the similar seasonal variation but they counter each other, which result in a smaller total error than the individual components. For arid regions, false precipitation is the main problem in retrievals, especially during winter. On the other hand, we examined the two gauge-correction schemes, i.e., climatological calibration algorithm (CCA) for real-time TMPA and gauge-based adjustment (GA) for post-real-time TMPA. Overall, our results indicate that the upward adjustments of CCA alleviate the TMPA's systematic underestimation over humid region but, meanwhile, unfavorably increased the original positive biases over the Tibetan plateau and Tianshan Mountains. In contrast, the GA technique could substantially improve the error components for local areas. Additionally, our improved error-component analysis found that both CCA and GA actually also affect the hit bias at lower rain rates (particularly for non-humid regions), as well as at higher ones. Finally, this study recommends that future efforts should focus on improving hit bias of humid regions, false error of arid regions, and missed snow events in winter. © 2016 by the authors.","Error component; Remote sensing; Satellite precipitation; TMPA; Uncertainty","Arid regions; Gages; Genetic algorithms; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Satellites; Uncertainty analysis; Error components; Individual components; Satellite precipitation; Satellite precipitation estimates; Systematic evaluation; TMPA; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Uncertainty; Errors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971458087

This study examined the dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) changes, temporal variation of ecosystem service value (ESV), the threatened ecosystem services function in Su-Xi-Chang region, and explore the consequences of unsustainable use of land resources on ESV provision. Remote sensing applications were used to evaluate changes in LULC, and an evaluation method for ESV based on land cover change was applied in 2000, 2005 and 2010. Our study investigated that change in ESV was caused mainly due to the expansion of construction land, which was increased by 88% during the study period. Meanwhile, ESV dropped from 57.1775 × 109 CNY in 2000 to 53.7585 × 109 CNY in 2010. Ecosystem service function for food provision was the most critically affected followed by climate and gas regulation functions respectively. Waste treatment and water supply were the two largest services functions provided by ecosystems of the area. The expansion of construction land, which have due impact on LULC change, is likely responsible for the overall decline in 3.4190 billion CNY ESV of the region. As they have showed the highest ESV and greatest degradation during the study period, protection of farmland and water bodies should be paid due attention by regional land use planning and policy making offices. As a result, sustainable use of land resources and mitigation of the declining ESV of the region will be realized. © 2016, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Ecosystem service value; Land use land cover changes; Su-Xi-Chang region; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977482627

Most of the provinces in China remain Energy Structure dominated by coal, and it is difficult to change in the short term. With growth in energy consumption derived by domestic economic development, carbon emissions increase. How to reduce carbon emissions becomes a hot-button issues. Using logarithmic mean weight Divisia method (LMD), this paper establishes a decomposition model on carbon emissions per capita from provincial perspective and studies the influence from Energy Structure, energy efficiency and economic development to carbon emissions per capita in 30 provinces from 1997 to 2012. The results indicate that the growth of carbon emissions per capita is mainly derived by economic development with exponential growth, while restraining influence from energy efficiency and Energy Structure to carbon emissions per capita is far less than promoting effect caused by economic development. Therefore, it is difficult to restrain increase of carbon emission caused by economic growth only through improving energy efficiency. Reducing carbon emissions by Energy Structure further optimization is urgently needed.","Carbon emissions; Decomposition analysis; Economic development; Energy efficiency; Energy Structure","Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy utilization; Project management; Structural optimization; Carbon emissions; Decomposition analysis; Decomposition model; Economic development; Economic growths; Energy structures; Exponential growth; Fossil energy consumption; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987973864

China faces serious dilemmas of system complexity and information incompleteness and asymmetry in allocating carbon allowance among enterprises. As one of the pilot ETS regions, Shenzhen has launched the first regional cap-and-trade ETS (SZ ETS) in China. Adhering to the overall plan and classification analysis, SZ ETS intends to solve the aforementioned dilemmas by developing innovative allowance allocation policies. A fundamental principle is to allocate allowances based on carbon intensity and actual output, according to which a two-step allocation procedure is constructed. A competitive game mechanism is introduced for allowance allocation among manufacturing enterprises. Empirical results indicate the following: (1) Carbon allowance allocation based on carbon intensity and actual output can mitigate carbon emission growth by reducing CO2 emitted per unit output, and, thus, buffer the shocks of unexpected economic fluctuations to ETS stability; (2) Competitive game allocation may contribute to improving the use of scattered information to enhance the efficiency of information and emission resource allocation. Exploring SZ ETS may provide a reference for formulating future national carbon allowance allocation policies in China and other developing regions. © 2016 by the authors.","Allowance allocation; Carbon emission trading; China; Game theory; Policy innovation","asymmetry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emissions trading; empirical analysis; mitigation; policy strategy; pollution policy; resource allocation; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956630954

Since China is experiencing unprecedented urbanization and industrialization processes, how much impact this has imposed on the earth during economic development worldwide is conspicuous. Therefore, this paper tries to examine the environmental impact in detail and track its changes in a typical city of Central China, Wuhan, based on ecological footprint analysis. By calculating the ecological footprint and its components in terms of biologically productive land areas during the period of 1995-2008, it is found that the ecological footprint increased in fluctuations from 1.48 gha per capita to 2.10 gha per capita, with the carbon footprint contributing most within the whole time period. Compared to the tiny declining biocapacity of the region, a gradually aggravated ecological deficit in the city was observed, which increased from 1.12 gha per capita in 1995 to 1.79 gha per capita in 2008. Component analysis on the trends of the ecological footprint and ecological deficit reveals that the impact on the ecosystem induced by humans' demands for resource production and energy consumption became greater than before, and cutting down the consumption of fossil fuels could reduce the carbon footprint and the overall ecological deficit of the city. © 2016 by the authors.","Biocapacity; Biological resource; Carbon footprint; Ecological deficit; Ecological footprint; Energy consumption; Wuhan","carbon footprint; carrying capacity; ecological footprint; emission control; energy use; environmental impact; fossil fuel; land use; living resource; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965062200

Together with recent air pollution law amendments, these reforms are the latest in a modernization process that has seen the enactment of more than two dozen distinct laws addressing a wide range of environmental issues since the 1990s. China has an extensive environmental regulatory infrastructure, with regulatory agencies at all levels of government. Environmental awareness and activism within China have been growing rapidly, and an active set of environmental civil society organizations is gradually developing. China's system is rooted in the socialist and civil law traditions. Environmental regulatory activity is based primarily on legislation that is enacted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The courts are structured as bureaucratic institutions and wield less power than their counterparts in the United States. Some of China's environmental governance mechanisms have no functional analogue in the United States, such as the Five-Year Plan, the cadre accountability system, and the environmental complaint system. China's unitary government and Communist Party domination at all levels suggest tight centralized control; in practice, environmental governance is largely decentralized.",,"decentralization; environmental legislation; policy reform; pollution control; regulatory framework; China; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020206349

Consequently, several electric taxi pilot projects have been deployed around the world, such as in New York City, USA, Tokyo, Japan, and Shenzhen, China. One of major barriers that impede wide-scale adoption of BEVs in the taxi fleet is the inadequate charging infrastructure. As taxis are usually driven heavily, the daily travel distances are likely to exceed the typical BEV range of 80 to 120 miles. Therefore, it is desirable for electric taxi drivers to charge the battery in a convenient and timely fashion, preferably during the time when they take a break or wait for customers. This paper presents a data driven approach to determine optimal allocation of chargers that maximizes the acceptance of BEVs in the taxi fleet. In particular, GPS tracked vehicle trajectories of conventional gasoline taxis are used to estimate the potential charging demand. At popular locations, multiple taxis might dwell and charge during the same time period. Therefore, an M/G/s/s queuing model is adopted to describe charging congestion effect and estimate the number of lost customers (i.e. the fraction of customers who find the charging station full and are turned away). The optimal charger allocation problem is formulated as an integer program - given the driving and dwell activities of the taxi fleet, determine the number of chargers to be installed at each popular dwell location so as to minimize the rejection probabilities at the charging stations. Genetic algorithm is used to search for the near optimal solution for systematically planning the public charging system. In addition to the taxi fleet, the proposed approach can also be adapted for charging infrastructure planning of other fleet vehicles and private vehicles.","Charging infrastructure planning; Electric taxi; Genetic algorithm; Integer programing; Queueing model","Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Queueing theory; Sales; Secondary batteries; Taxicabs; Tracked vehicles; Vehicles; Charging infrastructures; Conventional gasoline; Electric taxi; Integer programing; Near-optimal solutions; Queueing model; Rejection probability; Vehicle trajectories; Fleet operations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013881750

These, together with the strong absorption in the visible region and rich photo-redox properties, allow the bis-NHC Ir(iii) complexes to act as good photo-catalysts for reductive C-C bond formation from C(sp3/sp2)-Br bonds cleavage using visible-light irradiation (λ &gt; 440 nm). A water-soluble complex with a glucose-functionalized bis-NHC ligand catalysed a visible-light-driven radical cyclization for the synthesis of pyrrolidine in aqueous media. Also, the bis-NHC Ir(iii) complex in combination with a cobalt catalyst can catalyse the visible-light-driven CO2 reduction with excellent turnover numbers (&gt;2400) and selectivity (CO over H2 in gas phase: &gt;95%). Additionally, this series of bis-NHC Ir(iii) complexes are found to localize in and stain endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of various cell lines with high selectivity, and exhibit high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, revealing their potential uses as bioimaging and/or anti-cancer agents. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"C (programming language); Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Cell culture; Cell membranes; Chelation; Cyclization; Diseases; Excited states; Ionic liquids; Irradiation; Ligands; Light; Organic compounds; Reduction; Synthesis (chemical); Endoplasmic reticulum; Excited-state properties; N-heterocyclic carbenes; Photoluminescence quantum yields; Radical cyclizations; Visible-light irradiation; Visible-light-driven; Water-soluble complexes; Iridium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966709038

Herein, we adopt an imidazolate motif as a cocatalyst for TiO2 based CO2 photoreduction. Co-ZIF-9/TiO2 (denoted as ZIFx/T) composite materials were firstly synthesized via an in situ synthetic procedure, and this endowed the fabricated ZIFx/T composites with a well-designed nanostructure in which TiO2 and Co-ZIF-9 were closely bound with each other, thus leading to better charge separation compared to the previously reported physical mixture of ZIF with other semiconductors. Via optimization of the concentration of Co-ZIF-9 in the ZIFx/T composites, 8.79 μmol of CO, 0.99 μmol of CH4, and 1.30 μmol of H2 with a total utilized photoelectron number (UPN) of 28.17 μmol could be obtained over ZIF0.03/T after 10 h of CO2 photoreduction, which is about 2.1 times that of pure TiO2. Linear sweep voltammetry at the pseudo stationary state in a CO2 saturated solution further revealed that Co-ZIF-9 can effectively activate the CO2 molecule and positively shift the onset potential of CO2 reduction for ZIFx/T (x ≤ 0.10). Moreover, photoluminescence spectra suggest that the ZIFx/T composites prepared via the in situ synthetic procedure have better charge separation efficiency with less Co-ZIF-9 content. Accordingly, both better CO2 activation and charge separation contribute to the high activity of the well-designed ZIFx/T nanostructure. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chemical activation; Nanostructures; Photoluminescence; Separation; Titanium dioxide; Charge separations; Linear sweep voltammetry; Photoluminescence spectrum; Physical mixtures; Saturated solutions; Stationary state; Synthetic procedures; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990068242

The SULM can create land-use and social economic scenarios at micro districts level based on an urban economic theory. In order to co-design transformative urban plans with local stake holders, it is important to visualize possible future land-use scenarios. This model makes it possible to endogenously project the residential choice of households, floor space and land area with considering location-specific disaster risk as well as economic and environmental factors. With this model, we can create scenarios for not only urban growth, but also urban shrinking, thus the method could be useful for both developing and developed countries’ situations. In this study, the model was developed and calibrated for the Tokyo Metropolitan Area (Greater Tokyo) at the micro-district level (around 1 km grid) and used to simulate possible land-use scenarios with different urban forms. We have specifically looked at the implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation capacities. This chapter explains mainly the tested three land-use scenarios; (1) Business as usual scenario, (2) Extreme urban compact city scenario, and (3) Combined mitigation and adaptation scenario. The scenarios were assessed with multiple criteria including disaster/energy resilience and environmental sustainability (CO2 emissions, urban climate) and economic benefits. The obtained results have shown that fairly large future economic costs could be saved by additionally considering adaptation (flood risk) in combination with mitigation (CO2 emissions) in the scenario that we call “Wise Shrinking”. Our research suggests that integration of resilience thinking into urban planning is important and promising. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Land use; Mitigation and adaptation; Spatially explicit model; Synergy and trade-off; Urban form",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034817599

The X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements reveal the crystalline nature of the phosphor sample. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the different samples have been studied using 266 and 394 nm radiation, which give an intense red emission at 612 nm due to 5D0 → 7F2 transition. The addition of Yb3+ in the Eu3+ doped sample reduces the emission intensity of Eu3+ bands in the visible region continuously whereas in the NIR region, the intensity of the Yb3+ band first increases up to 2 mol% and then decreases. This is due to cooperative downconversion energy transfer from Eu3+ to Yb3+ ions and concentration quenching. The decay curve analyses of different samples reveal an efficient energy transfer from Eu3+ to Yb3+ ions. The quantum efficiency (QE) has been calculated for different concentrations of Yb3+ ions and is estimated to be 197%.

A field experiment was conducted at Vivekananda Institute of Hill Agriculture, Almora, India in a 30-year-old Quercus leucotrichophora to evaluate the changes in vegetation carbon pools as a function of four cutting management (1m, 2m, local practice, and above 1/3rd part undisturbed), under high density plantation (1.0m × 1.0m). Tree cutting management significantly (&lt;0.01) influenced the carbon stocks of Q. leucotrichophora trees. Total vegetation (aboveground + below ground) carbon stock was highest for the above 1/3rd part undisturbed (356.9 Mg ha-1) and lowest in the cutting at 1m (86.7 Mg ha-1). Overall, less disturbance to stands promote carbon storage, but intense cutting management (e.g., cutting at 1m) may adversely affect tree growth and productivity, reducing vegetation carbon pools. Cutting management effects are very much visible on carbon stock of Q. leucotrichophora under high density plantation. By extension, stand cutting exerts negative or positive feedbacks on biomass accretion, which may also influence the amount of carbon sequestered by the trees. © 2016, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Biomass; Carbon stock; Cutting management; High density plantation; Himalaya; Oak plantation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967185392

Design/methodology/approach: Local organisational elites designed/conceptualised the concept, where it can be operated organisationally and in local organisational context that provides new ways and methods to develop conceptual framework (Table I), which sheds light on involvement of poor and underprivileged members in decision-making process and distribution of benefit on equity basis. Findings: The findings will lead to a positive change through the organisational elite model through both reorganising organisations and restructuring of power with change in the society and reduce the impact of rational choices, vested interests of elites (leaders of local organisation) and political factors, which are otherwise playing a game or tragedy of commons. Research limitations/implications: Because of the limited resources and time, the authors are unable to verify it on the other development line agencies such as drinking water scheme, livestock, health and cooperative. Practical implications: It considerably appears that the impacts are very sound to conclude from the review of above models of elites that provide a very clear understanding and useful conceiving lens to formulate how participation occurs in the executive committee of the community forestry user groups (CFUG) and community-based organisations based on three key elements. First are the caste and the caste structure of the community. Second is the wealth status of the individual, and third is power created both from wealth and caste. This should be determined from the local organisational elite model (Table I) about the nature of interactions on the executive of the CFUGs and other vehicles of local community-based development organisations. Social implications: Local organisations will provide an opportunity in reality to both elites and non-elites to considerably change, make aware and create a realistic situation to determine the dialectical opportunity to develop relationship, interaction and configuration between elite and non-elite members both outside and inside of the local organisations. Originality/value: It has not been found in literatures yet such sort of concept developed in development field particularly in the development activities performed by participation of local users. Hence, it is certainly original conceptual framework. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CBNRM; Elite model; Elite power; Local organisation; Organisational analysis; Power structure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995897441

This study analyses future steel production globally, with focus on the rising availability of steel scrap, and implications for steel production capacity planning. We evaluate the development of steel demand, using the Steel Optimization Model, which provides a regiondetailed representation of technologies, energy and material flows and trade activities. We link it to the Scrap Availability Assessment Model, which estimates the theoretical steel scrap availability. The modelling horizon stretches until 2100, with 2050 serving as a benchmark for the analysis. The scenarios require a range of inputs to estimate regional pathways for steel demand including demographic development and economic growth, and these affect scrap availability. The results show that aggregated crude steel production will evolve into an almost balanced split between the primary production route using iron ore and secondary production from steel scrap by 2050 and the share of EAF will exceed by 2060 the production in BOF globally. The results also show a global increase in scrap use from 611 Mtonnes in 2015 to 1.5 Gtonnes in 2050, with highest growth being for post-consumer scrap. In 2050, almost 50 % of post-consumer scrap is expected to be traded, with the main exporter being China and major importing regions being Africa, India and other developing Asian countries. Surprisingly, the increase in scrap use does not depend much on the introduction of a global carbon price until 2050. The results are important for producers contemplating new investments, since regional availability, quality and trade patterns of scrap will influence production route choices, possibly in favor of secondary routes. Also policy instruments such as carbon taxation may affect investment choices, and favor more energy eficient and less carbon-intensive emerging technologies. © 2018 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Based on the above findings, a framework is conceptualized as an attempt to strengthen the climate-adaptive open space design strategy. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","design strategy; health perception; Microclimate; site configuration","Atmospheric temperature; Forestry; Health; Population statistics; Surveys; Built environment; Climatic conditions; Design strategies; Empirical studies; Environment assessments; Health perceptions; Microclimate; site configuration; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012960872

Understanding how humans move and select the transportation mode throughout a large-scale transportation network is vital for urban congestion prediction and transportation scheduling. In this study, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g., GPS records and transportation network data), and we build an intelligent system, namely DeepTransport, for simulating and predicting human mobility and transportation mode at a citywide level. The key component of DeepTransport is based on the deep learning architecture that that aims to understand human mobility and transportation patterns from big and heterogeneous data. Based on the learning model, given any time period, specific location of the city or people's observed movements, our system can automatically simulate or predict the persons' future movements and their transportation mode in the large-scale transportation network.

Modification of fracture apertures by reactive flows is strongly affected by non-reactive, non-wetting fluids that limit the fracture surface area and void volume that is accessible to the reactive fluids. An experimental investigation was performed to examine the controls on mineral precipitation within a fracture when mineral precipitation occurs with and without the generation of gas. Several differences were observed in the results from the experiments using the two chemical approaches for generating precipitates. The pore-filling precipitates (particles formed in solution) were more uniform in size and were thicker than the surface adhering precipitates (particles formed on fracture surfaces). The acoustic response for fractures with pore-filling precipitates reached a steady-state after 2 hours while fractures with surface adhering precipitates took longer to equilibrate because of the presence of CO2 that was generated during the chemical reaction at liquid-surface interfaces. In surface adhering precipitation case, the generation of CO2 limited accessibility of calcium carbonate pre-nucleation polymers to the entire void volume of the fractures. On the other hand, fractures with pore-filling precipitates exhibited a more uniform acoustic response across the fracture plane than fractures with surface adhering precipitates. Understanding the effect of mineral precipitation on acoustic wave attenuation provides a path forward for long-term monitoring of seal integrity.",,"Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Filling; Hydrogen embrittlement; Interface states; Minerals; Phase interfaces; Precipitation (chemical); Rock mechanics; Surface reactions; Wetting; Calcite precipitation; Experimental investigations; Fracture apertures; Fracture geometries; Fracture surface area; Liquid-surface interface; Long term monitoring; Mineral precipitation; Fracture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010366339

These modifications have drastically affected the structures and functions of natural and agricultural ecosystems in terrestrial and aquatic areas. In this manuscript, we first present a modified view of the global N cycle that includes N transport, conversion, and exchange processes. Second, several crucial issues concerning N balance, including N deposition and excessive addition and the dynamics of N and other nutrients, are reviewed. Third, the effects of climate change factors, including water status, warming, and elevated CO2 concentrations, on N balance and the N cycle and their interactions within and with other environmental factors are outlined. Finally, intervention strategies for improving N balance and N cycling to address rapid continual climatic change and socio-economic development are presented and discussed. It is highlighted that the altered N balance and N cycle between the geosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere have produced the profoundly critical challenge of maintaining N levels within an appropriate range, which should be considered by relevant people and sectors, including researchers, managers, and policy makers from ecological, environmental, and sustainable development sectors. © 2016 Published by NRC Research Press.","Climate change; Excessive nitrogen addition; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen management; Terrestrial ecosystems","Aquatic ecosystems; Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Nitrogen; Planning; Sustainable development; Nitrogen additions; Nitrogen cycles; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen management; Terrestrial ecosystems; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971450226

Coupling microsimulation model runs with emissions modeling can make fast assessments possible in transportation air quality planning. This research developed a tool with automated linkage between the Vissim microsimulation model and the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) model. To link the two models, the research team used MOVES-Matrix, which was prepared by iteratively running MOVES across all possible iterations of vehicle source type, fuel, environmental and operating conditions, and other parameters (hundreds of millions of model runs) to create a multidimensional emission rate lookup matrix. A Vissim simulation of the major arterial roads and freeways at I-85 and Jimmy Carter Boulevard in Gwinnett County, Georgia, provided the case study for this MOVES-matrix application. The researchers present predicted emissions and the results of a sensitivity analysis to identify the potential impacts of various internal Vissim modeling parameters (such as minimum headway, maximum deceleration rate for cooperative braking, and emergency stop distance) on a case study's emissions outputs. The sensitivity analysis found that internal Vissim parameters impacted emissions and that proper care should be taken in using Vissim for emissions analysis at the corridor and link level. The case study demonstrates that Vissim coupled with MOVES-Matrix can be an effective tool for emissions analysis. © 2016, National Research Council.

Thus, accurate prediction of the intake charge mass flow rate is paramount. Current speed-density air mass-flow prediction techniques require extensive calibration for predicting volumetric efficiency, while mass air flow (MAF) meter based approaches suffer from a loss of accuracy during transients. This work aims to provide an alternative, i.e. a model based air charge estimation algorithm that can reduce calibration effort and provide a universal solution across engine platforms. An additional objective is to minimize the number of required sensors and associated cost. The foundation is established with a 0-D physics-based air charge model, where air flow through intake and exhaust valves is modeled on a crank-angle basis, without the need to measure in-cylinder pressure. The proposed algorithm solves differential equations for cylinder pressure and mass flow rate in/out of the cylinder to simultaneously obtain instantaneous pressure and mass-flow estimations, hence eliminating the need to install cylinder pressure transducers. An additional benefit is the robustness of the new model, due to its ability to self-compensate for an error in the intake runner pressure or initial estimation of the cylinder pressure. The model has been validated with GT-Power simulations and steady-state engine tests with multiple actuator sweeps. Transient tests and real-time implementations were performed as well.

In a flight over Georgia, organic aerosol (OA) is enhanced downwind of the Harllee Branch power plant but not the Scherer power plant. We find that the OA enhancement is likely caused by the rapid reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) in the sulfate-rich plume of Harllee Branch, which was emitting at least 3 times more sulfur dioxide (SO2) than Scherer, and more aerosol sulfate was produced downwind. The contrast in the evolution of isoprene-derived OA concentration between two power plants with different SO2 emissions provides an opportunity to investigate the magnitude and mechanisms of particle sulfate on isoprene-derived OA formation. We estimate that 1 μgsm-3 reduction of sulfate would decrease the isoprene-derived OA by 0.23 ± 0.08 μgsm-3. Based on a parameterization of the IEPOX heterogeneous reactions, we find that the effects of sulfate on isoprene-derived OA formation in the power plant plume arises from enhanced particle surface area and particle acidity, which increases both IEPOX uptake to particles and subsequent aqueous-phase reactions, respectively. The observed relationships between isoprene-OA, sulfate, particle pH, and particle water in previous field studies are explained using these findings. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

Taking Wuhan city, Central China, as a case example, we explore the quantitative relationship between land use (built-up land, water bodies, and vegetation) and air quality (SO2, NO2, and PM10) based on nine ground-level monitoring sites from a long-term spatio-temporal perspective in 2007-2014. Five buffers with radiuses from 0.5 to 4 km are created at each site in geographical information system (GIS) and areas of land use categories within different buffers at each site are calculated. Socio-economic development, energy use, traffic emission, industrial emission, and meteorological condition are taken into consideration to control the influences of those factors on air quality. Results of bivariate correlation analysis between land use variables and annual average concentrations of air pollutants indicate that land use categories have discriminatory effects on different air pollutants, whether for the direction of correlation, the magnitude of correlation or the spatial scale effect of correlation. Stepwise linear regressions are used to quantitatively model their relationships and the results reveal that land use significantly influence air quality. Built-up land with one standard deviation growth will cause 2% increases in NO2 concentration while vegetation will cause 5% decreases. The increases of water bodies with one standard deviation are associated with 3%-6% decreases of SO2 or PM10 concentration, which is comparable to the mitigation effect of meteorology factor such as precipitation. Land use strategies should be paid much more attention while making air pollution reduction policies. © 2016 by the authors.","Air pollution; China; Land use; Urbanization","Air pollution; Air quality; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy utilization; Geographic information systems; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Precipitation (meteorology); Quality control; Statistics; Sulfur dioxide; Vegetation; Annual average concentration; Bivariate correlations; China; Environmental problems; Meteorological condition; Socio-economic development; Stepwise linear regression; Urbanization; Land use; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; correlation; land use change; multivariate analysis; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970003856

The results demonstrated: 1. During 1999-2013 the decoupling index between agricultural carbon emissions and agricultural economic growth showed a “decoupling, hooking, and decoupling” three-state process. This was in the relative decoupling stage between 1999 and 2004, the relative hook state between 2005 and 2009, and the relative decoupling stage between 2010 and 2013. According to the elastic index, the relationship was in a strong decoupling state between 2000 and 2002, a weak decoupling state between 2003 and 2004, an expansive negative decoupling state between 2005 and 2009, and a weak decoupling state between 2010 and 2013. 2. Hotan is an area whose carbon emissions intensity is higher than that of the China and Xinjiang regions, is a serious lag on the decoupling stage to the nation and the region, and cannot achieve its agricultural carbon emission reduction targets by 2030. Therefore, a low carbon agriculture economy is the best strategic choice to develop its economy and address global climate change in Hotan. Thus, we have proposed policy recommendations including the establishment of a low carbon sense, the change of agricultural development way, the development of agricultural S&T, and the establishment of an incentive mechanism. © 2016, HARD Publishing Company.

With the dual naphthalimide planes, BNAP can act as a double-channel rotor, which can output the shorter emission in the twisted state and the longer emission in the planar state. Because of the restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) effects, BNAP showed strong emission character in high viscosity circumstances. The longer and moderate emission in aggregates is attributed to the synergetic effects of RIR and intramolecular planarization. As a molecular rotor with dramatic changes in both emission wavelength and intensity, BNAP could be developed for the rapid detection of viscosity. The probe generates a logarithmic response to the viscosity of a glycerol/water system with different ratios. Furthermore, the probe exhibits high sensitivity to viscosity-related temperature variations. This property is very important because temperature always changes the surrounding viscosity in many biological systems and mechanical systems. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Fluorescence; Probes; Sensitivity analysis; Bisnaphthalimide; Emission wavelength; High viscosities; Logarithmic response; Mechanical systems; Synergetic effect; Temperature variation; Thermo-responsive; Viscosity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975466811

The results show that the Ability-to-Pay criterion is better than the other criteria, as it can lead to fewer macroeconomic costs and welfare losses; narrow the economic gap between the eastern, central and western regions; and guide investment into the western regions.

This article reviews the current state of known science on how the global climate has been changing in recent decades, as well as likely climate change trends in the near future. The article focuses in depth on how climatic variables affect fungal infection and production of specific mycotoxins in food crops, and how near-future climatic changes will shape the prevalence of these mycotoxins in crops in different parts of the world. Because of regulatory limits set on maximum allowable levels of mycotoxins in food and feed, growers will experience economic losses if climatic factors cause certain mycotoxins to become more prevalent. A case study is presented of how maize growers in the United States will experience increased economic losses due to slightly higher aflatoxin levels in maize, even if those levels may still be below regulatory limits. We discuss the overall expected economic impacts of climate change-induced mycotoxin contamination worldwide - not just marketrelated losses, but also losses to human and animal health and risks to food security. Aflatoxin is the mycotoxin that is most likely to increase under near-future climate scenarios; and thus is likely to pose the greatest amount of economic risk of all the mycotoxins. © 2016 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Aflatoxin; Deoxynivalenol; Economic impacts; Fumonisin; Global climate; Ochratoxin","aflatoxin; fumonisin; mycotoxin; ochratoxin; vomitoxin; animal health; Article; climate change; environmental economics; food crop; food security; global climate; maize; mycosis; prevalence; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012050880

The multiphase flow properties of impurities in the CO2-brine system in porous media are the key to understanding the mechanisms and nature of geological CO2 sequestration projects. In this study experiments were performed on the multiphase flow process of CO2/N2/brine system at conditions similar to aquifer pressure and temperature using the X-ray CT technique. Experiments at various rates of CO2 injection that affect saturation and spatial distribution of injected gas were conducted in this experiment. The results indicate an strong relationship between gas saturation and porosity distribution in porous media, and the increasing capillary number leads to lower saturation in downward injection. Small capillary numbers and higher fractional flows in the gas phase both result in uniform saturation maps in the core. The CO2 clusters seem larger at high capillary numbers and the high CO2 collection regions extend based on the saturation distribution in the lower CO2 fraction as the flow pattern stays similar as the same capillary number. CO2 containing N2 tends to retain more correlative relationships at different gas injection rates compared with the pure CO2 stream. Even though both distribution and saturation are storage concerns, the N2 component has little effect on gas distribution, whereas it brings about an overall increase in the saturation for most experiments. Thus the N2 enhanced the storage performance of CO2. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Aquifers; Capillarity; Carbon; Carbon capture; Flow patterns; Gases; Multiphase flow; Porous materials; Sulfur dioxide; Two phase flow; Correlative relationship; Gas injection rate; Multi-phase flow properties; Porosity distributions; Preliminary analysis; Pressure and temperature; Saturation distribution; Storage performance; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976417346

Here, by forestalling SIRT1 carbonylated inactivation in aged heart, we determined the benefits of activation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) on the autophagy. In this study, the ALDH2 KO mice progressively developed age-related heart dysfunction and showed reduction in the life span, which strongly suggests that ALDH2 ablation leads to cardiac aging. What's more, aged hearts displayed a significant decrease ALDH2 activity, resulting in accumulation of 4-HNE-protein adducts and protein carbonyls, impairment in the autophagy flux, and, consequently, deteriorated cardiac function after starvation. Sustained Alda- 1 (selective ALDH2 activator) treatment increased cardiac ALDH2 activity and abrogated these effects. Using SIRT1 deficient heterozygous (Sirt1+/-) mice, we found that SIRT1 was necessary for ALDH2 activation-induced autophagy. We further demonstrated that ALDH2 activation attenuated SIRT1 carbonylation and improved SIRT1 activity, thereby increasing the deacetylation of nuclear LC3 and FoxO1. Sequentially, ALDH2 enhanced SIRT1 regulates LC3-Atg7 interaction and FoxO1 increased Rab7 expression, which were both necessary and sufficient for restoring autophagy flux. These results highlight that both accumulation of proteotoxic carbonyl stress linkage with autophagy decline contribute to heart senescence. ALDH2 activation is adequate to improve the autophagy flux by reducing the carbonyl modification on SIRT1, which in turn plays an important role in maintaining cardiac health during aging.","Aging; ALDH2; Autophagy; Carbonyl stress; Gerotarget; SIRT1","aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 2; protein p16; protein p53; Rab7 protein; sirtuin 1; transcription factor FKHR; 1,3 benzodioxole derivative; aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 2; ALDH2 protein, mouse; Atg7 protein, mouse; autophagy related protein 7; benzamide derivative; Foxo1 protein, mouse; MAP1LC3 protein, mouse; microtubule associated protein; N-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)-2,6-dichlorobenzamide; Rab protein; Rab7 protein; Sirt1 protein, mouse; sirtuin 1; transcription factor FKHR; aging; animal cell; Article; autophagy; carbonylation; controlled study; deacetylation; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; heart ejection fraction; heart function; male; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear localization signal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; aging; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; autophagy; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; cardiac muscle; chemistry; enzyme activation; genetics; knockout mouse; metabolism; physiology; protein carbonylation; starvation; Aging; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial; Animals; Autophagy; Autophagy-Related Protein 7; Benzamides; Benzodioxoles; Enzyme Activation; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Myocardium; Protein Carbonylation; rab GTP-Binding Proteins; Sirtuin 1; Starvation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962222721

To manage this avoidable burden in the United Kingdom (UK), government policies and interventions are implemented. In practice, this procedure is interdisciplinary in action and multi-dimensional in context. Here, we demonstrate how Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can be used as a decision support tool to facilitate priority setting for environmental public health interventions within local authorities. We combine modelling and expert elicitation to gather evidence on the impacts and ranking of interventions. Methods: To present the methodology, we consider a hypothetical scenario in a UK city. We use MCDA to evaluate and compare the impact of interventions to reduce the health burden associated with four environmental health hazards and rank them in terms of their overall performance across several criteria. For illustrative purposes, we focus on heavy goods vehicle controls to reduce outdoor air pollution, remediation to control levels of indoor radon, carbon monoxide and fitting alarms, and encouraging cycling to target the obesogenic environment. Regional data was included as model evidence to construct a ratings matrix for the city. Results: When MCDA is performed with uniform weights, the intervention of heavy goods vehicle controls to reduce outdoor air pollution is ranked the highest. Cycling and the obesogenic environment is ranked second. Conclusions: We argue that a MCDA based approach provides a framework to guide environmental public health decision makers. This is demonstrated through an online interactive MCDA tool. We conclude that MCDA is a transparent tool that can be used to compare the impact of alternative interventions on a set of pre-defined criteria. In our illustrative example, we ranked the best intervention across the equally weighted selected criteria out of the four alternatives. Further work is needed to test the tool with decision makers and stakeholders. © 2016 Heaviside et al.",,"carbon monoxide; radon; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; decision support system; ecosystem health; emission inventory; indoor radon; multicriteria analysis; pollution control; prioritization; public health; risk assessment; state role; air and air related phenomena; air pollution control; air quality; Article; cycling; decision making; decision support system; ecosystem restoration; environment; environmental health; exposure; health care policy; health hazard; metabolic equivalent; motor vehicle; Multi Criteria Decision Analysis; obesogenic environment; outdoor air; priority journal; United Kingdom; city; health status indicator; human; public health; United Kingdom; Cities; Decision Support Techniques; Environmental Health; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Public Health; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995757538

Two methods of ground improvement, dynamic compaction and aggregate piers were the first two options considered, the third option was driven pile foundations, and the final option was a full removal of the unsuitable fill material and replacement with imported structural fill. Results of the study indicated that under the assumed conditions, ground improvement programs can have a carbon footprint on the order of 2 to 6% of the footprint associated with full removal of the fill material to send to a landfill. As such, this paper recommends that further evaluation be given towards establishing a new LEED credit related to geotechnical construction issues, or at minimum, establishing a carbon footprint reduction scorecard that could be incorporated into the existing LEED infrastructure.",,"Energy efficiency; Environmental design; Geotechnical engineering; Piles; Construction projects; Dynamic compaction; Fill materials; Green buildings; Ground improvement; Ground improvement project; LEED rating system; United states green building councils; Carbon footprint",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985038514

Friction drilling, as forming process with subsequent manufacturing of threads, offers the opportunity to produce an internal thread in lightweight profiles with a usable thread depth larger than the profile thickness, making use of local material expansion. Moreover, the direct manufacturing offers a huge potential for time and cost saving in comparison to conventional thread machining. Microscopic-based characterization of mechanical properties of aluminium AlSi10Mg and magnesium AZ31 internal threads in thin-walled profile specimens was carried out using tensile tests and fatigue tests in tensile loading range. The internal threads were chipless manufactured by means of thread forming. Variations in the geometric process parameter wall thickness were compared. Differences between the AlSi10Mg chill casting alloy and the AZ31 continuous casting alloy in maximum tolerable loads and fatigue limits were correlated with the production-related profile qualities of the profile specimens. The maximum tolerable loads increase linearly with increasing wall thickness of the specimens, whereby AlSi10Mg specimens were about 20-24% lower in the quasi-static range and about 37-47% lower in the cyclic range in comparison to AZ31 specimens due to oval forms of the core holes caused by the friction drilling process.

The more stress and threat facing community-based rights and resources, the more purposive their governance regimes become. This explains why despite the odds, the community-based system of landholding survives and evolves with the times as a vibrant framework for owning land for rural majorities in most agrarian states. Recognition that communities own their expansive lands, including millions of hectares of forests and rangelands, offers enormous potential for cheap and sustainable resource conservation and climate mitigation. Moving millions out of conditions of tenure insecurity will also safeguard livelihoods and contribute to the peace and stability that eludes so many agrarian nations. For agrarian states following classical paths to wealth creation, it remains convenient for gov-ernments to keep millions of hectares of valuable lands close to hand as disposable assets for companies and well-heeled elites despite the fact these lands are traditionally the customary property of their citizen. Maturation of local lands into community lands with clearer perimeter boundaries and comprising increasingly well-defined distinctions between family and common properties, has been a noticeable transition. Critical awareness of the weak legal status of communities' land rights is also rising. Globalization aids this, as each new surge reaches more deeply into their domains.",,"globalization; land rights; land tenure; landholding; livelihood; rural landscape; state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020175342

Building on the successes of the 8 Millennium Development Goals, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals officially came into force on 1 January 2016. They include provisions on: poverty, hunger, health, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, energy, livelihood and economic growth, industry and infrastructure, inequality, cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, sustainable water resources, sustainable land resources, governance and justice, and global partnerships. Each goal has specific, integrated targets to ensure measurable, transparent progress by 2030. Though the SDGs are not legally binding, all countries agreed to build out national frameworks for achievement of the goals. According to the United Nations, each country has the ""primary responsibility for follow-up and review of the progress made in implementing the Goals, which will require quality, accessible and timely data collection."" Geospatial technologies (GIS, remote sensing) are a cost-effective way of collecting information about large, sparsely populated areas and has already been integrated successfully in many programs on agriculture, land use planning, disaster management, climate change, and other SDG areas. This paper will explore how earth observation technology can be used to address some of challenges faced in achieving the SDGs, particularly in less-traditional areas such as health, governance, gender, and small-scale infrastructure.

Understanding climate change effects on AMF, and the resulting plant responses, is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses at regional and global scales. We investigated how the effects of climate change on AMF-plant symbioses are mediated by soil water availability, soil nutrient availability, and vegetation dynamics. Methods: We used a combination of a greenhouse experiment and a manipulative climate change experiment embedded within a Mediterranean climate gradient in the Pacific Northwest, USA to examine this question. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine the direct and indirect effects of experimental warming on AMF colonization. Results: Warming directly decreased AMF colonization across plant species and across the climate gradient of the study region. Other positive and negative indirect effects of warming, mediated by soil water availability, soil nutrient availability, and vegetation dynamics, canceled each other out. Discussion: A warming-induced decrease in AMF colonization would likely have substantial consequences for plant communities and ecosystem function. Moreover, predicted increases in more intense droughts and heavier rains for this region could shift the balance among indirect causal pathways, and either exacerbate or mitigate the negative, direct effect of increased temperature on AMF colonization. © 2016 Wilson et al.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Climate change; Experimental warming; Mediterranean; Nutrient availability; PacificNorthwest; Plant-nutrient interactions; Structural equation models","analysis of variance; arbuscular mycorrhiza; Article; climate change; controlled study; fungal colonization; greenhouse effect; mineralization; nonhuman; plant community; prairie; soil analysis; soil temperature; temperature; vegetation dynamics; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977138645

GHG reporting protocols fairly uniformly account for methanol combustion as a Scope-1 emission and manufacturing energy and emissions as a Scope-3 GHG source. Only ICLEI’s (2012) more-recently-published U.S. Community Protocol’s identifies a methodology to account for the liberation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributable to the addition of methanol. The prior oversight was likely attributable to a belief that CO2 produced through activated-sludge-process respiration is biogenic; raw sewage carbon being previously un-sequestered prior to entering a water resource recovery facility (WRRF). However, the biogenic categorization does not apply to fossil-fuel-derived carbon sources added for WRRF operations. This paper provides a case study as to the significance of these emissions using the Blue Plains Advanced Water Treatment Plant (AWTP) in Washington, DC where methanol CO2 represented 70% and 82% of the AWTP’s Scope-1 GHG emissions, before and after enhanced digestion upgrades, respectively.

Stochastic parameterization relaxes this assumption, by sampling the subgrid variability in a computationally inexpensive manner. This study shows that the simulated climatological state of the ocean is improved in many respects by implementing a simple stochastic parameterization of ocean eddies into a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. Simulations from a high-resolution, eddy-permitting ocean model are used to calculate the eddy statistics needed to inject realistic stochastic noise into a low-resolution, non-eddy-permitting version of the same model. A suite of four stochastic experiments is then run to test the sensitivity of the simulated climate to the noise definition by varying the noise amplitude and decorrelation time within reasonable limits. The addition of zero-mean noise to the ocean temperature tendency is found to have a nonzero effect on the mean climate. Specifically, in terms of the ocean temperature and salinity fields both at the surface and at depth, the noise reduces many of the biases in the low-resolution model and causes it to more closely resemble the high-resolution model. The variability of the strength of the global ocean thermohaline circulation is also improved. It is concluded that stochastic ocean perturbations can yield reductions in climate model error that are comparable to those obtained by refining the resolution, but without the increased computational cost. Therefore, stochastic parameterizations of ocean eddies have the potential to significantly improve climate simulations. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Coupled models; General circulation models; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Parameterization; Stochastic models","Climate change; Climate models; Oceanography; Parameterization; Stochastic systems; Coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation model; Coupled models; General circulation model; High-resolution models; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Stochastic experiment; Sub-grid variability; Stochastic models; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate modeling; eddy; general circulation model; numerical model; parameterization; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001038120

Given the connection between energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change and the reality that the built environment emits around half of total emissions, the construction industry has considerable potential to reduce emissions and a key role in mitigating global warming. Other local challenges include for example loss of species and habitats, social degradation of neighborhoods, and an overall erosion of sustainability. Urbanisation patterns and the lifestyles of urban dwellers also affect the planet on wider scales and contribute to shaping bio-physical processes on planetary scales and affect how humans mentally connect with the Biosphere. However there is evidence our current understanding of the concept of sustainability, and thus sustainable development, is fragmented and unclear. There are a plethora of terms used to cover sustainable buildings, such as ecological, green, Gaian, zero energy, eco-friendly and environmental; all of which come in, and out, of fashion over time; do they mean the same thing or are they different? Furthermore, do the stakeholders within the built environment demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept of sustainability or; are they muddled and confused? The consequence of unclear thinking and a lack of understanding is that ultimately the built environment stakeholders are unlikely to deliver ‘sustainability’ efficiently or even at all, with the broader and more onerous consequences for society as a whole. In addition what are the implications for education and should academics be broadening the debate? This lecture examines the environmental, economic, social, political and philosophical thinking underpinning the concept of sustainable development and shows how different perspectives reflect very different ways of thinking about sustainability and sustainable development. It aims to create a better understanding while offering creative solutions. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Corporate social responsibility; Sustainable development; Sustainable urbanism; United Nations; Urban sprawl",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060590315

In 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated an Information Collection Request (ICR) as part of their emission standard review and residual risk evaluation for the existing refinery New Source Performing Standards (NSPS) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards. The ICR included a stack testing component, part of which required 10 refineries to stack test their FCCUs for selected organic and inorganic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), including HCN. The results of the stack tests demonstrated that IICN emissions from FCCUs were higher than previously considered. As such, the EPA revised the previously published AP-42 emissions factor and updated MACT Subpart UUU to include an HCN stack testing requirement (in addition to other changes). Currently, the EPA maintains that complete combustion is the best method to control HCN emissions, and they use carbon monoxide as a surrogate for limiting HCN emissions, since both are products of incomplete combustion. This approach is advantageous for industry since it does not require any additional controls, monitors, or best management practices outside of those already required for carbon monoxide (CO). I lowever, the EPA and state agencies may use the results of the required HCN stack tests to establish new emission standards and or operating limitations if they feel the HCN testing data warrants such measures. The EPA and select state agencies are requiring supplemental information be provided in addition to the stack test results so they can further evaluate whether HCN emissions are influenced by the operational configuration of the FCCU and if CO is truly the best surrogate as opposed to other operational parameters. This paper used historical stack test results, new and more recent stack results, and other FCCU operating data to evaluate whether there may be potential correlations in advance of EPA review. FCCU parameters evaluated include comparing units with and without CO boilers, units with wet gas scrubbers as compared to units with particulate-only control devices (e.g., electrostatic precipitators fESPs)), and other operating parameters including feed nitrogen content, regenerator temperature, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and CO emissions, and the use and non-use of combustion promotors. The results of the correlation tests strongly indicate that FCCUs with CO boilers should be considered separate from those without CO boilers and that FCCUs that used combustion promotors also had statistically smaller HCN emissions than units that did not use promotors. Additionally, the data indicates that units with wet gas scrubbers did not have statistically different averages than those units operating particulate-only controls. The results of the remaining parameters evaluated indicate that there was either no observational relationship or the data was too limited to draw any statistically significant conclusion. Although the EPA and state agencies could potentially use the results of HCN stack tests to require new controls, monitors, or best management practices, it should be noted that several refineries have conducted health effects reviews to demonstrate there is no impact to the public health and welfare. These reviews were conducted using emission factors from FCCUs of all configurations and those that do and do not use combustion promoters. In all cases, the nature of the regenerator vent and its dispersive qualities showed that HCN emissions do not have a significant impact on the public health and welfare. Therefore, it should be maintained that complete combustion is the best control of HCN emissions, and CO is an appropriate surrogate to establish federally enforceable limits.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019028899

However, GHG emissions are strongly affected by the type of waste management system (WMS) used. For example, CH4 emissions increase substantially under anaerobic conditions that occur in many WMSs. There is a need for improved estimates at regional and national scales of the effect of WMSs on GHG emissions and identification of opportunities and associated costs to mitigate these emissions. As New York State is the fourth largest dairy producer in the country, our objectives were to quantify (i) the changes in WMS and associated GHG emissions over time, (ii) a methane conversion factor (MCF) derived from existing data from three covered manure storage units in New York, and (iii) the benefit and cost of installing covers and flares to destroy CH4 from existing storage units. We found that GHG emissions from changing manure management increased from 0.7 Tg carbon dioxide equivalents per year (CO2e yr-1) in 1992 to 1.6 Tg CO2e yr-1 in 2012. We derived an MCF of 0.61 based on data from dairy manure storage units with covers that captured and flared CH4 in 2010 and used this MCF to project GHG reductions for a statewide mitigation scenario in year 2022.

On 1 June 2017, he announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. More generally, the new Trump administration has been vocal about changing US climate and environmental policies. This paper reviews these proposed changes, potential obstacles, and possible future paths. These include US membership in the Paris Agreement, the US NDC submitted to the Paris Agreement, and US domestic policies such as the EPA “Clean Power Plan” and other agency rules. So far, the Trump administration has taken some steps, but it has not made final policy changes. Its attempts at policy changes will take time, perhaps several years to withdraw from Paris and to conduct new agency rulemakings. They may be challenged by others, such as in other countries, in Congress, in the States, and in court. Litigation could seek to require agencies to justify their policy changes, to carry out statutory responsibilities, to use a social cost of carbon, and to protect the public trust. The effects of potential policy changes on the economy, emissions, and international relations remain to be seen. Beyond policy changes that may be made by the Trump administration, EPA and other agencies, another path may be through new legislative action in Congress. One avenue to seek bipartisan support for legislation in Congress might be a deal to remove EPA regulatory authority over greenhouse gases while also simultaneously adopting a new carbon tax.

The study used data from regional datasets and case study farms, and applied new methods for assessing water use using detailed farm water balances and water stress weighting. Land occupation was assessed with reference to the proportion of arable and non-arable land and allocation of liveweight (LW) and greasy wool was handled using a protein mass method. Fossil fuel energy demand ranged from 2.5 to 7.0 MJ/kg LW, fresh water consumption from 58.1 to 238.9 L/kg LW, stress-weighted water use from 2.9 to 137.8 L H2O-e/kg LW and crop land occupation from 0.2 to 2.0 m2/kg LW. Fossil fuel energy demand was dominated by on-farm energy demand, and differed between regions and datasets in response to production intensity and the use of purchased inputs such as fertiliser. Regional fresh water consumption was dominated by irrigation water use and losses from farm water supply, with smaller contributions from livestock drinking water. GHG emissions ranged from 6.1 to 7.3 kg CO2-e/kg LW and additional removals or emissions from land use (due to cultivation and fertilisation) and direct land-use change (due to deforestation over previous 20 years) were found to be modest, contributing between -1.6 and 0.3 kg CO2-e/kg LW for different scenarios assessing soil carbon flux. Excluding land use and direct land-use change, enteric CH4 contributed 83-89% of emissions, suggesting that emissions intensity can be reduced by focussing on flock production efficiency.

The use of fuel consumption saving potentials of friction-causing engine components can make a significant contribution. Boundary potential aspects of a combustion engine offer a good opportunity for estimating fuel consumption potentials. As a result, the focus of development is placed on components with great saving potentials. Friction investigations using the motored method are still state of the art. The disadvantages using this kind of friction measurement method are incorrect engine operating conditions like cylinder pressure, piston and liner temperatures, piston secondary movement and warm deformations which can lead to incorrect measurement results compared to a fired engine. In the past, two friction measurement methods came up, the so called floating liner method and a motored friction measurement with external charging. Both methods are getting closer to realistic engine load and thermal distortion, nevertheless there are still shortcomings. The floating liner method can only be used with great effort on a single cylinder research engine with cylinder pressure limitation. Using the motored method with external charging, cylinder pressure maxima can be reached, but with incorrect piston and liner temperature and an incorrect phasing of the cylinder pressure curve. In this paper a newly developed friction measurement method which allows a detailed strip down of a fired diesel engine for a complete engine map is used for the measurements. With this method the total friction can be divided into shares of the coolant pump, belt drive, oil pump, balance shafts, cranktrain, high-pressure pump and valve train. The measurement method was tested and verified with a state-of-the-art 3-cylinder diesel engine for passenger cars. The experimental results are presented in this paper. Furthermore the influence of different cylinder liner honings on the cranktrain friction was analyzed and compared in legislation cycle relevant engine operating points. The second part of the paper deals with friction simulation. The simulation model used is an EHD (elastohydrodynamic) model to simulate the friction in the contact area between piston skirt and cylinder liner using the AVL software Excite Power Unit. The simulation model was parameterized with detailed input data such as surface roughness, piston and cylinder liner geometry, cold and warm deformations of piston skirt and cylinder liner, cylinder pressure and oil data. Using the EHD simulation model, basic relations of various parameters affecting the piston skirt friction can be investigated. Finally a friction optimized combination of piston skirt and cylinder liner geometry was investigated and analyzed in detail. The combination of EHD simulation and experimental results using the new friction measuring method allows a detailed estimation of CO2 saving potentials resulting from friction reduction measures.

Deltaic areas, in which millions of farmers cultivate from one to three crops of rice per year, are susceptible also to the impacts of a rising sea level, submergence during major storm events, and saline intrusion into groundwater and surface water resources. In this paper, I review the current state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of climate change on rice production and I describe adaptation measures that involve soil and water management. In many areas, farmers will need to modify crop choices, crop calendars, and soil and water management practices as they adapt to climate change. Adaptation measures at the local, regional, and international levels also will be helpful in moderating the potential impacts of climate change on aggregate rice production and on household food security in many countries. Some of the changes in soil and water management and other production practices that will be implemented in response to climate change also will reduce methane generation and release from rice fields. Some of the measures also will reduce the uptake of arsenic in rice plants, thus addressing an important public health issue in portions of South and Southeast Asia. Where feasible, replacing continuously flooded rice production with some form of aerobic rice production, will contribute to achieving adaptation objectives, while also reducing global warming potential and minimizing the risk of negative health impacts due to consumption of arsenic contaminated rice. © 2016 by the authors.","Aerobic rice; Climate change; Deltas; Mekong; Mitigation; Sustainable rice intensification","Agriculture; Arsenic; Crops; Food supply; Global warming; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Health risks; Methane; Saline water; Sea level; Soil pollution; Soils; Storms; Surface water resources; Surface waters; Water management; Water resources; Aerobic rice; Deltas; Mekong; Mitigation; Sustainable rice intensification; Climate change; agricultural emission; agricultural intensification; arsenic; carbon emission; climate change; concentration (composition); delta; environmental effect; food security; global warming; methane; public health; rice; water management; Asia; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965107845

What is often overlooked and certainly required for comprehensive planning and programming are better tools and approaches that include ecosystems in the equations. Collectively, these mechanisms can help to enhance societies’ abilities to capture the protective benefits of ecosystems for communities facing disaster and climate risks. As illustrated within this chapter, decision support tools and approaches are clearly improving rapidly. Despite these advancements, factors such as resistance to change, the cautious approach by development agencies, governance structure and overlapping jurisdictions, funding, and limited community engagement remain, in many cases, pre-requisites to successful implementation of ecosystem-based solutions. Herein we provide case studies, lessons learned and recommendations from applications of decision support tools and approaches that advance better risk assessments and implementation of ecosystem-based solutions. The case studies featured in this chapter illustrate opportunities that have been enhanced with cutting edge tools, social media and crowdsourcing, cost/benefit comparisons, and scenario planning mechanisms.

To make the link between “sustainability” and “paradigm change,” the following commentary analyzes the former concept as a main example of the latter. Although it is often applied to rather modest planning initiatives, “sustainability” can be seen as requiring shifts in cognitive paradigm that are transformational, radical, and not yet fully appreciated by most of those who use the term. Specifically, this term implies a proactive, results-oriented approach (e.g. initiatives to actually meet GHG reduction targets), a long-term viewpoint (e.g. planning for 50 or 100+ years in the future), and a holistic or ecological mindset able to understand dynamic, evolving systems. This last change is the most difficult and requires thinking across scales of action, across time frames, across issue areas and goals (e.g. the “Three E’s” of environment, economy, and social equity), and across communities. It also means integrating different types of actions into a broader program of social change. Though challenging, these cognitive shifts can lead to radically different outcomes than past urban planning. © 2016 by the author.","Paradigm change; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Urban planning",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044450142

Climatologists recognize Sahelian desiccation as a long-term multidecadal dry period that persisted from roughly 1968 to 1995. This study draws on fine-scale ethnographic and daily rainfall data to elucidate local perspectives on this broad regional process. As such, this provides a window on the local lived experience of regional climate variability. Methodology/approach-This study draws on multiple periods of ethnographic fieldwork in two different Mossi areas in north-central Burkina Faso (West Africa). Fieldwork consisted of key informant interviews, household surveys, and participant observation. The authors incorporate daily precipitation data from two meteorological stations provided by the General Directorate of Meteorology of Burkina Faso. Researchers assembled this data and graphed daily rainfall totals for individual rainfall seasons in the years preceding each period of fieldwork. The qualitative and quantitative data are analyzed by using a Sustainable Livelihoods (SL) framework. Findings-The study finds that local perceptions of increased rainfall variability correspond to patterns evident in daily rainfall records for individual stations. Additionally, the authors document how rural producers are negatively affected by both intra-seasonal and multi-decadal rainfall variability. Mossi smallholders have adapted through new cropping patterns, livelihood diversification, and investments in agricultural intensification. These adaptations have been largely successful and could be adopted by other Sahelian groups in their efforts to adapt to climate change. Research limitations-Fieldwork took place over several years in two different departments and five localities. The two anthropologists used a common livelihoods analytical framework but different research protocols over this time span. Thus, the data collection was not systematic across all locations and time periods. This limits the degree to which results are representative beyond surveyed localities at their respective points in time. Originality/value-This study presents local views and perceptions of regional climate variability and ecological change. It is a rare bottom-up perspective supplemented with precipitation data. © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate adaptation; Desiccation; Livelihood vulnerability; Sahel; Smallholder farmers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986536257

These issues are compounded by precipitation structures that are relatively shallow and experience growth at low levels due to orographic enhancement. To improve surface precipitation estimation, researchers at the University of Oklahoma have demonstrated the benefits of integrating the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) products into the ground-based NEXRAD rainfall estimation system using a vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) identification and enhancement (VPR-IE) approach. However, the temporal resolution of TRMM limits the application of VPR-IE method operationally. To implement the VPR-IE concept into the National Mosaic and Multi-Sensor QPE (NMQ) system in real time, climatological VPRs from 11 years of TRMM PR observations have been characterized for different stratiform/convective rain types, seasons, and surface rain intensities. Then, these representative profiles are used to adjust ground radar-based precipitation estimates in the NMQ system based on different precipitation structures. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the newly developed climatological VPR-IE (CVPR-IE) method on winter events (January, February, and December) in 2011. The statistical analysis reveals that the CVPR-IE method provides a clear improvement over the original radar QPE in the NMQ system for the study region. Compared to physically based VPRs from real-time PR measurements, climatological VPRs have limitations in representing precipitation structure for individual events. A hybrid correction scheme incorporating both climatological and real-time VPR information is desired for better skill in the future. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Atm/Ocean Structure/Phenomena; Observational techniques and algorithms; Precipitation; Radars/Radar observations; Satellite observations","algorithm; precipitation (climatology); radar; rainfall; real time; satellite data; satellite imagery; TRMM",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961390259

Alberta's wealth of biomass resources is estimated at 458 PJ potential. However, biomass-based energy development has been slow, and its contribution for provincial energy supply has so far been low. Recognizing the role of biomass for sustainability, the use of potentially available resources should be supported by provincial policy makers. The energy substitution and emission mitigation potential by biomass for Alberta is not fully understood and accounted. In this paper, energy and emission analysis approach was applied to assess the biomass resources potential; and analyse the GHG mitigation and energy substitution potential of biomass in the context of Alberta's final energy demand on a near term planning range, i.e. 15 years. The results demonstrate that utilization of agricultural and forest biomass resources for energy production can avoid 11-15% of GHG emissions and also substitute 14-17% of final energy demand by 2030. In addition, biomass has the potential to substitute 29% of total electricity consumption or 28% of Alberta total internal load. Agriculture is a major source for biomass feedstock supply in Alberta. Policy makers should give due recognition to the potential of biomass-derived energy in developing energy strategies. Further quantification of the economic removal of biomass feedstocks for energy production is needed to facilitate biomass integration to the provincial energy system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The most important aspects of this Energiwende are the phase out of nuclear energy, promotion of renewable energy technologies, and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a consequence, huge investments in power generation systems and infrastructure are needed. Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) are important renewable energy sources for achieving the goals, but power generation depends on spatial and meteorological conditions on site. For new build PV systems, the level of on-site solar irradiation is crucial, whereas the yield of wind turbines is mainly determined by the wind speed on site. In the model-based analysis with the RETScreen software, we distinguish between three different regions in order to take differences in climatic and geographical conditions in Germany into account. For each region, six locations with specific site conditions are used for the calculations. Projections are made for the base year 2015 and the future year 2030. We find that PV systems achieve levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) below 11 €-ct/kWh in 2030, with a GHG reduction potential of 133-289 €/tCO2. The LCOE of wind power ranges from 5.1-16.1 €-ct/kWh and the related GHG mitigation costs from 101-321 €/tCO2. In light of these results, it seems to be possible to restructure the German electricity generation system in a cost-effective and environmentally efficient way. Due to decreasing unit investment costs and increasing capacity, solar PV and wind power become increasingly competitive against conventional power generation. Hence efforts are needed to enhance and optimize the grid integration of wind energy and PV and to maintain the long-term security of electricity supply during the transition process. © 2016 The Authors.","Cost & GHG analysis; Germany; Multi-region analysis; PV and wind energy; RETScreen","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economics; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Geographical regions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electricity-generation system; Germany; Levelized cost of electricities; Meteorological condition; Power generation systems; Region analysis; Renewable energy technologies; RETScreen; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012972010

In order to achieve the optimal trade-off between fuel consumption and emission from the outlet of diesel engine aftertreatment, this paper presents a schematic optimal control strategy for PHEV with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF).The solution for optimal balance between fuel consumption and emission is presented by using PMP-based (Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle) control strategy which has two state variables. The SCR temperature is viewed as a second state variable as well as the battery State Of Charge (SOC).

Due to the required amount of raw materials and energy in the production phase, the holistic sustainability of these materials significantly depends on the manufacturing method, the achieved weight reduction and the respective application. One important key performance indicator to describe the sustainability of products over their whole life cycle is the primary energy demand (PED). The PED includes all sources of primary energy that have to be withdrawn from the environment in order to provide the function of a process, a product or a service. The presented study provides both manufacturers and users of CFRP with the means to effectively reduce the PED of CFRP production by investigating the effect of different technologically and energy supply related measures and their interdependencies along the process chain of CFRP production. The results show a great variance of the PED depending on particular, partly interdependent parameters in the process chains and highlight the importance of a detailed investigation of the state of the process chains subject to optimization. © 2016, European Conference on Composite Materials, ECCM.

In extreme cases entire states may disappear. Kiribati is one of these countries. Within its own territory there are no places to where people could be safely resettled when their home islands become unsuitable for human habitation. Large-scale resettlement is nothing new to the people of Kiribati. In colonial times people from various islands were resettled. The Phoenix Island Settlement Scheme (PISS) is one of these efforts to allegedly bring people to safety. Making use of primary sources that have become available only recently the paper raises the question if there is anything to learn from PISS for present times, or if PISS has historical value only, as the United Kingdom's last colonial expansion scheme. The paper asks about conflicting intentions of colonial authorities and assesses if and possibly why strategic political considerations resulted in a situation where humanitarian motivations retreated into the background leading to a sub-optimal preparation of the scheme, which then finally led to its failure. The paper comes to the conclusion that behind reportedly noble purposes there is a layer of colonial interests which lets settlers appear as objects in a larger colonial game.",,"climate change; climate effect; colonialism; geopolitics; international conflict; population migration; resettlement policy; safety; settlement planning; territory; Kiribati; Phoenix Islands; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977100870

We investigate the acidification effects on marine phytoplankton and subsequent production of the trace gas dimethylsulfide, a major route for sulfur transfer from the oceans to the atmosphere. Increasing surface water CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) affects the growth of phytoplankton groups to different degrees, resulting in varying responses in community production of dimethylsulfide. Abstract The human-induced rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide since the industrial revolution has led to increasing oceanic carbon uptake and changes in seawater carbonate chemistry, resulting in lowering of surface water pH. In this study we investigated the effect of increasing CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) on concentrations of volatile biogenic dimethylsulfide (DMS) and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), through monoculture studies and community pCO2 perturbation. DMS is a climatically important gas produced by many marine algae: it transfers sulfur into the atmosphere and is a major influence on biogeochemical climate regulation through breakdown to sulfate and formation of subsequent cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Overall, production of DMS and DMSP by the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain RCC1229 was unaffected by growth at 900atm pCO2, but DMSP production normalised to cell volume was 12% lower at the higher pCO2 treatment. These cultures were compared with community DMS and DMSP production during an elevated pCO2 mesocosm experiment with the aim of studying E. huxleyi in the natural environment. Results contrasted with the culture experiments and showed reductions in community DMS and DMSP concentrations of up to 60 and 32% respectively at pCO2 up to 3000atm, with changes attributed to poorer growth of DMSP-producing nanophytoplankton species, including E. huxleyi, and potentially increased microbial consumption of DMS and dissolved DMSP at higher pCO2. DMS and DMSP production differences between culture and community likely arise from pH affecting the inter-species responses between microbial producers and consumers. © CSIRO 2016.",,"acidification; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coccolith; dimethylsulfide; dimethylsulfoniopropionate; growth rate; marine environment; mesocosm; microbial community; partial pressure; phytoplankton; water chemistry; algae; Emiliania huxleyi",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961621866

The persistence of this inversion during a frontal passage can result in complex patterns of snow and rain that are difficult to predict. Yet these predictions are critical to support highway avalanche control, ski resort operations, and modeling of headwater snowpack storage. In this study we used observations of precipitation phase from a disdrometer and snow depth sensors across Snoqualmie Pass, WA, to evaluate surface-air-temperature-based and mesoscale-model-based predictions of precipitation phase during the anomalously warm 2014-2015 winter. Correlations of phase between surface-based methods and observations were greatly improved (r2 from 0.45 to 0.66) and frozen precipitation biases reduced (+36% to -6% of accumulated snow water equivalent) by using air temperature from a nearby higher-elevation station, which was less impacted by low-level inversions. Alternatively, we found a hybrid method that combines surface-based predictions with output from the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model to have improved skill (r2 = 0.61) over both parent models (r2 = 0.42 and 0.55). These results suggest that prediction of precipitation phase in mountain passes can be improved by incorporating observations or models from above the surface layer. © 2016.

The global air traffic between 2005 and 2011 was modeled with the TRS in which turbofan powered aircraft were replaced with nine chosen turboprop powered aircraft on all routes up to 1700 nautical miles (NM) in range. The results of this TRS double the globalnumberof departures, as well as global mission distance, while global mission time grows by nearly a factor of 3. However, the global mission fuel and the emissions of aviation CO2, H2O, and SOx remain approximately unchanged,and the total global aviation CO, hydrocarbons (HC), and NOx emissions are reduced by 79%, 21%, and 11% on average between 2005 and 2011. The TRS lowers the global mean cruise altitude of flights up to 1700 NM by ~2.7 km which leads to a significant decrease in global mission fuel burn, mission time, distance flown, and the aircraft emissions of CO2, CO, H2O, NOx, SOx, and HC above 9.2 km. The replacement of turbofans with turboprops in regional fleets on a global scale leads to an overall reduction in levels of tropospheric O3 at the current estimatedmean cruise altitude near the tropopause where the radiative forcing of O3 is strongest. Further, the replacement strategy results in a reduction of ground-level aviation CO and NOx emissions by 33 and 29%, respectively, between 2005 and 2011. © 2016.

The main objective of this study was to assess the potential of two-stroke engines in achieving a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions compared to four-stroke diesel baselines. As part of this study 1-D models were developed for loop scavenged two-stroke and opposed piston two-stroke diesel engine concepts. Based on the engine models and an in-house vehicle model, projections were made for the CO2 emissions for a representative light-duty vehicle over the New European Driving Cycle and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure. The loop scavenged two-stroke engine had about 5-6% lower CO2 emissions over the two driving cycles compared to a state of the art four-stroke diesel engine, while the opposed piston diesel engine had about 13-15% potential benefit. Opposed piston two-stroke engines offer the potential for even higher thermal efficiency than loop scavenged two-stroke engines. The efficiency advantages of the opposed piston two-stroke engine are mainly because of lower in-cylinder heat losses due to elimination of the cylinder head and lower surface area to volume ratio. The thermal efficiency of a loop scavenged two-stroke engine can be potentially further improved by using thermal barrier materials for incylinder surfaces to minimize heat losses. Analytical studies show that integration of thermal barrier materials and two-stroke loop scavenged engine could lead to a cost effective highly efficient diesel engine. Whether the theoretical benefit translates to actual CO2 emissions reduction will have to be verified experimentally.

Analysis determined that operating in SND mode at current conditions could offer the facility operational savings on the order of $500,000 per year. SND was piloted in one tank during the summer of 2015 and achieved a 40% reduction in carbon. Based on a 40% reduction in carbon and all ENR tanks running in SND mode, savings would be approximately $210,000 per year.

Urban indicators were calculated to match LCZ types of measurement points. Using a mobile measurement approach, we analyzed screen-height air temperature distribution inside local climate zones in both spring and summer. An apparent seasonal difference inside LCZs was found, with air temperature amplitude about 0.8°C in spring and 0.9°C in summer. The average air temperature difference in LCZ 1 was 2.9°C between the two seasons, while in LCZ H this difference was as high as 3.5°C.

The crystal structure, morphological and microstructural features, and photoluminescence (PL) properties of KCYP:Dy3+, Eu3+ nanophosphor, as well as its thermal properties, have been studied. Investigations based on XRD, FTIR and Raman verify the formation of single-phased and well-crystallized KCYP:Dy3+, Eu3+. SEM and TEM observations reveal that the KCYP:Dy3+, Eu3+ nanophosphor displays uniform spherical morphology with an average particle size of about 47 nm. The optimal concentrations of Dy3+ and Eu3+ ions in KCYP were determined to be 3 mol% and 7 mol%, respectively. Under near-ultraviolet (NUV) excitation, individual Dy3+- or Eu3+-doped samples exhibit characteristic PL emissions in their respective regions. As for the Dy3+, Eu3+ co-doped KCYP, energy transfer has been confirmed happening from Dy3+ to Eu3+via an electric dipole-dipole interaction, and the critical distance (Rc) was calculated to be 17.07 Å. Our experiments reveal that it is easy to produce warm white or tunable emissions by regulating the Eu3+ content. Moreover, the single-component KCYP:3%Dy3+, 7%Eu3+ nanosized phosphor has a very low correlated color temperature (2766 K) and a high color-rendering index (Ra = 81.6). The quenching temperature (T0.5) of the KCYP:Dy3+, Eu3+ nanophosphor was found to be higher than 220 °C, indicating its superior thermal resistance. Consequent three rounds of the heating-cooling cycle experiments demonstrate no occurrence of thermal degradation. These findings suggest that this nanophosphor is a promising candidate for application in NUV-pumped glareless warm-white LED. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Color; Color image processing; Crystal structure; Energy transfer; Gadolinium compounds; Light emission; Microstructural evolution; Particle size; Phosphors; Correlated color temperature; Electric dipole-dipole interactions; High color rendering index; Microstructural features; Optimal concentration; Photoluminescence properties; Quenching temperatures; Spherical morphologies; Europium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991676948

In order to fully understand the mechanism of this reaction the determination of both the rate-determining steps and reaction intermediates are vital. Steady-State Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis (SSITKA) is one of the most powerful techniques used to investigate the elementary steps under steadystate reaction conditions. This technique provides valuable information on mean resident lifetime of surface intermediates, surface concentrations of adsorbed reactant species and an upper bound of the turnover frequency.[1-3] Coupling SSITKA with operando-FTIR spectroscopy allows us to discriminate between active and spectator species present on the catalytic surface under steady state reaction conditions. Most of the reaction cells applied in these types of studies possess a large volume leading to long gas hold-up times, which makes it impossible to do kinetic study on the surface species. In this work, we used a transmission IR cell which has an internal reactor volume of 0.48 cm3, providing a short effective response time. The fast time grants us the ability to obtain kinetic parameters of surface species and relate a particular surface intermediate to a given reaction product by comparison with kinetic parameters from SSITKA. On Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, our previous results showed that adsorbed CO was hydrogenated to methane while H-assisted formate decomposition can yield gaseous CO.[4] Those results were obtained from transient switches between hydrogen and reaction gases rather than under steady state reaction conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the roles of adsorbed CO and formate on the surface of Pd/Al2O3 under steady state reaction conditions. In the present work, for the first time, operando SSITKA experiments coupled with transmission FTIR, mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography (GC) were performed to probe both the chemical nature and kinetics of reactive intermediates over a 5% Pd-Al2O3 catalyst and provide a clear mechanistic picture of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction by revealing the ratedetermining steps for CH4and CO production under steady state conditions.

Therefore, a detailed analysis of the carbon emission performance of industrial land use is necessary for making reasonable carbon reduction policies that promote the sustainable use of industrial land. This paper aims to analyze the dynamic changes in the total-factor carbon emission performance of industrial land use (TCPIL) in China y applying a global directional distance function (DDF) and non-radial Luenberger productivity index. The empirical results show that the eastern region enjoys better TCPIL than the central and western regions, but the regional gaps in TCPIL are narrowing. The growth in NLCPILs (non-radial Luenberger carbon emission performance of industrial land use) in the eastern and central regions is mainly driven by technological progress, whereas efficiency improvements contribute more to the growth of NLCPIL in the western region. The provinces in the eastern region have the most innovative and environmentally-friendly production technologies. The results of the analysis of the influencing factors show implications for improving the NLCPIL, including more investment in industrial research and development (R & D), the implementation of carbon emission reduction policies, reduction in the use of fossil energy, especially coal, in the process of industrial production, actively learning about foreign advanced technology, properly solving the problem of surplus labor in industry and the expansion of industrial development. © 2016 by the authors.","China; Industrial land; Irectional distance function (DDF); Non-radial Luenberger carbon emission performance of industrial land use (NLCPIL); Non-radial Luenberger productivity index; Total-factor carbon emission performance of industrial land use (TCPIL)","carbon emission; environmental economics; environmental policy; index method; industrial development; industrial emission; industrial location; industrial production; investment; land use; performance assessment; research and development; sustainability; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965149378

Moreover, the binding energy of ionic pairs to CO2 is tunable by changing the hydration state so that the sorbent can be regenerated through humidity adjustment. In this study, theoretical calculations were conducted to reveal the mechanism of the humidity swing CO2 adsorption, based on model compounds of quaternary ammonium cation and carbonate anions. The electrostatic potential map demonstrates the anion, rather than the cation, is chemically preferential for CO2 adsorption. Further, the proton transfer process from water to carbonate at the sorbent interface is successfully depicted with an intermediate which has a higher energy state. By determining the CO2 adsorption energy and activation energy at different hydration states, it is discovered that water could promote CO2 adsorption by reducing the energy barrier of proton transfer. The adsorption/desorption equilibrium would shift to desorption by adding water, which constitutes the theoretical basis for humidity swing. By analyzing the hydrogen bonding and structure of the water molecules, it is interesting to find that the CO2 adsorption weakens the hydrophilicity of the sorbent and results in release of water. The requirement of latent heat for the phase change of water could significantly reduce the heat of adsorption. The special ""self-cooling"" effect during gas adsorption can lower the temperature of the sorbent and benefit the adsorption isotherms. © the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973526729

The excitation and emission spectra show that this phosphor can be effectively excited by near ultraviolet (NUV) light, and produces strong and prevailing red emissions at 612 nm belonging to the 5D0→7F2 electric dipole transition. Eu3+ ion was heavy doped in Sr3Lu(PO4)3 host and the optimal concentration of Eu3+ was found as 0.8. The critical transfer distance of Eu3+ was determined to be 8.5 Å.

However, the size of this contribution, namely, the direct radiative forcing (RF), ranges from +0.1 to +1.0Wm -2 , largely due to differences between bottom-up and observation-based estimates. Current global models systematically underestimate BC radiation absorption relative to observations, which is often attributed to the underestimation of BC emissions. Several studies that adjusted emissions to correct biases of global aerosol models resulted in a revised upward estimate of the BC RF. However, the BC RF was never optimized against observations in a rigorous mathematical manner. Here we simulated the absorption of solar radiation by BC from all sources at the 10 km resolution by combining a highly disaggregated emission inventory with a nested aerosol climate model and a downscaling method. As a result, the normalized mean bias in BC radiation absorption was reduced from -51% to -24% in Asia and from -57% to -50% elsewhere. We applied a Bayesian method that makes the best account of all model, representativeness and observational uncertainties to estimate the BC RF and its uncertainty. Using the new emission inventory and high-resolution model reduces uncertainty in BC RF from-101%/+152% to-70%/+71% over Asia and from-83%/+108% to -64%/+68% over other continental regions. Finally we derived an observationally constrained BC RF of 0.61 Wm -2 (0.16 to 1.40 as 90% confidence) as our best estimate. Our estimate implies that reduction in BC emissions would contribute to slow down global warming, but the contribution could be less than previously thought. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

Accurately evaluating the contribution of industry structure adjustment to the carbon intensity target is helpful for the government to implement more flexible and effective policies and measures for CO2 emissions reduction. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the contribution of industry structure adjustment to the carbon intensity target. Firstly, we predict the gross domestic product (GDP) with scenario forecasting, industry structure with the Markov chain model, CO2 emissions with a novel correlation mode based on least squares support vector machine, and then we assess the contribution of industry structure adjustment to the carbon intensity target of Guangdong during the period of 2011-2015 under nine scenarios. The obtained results show, in the ideal scenario, that the economy will grow at a high speed and the industry structure will be significantly adjusted, and thus the carbon intensity in 2015 will decrease by 25.53% compared to that in 2010, which will make a 130.94% contribution to the carbon intensity target. Meanwhile, in the conservative scenario, the economy will grow at a low speed and the industry structure will be slightly adjusted, and thus the carbon intensity in 2015 will decrease by 23.89% compared to that in 2010, which will make a 122.50% contribution to the carbon intensity target. © 2016 by the authors.","Carbon intensity target; Contribution; Guangdong; Industry structure adjustment; Least squares support vector machine; Markov chain model","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; growth rate; industrial structure; Markov chain; support vector machine; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965102326

Four oils, peanut, rapeseed, corn and soybean oils, varying in the contents of unsaturated fatty acids as indicated by their iodine values, were used to investigate their effects on methane production and on the content of the F420 enzyme of ruminal methanogens in an in vitro fermentation. The control group was added with calcium palmitate (100% saturated 16C fatty acid). The results showed that the total gas production over a period of 36 h varied from 20.61 mL to 39.67 mL, and were lower in rapeseed, corn and soybean oil treatments than the control (P < 0.05), but not in the peanut oil treatment. The methane concentration in the total gas differed significantly among groups (P < 0.05), and decreased with the increases of unsaturation degree of the oils. The coenzyme F420 content, as indicated by F420 fluorescence intensity in supernatant of the medium, was significantly lower in the oil treatments than in the control (P < 0.05), and the intensity values decreased with the increases of unsaturation degree of the oils, except for the rapeseed oil treatment. Furthermore, there was a close correlation between F420 content and methane production (r ≤ 0.916). By comparison, soybean oil treatment had higher dehydrogenase activity and bacteria density than the other groups (P < 0.05); but was lower in methanogens and genus entodinium (P < 0.05), except for the rapeseed oil treatment. Overall, soybean oil contained a high level of unsaturated fatty acids, and could be used as an ingredient of ruminant diets for methane suppression. © CSIRO 2016.","flora; goats; rumen microbes; unsaturated fatty acids.","bacterium; canola; concentration (composition); digestive system; enzyme activity; essential oil; experimental study; fatty acid; fermentation; goat; groundnut; maize; methane; microbial community; soybean; Arachis hypogaea; Brassica napus; Capra hircus; Entodinium; Glycine max; Zea mays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958168059

It is found that although most governments showed great enthusiasm in promoting emission reduction, most regions present no decoupling effect.

Theoretically, heterogeneity in abatement cost determines the efficiency advantage of market based programs over command and control policies on carbon emissions. This study tries to answer the question that what will be the abatement cost savings or GDP loss recoveries from carbon emissions trading in China from the perspective of estimating the potential gains from carbon emissions trading. A DEA based optimization model is employed in this study to estimate the potential gains from implementing two carbon emissions trading schemes compared to carbon emissions command and control scheme in China. These two schemes are spatial tradable carbon emissions permit scheme and spatial–temporal tradable carbon emissions permit scheme. The associated three types of potential gains, which are defined as the potential increases on GDP outputs through eliminating technical inefficiency, eliminating suboptimal spatial allocation of carbon emissions permit, and eliminating both suboptimal spatial and temporal allocation of carbon emissions permit, are estimated by an ex post analysis for China and its 30 provinces over 2006-2010. Substantial abatement cost savings and considerable carbon emissions reduction potentials are identified in this study which provide one argument for implementing a market based policy instrument instead of a command and control policy instrument on carbon emissions control in China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; DEA; Emissions trading; Potential gains; Tradable permit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988841535

Vehicles were tested on a dynamometer that conducted a typical city-driving protocol and their exhaust samples were collected on filters. A high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the determination of HPAs in the exhaust samples. Method detection limits reached low ng/m3 in exhaust after optimization of experimental conditions. Identification and quantification were proven to be reliable for these phenols in lightly-loaded and ambient filter samples. In heavily loaded samples, matrix interferences existed, which decreased recoveries of surrogate in both filter and disk. However, matrix spike samples showed good recoveries of target HPAs. In vehicle emission samples, the highest level of HPAs was 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol at 52.7 ng/m3 (28.9 pg/mm2 on filter) in emission of a 2009 Volkswagen Jetta with a diesel engine. Most HPAs were not detected or near detection limits. Therefore, the additives of phenol antioxidants in fuels were mostly oxidized during the combustion process. Further, the 2009 diesel Jetta produced about 7 times more of HPAs than the 2008 Pontiac G5 with a gasoline engine. In addition, it is discovered that engines operated at a colder ambient temperature (−7 °C) yielded more HPA emissions than at the warmer condition (25 °C), because the combustion efficiency of engines are normally reduced at a lower temperature. © 2015 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Emission; Exhaust; Hindered phenolic antioxidants; HPLC-MS/MS; Light-duty vehicles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995814188

By employing System Complexity Theory, we also analyze the impact of delays and the feedback control on stability and entropy of the system are analyzed from two aspects: single delay and double delays. In numerical simulation section, we test the theoretical analysis by using means bifurcation diagram, the largest Lyapunov exponent diagrams, attractor, time-domain plot, Poincare section plot, power spectrum, entropy diagram, 3-D surface chart and 4-D graph, the simulation results demonstrating that the inappropriate changes of delays and the feedback control will result in instability and fluctuation of carbon emissions. Finally, the bifurcation control is achieved by using the method of variable feedback control. Hence, we conclude that the greater the value of the control parameter, the better the effect of the bifurcation control.

Domain-wide, WRF-Chem showed a decrease of 20W/m 2 in surface shortwave (SW) radiation due to the aerosol direct effect (ADE), consistent with observational studies. The ADE caused 24 h surface PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter &lt;2.5 µm) concentrations to increase in eastern China (4.4%), southern China (10%), western China (2.3%), and the Sichuan Basin (9.6%), due to different aerosol compositions in these four regions. Conversely, surface 1 h maximum ozone was reduced by 2.3% domain-wide and up to 12% in eastern China because less radiation reached the surface. We also investigated the impact of reducing SO2 and black carbon (BC) emissions by 80% on aerosol amounts via two sensitivity simulations. Reducing SO2 decreased surface PM2.5 concentrations in the Sichuan Basin and southern China by 5.4% and decreased ozone by up to 6 ppbv in the Sichuan Basin and Southern China. Reducing BC emissions decreased PM2.5 by 3% in eastern China and the Sichuan Basin but increased surface ozone by up to 3.6 ppbv in eastern China and the Sichuan Basin. This study indicates that the benefits of reducing PM2.5 associated with reducing absorbing aerosols may be partially offset by increases in ozone at least for a scenario when NOx and VOC emissions are unchanged. © 2016.

We aim to investigate livelihood adaptation strategies of herder households and the types of local institutions that shaped those adaptation strategies. We examined the barriers and opportunities for strengthening adaptive capacity of local herder communities. We designed and implemented a household survey in the herder communities of northern Tibet. The survey results showed that migratory grazing has become less feasible. Storage, diversification, and market exchange have become the dominant adaptation strategies. The adaptation strategies of local herders have been reshaped by local institutional change. Local governmental and market institutions played the dominant roles in reshaping climate adaptation strategies. Although the present livelihood adaption strategies related to sedentary grazing have improved productivity and profitability of the herding livelihood, they have led to continuous deterioration of pastures. The local grazing system has become more and more dependent on artificial feeding and inputs from outside the grazing system. Purchasing forage has become one of the dominant adaptation strategies of local herder households. Multilevel regression modeling of this adaptation behavior showed that explanatory variables related to climate variability, household capital, and local institutional arrangements had statistically significant relationships with the adoption of this adaptation strategy. The results implies that building household capital and promoting the coordination among local governmental, market, and communal institutions are critical for strengthening adaptive capacity of the Tibetan herder communities. © 2016 by the author(s).","Climate adaptation; Herder communities; Institutional change; Sustainable livelihoods; Tibetan plateau","adaptive management; climate change; grassland; institutional reform; local government; profitability; sustainability; sustainable development; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962632760

Study on spatiotemporal characteristics of urban sprawl and its impact on ecological environment is useful for ecological civilization construction. Although a lot of work has been conducted on urban sprawl and its impact on ecological environment, resolution of images to extract urban boundary was relatively coarse and most studies only focused on certain indicators of ecological environment, rather than comprehensive evaluation of urban ecological environmental impact. In this study, high-resolution remote sensing images of Beijing from aerial photography in 2002 and 2013 respectively are employed to extract urban boundary with manual interpretation. Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC), Water Density (WD), Impervious Surfaces Coverage (ISC), Net Primary Production (NPP), and Land Surface Temperature (LST) are adopted to represent ecological environment. The ecological environment indicators are measured with some general algorithms by combining Landsat images, GIS data and metrological data of 243 day, 2001 and 244 day, 2013. In order to evaluate the impact of urban sprawl on ecological environment, pseudo changes due to metrological variation and other noise in this time period are removed after images calibration. The impact of urban sprawl on ecological environment is evaluated at different scales of urban extent, Beijing ring road and watershed. Results show that Beijing had been undergoing a rapid urbanization from 2002 to 2013, with urban area increase from 600 square kilometres to 987 square kilometres. All ecological environment indicators except LST became terrible in urban sprawl region, with carbon reduction of approximate 40508 tons. The Beiyun River watershed of Beijing degraded seriously since ISC increased to 0.59. Gratifyingly, ecological environment indicators including NDVI, NPP, and LST inside of 4th Ring Road became well.","Beijing; Ecological environment; Multi-source data; Multiscale; Urban sprawl","Aerial photography; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon; Ecology; Environmental impact; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Remote sensing; Roads and streets; Watersheds; Beijing; Ecological environments; Multiscale; Multisource data; Urban sprawl; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979539457

We also examine the catalytic activities of these complexes in the photochemical and electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO using [Ir(ppy)3] as the photosensitizer. Among the complexes studied, cis-[CoII(PDP)Cl2] (C1) (PDP = 1,1′-bis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-2,2′-bipyrrolidine) displayed the highest catalytic activity. This Co(ii) complex was able to effectively mediate the reduction of CO2 to CO under either electrochemical or visible light photocatalytic conditions. For the electrocatalysis, C1 catalysed CO2 to CO with up to 96% Faraday efficiency at -1.70 V (vs. SCE, SCE = saturated calomel electrode). A selectivity of up to 95% for CO production was achieved in a photocatalytic CO2 reduction system by using C1 as the catalyst, Ir(ppy)3 as the photosensitizer and triethylamine as the electron donor. The Co(i) species in situ generated by the one electron reduction of cis-[CoII(PDP)Cl]+ is suggested to be directly responsible for CO2 activation. Ultrafast time (ns) resolved absorption spectroscopy revealed that the photoinduced electron transfer from the triplet excited state of Ir(ppy)3 to C1 is a key step in the generation of active Co(i) species. The electronic structure and redox properties of the Co(i) species, [CoI(N4)Cl], as well as its role in the catalytic reaction were investigated by DFT calculations. The presence of one chloride ligand cis to the CO2 coordination site neutralizes the positive charge on the Co(i) centre, therefore assisting the bound CO2 molecule in attracting protons. The reaction mechanism for CO2 reduction to CO catalysed by the recently reported [CoII(TPA)Cl]+ (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine) catalyst was also computed. Subtle modifications of the chelating N4 ligand from cis-[CoII(N4)Cl2] were found to have a profound effect on the efficiency of CO2 reduction by DFT calculations. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Chelation; Chlorine compounds; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Crystal atomic structure; Density functional theory; Efficiency; Electrocatalysis; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic structure; Excited states; Iridium; Ligands; Photosensitizers; Plasma display devices; Reduction; Synthesis (chemical); Catalytic reactions; Electrochemical reductions; Ligand coordination; One-electron reductions; Photo-induced electron transfer; Photochemical conversion; Saturated calomel electrode; X ray crystal structures; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991270798

This BIF is within a metasedimentary rock succession of the Yuanjiacun Formation in the lower Lüliang Group. The clastic metasediments associated with the BIF are mainly represented by well-bedded meta-pelites (chlorite schists and sericite-chlorite phyllites) and meta-arenites (sericite schists), which have undergone greenschist-facies metamorphism. The Yuanjiacun Formation had been originally deposited in a passive margin setting, most probably on a stable continental shelf. Iron oxide (magnetite and hematite), carbonate, and silicate facies are all present within the iron-rich layers. Integration of petrographic and isotopic evidence indicates that the most likely precursor materials were comprised predominantly of probably hydrous, Fe-silicate gels of stilpnomelane-type composition, amorphous silica gels, and ferrihydrite. The PO2-PCO2 and pH-Eh fields of the mineral assemblages (and/or their precursors) in the Yuanjiacun BIF indicate anoxic and near-neutral to slightly alkaline conditions for the original depositional environment except for the hematite precursor field (that of Fe(OH)3), which is very small and exists only at relatively high PO2 values. The eastward transition from carbonate- into oxide-facies iron formations is accompanied by a change in mineralogical composition from siderite in the west through magnetite-ankerite and magnetite-stilpnomelane assemblages in the transition zone to magnetite and then hematite in the east. These distinct lateral facies are also observed vertically within the BIF, i.e., the iron mineral assemblage changes up section from siderite through magnetite into hematite-rich iron formation. The oxide-facies BIF formed near shore, whereas carbonate (siderite)- and silicate-facies assemblages formed in deeper waters. Based on detailed analyses of these variations on a basinal scale, the BIF precipitated during a transgressive event within an environment that ranged from deep waters below storm-wave base to relatively shallow waters. The BIF samples display distinctively seawater-like REE + Y profiles that are characterized by positive La and Y anomalies and HREEs enrichment relative to LREEs in Post-Archean Australian shale-normalized diagrams. Consistently positive Eu anomalies are also observed, which are typical of reduced, high-temperature hydrothermal fluids. In addition, slightly negative to positive Ce anomalies, and a large range in ratios of light to heavy REEs and Y/Ho, are present in the oxide-facies BIF. These characteristics, in combination with consistently positive δ56Fe values, suggest that deposition of the BIF took place along the chemocline where upwelling of deep, anoxic, iron- and silica-rich hydrothermal fluids mixed with shallower and slightly oxygenated seawater. The ankerite displays highly depleted δ13C values and the carbonate-rich BIF has a high content of organic carbon, suggesting dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction of a ferric oxyhydroxide precursor during burial of biomass deposited from the water column; that same biomass was likely tied to the original oxidation of dissolved Fe(II). The fact that the more ferric BIF facies formed in shallower waters suggests that river-sourced nutrients would have been minimal, thus limiting primary productivity in the shallow waters and minimizing the organic carbon source necessary for reducing the hematite via dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction. By contrast, in deeper waters more proximal to the hydrothermal vents, nutrients were abundant, and high biomass productivity was coupled to increased carbon burial, leading to the deposition of iron-rich carbonates. The deposition of the Yuanjiacun BIF during the onset of the Great Oxidation Event (GOE; ca. 2.4–2.2 Ga) confirms that deep marine waters during this time period were still episodically ferruginous, but that shallow waters were sufficiently oxygenated that Fe(II) oxidation no longer needed to be tied directly to proximal cyanobacterial activity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.","BIF facies; Depositional environment; Great oxidation event; North China Craton; Yuanjiacun",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067938877

Chinese nature reserves contain a rich diversity of plant species that are at risk of becoming more threatened by climate change. Hence, it is urgent to identify the extent to which future climate change may compromise the suitability of threatened plant species habitats within Chinese nature reserves. Here, we modelled the climate suitability of 82 threatened plant species within 168 nature reserves across climate change scenarios. We used Maxent modelling based on species occurrence localities and evaluated climate change impacts using the magnitude of change in climate suitability and the degree of overlap between current and future climatically suitable habitats. There was a significant relationship between overlap with current and future climate suitability of all threatened plant species habitats and the magnitude of changes in climate suitability. Our projections estimate that the climate suitability of more than 60 threatened plant species will decrease and that climate change threatens the habitat suitability of plant species in more than 130 nature reserves under the low, medium, and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios by both 2050s and 2080s. Furthermore, future climate change may substantially threaten tree plant species through changes in annual mean temperature. These results indicate that climate change may threaten plant species that occur within Chinese nature reserves. Therefore, we suggest that climate change projections should be integrated into the conservation and management of threatened plant species within nature reserves. © 2016 Wang et al.","China; Climate change; Conservation areas; Maxent modelling; Schoener's D; Suitable habitat; Threatened plant species","China; climate change; greenhouse gas; plant model; species habitat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977070410

The main global impact of landfills is the methane produced from anaerobic digestion, which has a significant effect in global warming, if released to the atmosphere. The economic use of this biogas is possible, but for a better evaluation, a strong methodology to estimate the methane generation potential is necessary. There are many estimation methods developed by different organizations and this study will focus on USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency), UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) methodologies. A large sanitary landfill in Brazil is measuring its methane generation in order to achieve carbon credits according to the Kyoto Protocol since 2008. These measurements along eight years were compared to the values predicted by the methods cited above and very different results were revealed for the three methodologies. The USEPA was the worse result overestimating the methane amount in 27.57%, while the UNFCCC method resulted an average value 14.71% smaller than measured. The IPCC methodology prove to give good results with a value only 5.18% greater than measured. The main difference is that the IPCC method takes in account more details from the waste composition and uses a better calculation of the decay constant, ensuring a better representation of the process. The company has used this analysis to install biogas driven engines and is actually generating 8.2 MW of electricity. The prediction is that there will be methane enough to run the engines up to the year of 2039, considering IPCC estimations.

However, local planning practices that support these approaches are scattered, andmeasures are neither systematically implemented nor comprehensively reviewed. Against this background, this paper advances the operationalization of ecosystem-based adaptation by improving our knowledge of how ecosystem-based approaches can be considered in local planning (operational governance level). We review current research on ecosystem services in urban areas and examine four Swedish coastal municipalities to identify the key characteristics of both implemented and planned measures that support ecosystem-based adaptation. The results show that many of the measures that have been implemented focus on biodiversity rather than climate change adaptation, which is an important factor in only around half of all measures. Furthermore, existing measures are limited in their focus regarding the ecological structures and the ecosystem services they support, and the hazards and risk factors they address. We conclude that a more comprehensive approach to sustainable ecosystem-based adaptation planning and its systematic mainstreaming is required. Our framework for the analysis of ecosystem-based adaptation measures proved to be useful in identifying how ecosystem-related matters are addressed in current practice and strategic planning, and in providing knowledge on how ecosystem-based adaptation can further be considered in urban planning practice. Such a systematic analysis framework can reveal the ecological structures, related ecosystem services, and risk-reducing approaches that are missing and why. This informs the discussion about why specific measures are not considered and provides pathways for alternate measures/designs, related operations, and policy processes at different scales that can foster sustainable adaptation and transformation in municipal governance and planning. © 2016 by the author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Municipal planning; Nature-based solutions; Renaturing cities; Risk reduction; Spatial planning; Sustainability transitions; Urban planning; Urban resilience; Urban transformation","adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; risk assessment; spatial planning; sustainability; sustainable development; urban area; urban development; urban planning; Sweden",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962758880

Fuel chemistry effects are generally well recognized, while engine calibration effects are not. It is important that investigations of the impact of biofuels on vehicle emissions consider the impact of engine calibration effects and are conducted using vehicles designed to operate using such fuels. We report the results of emission measurements from a Ford F-350 fueled with either fossil diesel or a biodiesel surrogate (butyl nonanoate) and demonstrate the critical influence of engine calibration on NOx emissions. Using the production calibration the emissions of NOx were higher with the biodiesel fuel. Using an adjusted calibration (maintaining equivalent exhaust oxygen concentration to that of the fossil diesel at the same conditions by adjusting injected fuel quantities) the emissions of NOx were unchanged, or lower, with biodiesel fuel. For ethanol, a review of the literature data addressing the impact of ethanol blend levels (E0-E85) on emissions from gasoline light-duty vehicles in the U.S. is presented. The available data suggest that emissions of NOx, non-methane hydrocarbons, particulate matter (PM), and mobile source air toxics (compounds known, or suspected, to cause serious health impacts) from modern gasoline and diesel vehicles are not adversely affected by increased biofuel content over the range for which the vehicles are designed to operate. Future increases in biofuel content when accomplished in concert with changes in engine design and calibration for new vehicles should not result in problematic increases in emissions impacting urban air quality and may in fact facilitate future required emissions reductions. A systems perspective (fuel and vehicle) is needed to fully understand, and optimize, the benefits of biofuels when blended into gasoline and diesel. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"alcohol; biofuel; carbon monoxide; gasoline; nitrogen oxide; volatile organic compound; air pollution; analysis; chemistry; exhaust gas; particulate matter; Air Pollution; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Ethanol; Gasoline; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978498201

The research method employed morphology observation, stomata density measurement, and wet weight measurement of Sansevieria trifasciatas in glass boxes. The result of the research showed that stomata density level was low. Difference wet weight measurement of the plants showed that there was weight increasing on the plants when they situated in the drier growing media inside glass boxes.

So there is a considerable need to wake up the sleeping giant in order to fulfill GHG reduction promises. Renewable electricity success is very much based on adequate financial return to investors without the burden of searching for customers. The heat sector works quite different. 20 Mio single appliances in private or rented buildings for tenants or companies but industrial appliances as well need to be switched from fossil to renewable sources without any direct return. Using system analysis the German Renewable Energy Association (BEE) has taken the responsibility to set up a strategy for vibrant development of renewable heat markets. Analyses shows the different role of influencing factors like craftsmen, industry, public opinion, innovation, subsidies or legal framework conditions which are all very much interlinked. But based on the existing system of legal rules and state subsidies no dynamic growth in decisions for renewable appliances will be possible. Thereby Germany will probably fail in achieving its climate protection goals.

Cogeneration (combined production of heat and electricity) is one of high-efficiency technologies, because the losses of primary energy are less than losses from the separate generation of heat and power. Consequently, in 27 EU member-states 70% of the district heating is based on cogeneration plants. Using one of the renewable energy sources as a fuel in cogeneration plants can provide additional advantage because these technologies can provide a double carbon reduction benefit. Biomass is suitable for using in cogeneration technologies that are based on steam turbine, gas turbine, combined cycle, internal combustion engine, Stirling engine and Organic Rankine Cycle. Biomass is one of the most important renewable energy sources in Serbia. Various estimations suggest that Serbia has potential in 1,000 ktoe of wood biomass and more than 1,400 ktoe is the agricultural biomass. Serbia has significant potential for the use of biomass, primarily in small cogeneration plant that can ensure energy supply for wood processing industry, farms, or parts of municipalities. The level of utilization of biomass in cogeneration plants in the EU, the potential of biomass utilization in small cogeneration plants in Serbia, as well as commercially available cogeneration technologies will be presented in this paper. © 2016, Gh.

Lateritic soils form through weathering and deliver abundant iron (oxy)hydroxides but very little sulfate to the lake and its sediment. To characterize the sediment biogeochemistry, we collected cores at three sites with increasing water depth and decreasing bottom water oxygen concentrations. Microbial cell densities were highest at the shallow site-a feature we attribute to the availability of labile organic matter (OM) and the higher abundance of electron acceptors due to oxic bottom water conditions. At the two other sites, OM degradation and reduction processes below the oxycline led to partial electron acceptor depletion. Genetic information preserved in the sediment as extracellular DNA (eDNA) provided information on aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs related to Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, and Thermoplasmatales. These taxa apparently played a significant role in the degradation of sinking OM. However, eDNA concentrations rapidly decreased with core depth. Despite very low sulfate concentrations, sulfate-reducing bacteria were present and viable in sediments at all three sites, as confirmed by measurement of potential sulfate reduction rates. Microbial community fingerprinting supported the presence of taxa related to Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes with demonstrated capacity for iron and sulfate reduction. Concomitantly, sequences of Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales, and Methanomicrobiales indicated potential for fermentative hydrogen and methane production. Such first insights into ferruginous sediments showed that microbial populations perform successive metabolisms related to sulfur, iron, and methane. In theory, iron reduction could reoxidize reduced sulfur compounds and desorb OM from iron minerals to allow remineralization to methane. Overall, we found that biogeochemical processes in the sediments can be linked to redox differences in the bottom waters of the three sites, like oxidant concentrations and the supply of labile OM. At the scale of the lacustrine record, our geomicrobiological study should provide a means to link the extant subsurface biosphere to past environments. © 2016 Vuillemin, Friese, Alawi, Henny, Nomosatryo, Wagner, Crowe and Kallmeyer.","Bottom waters; Extracellular DNA; Iron reduction; Iron-rich sediment; Lake Towuti; Sedimentary microbes; Sulfate reduction","organic matter; organic nitrogen; oxidizing agent; anoxia; Article; atomic absorption spectrometry; biogeochemistry; biosphere; Chloroflexi; Clostridiales; controlled study; Deltaproteobacteria; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; Firmicutes; fluorescent lighting; gene sequence; ion chromatography; lake sediment; Methanomicrobiales; microbial community; Nitrospirae; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; oxidation reduction reaction; oxygen concentration; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Ruminococcaceae; sulfate reducing bacterium; Thermoplasmatales; total organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980398286

We also include results from archived air samples in canisters and from polar firn in both hemispheres, thereby deriving an atmospheric record of nearly nine decades (1930s to present). All three halons were absent from the atmosphere until ~1970, when their atmospheric burdens started to increase rapidly. In recent years H-1211 and H-2402 mole fractions have been declining, but H-1301 has continued to grow. High-frequency observations show continuing emissions of H-1211 and H-1301 near most AGAGE sites. For H-2402 the only emissions detected were derived from the region surrounding the Sea of Japan/East Sea. Based on our observations, we derive global emissions using two different inversion approaches. Emissions for H-1211 declined from a peak of 11 kt yr-1 (late 1990s) to 3.9 kt yr-1 at the end of our record (mean of 2013-2015), for H-1301 from 5.4 kt yr-1 (late 1980s) to 1.6 kt yr-1, and for H-2402 from 1.8 kt yr-1 (late 1980s) to 0.38 kt yr-1. Yearly summed halon emissions have decreased substantially; nevertheless, since 2000 they have accounted for ~30% of the emissions of all major anthropogenic ozone depletion substances, when weighted by ozone depletion potentials. © 2016.

This next generation of engines, which aim to combine the high efficiency of diesel engines with the relative simplicity of gasoline engines, may allow engine manufacturers to continue improving efficiency and reducing emissions without a large increase in engine and aftertreatment system complexity. In this work, a 1-D heavy-duty engine model was validated with measured data and then used to generate boundary conditions for the detailed chemical kinetic simulation corresponding to various combustion modes and operating points. Using these boundary conditions, homogeneous simulations were conducted for 242 fuels with research octane number (RON) from 40 to 100 and sensitivity (S) from 0 to 12. Combustion phasing (CA50) was most dependent on RON and less dependent on S under all conditions. Both RON and S had a greater effect on combustion phasing under partiallypremixed compression ignition (PPCI) conditions (19.3°) than under mixing-controlled combustion (MCC) conditions (5.8°). The effect of RON and S were also greatest for the lowest reactivity (RON>90) fuels and under low-load conditions. The results for CA50 reflect the relative ignition delay for the various fuels at the start-of-injection (SOI) temperature. At higher SOI temperatures (>950K), CA50 was found to be less dependent on fuel sensitivity due to the convergence of ignition delay behavior of different fuels in the high-temperature region. Combustion of light-end fuels in CI engines can be an important opportunity for regulators, consumers and enginemakers alike. However, selection of the right fuel specifications will be critical in development of the combustion strategy. This work therefore provides a first look at quantifying the effect of light-end fuel chemistry on advanced CI engine combustion across the entire light-end fuel reactivity space, and provides a comparison of the trends for different combustion modes.

To calculate the average levels and the maximum values of the pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere on an annual, daily and hourly basis, the procedure of identifying the characteristic weather types or weather days of the area of interest was followed. For the current study, meteorological files were extracted from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP / USA) Global Forecasting System (GFS) available on a 6-hour temporal resolution from a planetary model of 1 degree horizontal resolution for a five-year period. The prevailing meteorological conditions or in other words characteristic weather types were obtained using these files and by applying a specific methodology based on Principal Components Analysis. The simulation of the 3-d meteorological fields was carried out for the characteristic weather types or days for the area of interest (computational domain extent 20x20 km2) with 3 × 3 km2 horizontal and 1-hour temporal resolution.

PEVs connected to the grid with smart charging strategies can be an effective way to integrate non-dispatchable renewable generation, smoothing the load curve, contributing to the system stability by providing regulation services, and moving unhealthy emissions away from city centers. This paper analyzes the combined penetration of PEVs, and wind and solar generation using a Unit Commitment model for the Spanish power system, providing some insight on how the penetration of these technologies affects relevant variables such as energy and reserve, thermal plants behavior (such as starts-up and shut-downs, technological energy share, generation costs or emissions) and systems costs. Results show that PEV increase total demand, but its optimal charging smooths the net demand (to be supplied by thermal units) and the final electricity prices. In addition, solar generation penetration leads to a larger net demand with more variability but with lower production costs than wind generation penetration, due to their different hourly profiles. Finally neither solar nor wind generation penetrations are totally profitable for the system with the assumptions made, since their investments costs do not compensate the production cost decrement, but grid parity is almost reached for both technologies.","Electric vehicle; emissions; unit commitment; wind and solar power integration","Costs; Curve fitting; Economics; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Investments; Particulate emissions; Plant shutdowns; Smart city; Solar energy; Solar power generation; System stability; Vehicles; Electricity prices; Emissions reduction; Energy cost savings; Large penetrations; Regulation services; Renewable generation; Unit-commitment; Wind and solar power; Plug-in electric vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012978016

Besides increasing adaptation and mitigation efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, climate change remains a major challenge in the twenty-first century and beyond especially for tourism which is highly climate sensitive. Hence, it is necessary for tourism to adapt to survive. The aim of the study is to provide a systematic overview of the topic to offer a foundation for better understanding different ways of integrating climate finance initiatives with tourism. Design/methodology/approach: The research focused on the top-ranked, peer reviewed journals of each of the two selected research fields. To address this topic, an in-depth systematic literature review in the fields of climate change finance and tourism adaptation development was conducted. Furthermore, because it is a relatively new research topic, conference proceedings were also explored. To guarantee wide coverage of the literature, a query of the following scholarly databases was considered: Elsevier, ScienceDirect and Web of Science. Findings: Based on the analyses of the literature available on the topic, the paper highlights the main research trends and conclusions. It is argued that there is imbalance of knowledge on climate change finance as it relates to tourism. To date, there have been relatively few published articles on this topic in the context of tourism. Based on the findings, promising areas for future research were identified, and in particular for small island communities and recommendations for future research are outlined. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited by the scope of the literature review accessed by the researcher. The results of this review may vary according to the databases used. Originality/value: Currently, there is no extensive review of articles on climate finance and tourism adaptation. This paper aims at reviewing climate finance studies published in English language to explore knowledge gaps in tourism adaptation. Sets of themes being advanced are also highlighted.

One of the core elements of this plan was the expectation that existing coal-fired steam electric generating units (EGUs) will be able to implement process equipment repairs, improvements and changes that would garner facility efficiency improvements in the proposed 4%-6% range, but were subsequently reduced to 2.1 to 4.0% in the final rule. In the past, planning such improvements would have automatically triggered fears of a (or an actual) New Source Review (NSR) of the facility. NSR's were originally put in place to insure that generating facility modifications or degradations would not have a negative impact on regulated criteria pollutant emission levels, such as NOx, SOx, CO, VOC's, HAP's, particulates, etc. CO2 is not currently identified as a criteria pollutant. This author spoke to the EPA during the 2014 public comment period, regarding NSRs which might be triggered as a consequence of the Clean Power Plan. He put forth the suggestion that the EPA and the states could avoid the triggering of NSR's by a modified or improved facility, if data could be presented that showed actual heat rate (i.e. efficiency) improvements, while emissions remained at, or were reduced from, pre-project levels, as evidenced by emissions monitoring systems. For example, the EPA could generate a guideline list of facility improvements which would, and also would not, require an NSR permit. In this presentation, we will review technology modifications in a ""typical"" coal-fired power plant which should, and which should not, trigger an NSR permit process. It is intended that this list provide facility planners with a more realistic approach for planning efficiency improvements without necessarily needing to consider full execution of an NSR permitting process.","Clean power plan; CO2; Coal-fired; CPP; Efficiency; EGU; EPA; NSR; PSD","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Fossil fuel power plants; Plants (botany); Pollution; Clean power; Coal-fired power plant; Efficiency improvement; Emissions monitoring; Generating unit; New Source Reviews; Pollutant emission; Process equipments; Efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018451833

Several temporal techniques have been proposed to reduce noise and fill gaps in the time series of satellite data. The choice of the compositing method may have a large impact on the accuracy of the phenology extracted from the reconstructed time series. This chapter presents a comparison of six methods to improve the temporal coherence and continuity of leaf area index (LAI) time series. The temporal smoothing gap filling (TSGF) method which is based on an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter combined with a linear interpolation approach for filling gaps over a limited temporal window showed the best performance when applied to time series with less than 60% of gaps. A climatology based approach outperformed other approaches for filling gaps in time series with more than 60% of missing data or when the period of missing data is longer than 100 days. Based on these findings, a dedicated approach combining the local TSGF filter with a climatology gap filling technique was developed.

An increase in environmental awareness and the existence of regulations can lead to greater complaints amongst citizens. In addition, odours that are considered as unpleasant can be perceived as being linked to health concerns in local populations. Thus, VOC and odour emission control has become an issue of utmost importance at wastewater treatment plants, and subsequently the monitoring of emissions is an equally significant task. The aim of this study is to evaluate a GC-IMS (Gas Chromatography - Ion Mobility Spectrometer) as a tool for continuous monitoring emissions from wastewater treatment plants, offering the possibility of producing fast measurements for the determination of chemical fingerprints of VOCs and odorous compounds. Air samples from different process units at a metropolitan wastewater treatment plant in the UK were collected and analysed by GC-IMS and dynamic olfactometry according to EN 13725. The GC-IMS system was used to determine magnitude of individual VOC emissions and investigate whether process types could be characterised by unique VOC fingerprints. The results showed different chemical fingerprints of volatiles in each sample and a correlation between the magnitudes of VOCs detected against results obtained by olfactometry. This suggests that GC-IMS has the potential for use as a beneficial analytical technique for the monitoring odour compounds, with greater potential than conventional electronic noses due to its higher sensitivity. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Chemical compounds; Chromatography; Electronic nose; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Fragrances; Gas chromatography; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Ion chromatography; Ion mobility spectrometers; Odor removal; Odors; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Toxicity; Water treatment plants; Chemical fingerprint; Continuous monitoring; Dynamic olfactometry; Environmental awareness; Local populations; Real time monitoring; Residential areas; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988837673

However, most of these models account for CO2 dissolution in the aqueous phase using a Henry's law approximation valid only at low pressures. These models do provide the ability to track the changes in CO2 as well as other ions in the aqueous phase following the injection of CO2.

Free cooling system is one which optimizes the air conditioning load of the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) shelter. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The main contribution of this paper is modeling and simulation of BTS shelter envelope with the Energy Plus for energy efficiency. The Shelter envelope absorb the heat from atmosphere which varies throughout the year. For the given shelter inside temperature, the Energy plus gives out the shelter envelope's sensible cooling load. This sensible cooling load is considered as separate variable. The sensible cooling load of the shelter and the equipment load are computed as thermal current. A fuzzy logic controller has been designed, which switches ON the free cooling fans or air conditioner depending upon atmospheric temperature and room temperature. Findings: Generally environmental influence on the room temperature is considered as atmospheric temperature variations. Instead if we consider the environmental influence as heat absorbed in kilo Watts (kW) and fed to the controller there will be further reduction in the energy consumption and improvements in contribution of free cooling fans. By modeling and simulating the BTS shelter in Energy Plus this findings are realized. On comparison of the energy consumption during simulations the proposed Energy plus model based control has saving of about 2.69% and 1.37% respectively for fixed and variable capacity air conditioner over the model derived from the basic principles which considerer atmospheric influence as temperature variations. The over all energy saving is increased from 12.04% to 14.41% by using the Energy Plus model based control proposed in this paper with free cooling for Chennai region. Analysis made to find priority city for free cooling in selected important cities. Bangalore region gives more free cooling saving and lesser energy consumption among the selected cities. Applications/Improvements: The simulated heat load data of envelope from Energy Plus can be directly used in the controller for real time applications. The other ways is cure fitting heat absorption data over atmospheric temperature for various seasons/periods. Using the equation and atmospheric temperature the heat load of the envelope calculated for control purpose This concept can be applied even for buildings.","BTS Shelter; Energy Efficiency; Energy Plus Model; Free Cooling System; Fuzzy Logic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995482276

For this reason, the RegCM3 climate model precipitation data, which showed a reduction in rainfall, was entered in the steady-state groundwater flow model MODFLOW for the case study of a coastal aquifer in the eastern part of the Thermaikos Gulf (North Greece). The uprising urbanization in combination with the intensive cultivation have led to the overexploitation of the coastal aquifer and seawater intrusion. The groundwater flow simulation by using the MODFLOW code indicates a negative water budget and estimates the quantities of the seawater intrusion. According to the RegCM3 climate model, the precipitation reduction is estimated to be 4% during the period of 2021-2050, while the precipitation decrease is expected to be 22% during the period of 2071-2100. Furthermore, the natural recharge of the coastal aquifer is expected to be influenced by the precipitation reduction. Finally, the seawater intrusion amounts are expected to increase during these future periods and more specifically during the second period of 2071-2100. © 2016 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

Here we use the process-based fire model SPITFIRE within the global vegetation model JSBACH to simulate wildfire activity for present-day climate conditions and future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The modeled fire emission fluxes and fire radiative power serve as input for the aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM2, which has been extended by a semiempirical plume height parametrization. Our results indicate a general increase in extratropical and a decrease in tropical wildfire activity at the end of the 21st century. Changes in emission fluxes are most pronounced for the strongest warming scenario RCP8.5 (+49% in the extratropics, -37% in the tropics). Tropospheric black carbon (BC) concentrations are similarly affected by changes in emission fluxes and changes in climate conditions with regional variations of up to -50% to +100%. In the Northern Hemispheric extratropics, we attribute a mean increase in aerosol optical thickness of +0.031±0.002 to changes in wildfire emissions. Due to the compensating effects of fire intensification and more stable atmospheric conditions, global mean emission heights change by at most 0.3 km with only minor influence on BC long-range transport. The changes in wildfire emission fluxes for the RCP8.5 scenario, however, may largely compensate the projected reduction in anthropogenic BC emissions by the end of the 21st century. © 2016.

It is also to take appropriate actions to control their exposure through improvement in facility, practices and corrective actions. Methods, Procedures and process: Occupational health survey on technicians performing sampling and analysis of crude oil, condensate, paraffinic naphtha etc. was carried out every year by a competent external agency. The BTEX vapors were absorbed in a passive sampler for 8 hours held close in the breathing zone of technicians. The absorbed components were extracted and analyzed using chromatograph for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene. Their metabolites were determined by collecting pre/post urine samples after extended hours of exposure. Results, observations and conclusions: In 2010 BTEX were below the threshold and detection limits in 4 cases out of 5. The BTEX metabolites were below detection limit (DL) and Threshold Limit value (TLV). In Oct 2012, the survey indicated abnormal and higher BTEX values; particularly Toluene was 120 mg/m3 as against the TLV of 75 mg/m3. Several steps were taken which included training, awareness of technicians, good laboratory practices, personal protective equipment and improved exhaust system and ventilation. The air intake velocity of fume hoods, HVAC system, the ambient temperature etc. were inspected and monitored. Additional fume hood was installed to extract vapors. The activated carbon filters of all 19 air extraction blowers were replaced in Sep-2013 to ensure increase in fume hood air velocity and for complete absorption of BTEX in these filters so that there is no air pollution. A special type of face mask (Model 3M 9922) was introduced which prevents direct inhalation of volatiles. BTEX exposure was minimized by improving the performance of fume hoods, extraction system, exhaust bowers and HVAC Units. Training of technicians and their awareness on release of BTEX and ways of minimizing their exposure helped us to implement a good laboratory practice thereby minimizing exposure. Strict adherence to safety procedures and using appropriate personal protective equipment reduces inhalation of BTEX. Improvement in the exhaust filters minimized air pollution. The subsequent surveys indicated that the working place is well protected against release of BTEX and there is no risk to health of the staff. By the whole process we could meet both local and international legislation on BTEX emissions. Novel/additive information: This significant improvement can be shared with ADNOC group of companies having similar work place hazards. This can be considered as an achievement and operational excellence towards ADGAS commitment in safeguarding the safety of our employees and looking for improving the work environment. © 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","Benzene; Condensate; Crude oil; Ethylbenzene; Laboratory; Metabolites; Natural gas; Occupational exposure; Petroleum; Threshold limit; Toluene; Xylene","Activated carbon; Air; Air intakes; Air pollution; Benzene; Biomolecules; Climate control; Crude oil; Ethylbenzene; Extraction; Fume control; Gasoline; Health risks; HVAC; Industrial hygiene; Laboratories; Metabolites; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Protective clothing; Surveys; Toluene; Ventilation exhausts; Xylene; Activated carbon filters; Condensate; Laboratory technicians; Occupational exposure; Operational excellence; Personal protective equipment; Threshold limit values; Threshold limits; Petroleum analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044330339

Consequently, greenspaces are recognised for their ability to locally reduce the urban heat island, a phenomenon that has negative implications for the thermal comfort and health of urban citizens. However, the amount of cooling provided by a greenspace and the distance over which that cooling extends depend on factors such as greenspace size and characteristics. Based on data collected in and around eight London greenspaces, with areas ranging from 0.2 to 12.1 ha, this work models the distance and magnitude of cooling provided by each greenspace and defines the relationships between cooling extent and the size of greenspace or the areas of tree canopy and grass. Such data, illustrating the value of expanding the area of urban greenspaces and explaining how cooling relates to greenspace size/coverage characteristics, will be of use to urban planners and climatologists concerned with finding solutions to the urban heat island. Modelling was statistically valid on calm warm nights (with mean air temperatures ≥10 °C and wind speed ≤3 m s-1). On those nights, cooling distance increased linearly with increasing area of greenspace, tree canopy and grass, but the relationship between those factors and the amount of cooling was non-linear. Cooling distance was most strongly related with tree canopy whereas the amount of cooling was most strongly linked to the grass coverage. Our results suggest that a comprehensive cooling service on calm warm nights within cities with similar climate/characteristics to London may come from greenspaces with 3-5 ha, situated 100-150 m apart. © 2016.","Ecosystem service provision; Green infrastructure; Urban heat island; Urban planning","air temperature; canopy architecture; climate change; cooling; ecosystem service; greenspace; heat island; urban planning; vegetation cover; wind velocity; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959265253

The severity of disease epidemics and accumulation of associated trichothecene mycotoxins in wheat kernels is strongly driven by meteorological factors. The potential impacts of change in climate are reviewed from the perspective of the FGSC life cycle and host resistance mechanisms influenced by abiotic pressures at the ecological, physiological and molecular level. Alterations in climate patterns and cropping systems may affect the distribution, composition and load of FGSC inoculum, but quantitative information is lacking regarding the differential responses among FGSC members. In general, the coincidence of wet and warm environment during flowering enhances the risk of FHB epidemics, but the magnitude and direction of the change in FHB and mycotoxin risk will be a consequence of a multitude of effects on key processes affecting inoculum dynamics and host susceptibility. Rates of residue decomposition, inoculum production and dispersal may be significantly altered by changes in crop rotations, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]), temperature and precipitation patterns, but the impact may be much greater for regions where inoculum is more limited, such as temperate climates. In regions of non-limiting inoculum, climate change effects will likely be greater on the pathogenic rather than on the saprophytic phase. Although the mechanisms by which abiotic stress influences wheat defences against Fusarium species are unknown, available data would suggest that wheat may be more susceptible to Fusarium infection under future climate conditions. Additional research in this area should be a priority so that breeding efforts and climate resilient management strategies can be developed. © 2016 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Deoxynivalenol; Global change; Trichothecene; Triticum aestivum; Wheat scab","trichothecene; vomitoxin; climate change; cropping system; decomposition; disease predisposition; Fusarium graminearum; Fusarium head blight; global change; inoculation; nonhuman; pathogenesis; Review; saprotroph; species diversity; system analysis; Triticum aestivum; waste; weather; wheat",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012042836

First principles calculations reveal that the under-coordinated lattice Cu-O pair on different CuO surfaces synergistically activates methane with barriers as low as 60.5 kJ mol-1 on the high-energy CuO(010) surface and 76.6 kJ mol-1 on the most stable CuO(111) surface. The significantly low activation barrier is due to (1) the stabilization of the transition state (TS) and the reduced strain on the dissociating methane molecule and (2) the stabilization of the co-adsorbed products of dissociation, resulting in favorable thermodynamics. The mechanism, which is also applicable to the chemisorbed oxygen-containing Cu(111) surface, involves simultaneous copper addition and hydrogen abstraction by the chemisorbed/lattice oxygen via a 4-centered (CH3-(Cu)-H-(O)) TS, stabilized by the Cu-CH3 and O-H dipole-dipole interaction. The activation barriers for the subsequent dissociation of surface CH3 moieties and coupling of CH3 with CH2 on the CuO(111) surface are both much higher than the barrier of the first C-H bond dissociation in methane. The mechanistic insights elucidated in this article could be applicable to methane activation by other metal-oxygen (M-O) site-pairs and thus can serve to screen potential oxide surfaces for the purpose. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Calculations; Chemical activation; Chemisorption; Copper oxides; Dissociation; Oxygen; Stabilization; Thermodynamics; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Activation barriers; C-H bond dissociation; CH-bond activation; Dipole dipole interactions; First-principles calculation; Hydrogen abstraction; Methane activation; Value-added chemicals; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973137234

These effects improve local air quality near the ground. On the upwind side the downwash transports clean air to the ground. On the backward side of the building, polluted air is elevated to larger heights, thus local ground level concentrations decreases. However, there is no clear understanding in the literature what is the far field effect of a single tall building.

As widespread measurement of methane emissions is precluded by current in vivo methods, the development of an easily measured proxy is desirable. An equation has been developed to predict methane from the mid-infrared (MIR) spectra of milk within routine milk-recording programs. The main goals of this study were to improve the prediction equation for methane emissions from milk MIR spectra and to illustrate its already available usefulness as a high throughput phenotypic screening tool. A total of 532 methane measurements considered as reference data (430 ± 129 g of methane/day) linked with milk MIR spectra were obtained from 165 cows using the SF6 technique. A first derivative was applied to the MIR spectra. Constant (P0), linear (P1) and quadratic (P2) modified Legendre polynomials were computed from each cows stage of lactation (days in milk), at the day of SF6 methane measurement. The calibration model was developed using a modified partial least-squares regression on first derivative MIR data points × P0, first derivative MIR data points × P1, and first derivative MIR data points × P2 as variables. The MIR-predicted methane emissions (g/day) showed a calibration coefficient of determination of 0.74, a cross-validation coefficient of determination of 0.70 and a standard error of calibration of 66 g/day. When applied to milk MIR spectra recorded in the Walloon Region of Belgium (≈2000000 records), this equation was useful to study lactational, annual, seasonal, and regional methane emissions. We conclude that milk MIR spectra has potential to be used to conduct high throughput screening of lactating dairy cattle for methane emissions. The data generated enable monitoring of methane emissions and production characteristics across and within herds. Milk MIR spectra could now be used for widespread screening of dairy herds in order to develop management and genetic selection tools to reduce methane emissions. © CSIRO 2016.","breeding; management; methane prediction.","breeding; calibration; carbon emission; cattle; dairy farming; environmental management; equation; infrared spectroscopy; lactation; measurement method; methane; milk; pollution monitoring; prediction; sustainability; Belgium; Wallonia; Bos",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958184857

Aircraft cruise emissions are the only direct source of anthropogenic BC particles at altitudes above the tropopause.1 Black carbon aerosols are strong solar radiation absorbers and have long atmospheric lifetimes.2 Therefore, BC results in positive radiative forcing and is believed to be the second largest contributor to climate change.3 Additionally, upper troposphere and lower stratosphere BC particles contribute to climate forcing indirectly by acting as ice nucleation sites and cloud activators.4-6 With regards to human health, a link between cardiopulmonary diseases and carbonaceous black particulate matter has recently been suggested.7 As concern for human health risks and environmental impacts caused by aviation BC emissions increases, emission reduction strategies will need to be implemented. An ambitious carbon, solid and gaseous, emission reduction goal of 50% reduction by 2050 as compared to 2000-2005 levels have already been defined by the International Air Transport Association and Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe.8 Meeting these goals will require significant engineering advancements requiring a long implementation period.

The U. S., Europe (UK), and China are of particular interest and seeing the most growth. This paper examines the category of small wind starting with the variety of definitions found in the literature. Growth world-wide, with an emphasis on these major markets, is analyzed for trends and predicted development. The focus is on fixed pitch, small horizontal axis wind turbines, with a direct drive DC generator in the 1-10 kW class. To understand small wind turbines it is necessary to discuss design tools available for design. Included in this design discussion is the necessity for computational fluid dynamic models as well as experimentally testing both open rotors and wind tunnel models. In order for small wind turbines to continue to improve, better technologies are necessary. For design, wind turbines must be optimized for peak performance to include startup/cut-in speeds and other modifications. These wind turbines will rely on new and purposely designed airfoils; however, for low Reynolds number conditions actual airfoil data are needed as many of the computational tools do not accurately predict separation. Increasingly, noise is an issue, especially if these wind turbines will be sited in populated urban areas. An analysis of noise generation as well as design techniques for reducing noise is necessary for future designs. Important discussions on the technologies particular to small wind turbines should include the topics of aerodynamics and structures/materials. Future applications of small wind turbines seem bright. Small wind turbines are contributing to the concept of distributed generation and helping to reduce the carbon footprint. Urban environments are becoming more accepted for small wind turbines which lead to studies of flow fields in and around buildings. Of particular note are hybrid systems which combine wind with other energy generation systems such as solar, internal combustion engines, and diesel engines to name a few. These systems are advantageous for the homeowner, small business, cell phone towers, remote locations, and backup emergency power systems (to include lighting). Lastly, the concept of energy storage must be addressed in the context of small wind turbines, especially those turbines used in an isolated application. Permitting and government incentives are critical to the future success of these wind turbines.

These threats pose real risks of putting oil and gas producers out of business. They lead to the problem of stranded assets and a significant downward valuation of oil and gas producers. This calls for divesting from and shorting coal, oil, and gas. The economies of oil- and gas-rich countries are typically in a deplorable state, since they did not use their past windfalls to build up buffers and invest in a diversified economy.

Mycotoxins are produced by a wide variety of fungal species, each having their own characteristics and requirements. The geographic distribution of toxigenic fungi reflects their ecological needs, with thermophilic fungi prevalent at lower latitudes and psychrophiles at the higher latitudes. A resulting gradient of mycotoxin contamination has been repeatedly stressed. Changes in climatic conditions will lead to shifts in the fungal population and the mycotoxin patterns. In general, climate change is expected to increase mycotoxin contamination of crops, but due to the complexity of mycoflora associated to each crop and its interaction with the environment, it appears rash to draw conclusions without specific studies. Very recently first quantitative estimations of impacts of climate change on mycotoxin occurrence have been made. Two studies each applied models of different disciplines including climate projection, crop phenology and fungal/mycotoxin prediction to cereals cultivated in Europe. They were followed by a case study on climate change effects on Alternaria moulds and their mycotoxins in tomato. Results showed that DON contamination of wheat grown in Europe was, in general, expected to increase. However, variation was large, and in some years and some regions a decrease in DON contamination was expected. Regarding aflatoxin contamination of maize grown in Europe, an increase was estimated, mainly in the +2 °C scenario. Two main research gaps were identified related to the (limited) number of existing quantitative models taking into account climate change and their validation in limited areas. Efforts are therefore mandatory to be prepared for future changes and challenges on model validation and limited mycotoxin-crop combinations. © 2016 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Europe; Food safety; Impact assessment; Predictive modelling; Scenario analyses","aflatoxin; mycotoxin; vomitoxin; Alternaria; cereal; climate change; crop production; Europe; food safety; food security; fungal contamination; latitude; nonhuman; psychrophile; Review; tomato; wheat",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012054818

It aims to increase public support for climate-mitigation strategies by showing the medical case for negative climate-induced health impacts, the economic burden it entails and the public response to climate change that may be expected when health frames are used. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews medical, economic and behavioural studies focusing on climate-induced health impacts, its economic costs and its potential for catalysing public engagement for climate policy. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about the various direct and indirect effects of climate change on human health which includes both physical impacts (infectious and non-infectious diseases) and non-physical impacts (mental disorders and reduced labour productivity). Extreme events such as storms, floods and droughts further seriously affect the health of many people, as they restrict food production and water supply. Economic damage costs of climate-induced health impacts are underestimated. Together, natural science, medical and economic studies warrant giving more attention to health in public debates on climate change. The more so as evidence of behavioural studies suggests that the use of health frames reinforces public concern for climate issues. Originality/value: This paper argues that climate-induced health impacts and their economic costs should be given more serious attention in discussions about climate-mitigation strategies. They can augment public support for climate policy. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioural response; Climate policy; Economic costs; Health impacts; Public preferences; Public support","behavioral response; climate change; cost analysis; environmental economics; environmental issue; environmental policy; extreme event; flood; food production; health impact; local participation; public health; storm; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999634784

The NC10 phylum bacteria made up less than 1% of all bacterial sequences. The phylogenetic analysis was complemented by qPCR showing that AAA ranged from 0.28 × 106 to 3.9 × 106 16S rRNA gene copies g-1 dw in bulk soil and 0.27 × 106 to 2.8 × 106 in the rhizosphere. The abundance of NC10 phylum bacteria was an order of magnitude lower. Revisiting published diversity studies, we found that AAA have been detected, but not linked to methane oxidation, in several paddy fields. Our data suggest an important role of AAA in methane cycling in paddy fields. © FEMS 2016.","16S rRNA gene; Amplicon sequencing; Anaerobic oxidation of methane; Methanoperedens nitroreducens; AAA; Microbial community; Paddy fields; Rice rhizosphere","anoxic conditions; fertilizer application; gene expression; genetic analysis; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; microbial community; nitrogen; oxidation; paddy field; phylogenetics; rhizosphere; rice; Italy; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995784291

An alternative strategy is to use mechanistic or semi-mechanistic models that incorporate variables that are known to have important effects on physiological responses of the organisms. We compared models built using simple climatic variables with models incorporating calculations of monthly soil water balance when predicting the distribution of 258 Mexican tree species associated with five different ecosystems. The species chosen varied in their degree of exposure to periods of drought. Water balance was calculated using a bucket model that integrated the effects of evapotranspiration and rainfall over a year. Models incorporating calculated soil water balance were contrasted with models that used net annual rainfall as a measure of variability in water availability. The effects of mean annual temperature and temperature range were included in both sets of models. More detailed water balance models showed a significantly improved ability to predict the distribution of some, but not all, species. The observed increase in mean AUC when replacing Panualby DHanualwas higher for the group of species of xeric scrub (0.15), intermediate for the group of species of deciduous tropical forests (0.09), and significant, but comparatively low for the group of species of tropical moist forests (0.07). Calculated water balance did not improve predictions for species found in montane forests. We conclude that including detailed calculations of soil water balance can improve the species distribution models in areas of both moist and dry warm tropical forests, where temperature remains comparatively constant. However including variability in soil water balance is less important when species distributions are limited by the effect of elevation on temperature. Model predictions could be further refined through the incorporation of soil parameters and geomorphological variability at a local scales. © 2016, Sociedad Botanica de Mexico, A.C.

India is among the world's fourth-largest petroleum consumer due to which the vehicular emissions increased eight times over the last two decades. Due to the environmental awareness and depletion of fossil fuel reserves, attention has been given to find an alternative energy source. Among the alternatives existing, Biodiesel is the one which is less polluting and eco-friendly. So it can be used in industrial, commercial, agricultural and other sectors as a substitute for diesel. Biodiesel can be produced from crude vegetable oil, non-edible oil, frying oils (waste), animal tallow and algae by a process of chemical reaction called Transesterification. Biodiesel is also known as methyl or ethyl esters of the feedstock from which it is produced. It is miscible with diesel oil which allows the use of blends of petro diesel and biodiesel in any percentage. The C.I. engines fuelled with biodiesel perform more or less in the same fashion as that with the conventional fuel. Comparative to diesel, biodiesel has high Cetane number and lower compressibility. Additionally, the heat release rate of biodiesel is slightly lower than diesel owing to low calorific value, low volatility and high viscosity. The problem of high viscosity can be eradicated by transesterification process and by adding additives which help us to store the biodiesel for a longer duration of time without any decay. Exhaust emissions are significantly reduced with the use of biodiesel or its blends. The present paper investigates the potential of Mahua (Madhuca Indica) oil for biodiesel production as it can be extracted from seeds of Mahua tree which are indigenous to India. It can grow even in dry regions and are found abundantly in several parts of India. © Applied Science Innovations Pvt.

Furthermore, these products provide local stakeholders with important baseline data for the development of sustainable management strategies. Using remote sensing techniques it is possible to provide spatially explicit information of AGB from local to global scales. In this work we present a two-stage up-scaling approach to estimate forest aboveground biomass in Mexico at national scale based on multi-sensor remote sensing data. For this, we estimate firstly AGB along the airborne LiDAR transects using Mexican National Forest Inventory data collected by CONAFOR and very high resolution NASA G-LiHT LiDAR data. We calculated from discrete-return LiDAR data 88 LiDAR metrics that are then related to field-estimated AGB. In the next step, we calibrate active (ALOS PALSAR) and passive satellite imagery (Landsat) with LiDAR-based AGB estimates in a non-parametric Random Forest model to create a national wall-to-wall AGB map. Finally, the generated AGB product is validated using independent Mexican National Forest Inventory (NFI) data that were not used for model training. Furthermore, we modelled AGB at national scale using satellite imagery and NFI data only and compared to the results from the two-stage up-scaling approach. The estimated AGB products showed similar goodness-of-fit statistics at different scales compared to the independent validation data set. However, we observed different AGB spatial patterns in two products, especially in regions where NFI data are not available, but where high AGB values occur.

For past precipitation frequency analyses, regions are defined using observed datasets. However, for frequency analysis of projected precipitation, climate change can influence the grouping of sites, such as homogeneous regions of extreme precipitation. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of region definition in the regional frequency analysis (RFA) of extreme precipitation in climate change scenarios. Specifically, we use a statistically downscaled climate modeling-based dataset for Chicago, Illinois, USA and 8 climate change cases (4 models with 2 future climate scenarios). The cases were developed using the asynchronous regional regression model, which focuses on accurately resolving the tails of the probability distributions of precipitation data. For the 40 stations around Chicago, the clustering of precipitation stations varies. The precipitation characteristics, such as the averages of the monthly maximum and annual precipitation and the L-moments of the annual maximum daily precipitation, vary significantly over different time periods and regional clusters. Furthermore, the number of stations that exhibit heterogeneity in terms of their clusters is lower when changes in the clustering of the climate regions are considered than when these changes are ignored. The results of this work illustrate the need to consider changes in the regional clustering of precipitation stations in RFA, which is particularly useful for designing water-related infrastructure in response to climate change. © Inter-Research 2016.","Climate change; Extreme precipitation; Regional clustering; Regional frequency analysis","climate change; climate modeling; cluster analysis; frequency analysis; heterogeneity; precipitation (climatology); probability; regional climate; spatial variation; Chicago; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961798918

Moreover, the control measures adopted have not been very effective and fully enforced (Suleiman, 2013). It is based on the above fact that this study focuses on mapping of the spatial distribution of air pollutants within Port Harcourt Metropolis. This study goes further to propose some preventive and monitoring measures utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS) as an analysis tool. The research focused on spatial variation and distribution of air pollutants in Port Harcourt city. The main objectives of this study was to analyze the level of atmospheric pollutants in parts of Port Harcourt metropolis and to evaluate the temporal variation of atmospheric pollution in the study locations. A correlation test was performed to establish the relationship between each air quality parameter within Port Harcourt Metropolis. GIS was utilized to investigate the spatial distribution of the air pollutants. The main finding of this research is the comparison between spatial and non-spatial (statistical) analysis approaches, which indicated that correlation analysis and spatial interpolation analysis of GIS using the average levels of air pollutants from a single monitoring station or by group of few monitoring stations is a relatively efficient method for comparing the health effects of air pollution in emerging locations of under-developing cities. There was a significant positive correlation between variable under consideration, and the research shows an increasing trend of concentration of pollutants in maps which was used to confirm the depleting air quality in Rumokoro, Garrison and Mile 1 areas of Port Harcourt. A non-spatial approach alone may be insufficient for an appropriate evaluation of the impact of air pollutant variables and their inter-relationships and spatial distribution within cities. It is important to evaluate the spatial features of air pollutants before modeling the air pollution-health relationships. Hence, this air quality maps could play a vital role in the decision making process for air pollution monitoring strategies and policies. © 2016 by the Internat ional Ast ronaut ical Federat ion (IAF).

A random point-based sampling approach, which involved 1000 sample points, was compared against a plot/grid sampling (cluster sampling) approach that involved a 1.83 m square grid of points embedded within 0.04 ha circular plots. The imagery products included aerial photography from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Imagery Program (viewed within ArcGIS), and Google Earth imagery. For Tallahassee, Florida, the estimate of tree canopy cover was 48.6-49.1% using Google Earth imagery and 44.5-45.1% using NAIP imagery within ArcGIS. Statistical tests suggested that the two sampling approaches produced significantly different estimates using the two different imagery sources. For Tacoma, Washington, the estimated tree canopy cover was about 19.2-20.0% using Google Earth imagery and 17.3-18.1% when using NAIP imagery in ArcGIS. Here, there seemed to be no significant difference between the random point-based sampling efforts when used with the two different image sources, while the opposite was true when using the plot/grid sampling approach. However, our findings showed some similarities between the two sampling approaches; hence, the random point-based sampling approach might be preferred due to the time and effort required, and because fewer opportunities for classification problems might arise.

Compared to standard gasoline combustion, the CO2-production can be clearly reduced by using a methane-based fuel as it has a beneficial H/C ratio. The high knock resistance of methane allows higher compression ratios so that the thermodynamic efficiency is enhanced. Furthermore, the realization of a stratified mixture formation concept shows great potential to further increase fuel savings due to the reduced throttling losses. In the present work, an URANS-based simulation strategy using the commercial code AVL Fire for the direct injection (DI) of CNG and the mixture formation, including a discretisation of the full nozzle and cylinder geometry is presented. High pressure ratios between the injector and the cylinder lead to a choked flow inside the nozzle. A supersonic region, including shock-occurrence follows as the jet is expanded further downstream the orifice. To successfully resolve the multi-scale flow phenomena the mesh generation process involves the design of a fine hexahedral mesh for the injector, which is merged to the moving cylinder mesh by an arbitrary interface. Turbulence is modelled using the k-ζ-f model. To estimate the grid-induced error of the simulation, a set of calculations was performed on meshes of decreasing cell dimension. Different nozzle geometries are investigated and evaluated with regard to their mixture formation suitability as well as the effect of increasing rail pressure. Variations include an inward opening multi-hole injector and an outward opening annular ring injector. The results show a strong tendency of the gas jets to interact with each other and with the surrounding walls. © 2016 WIT Press.","Compressed natural gas; Compressible flow; Direct injection; Internal combustion engines; Stratified mixture formation; Supersonic gas jet",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073581583

Both the CSEM and seismic inversions are performed using the ensemble Kalman filter, which updates property models without calculating sensitivities, and provides the ability to quantify uncertainty in the models. Theproposed inversion methodology is applied to synthetic CO2-monitoring test cases. It was found that it was necessary to use information on saturation changes from inversion results from CSEM as prior information in the seismic inversion to be able to accurately locate both saturation and pressure changes. © 2016 SEG.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019147128

This has resulted in the measurable alteration of ocean carbonate chemistry. Ocean pH has already decreased by a global average of 0.1, and unmitigated CO2 emissions will cause ocean pH to decrease by as much as 0.4 by the year 2100 and 0.77 by 2300. These will be the most rapid and greatest changes in ocean carbonate chemistry experienced by marine organisms over the past tens of millions of years. Evidence from a wide range of studies indicates that these changes are a threat to important biological processes (productivity, calcification, internal physiology, fertilization, embryo development, larval settlement, and communication) and ultimately to the survival of many marine organisms. Whilst a global issue, upwelling regions and polar and some sub polar waters are particularly vulnerable to early onset of ocean acidification, although tropical waters and ecosystems such as coral reefs will be vulnerable too. The only way of reducing the impacts of ocean acidification and widespread extinctions on a global scale is through urgent and substantial reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Power ful international intermediaries in this process are the United Nations (UN), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the European Union (EU), the World and European Banks (WB and EB). One of structural subdivisions of this interaction is development of the international environmental management qualified to solve environmental problems: pollution of all items of natural environment (atmosphere, water sources, soil, etc.) exceeding the carrying capacity of natural ecosystem; depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (coal, oil, etc.) and some renewable natural resources (fresh water, woods, etc.); reduction and loss of biodiversity. The top-priority dangerous manifestations of environmental problems are regional production-induced desertification, soil degradation, depletion and contamination of water sources, air pollution, reduction of woods area, accumulation of hazardous and toxic wastes. Ecological problems have already crossed state borders of separate countries, and depletion and contamination of ecological systems of some countries significantly impact environmental state of the world, affecting health and wellbeing of people in different countries. In this situation failure to take timely decisions can lead to significant economic losses, irreversible damage to the habitation environment of millions of people, freezing of the economic growth of some regions and whole countries. For solution of environmental problems development of international environmental policy and reliable organizational and legal measure for environmental protection on both international and national levels are required. In accordance with the UN expert judgement the most environmentally degraded towns of the world are metallurgical centers of the CIS. Such situation forces the governments of the CIS countries to enforce more and more environmental legislations, which are binding to implement new and modernize existing companies with implementation of clean technologies.

Global communities are shifting towards urbanization due to various factors. Urbanization has caused lack of stable condition for dwellers due to environmental and anthropogenic factors such as land cover changes. Urban temperature rising is the main factors hindering urban dwellers at global level due to insufficient green areas. Social institutions are playing important role in urban greening and urban climate regulation. Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church has long history in indigenous trees biodiversity conservation that plays largely greening role in urban and rural parts of the country. However, there is a research gap in Ethiopia regarding the role of urban green area in the church yards in regulating urban temperature and microclimate change. Therefore, the study evaluated the role of church managed forests in Addis Ababa in regulating surface temperature. Surface temperature inside four church forests at a buffer radius of 0–50 m, 50–100 m, 100–200 m and 200–500 m estimated using Landsat image thermal band 6 of 1986, 2000 and 2010 and ground measurement by ambient thermometer at 10:00 am, 12:30 am and 3:00 pm local time. The ground measurement was done in order to validate satellite image analysis. Plant species diversity, DBH, H, HC, BH and BA was measured. There were 1167 trees in the four studied churches. The mean temperatures of the studied sites were 22.5±0.1, 23.25±0.2, 24±0.6, 24.6±1.1 and 25.5±2.2°C on site,0–50 m, 50–100 m, 100–200m and 200–500 m respectively for 1986 images; 23.2±0.5, 23.3±1.0, 24.3±2.1, 24.8±2.2 and 25.5±1.8°C on site, 0-50 m, 50–100 m, 100–200 m and 200–500 m respectively for 2000 images and 23.2±0.3, 23.27±0.2, 23.7±1.6, 24±1.4 and 24.7±1.3°C on site, 0–50 m, 50–100 m, 100–200 m and 200–500 m respectively for 2010 images. The result illustrated a significant influence of green area on urban temperature in the buffering radius and implies the possibility of regulating urban temperature by planning urban green area in appropriate radius intervals.

Specific climate conditions, which occurs in urban areas, are expected to change with almost certainly disadvantageous effects on quality of life at outdoor spaces. This paper presents an evaluation of climate change impact on cities, by simulating the thermal performance of outdoor spaces, using different climate scenarios. The Plaza de Armas of Concepción (Chile) has been used as case study, and climate conditions at 2020, 2050 and 2080 have been produced for the acknowledged A2'medium-high' emissions Greenhouse Gases GHG scenario, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC. To simulate the urban microclimate, the ENVI-met v4 software, a three-dimensional numerical model based primarily on fluid dynamic and thermodynamic models has been used to estimate interaction between surfaces, plant and atmosphere at the micro-scale. The comparison between different scenarios and discussion about results are presented as well.

Besides, there are considerable development in marine transportation and activities: from offshore installation supply to the exploitation of marine resources. It leads to the high increasing of fuel consumption for ship operation on the ocean. Moreover, in 2010, International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) as a technical measure to limit pollution of the environment resulted by marine engines [1]. EEDI is expressed by CO2 gram per ship's capacity. So smaller EEDI means smaller CO2 exhausting to the environment. With that reason, many efforts have been made to optimize ship's fuel consumption, to save the operation cost, on the one hand and to reduce the CO2 emission, or reduce EEDI on the other hand. From the EEDI equations [2], according to Bazari & Longva, 2011 and IMO MEPC 63 (2011) [2], there are 15 methods of EEDI reduction. Within these 15 methods, hull form and propulsion optimization are common approaches for many designers and researchers. To optimize the hull form and propeller, the designers need to carry many designs then select the best one based on their performance. Estimation of hull form and propeller performance usingmodel tests widely accepted as most reliable means, and could be considered as the closest method to reality. However, due to time and cost for making testing models, it is not suitable for optimization process; it is just only used to validate the result of optimization. Besides, with the rapid improvement of computational resources, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) is getting to become a useful tool in ship design and power prediction. CFD method is able to look into local flow properties and providing a room for designers to improve the design. In this paper, the authors will investigate the capability of CFD method for propeller and propeller - hull form performance calculation, during ship optimization process. The approach of CFD here is Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANSE). During the optimization process, many designs have to be analyzed, so the level of accuracy and computational time of the calculation have to be taken into account. The paper has two major parts. For the propeller calculation in open water, the authors will perform 3 methods to model the rotation of propeller and select the best one in terms of accuracy and time consumption. Later, the self-propulsion simulation is carried out. That is a setup with full rotating propeller behind a ship. The ISIS - CFD code, integrated in the commercial software Numeca Fine Marine is used. The simulation results will be compared with model test results. © 2016 The Vietnam Maritime University.","CFD; EEDI reduction; Hull; ISIS code; Optimization; Propeller; RANSE","Carbon dioxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy efficiency; Fluid dynamics; Global warming; Hulls (ship); Marine biology; Marine engines; Marine pollution; Navier Stokes equations; Optimization; Propellers; Propulsion; Ships; Vehicle performance; Waterway transportation; Computational resources; Energy efficiency design indices (EEDI); Hull; International maritime organizations; ISIS code; Performance calculation; RANSE; Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations; Ship propulsion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009135164

These revenues, deposited in the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), must be invested in projects that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maximizing benefits for disadvantaged communities and households. SB 535 (de León 2012), as amended by AB 1550 (Gomez 2016), requires at least thirty-five percent of these revenues to be invested in projects that benefit disadvantaged community residents and low-income households and communities. Implementing these statutory requirements has been the work of a coalition of policy-advocacy and organizing groups, who have too often seen public investment in environmental justice communities fail to meet the needs of low-income residents of color - or worse yet, actually harm them. This article presents the"" disad-vantaged community benefits"" framework that this coalition developed, which is now incorporated in large part into statewide guidelines on climate investments. The framework offers a four-step process for evaluating whether a project meaningfully benefits a disadvantaged community: (1) whether a project meets an important need identified by underserved residents (2) in a way that provides them a significant benefit and (3) targets its benefits primarily to low-income people while (4) avoiding substantial burdens on a disadvantaged community. This article discusses the genesis of this framework and its importance in enabling local residents to shape investment decisions in their communities, and then assesses a GGRF investment in affordable housing according to this framework. A key lesson of California's experience in directing climate investments to benefit disadvantaged communities is that the same investments that promote the state's climate goals are also helping to tackle the crisis of extreme inequality.",,"affordable housing; emission control; environmental justice; implementation process; investment; California; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018921322

Most community-based approaches rely on partnerships and knowledge exchange between communities, civil society organizations, and professionals such as practitioners and/or scientists. However, few models have actively integrated more horizontal knowledge exchange from community to community. We reflect on the transferability of community owned solutions between indigenous communities by exploring challenges and achievements of community peer-to-peer knowledge exchange as a way of empowering communities to face up to local environmental and social challenges. Using participatory visual methods, indigenous communities of the North Rupununi (Guyana) identified and documented their community owned solutions through films and photostories. Indigenous researchers from this community then shared their solutions with six other communities that faced similar challenges within Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, and Brazil. They were supported by in-country civil society organizations and academics. We analyzed the impact of the knowledge exchange through interviews, field reports, and observations. Our results show that indigenous community members were significantly more receptive to solutions emerging from, and communicated by, other indigenous peoples, and that this approach was a significant motivating force for galvanizing communities to make changes in their community. We identified a range of enabling factors, such as building capacity for a shared conceptual and technical understanding, that strengthens the exchange between communities and contributes to a lasting impact. With national and international policy-makers mobilizing significant financial resources for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, we argue that the promotion of community owned solutions through community peer-to-peer exchange may deliver more long-lasting, socially and ecologically integrated, and investment-effective strategies compared to top-down, expert led, and/or foreign-led initiatives. © 2016 by the author(s).","Best practices; Community owned solutions; Environmental governance; Guiana shield; Guyana; Indigenous; Knowledge exchange; Participatory; Visual","advocacy; best management practice; environmental management; governance approach; indigenous knowledge; participatory approach; policy making; Colombia; French Guiana; Guyana Shield; Suriname; Venezuela",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976523645

A study of these critical pollution events showed a close correlation with the wind coming from the industrial site to the adjacent urban area. During 2011, at monitoring sites closes to the industrial area, at least the 65% of PM10 exceedances were related to wind day conditions (characterized by at least 3 consecutive hours of wind coming from 270-360±2deg with an associated speed higher than 7 m/s). For this reason, in 2012 an integrated environmental permit and a regional air quality plan were enacted to reduce pollutant emissions from industrial plants. A study of PM10 levels registered during windy days was performed during critical episodes of pollution highlighting that the difference between windy days and no windy days' concentrations reduces from 2012 to 2014 in industrial site. False negative events (verified ex-post by observed meteorological data) not identified by the forecast model - did not show a significant influence on PM concentration: PM10 values were comparable and sometimes lower than windy days levels. It is reasonable that the new scenario with a relevant reduction emissions form Ilva plant reduced the pollutants contribution from industrial area, contributing to PM10 levels decrease, also in false negative events.","Air pollution; Benzo(a)Pyrene (B(a)P); Mitigation policies; Particulate matter (PM); Steel plant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043305017

Every year, from soil fertilized with solid manure (N300) an average of 12.3% nitrogen (which is incorporated with manure) leached. Compared to unfertilized soil, nitrogen leaching increased by 96%. Depending on hydrothermal conditions, during the year of incorporation 2.2-17.2% and during the subsequent year 1.5-5.0% of nitrogen from the incorporated mineral fertilizers leached. Fertilization with solid and semi-liquid cattle manure stimulates leaching of calcium (47-51%), magnesium (46-62%), and chlorine (34-56%), but produces no essential impact on the loss of potassium and sulfur. Cover crops for green manure reduce atmospheric precipitation infiltration in sandy loam soil during autumn, and the effects of nutrient leaching depend on the plant species. Fabaceae plants clover (Trifolium pretense L.) stimulate nitrogen leaching, while Poaceae orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and Brassicaceae fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L.) lessen it. Incorporation of green manure biomass does not alter potassium and calcium leaching, but substantially reduces organic carbon leaching. It was determined that in 1987-2014 on the territory of Lithuania, due to increased average cartemperatures and lengthening of the spring and autumn periods, annual precipitation infiltration increased (y annual = 17.0x + 267.9 R2 = 0.29) and this enlarges the risk of chemical element leaching. After long-term experiments on agro-technical measures that substantially alter soil properties, the soil in lysimeters should be replaced or left for a few years until the properties are equal again. © 2016, HARD Publishing Company.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors have compared the “Supergrid” concept that was pursued by some institutions in the past years with the original “TRANS-CSP” concept developed by the German Aerospace Centre in 2006. From this analysis, the authors could identify not only major barriers but also possible ways towards successful implementation. Findings: The authors found that in contrast to the Supergrid approach, the original concept of exporting dispatchable solar power from concentrating solar thermal power stations with thermal energy storage (CSP-TES) via point-to-point high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission directly to European centres of demand could be a resilient business case for Europe–North Africa cooperation, as it provides added value in both regions. Research limitations/implications: The analysis has been made in the frame of the BETTER project commissioned by the Executive Agency for Competitiveness & Innovation in the frame of the program Intelligent Energy Europe. Practical implications: One of the major implications found is that due to the time lost in the past years by following a distracted concept, the option of flexible solar power imports from North Africa to Europe is not any more feasible to become part of the 2020 supply scheme. Social implications: To make them a viable option for post-2020 renewable energy systems for electricity development in Europe, a key recommendation of the project is to elaborate a detailed feasibility study about concrete CSP-HVDC links urgently. Originality/value: The analysis presented here is the first to give concrete recommendations for the implementation of such infrastructure. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CO2 mitigation; Electricity; Imports; Policy; Renewable energies; Scenario analysis; Stakeholder meetings; Transmission","Concretes; DC power transmission; Electric energy storage; Electricity; Heat storage; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Thermoelectric power plants; Transmissions; CO2 mitigation; Imports; Renewable energies; Scenario analysis; Stakeholder meetings; HVDC power transmission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986564638

Many of these MURBs were constructed following the second world war (Touchie et al. 2013) and are in need of renewal to address energy performance and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) concerns. The Toronto Atmospheric Fund (TAF), a nonprofit corporation whose mandate is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the City of Toronto, and a local social housing provider have partnered to improve the performance of seven post-war MURBs through retrofits. To help prioritize retrofit options and assess IEQ, a monitoring program including pre-retrofit resident surveys and in-suite monitoring was implemented. The resident surveys included questions about basic demographics, resident behavior, and perceptions about IEQ. To supplement the surveys, temperature, relative humidity, and mean radiant temperature were monitored for one year in 65 suites. This paper examines the findings from both the in-suite monitoring and the resident surveys to determine the IEQ issues that should be addressed during the retrofit process. The analysis presented focuses on the summertime condition, which is of particular concern given the vulnerable populations housed in these buildings and the lack of central cooling facilities. The findings suggest that an air temperature threshold may be insufficient to ensure thermal comfort given the range of survey responses associated with the observed suite temperatures. Based on the data collected, it was not possible to explain the differences between the survey responses related to thermal comfort and the monitored conditions. Factors such as air speed, exposure to solar gains, and resident perceptions may contribute to these differences. The paper concludes with a discussion of some insights from the comparison between the survey and monitoring data and how they best can be used to inform the design of future retrofits and monitoring programs. © 2016 U.S. Government.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Military operations; Monitoring; Retrofitting; Thermal comfort; Energy performance; Indoor environmental quality; Mean radiant temperature; Monitoring programs; Non-profit corporation; Resident perceptions; Residential building; Second World War; Surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042931310

The activity releases CO2 and generates a change in land use, advancing on ecosystems with native vegetation, which function as carbon sinks. The model of industrial agriculture is highly dependent on inputs in the form of materials and energy, mainly fossil fuels but there are other hidden constraints that rely on the environmental quality of resources used and the extent of downstream impacts generated by their use in a process, that do not emerge clearly from investigating only material and commercial energy. As a consequence, additional investigation with alternative approaches, like emergy and emission assessment, is needed. In this article the analysis focuses on the emergy assessment and pollutant emissions by soybean production in two Argentine localities with environmental differences, one in the province of Buenos Aires (Rojas) and the other in the Chaco province (Charata). We used an upstream method (Emergy Accounting) and a downstream method (CML2 baseline 2000). Both sites show Renewability smaller than 35%. The total amount of CO2eq emitted in Charata is 0.80 ton/ha/yr and 0.81 ton/ha/yr in Rojas. However, the local conditions, the impact of industrial agriculture is very high. In Chaco region, possible regulations that establish the afforestation of certain areas around soybean crops should be analyzed, to operate not only as carbon sinks but also as barriers for agrochemical drift. © 2016 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.","CO2 eq emissions; Emergy; Industrial agriculture; Soybean",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008262908

The reasons for the interest towards this material are twofold: (i) its production process, using magnesium silicates, brine or seawater, dramatically reduces CO2 emissions with respect to Portland cement production, and (ii) it is very well suited to applications in radioactive waste encapsulation. In spite of its potential, assessment of the structural properties of its binder phase (magnesium silicate hydrate or M-S-H) is far from complete, especially because of its amorphous character. In this work, a comprehensive structural characterization of M-S-H was obtained using a multi-technique approach, including a detailed solid-state NMR investigation and, in particular, for the first time, quantitative 29Si solid-state NMR data. M-S-H was prepared through room-temperature hydration of highly reactive MgO and silica fume and was monitored for 28 days. The results clearly evidenced the presence in M-S-H of ""chrysotile-like"" and ""talc-like"" sub-nanometric domains, which are approximately in a 1:1 molar ratio after long-time hydration. Both these kinds of domains have a high degree of condensation, corresponding to the presence of a small amount of silanols in the tetrahedral sheets. The decisive improvement obtained in the knowledge of M-S-H structure paves the way for tailoring the macroscopic properties of eco-sustainable cements by means of a bottom-up approach. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Binders; Bins; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Hydrates; Hydration; Light polarization; Magnesium; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Portland cement; Radioactive waste encapsulation; Radioactive wastes; Serpentine; Silica fume; Silicates; Amorphous characters; Cementitious binders; Degree of condensation; Macroscopic properties; Magnesium silicates; Multi-technique approach; Structural characterization; Sustainable cements; Cements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959187442

The analysis shows the mid-to-late 1930s to be a period of increased reported cases. After World War II, malaria cases trend down to a relative minimum in the early 1950s, before increasing rapidly after 1953 to the end of the decade. Data for the Western Province confirm these national trends, which at the time were attributed to a wide range of causes, including land development and management schemes, population mobility, interventions and misdiagnosis. Climate was occasionally proposed as a contributor to enhanced case numbers, and unusual precipitation patterns were held responsible; temperature was rarely, if ever, considered. In this study, a dynamical malaria model was driven with available precipitation and temperature data from the period for five stations located across a range of environments in Uganda. In line with the historical data, the simulations produced relatively enhanced transmission in the 1930s, although there is considerable variability between locations. In all locations, malaria transmission was low in the late 1940s and early 1950s, steeply increasing after 1954. Results indicate that past climate variability explains some of the variations in numbers of reported malaria cases. The impact of multiannual variability in temperature, while only on the order of 0.5°C, was sufficient to drive some of the trends observed in the statistics and thus the role of climate was likely underestimated in the contemporary reports. As the elimination campaigns of the 1960s followed this partly climate-driven increase in malaria, this emphasises the need to account for climate when planning and evaluating intervention strategies. © A.M.

Therefore, renewable energy sources are essential to reach these new targets, like the world area's abundant solar resources that can be developed in order to contribute partially to the fossil fuel reduction, increasing the energy efficiency of O&G plants and reducing the emissions level at the same time. Solar PV (photovoltaic) is the most widely used solar energy technology to date and secondly, CSP (Concentrated Solar Power). While PV converts sunlight directly into electricity by using panel arrays based on semiconductor materials, the CSP make use of mirrors to concentrate the sun's energy and produce steam that can be used in the oil and gas industry in different ways: • To drive steam turbines and produce the electrical power to supplement the oil and gas facilities demand. • For thermal technologies in enhanced oil recovery systems or generally for plant process units steam use. All of the aforementioned CSP applications have the possibility to add thermal energy storage systems needed to overcome night time or for topping off during non-ideal solar conditions. Nowadays the photovoltaic cells have evolved technologically being very affordable with decreasing price trends and an increasing interest in standalone application at medium to large-scale capacity, nevertheless the CSP is shyly appearing in the oil and gas industry in specific geographical areas basing its attractiveness as a source of steam generation. The present paper refers to a case study of a combined-cycle power plant which benefits of the integration with a solar field (Integrated Solar Combined Cycle - ISCC) for oil and gas production facilities use sited in the North Africa region. This geographical area offers appropriate solar DNI (Direct Normal Irradiance) for CSP technologies. The selected configuration for this case, exploit the CSP heat in the same heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) of the combined cycle. Solar heat is integrated at the evaporation section, with an efficient heat exchange coming from the CSP system. In this study, it is presented a fuel saving configuration, in which constant power is produced. Therefore gas turbine electric load decreases up to 80% and the remaining electricity is produced in the steam cycle exploiting the heat coming from the solar field, which thermal load is decided as an overall compromise solution for the CSP field size. Results from the life cycle cost analysis showed that investment payback in order to be inside project operational life limits is largely driven from two market variables remaining a barrier: fuel gas price and CO2 shadow price; other limitation that might be an issue is water scarcity in the area for steam cycle or make up and also any permitting for connection to the grid unless the plant will be operated standalone.

In this study the influence of labile carbon fractions on the fractions of dry-sieved (DSA) and wet-sieved (WSA) macro-aggregates and the relationship between the content of total organic carbon (TOC) and its labile fractions in the soil and in the fractions of macro-aggregates were determined. The experiment included six soil types (Eutric Fluvisol, Mollic Fluvisol, Haplic Chernozem, Haplic Luvisol, Eutric Cambisol, Rendzic Leptosol) in four ecosystems (forest, meadow, urban, and agro-ecosystem). In the case of DSA, the contents of labile fractions of carbon, in particular cold water extractable organic carbon (CWEOC) and hot water extractable organic carbon (HWEOC), had a higher impact on the proportions of larger fractions of macro-aggregates (3-7 mm), while in the case of WSA, the impact of labile fractions of carbon, mainly labile carbon (CL) oxidizable with KMnO4, was higher on the proportions of smaller fractions of aggregates (0.25-1 mm). The WSA size fraction of 0.5-1 mm seems an important indicator of changes in the ecosystems and its amounts were in a negative correlation with CL (r = -0.317; P &lt; 0.05) and HWEOC (r = -0.356; P &lt; 0.05). In the WSA and DSA size fractions 0.5-1 mm, the highest variability in the contents of TOC and CL was recorded in the forest ecosystem &gt; meadow ecosystem &gt; urban ecosystem &gt; agro-ecosystem. The higher were the inputs of organic substances into the soil, the greater was the variability in their incorporation into the soil aggregates. The influence of the content of TOC and its labile forms on their contents in the DSA and WSA was different, and the contents of TOC and CL in the aggregates were more significantly affected by the CL content than by water soluble carbon. In the case of WSA fractions, their carbon content was more affected in the 1-2 mm than in 0.5-1 mm fraction.","Ecosystem; Labile carbon; Macro-aggregates; Soil type",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991778542

However, the effects of largescale land use change (LUC) from traditional annual crops, such as corn-soybean rotations to the perennial grasses (PGs) switchgrass and miscanthus, on soil microbial community functioning is largely unknown. Specifically, ecologically significant denitrifying communities, which regulate N2O production and consumption in soils, may respond differently to LUC due to differences in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) inputs between crop types and management systems. Our objective was to quantify bacterial denitrifying gene abundances as influenced by corn-soybean crop production compared to PG biomass production. A field trial was established in 2008 at the Elora Research Station in Ontario, Canada (n = 30), with miscanthus and switchgrass grown alongside corn-soybean rotations at different N rates (0 and 160 kg N ha-1) and biomass harvest dates within PG plots. Soil was collected on four dates from 2011 to 2012 and quantitative PCR was used to enumerate the total bacterial community (16S rRNA) and communities of bacterial denitrifiers by targeting nitrite reductase (nirS) and N2O reductase (nosZ) genes. Miscanthus produced significantly larger yields and supported larger nosZ denitrifying communities than corn-soybean rotations regardless of management, indicating large-scale LUC from corn-soybean to miscanthus may be suitable in variable Ontario climatic conditions and under varied management, while potentially mitigating soil N2O emissions. Harvesting switchgrass in the spring decreased yields in N-fertilized plots, but did not affect gene abundances. Standing miscanthus overwinter resulted in higher 16S rRNA and nirS gene copies than in fall-harvested crops. However, the size of the total (16S rRNA) and denitrifying bacterial communities changed differently over time and in response to LUC, indicating varying controls on these communities. © Author(s) 2016.

The costs of damage due to air emissions released during construction and operation of tertiary treatment alternatives were estimated using a hybrid based approach and were converted to external damage costs. Greenhouse gas emission (CO2 eq.), acidifying gas emission (SO2 and NOx), and particulate matter (PM2.5) emission unit costs were obtained from a Social Carbon Costs study, and cost factors from the Air Pollution Emission Experiments and Policy model were used to determine the total costs of emissions. The sum of average air emissions impact costs for the selected treatment processes were found to be between 5 and 8% of the total costs for tertiary treatment. Accounting for the external air emission costs provides a measure to assess the relative environmental costs of tertiary treatment options for reuse of treated municipal wastewater in cooling systems. Environmental costs of other emissions to air, water and land, as well as benefits stemming from offsetting freshwater withdrawal by reusing treated effluent in power plant cooling systems were not included in the analysis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Such repairs affect the exposed decorative elements, the envelope and occasionally the structure, often exacerbated by inappropriate repairs that can cause fatalities and climate change. Further European approaches to repairs are discussed like Glasgow(payment of maintenance factor),Venice (contribution to local Heritage Trust), Monumentenwacht in Flanders (agency that identifies repairs for its owner members), Hermoupolis (HERMES project evaluates vulnerability within a decision-making model), together with tax incentives (France) and less successful attempts to management (Building Book in Rome). The holistic approach in Edinburgh highlights at the same time the immense volume of work required, hampered by the fragmentation of ownership and the small size of the repair industry, contrasted however by the less widespread repairs in the other European models. The survey shows that increased participation of owners and incentives for their initiative, backed with experienced advice is seen as a more sustainable way forward. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Climate change; Housing; Structural analysis; Taxation; 19th century; Active management; Conservation management; Decision making models; Holistic approach; Repair industry; Tax incentive; Urban housing; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002131865

As a result, urban water systems will be disproportionately affected by the climate change, especially in such urban areas as Las Vegas, which concentrates its population, infrastructure, and economic activity. Proper design and management of stormwater facilities are needed to attenuate the severe effects of extreme rainfall events. The North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program is developing multiple high-resolution projected-climate data from different combinations of regional climate models and global climate models. The objective of this study was to evaluate existing stormwater facilities of a watershed within the Las Vegas Valley in southern Nevada by using a robust design method for the projected climate. The projected climate change was incorporated into the model at the 100 year return period with 6 h duration depths, using a statistical regionalization analysis method. Projection from different sets of climate model combinations varied substantially. Gridded reanalysis data were used to assess the performance of the climate models. An existing Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model was implemented using the projected change in standard design storm. Hydrological simulation using HEC-HMS showed exceedances of existing stormwater facilities that were designed under the assumption of stationarity design depth. Recognizing climate change and taking an immediate approach in assessing the city's vulnerability by using proper strategic planning would benefit the urban sector and improve the quality of life. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change; Flamingo and Tropicana watershed; HEC-HMS; Urban stormwater",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021420891

The main legislative acts in this field are two Government Emergency Ordinances (no. 18/2009 and no. 63/2012) regarding the increasing of energy performance of blocks of flats. According to these documents, more than 2,800 buildings have been rehabilitated in Bucharest, between 2009 and 2015. Tn this context, the objective of this study is to present a part of the results concerning this building stock refurbishment. As a result, it is presented an overview of rehabilitation programs for each district of Bucharest, focusing on data for districts I and 4. Regarding district 1, after the thermal rehabilitation measures, almost all block of flats (99.8 %) taken into consideration arc rated class A and B in terms of heating energy efficiency, according to Rornanian methodology of Building Energy Performance, while before renovation process, 54 % of these buildings were rated class D and 14 % were rated class E. On the other hand, the comparisons between estimated and measured heating energy consumptions for rehabilitated buildings in district 4 of Bucharest show that for 22 of the 92 buildings considered (24 %), the difference is less than 10 %. Nevertheless, for 14 of these buildings (15 %), the difference is between 40-60 % (but only 2 of them with differences around 60 %).

The process is generating a rather high amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that according to the current climate regulatory initiatives should be reduced. CO2 injection to enhance heavy oil production is a known technique for such reservoirs. The technology of capturing CO2 has evolved today up to a point where it can also be applied to steam generators. This work starts with a comprehensive review of most recent steam generator developments and their possibility of subsequently capturing CO2. Co-generation concepts will also be investigated and their potential to generate steam and CO2 for heavy oil enhanced recovery will be evaluated. The thermal properties of CO2 are well known, and its critical state poses challenges in many injection applications. This low-cost completion is proposing a parallel injection of steam through tubing and CO2 through annular space. While injecting CO2 in a steam-heated well, the elevated temperature keeps the carbon dioxide gas away from its critical state. The gas will cool down the upper part of the well, especially the surface casing, avoiding cement damage and well integrity breaches. This paper describes an economical completion technique that replaces the expensive thermal packer with a new budget-friendly design. This novel setup allows free tubing expansion and protects casing against high temperature through continuous gas circulation in the annulus. It also enables the simultaneously injection of combustion gases from steam generators or other gas supply. In this manner, substantial CO2 credit could be saved by operators while cutting completion expenses and environmental hazards at the same time.",,"Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Critical current density (superconductivity); Crude oil; Enhanced recovery; Gases; Oil well flooding; Petroleum engineering; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Steam; Steam generators; Tubing; Elevated temperature; Enhanced oil recovery; Environmental hazards; Heavy oil exploitations; Heavy oil reservoirs; High temperature; Regulatory initiatives; Steam injection; Heavy oil production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040521810

Conversely, permeability and porosity are observed to increase when net stress decreases, however typically follow a different path, this discrepancy is known as hysteresis. The trend of permeability and porosity hysteresis is a signature of porous medium that depends on several physical and mechanical properties. Understanding permeability and porosity hysteresis plays a significant role in production strategies of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Hysteresis effect on production strategies can be even more important in very low permeability reservoirs such as tight sandstone, tight carbonate, and shale formations. The reason is that the stress change associated with permeability and porosity hysteresis can affect adsorption/desorption and diffusion transport mechanisms which are among the main driving mechanisms in low or ultra-low permeability reservoirs. In this study, permeability and porosity hysteresis of nano, micro, and milli-Darcy core samples are measured for a wide range of net stress and the results are correlated with pore structures observed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) images. The nano and micro-Darcy core samples are from the Niobrara, Bakken, Three Forks, and Eagle Ford formations. The milli-Darcy core samples are from Middle East carbonate, Indiana Limestone, and Torrey Buff Sandstone formations. Bakken, Three Forks, and Middle East carbonate are core samples from oil producing reservoirs, whereas others are from outcrop. Our experimental observations show that: (a) compared to steady state method, the unsteady state permeability measurement used here can shorten the time required to measure permeability of nano and micro-Darcy cores without significant measurement error; (b) stress dependency of permeability and porosity and their hysteresis during loading and unloading of outcrop cores were observed to be very small compared to those of reservoir cores; (c) generally, the stress dependency and hysteresis of permeability and porosity was observed to be inversely related permeability and porosity at initial stress conditions; hence, these characteristics are more pronounced and important in organic rich shale reservoirs; (d) porosity decrease with stress and its hysteresis were observed to be much smaller than that of permeability; (e) our results generally follow the experimental and theoretical relationship between cubic root of permeability and logarithmic of net stress reported by many researchers; and (f) an increase in permeability with temperature (and decrease in permeability with hysteresis during temperature unloading) is observed in organic rich mudrocks. This is due to dilation, diffusion, and adsorption effects of organic rich pores. Hence, a temperature correction factor is required to estimate the exact in-situ permeability of organic rich mudrocks. Finally, we would like to comment that understanding of permeability and porosity dependency on stress and their hysteresis information values could be used to optimize production of low-permeability formations such that the irreversible permeability loss (formation damage) could be minimized by early fluid injection (pressure maintenance) to minimize rapid stress increase due to fluid withdrawal from stimulated reservoir volume. Also, these permeability and porosity hysteresis information could be used in proper designing of multi-stage hydraulic fracture and re-fracturing design of organic-rich low-permeability formations.

The reason is that the stress change associated with permeability hysteresis can affect adsorption/desorption and diffusion transport mechanisms which are among the main driving mechanisms in low or ultra-low permeability reservoirs. In our recent study, we investigated â€“ (a) stress dependent matrix permeability of nano, micro, and milli-Darcy core samples for a wide range of net stress; (b) hysteresis of matrix permeability of these cores during stress loading and unloading cases; (c) cyclic matrix permeability hysteresis of milli-Darcy cores; and (d) effect of temperature on permeability of organic rich mudrock. In this study, we further investigated â€“ (i) cyclic fractured (jointed) and matrix permeability hysteresis during stress loading and unloading of nano-Darcy permeability Niobrara and Eagle Ford cores, and (ii) pore pressure effect on matrix permeability of organic rich Eagle Ford core at 250 oF. The following are significant observations of this study: (a) fracture permeabilities are more stress dependent than matrix ones; (b) permeability hysteresis during stress loading and unloading of fractured (jointed) tight cores is larger, compared to that of matrix; (c) matrix permeability decrease with stress and its hysteresis during the second and third stress loading/unloading cycles were negligible; (d) improvements in fracture permeabilities were observed during the second and third stress loading/unloading cycles. The possible reason is that when a repeated stress loading and unloading happens, a new flow path that connect the main fracture to micro and nano cracks could be created; hence, improve the effective permeability. This indicates that re-fracturing of nano and micro-Darcy formations could lead to improvement in connectivity of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) region; hence, improved hydrocarbon recovery; (e) at constant confining stress, pore pressure loading (adsorption) leads to decrease in permeability, and pore pressure unloading (desorption) increases effective matrix permeability back, but with a hysteresis. The inverse relation of molecular diffusion vs pressure is also playing role to the inverse relation between pore pressure and permeablity.

The VUV excitation spectra indicated a band gap of 8.5 eV while the UV excited one showed the Eu3+ charge transfer transition starting at 3.9 eV.

These support a consumption argument for urban demand being the crucial generator of climate for 8,000 years in direct contradiction to the production argument that greenhouse gases are the crucial generator of climate change for 200 years. The modern policymaking focus on curbing carbon emissions is thus fundamentally flawed - merely feeding energy for continuing an accelerating global consumption in a different way that is only marginally more climate-friendly.

Large improvements in vehicle efficiency on mandated test cycles have already taken place in some markets through the widespread adoption of technologies such as downsizing or dieselisation. There is now increased focus on approaches which give smaller, but significant incremental efficiency benefits, such as reducing parasitic losses due to engine friction. The reduction in tail pipe CO2 emissions through the reduction of engine friction using lubricants has been reported by many authors. However, opportunities also exist to reduce the lubricant viscosity during warm up by the thermal management of the lubricant mass. This presents an attractive proposition to vehicle manufacturers because of the favorable cost-benefit ratios of thermal management systems and because this strategy can achieve some of the benefits that ordinarily require the lubricant viscosity grade to be lowered. In this paper the experimental results from chassis dynamometer tests are analysed. The performance of two modern vehicles was determined using various lubricant thermal management strategies, including removing lubricant from the sump and pre-heating it during the vehicle soak period. The effect of these strategies on the emission of CO2 from the vehicle is described with reductions of up to 1.2% measured on the vehicles tested in this study.

One of the effective way for reducing atmospheric CO2 is carbon sequestration by plants and soils. A vast area of Iran has desert condition with special adapted plant species in which can be devoted for carbon sequestration. Hammada salicornica as a shrub plant of chenopodiaceae grows as dominant or key species of vegetation types in many parts of desert areas in south of country. So, potentials of carbon sequestration of H. salicornica vegetation types were estimated in seven sites in South Khorasan provice, Iran. For this purpose, 113 individual plants were measured for height, and long and short diameters of plant crown area and then were cut from ground level. To estimate underground biomass, roots of 10 individual plants were pulled from soil by digging the root zone. Dry matter production of shoots and roots were weighted and some samples were burned for determination of organic carbon. Organic carbon of soil of three sites were measured by soil sampling. Results showed that carbon has been sequestered between 133 to 3293 kg/ha in different sites in which James and Sefarsakh had the highest and the lowest amount of organic carbon in plant vegetation parts. Soil organic carbon obtained about 6313 kg/ha on average. The best linear regression equation (R2=0.90) for estimating aerial biomass of H. salicornica obtained by using crown area in the equation. It seems that conservation of natural vegetation of H. salicornica and or restoration of degraded lands by this plant, have good potentials for carbon sequestration for globally action commitment and providing benefits such as forage and fuel for local people.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Desert areas; Hammada salicornica; Regression equation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018925514

With recent Collection 6 MODIS Deep Blue aerosol data in 2000-2015, we analyzed the trends of regional haze pollution and the corresponding influence of atmospheric circulation in China. Satellite observations show that regional haze pollution is mainly concentrated in northern and central China. The annual frequency of regional haze in northern China nearly doubles between 2000 and 2006, increasing from 30-50 to 80-90 days. Though there is a marked decrease in annual frequency during 2007-2009 due to both reduction of anthropogenic emissions and changes of meteorological conditions, regional pollution increases slowly but steadily after 2009, and maintains at a high level of 70-90 days except for the sudden decrease in 2015. Generally, there is a large increase in the number of regional-scale haze events during the last decade. Seasonal frequency of regional haze exhibits distinct spatial and temporal variations. The increasing winter haze events reach a peak in 2014, but decrease strongly in 2015 due partly to synoptic conditions that are favorable for dispersion. Trends of summer regional haze pollution are more sensitive to changes of atmospheric circulation. Our results indicate that the frequency of regional haze events is associated not only with the strength of atmospheric circulation, but also with its direction and position, as well as variations in anthropogenic emissions. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Aerosol; China; Haze; MODIS","Aerosols; Air quality; Climatology; Meteorology; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Supercomputers; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric circulation; China; Haze; Meteorological condition; MODIS; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal variation; Pollution; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric pollution; haze; MODIS; observational method; regional climate; satellite data; temporal variation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984986452

To dispose of biomass, some communities have utilized it to produce renewable energy or other products for household purposes. Currently, some villages have successfully implemented biomass utilization technology at the household level. Villagers have adopted skills and technical knowledge on biomass waste management from institutions dedicated to research on the development of renewable energy technology at the community level and are now able to mitigate and control waste problems systematically. Presently, biomass utilization technologies in Thailand are able to produce biogas, biodiesel, livestock feeds and organic fertilizers. In addition to the aforementioned environmental and economic benefits, villages that have adopted biomass utilization technology were also able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prevent deforestation and reduce household spending for energy and farming products. This paper investigates the current status of the general renewable energy policy in Thailand with specific focus on biomass utilization as a renewable energy source. Case studies further illustrate how these energy policies are being implemented at the community level.

It was found that the different stabilities of CHx species can modify the electronic structures and magnetic properties of NNM-graphene systems. The carbonaceous reforming reactions include conversion of CHx (x = 0, 1, 2 and 3) species by hydrogen molecules (H2) to form CHx+2 species or oxidation of C atoms by oxygen molecules to form CO2. In the hydrogenation reactions, deposited C atoms can be converted easily into CHx species overcoming small energy barriers. In comparison, coadsorption of C and O2 to generate CO2 encounters relatively larger energy barriers on the NNM-graphene. Hence, the coadsorption of CHx and H2 as the starting state is energetically more favorable and formation of CHx species can reduce amounts of carbon deposition. Among the NNM-graphene substrates studied, moderate adsorption energies and low reaction barriers of CHx species are more likely to occur on the Co-graphene surface, thus the hydrogenation reaction is able to inhibit carbon deposition on the NNM-graphene surface while maintaining high activity. © the Owner Societies 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976287681

Then localization of the AE source is formulated as a Bayesian state estimation problem with the source location and the wave velocity as unknown state parameters. A PF procedure is developed to iteratively estimate the unknown parameters simultaneously by using the TOA data. Experimental studies on a stiffened aluminum panel with AE events simulated by pensile lead breaks (PLBs) are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PF-based AE localization method.","Acoustic emission; particle filter; source localization; uncertainty","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Bandpass filters; Iterative methods; Monte Carlo methods; Uncertainty analysis; Wave propagation; Wavelet transforms; Acoustic emission sources; Bayesian state estimation; Complex wavelet transforms; Particle filter; Probabilistic approaches; Source localization; Time of arrival (TOA); uncertainty; Time of arrival",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009286692

The aim of the work was to achieve maximal possible solar primary energy gain by deploying of either solar photovoltaics or solar collectors on the building stock on the country. Since only 1-2% of the stock is exchanged annually, it is very important to increase the energy efficiency of the existing buildings. The study shows that the building sector is able to deliver large energy consumption and CO2 reduction at low costs.

Many studies proved that shading, i.e. the reduction of direct solar radiation is the most effective way to moderate summer heat stress under Central European climatic conditions. The investigation aims at determining the transmissivity of four tree species that occur frequently in Hungarian cities: Sophora japonica, Tilia cordata, Celtis occidentalis and Aesculus hippocastanum. In order to accomplish that, a systematic radiation measurement campaign was carried out in the South-Hungarian city of Szeged, from early summer (foliated condition of trees) to late autumn (nearly leafless condition). Short-wave radiation from the upper hemisphere was measured with Kipp & Zonen pyranometers under carefully selected tree specimens (transmitted radiation), as well as on a roof station free from sky obstruction (actual value of global radiation). The calculated transmissivity values varied greatly with the seasonal status of the canopy (the median value of transmissivity increased from 0.03 to 0.47 in case of A. hippocastanum), and we found considerable inter-species differences too, evidencing that solar permeability depends on the amount of leaves, leaf density and other tree crown-related characteristics.","Hungary; Shading potential; Szeged; Transmissivity; Urban trees","deciduous tree; environmental stress; leaf; permeability; season; shading; solar radiation; transmissivity; urban ecosystem; Fejer; Hungary; Szeged; Aesculus hippocastanum; Celtis occidentalis; Styphnolobium japonicum; Tilia cordata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976320175

However, one main reason why freight transport companies refrain from deploying freight EVs are their higher costs, compared to conventional vehicles. But despite their lower operational costs, the high purchase price of medium duty EVs—which are predominantly used in urban freight transport—renders them uncompetitive, compared to conventional vehicles. One possibility to raise the competitiveness of freight EVs is to increase their range by improving the drivers’ behavior. This is an important leverage, since first tests with passenger EVs indicate that the drivers’ behavior can influence the vehicles range with up to 30 %. Although sufficient literature about eco-drive strategies for conventional freight vehicles exists, these strategies cannot be directly transferred to freight EVs, due to technological differences, such as recuperation. The research of specific strategies for freight EVs has received little attention so far. Thus the objective of this research proposal is to measure, analyze and model the dependency of medium duty freight EVs energy consumption on the drivers’ behavior, by utilizing real world test data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Drivers behavior; Eco-driving; Electric vehicles; Energy consuption; Profitability; Real world; Urban freight transport",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101978750

Results pointed out that the eight restaurant types found in the city produced 174 t of WCOF/year in the following proportion: 41 [%] formal restaurant, 24 [%] fast food, 8 [%] taquerias, 7 [%] antojitos, 6 [%] soup kitchens,6 [%] bars, 4 [%] gorditas and 4 [%] roast chicken shops. In addition, representative samples of WCOF coming from every restaurant type were characterized for biodiesel production, in terms of viscosity, oxidative stability, free fatty acid content, acid value, saponification number, moisture content and fatty acid composition. The physicochemical analysis suggests that all the WCOF produced in the city, except that coming from the fast food cooking, met the recommended free fatty acid levels and the acidity values for alkaline transesterification. Based on the population of the city an average production of 0.31 t/year of WCOF per 1000 inhabitants was estimated. Projecting this figure to the whole country of Mexico, 34.9 kt of this fuel would be obtained per year, which would avoid the emission of 92 kt/year of CO2and contribute to reduce pollution in the country. © 2016, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

Material and Methods: Information from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System was used to create time-series records, for the period of April 2004 to December 2011, on emergency department visits of patients suffering from conjunctivitis. A total of 77 439 emergency department visits for conjunctivitis were analyzed. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied, completed with meta-analysis in order to pool inter-city results. Odds ratio (OR) for an emergency department visit was calculated in different population strata per one-unit increase (one interquartile range - IQR increase in a pollutant's daily level) while controlling for the impacts of temperature and relative humidity. Results: Statistically significant positive results were observed in the female population sample, for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure lagged 5-8 days, with the highest result for the 7-day lag (OR = 1.035, 95% CI: 1.018-1.052) and for fine particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), for lags 6 and 7 days, with the highest result for lag 7 (OR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.003-1.031). In the male population sample, statistically significant positive results were observed for NO2 at lag 5 days (OR = 1.024, 95% CI: 1.004-1.045) and for ozone (O3), at lags 0-3 and 7 days, with the highest result for lag 0 (OR = 1.038, 95% CI: 1.012-1.056). Also for males, statistically significant results were observed in the case of PM2.5 exposure lagged by 5 days (OR = 1.003, 95% CI: 1.000-1.038) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure lagged by 1 and 2 days (OR = 1.016, 95% CI: 1.000-1.031 and OR = 1.018, 95% CI: 1.002-1.033).

Sustainability issues are closely linked in with energy policy, given the desire to increase the proportion of renewable energy. According to the Horizon 2020 climate and energy package, European Union (EU) member countries have to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit by 20%, to increase the proportion of renewable energy to 20% and to improve energy efficiency by 20% by 2020. In this study we aim to assess the opportunities available to exploit solar radiation on roofs with Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and photogrammetry techniques. The surveyed area was in Debrecen, the second largest city in Hungary. An aerial LiDAR survey was conducted with a density of 12 points/m2, over a 7 × 1.8 km wide band. We extracted the building and roof models of the buildings from the point cloud. Furthermore, we applied a low-cost drone (DJI Phantom with a GoPro camera) in a smaller area of the LiDAR survey and also created a 3D model: buildings and roof planes were identified with multiresolution segmentation of the digital surface models (DSM) and orthophoto coverages. Building heights and building geometry were also extracted and validated in field surveys. 50 buildings were chosen for the geodetic survey and the results of the accuracy assessment were extrapolated to other buildings; in addition to this, 100 building heights were measured. We focused primarily on the roofs, as these surfaces offer possible locations for thermal and photovoltaic equipment. We determined the slope and aspect of roof planes and calculated the incoming solar energy according to roof planes before comparing the results of the point cloud processing of LiDAR data and the segmentation of DSMs. Extracted roof geometries showed varying degrees of accuracy: the research proved that LiDAR-based roof-modelling is the best choice in residential areas, but the results of the drone survey did not differ significantly. Generally, both approaches can be applied, because the solar radiation values calculated were similar. The aerial techniques combined with the multiresolution processing demonstrated can provide a valuable tool to estimate potential solar energy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The overall effect observed was that there was a reduction in the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll content in the leaf samples collected from polluted sites when compared with the samples from the control no-vehicular traffic site; with chlorophyll b being more sensitive to the effect of pollution than chlorophyll a, but at the same time this was also highly dependent upon the altitude at which the particular plant was growing. This decline was again much higher in the month of November which is a post-monsoon period as compared to the pre-monsoon period in the month of March; and this observed decline may have further been accelerated by the phenomenon of chilling-induced photoinhibition. On the contrary, there was no regular pattern or trend observed in the chlorophyll a/b ratio; which indicates that this parameter is not a reliable criterion for the assessment of air pollution damage to plants. The findings further revealed that plants growing at lower-altitudes exhibit a better adaptation to stress than those growing at higher-altitudes. Hence, the results of our study suggest that the leaves of Oxalis comiculata L. can be used as biomarkers for the assessment of automobile pollution.

The urban transportation system is a complex system with multiple variables, feedback loops, and is influenced by social, economic and environmental factors. The proposed model consists of two submodels: Vehicle Fleet and Emission Calculation. The model runs in Powersim Studio software using data from the Indonesia Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, and the Traffic Management Centre of the Indonesian National Police. The test was conducted by developing two scenarios: Business As Usual and Intention. The estimated results to be obtained using the first scenario in 2021 should be 1,113,398 units, while the second scenario is estimated to produce 850,733 units. We hypothesize that the Intentional Approach will have a more significant impact than the Technical Approach, which requires more investment. The Intentional Approach is designed to improve the intention of private car users to switch to public transportation. The Technical Approach to the emission measurement of every vehicle in a certain area is the data of vehicle emission which are usually taken to determine the current condition.

Estimated from manual chamber measurements over a 12-month period, average daily emissions were very low ranging from 0.78gN2O-Nha-1day-1 in the apple orchard at Lucaston to 1.86gN2O-Nha-1day-1 in the cherry orchard in Lower Longley. Daily emissions were up to 50% higher in summer (maximum 5.27gN2O-Nha-1day-1 at Lower Longley) than winter (maximum 2.47gN2O-Nha-1day-1 at Young) across the four trial orchards. N2O emissions were ∼40% greater in the inter-row than the tree line for each orchard. Daily flux rates were used as a loss estimate for annual emissions, which ranged from 298gN2O-Nha-1year-1 at Lucaston to 736gN2O-Nha-1year-1 at Lower Longley. Emissions were poorly correlated with soil temperature, volumetric water content, water filled porosity, gravimetric water content and matric potential - with inconsistent patterns between sites, within the tree line and inter-row and between seasons. Stepwise linear regression models for the Lucaston site accounted for less than 10% of the variance in N2O emissions, for which soil temperature was the strongest predictor. N2O emissions in deciduous tree crops were among the lowest recorded for Australian agriculture, most likely due to low rates of N fertiliser, cool temperate growing conditions and highly efficient drip irrigation systems. We recommend that optimising nutrient use efficiency with improved drainage and a reduction in soil compaction in the inter-row will facilitate further mitigation of N2O emissions. © CSIRO 2016.","apples; cherries; fertiliser; global warming; greenhouse gas; nitrogen","Agriculture; Composting; Crops; Farms; Fertilizers; Forestry; Fruits; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Orchards; Regression analysis; Soil mechanics; Soils; Temperature; apples; Australian agricultures; cherries; Nitrification and denitrification; Nitrous oxide emissions; Nutrient-use efficiencies; Stepwise linear regression; Volumetric water content; Gas emissions; agricultural emission; benchmarking; cropping practice; deciduous tree; denitrification; drip irrigation; fertilizer application; fruit; global warming; greenhouse gas; horticulture; matric potential; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; orchard; Australia; New South Wales; Tasmania; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981515974

There have been a number of papers published regarding the applicability and accuracy of using a statistical hybrid PEMS for air compliance purposes primarily in reporting mass emission rates of NOx from industrial combustion sources. The deployed PEMS solution typically predicts the concentration of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the concentration of a diluent such as oxygen (O2) in the stack gas exhaust and utilizes U.S EPA Reference Method 19 to calculate the mass emission rate. In this paper, the application of a statistical hybrid model to accurately predict the oxygen content in the process gas stream just after combustion is examined. In many boiler applications, an oxygen analyzer is utilized to provide safety feedback and input for secondary air control or trim. Sometimes, there are multiple analyzers installed for this purpose. The accuracy and applicability of using a predictive or virtual oxygen analyzer for boiler safety and control is explored with data from two sites on two boilers. The virtual process analyzer can be demonstrated to be more reliable, accurate, and economical than backup redundant oxygen analyzers.","Advanced control; Boiler; Oxygen analyzer; Virtual analyzer","Air pollution control equipment; Boilers; Combustion; Industrial emissions; Monitoring; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Particulate emissions; Advanced control; Air emission regulation; Continuous emission monitoring system; Industrial combustion sources; Oxygen analyzer; Predictive emissions monitoring; Secondary air control; Virtual analyzers; Boiler control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008210914

The analysis shows how the policy has influenced, and been influenced by, policy processes at the national and international levels. Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins with an analytical framework that recognizes different types of influence between international, national and provincial climate policy processes. That framework is used to structure a review of four historical periods of climate policy change: prior to 1992, 1992 to 2002, 2002 to 2012 and between 2012 and mid-2015. Findings – The analysis illustrates the interplay between the Alberta approach to climate policy and the international and national policy contexts. A period of intense policy conflict between Canada’s federal and provincial governments led to a situation in which the Alberta Government sought to lead rather than follow national policy. Subsequent periods have seen the Canadian national government oscillate between following the lead of Alberta or the USA. Research limitations/implications – Rather than national and international policies simply setting the context for Alberta’s policy, the paper identifies multiple flows of influence between the three levels of governance. The results illustrate the need to consider forward and backward flows of influence between the different levels of government that set climate change policies. Elements of several models of policy change are supported. Practical implications – The Alberta climate mitigation policy has many elements that can be effective in reducing carbon emissions in a way that is both flexible and predictable. These elements are of interest to other jurisdictions. Other elements of the current policy, however, limit its effectiveness in reducing emissions. More concerted policy action is needed to mitigate carbon emissions in Alberta for Canada to meet its agreed targets. Originality/value – No other paper has tracked the historical evolution of climate policy at the provincial/state level in a way that clarifies the forward and backward linkages with national and international policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agriculture; Climate change; Emission offsets; GHG mitigation; Policy instuments","analytical framework; carbon emission; climate change; economic instrument; emission control; environmental policy; governance approach; greenhouse gas; policy analysis; policy implementation; Alberta; Canada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971574749

Many transport engineers and planners nowadays have shifted focus on the development of new approaches or tools that provide fast and reliable means of assessing different transportation strategies to achieve low-carbon transportation system. In this study, a new mathematical Origin-Destination (O-D) approach of estimating energy demand and CO2 emissions is presented using inter-regional passenger and freight flow data. The lengths of three major road segments were used as independent variables to model fuel consumption for buses and trucks. The estimated energy demand under business as usual (BAU) scenario was compared to five different low-carbon policy scenarios. Study shows that the energy demand from inter-regional public buses and freight road transport under BAU scenario substantially increased from 6,358.86ktoe in 2015 to 36,410.43ktoe in 2050. These findings equate to 19.71 and 112.93 Megatons of CO2 emissions in 2015 and 2050, respectively. Results also show that shifting to low-carbon alternative fuel such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for buses and trucks provide the highest reduction in the overall inter-regional CO2 emissions as compared other policy measures. Simultaneous implementation of the three selected policy measures would substantially reduce the CO2 emissions by almost two-third (74.24%) in 2050. © 2015, Int. J. of GEOMATE.

The carbonation reaction of CaO and the reverse reaction are potential methods for CO2 capture and concentration from dilute flue gases at high temperature. In this paper, the thermodynamics and mechanisms of CO2 capture by CaO and CaO regeneration from CaCO3 were studied and identified in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). In the calculation, the exchange-correlation term was approximated by Perdew-Wang (PW91), a function within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) family. The reaction energies of carbonation reaction and calcination reaction were calculated to be -147.64 kJ mol-1 and 180.60 kJ mol-1, respectively. To study the reaction between CO2 and CaO, the transition states of carbonation and calcination were also analyzed. The results showed that the carbonation of CaO was rather fast, and the activation energy of carbonation reaction was 0 kJ mol-1, which indicated that the reaction process was not the rate-determining step during the process of CO2 capture. The regeneration of CaO by CaCO3 calcination occurred at higher temperature, with the activation energy of 166.85 kJ mol-1, and the rate of calcination was controlled by the chemical reaction. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Activation energy; Calcination; Calcium carbonate; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Chemical activation; Thermodynamics; Calcination reactions; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbonation and calcinations; Carbonation reactions; Density functional theory studies; Exchange correlations; Generalized gradient approximations; Rate determining step; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968754664

We further employed the proposed model to determine the optimal path for controlling CO2 emissions at the sector level for each province in China. At sectoral level, manufacturing showed the highest potential emissions reduction, and transportation was the largest accepter of emission quotas. At regional level, western and northeastern areas faced the largest adjustments in allowable emissions, while central and eastern areas required the least amount of adjustment.

In this strain-sensing smart skin (""S4"") method, nanotubes are dilutely embedded in a thin polymer film applied to a substrate of interest. Subsequent strain in the substrate is transferred to the nanotubes, causing systematic spectral shifts in their characteristic short-wave infrared fluorescence peaks. A small diode laser excites a spot on the coated surface, and the resulting emission is captured and spectrally analyzed to deduce local strain. To advance performance of the method, we prepare S4 films with structurally selected SWCNTs. These give less congested emission spectra that can be analyzed precisely. However, quenching interactions with the polymer host reduce SWCNT emission intensity by an order of magnitude. The instrumentation that captures SWCNT fluorescence has been made lighter and smaller for hand-held use or mounting onto a positioning mechanism that makes efficient automated strain scans of laboratory test specimens.

The results showed that industrial scale effect and energy intensity effect were the main determinants of the change in energy-related CO2 emissions. The industrial scale effect contributed the most significantly to increase the CO2 emissions, especially from 1999 to 2007. Energy intensity effect was the only cause for the reduction of CO2 emissions till 2014.

Here, we fabricated five nanostructured Ag electrocatalysts and studied their CO2 electro-reduction properties compared to commercial Ag. Ag L-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy was employed to characterize the electronic structure variation among the catalysts. It is found that an increased unoccupied density of states (DOS) of d-character of Ag endows the electrocatalyst with a higher selectivity and efficiency for CO2 reduction. The introduction of Ni into the Ag matrix reduces the unoccupied DOS of d-character as there is charge redistribution between Ag and Ni, worsening the active efficiency of CO production. Density functional theory calculations show that an increased unoccupied DOS optimizes the affinity of the catalyst surface to the intermediate COOH and CO, closer to the activity volcano, which facilitates CO formation. The nanoporous Ag electrocatalyst, made through anodization-reduction, possesses the highest unoccupied DOS of d-character among the samples, showing the best catalytic performance in the reduction of CO2 to CO. Meanwhile, its onset overpotential is 0.19 V and the highest faradaic efficiency reaches 90%. The electrocatalyst stays at this level for 10 h without any noticeable activity change, possessing great potential for applications in industry. This research provides a useful insight on the structure-property relationships of CO2 reduction catalysts, and a guideline for designing high-performance electrocatalysts.

The twisted molecular conformation together with the incorporation of electron donor-acceptor pairs endow the luminogen with both aggregation-induced emission and twisted intramolecular charge transfer properties. The crystalline luminogen shows strong green emission at around 514 nm while the emission colour turns orange-red (562 nm) with a big loss in the quantum efficiency after grinding. The colour of the ground sample can be readily converted back into the initial state though recrystallization by either immersing or fuming in organic solvents. The conversion can be implemented for more than 30 cycles, showing good repeatability. This luminogen probably shows the highest fatigue resistance among all the mechanochromic compounds that have been reported. Inspired by the unique mechanochromism, an archetype of ink-free rewritable paper is developed. Letters and patterns can be easily written using pressure and erased by fumigation in handwriting experiments. The luminogen also enjoys the advantages of a one-pot synthesis and low biotoxicity, providing a reliable candidate for green rewritable paper technology to fulfill demands for sustainability and carbon mitigation. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Charge transfer; Fatigue of materials; Aggregation-induced emissions; Carbon mitigation; Electron donor acceptors; Green emissions; Molecular conformation; One-pot synthesis; Paper technology; Twisted intra-molecular charge transfers; Doping (additives)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984863507

The burning of agricultural crop residue in open field which has been given little attention up till now represents an important source of CO2 for global warming concern. According to the CO2 emission factors of rice, wheat, and corn straws based on laboratory measurements, the amount of CO2 emission via agricultural crop residue open burning in China between 1996 and 2013 has been calculated. The diverse accounting methods and geographic information system (GIS) are used to map the CO2 emission of thirty-one provinces. Identifying the spatial distribution, 5-year average variation, and contributions of CO2 emission by three major agricultural residue open burning, it is found: (i) About 2707.34 Tg of CO2 is emitted by agriculture residue open burning, occupies 45.09% of the total residential coal consumption from 1996 to 2013 (ii) The total emission from rice, wheat and corn straw burning are concentrated in south and northeast of China, North China and northeast of China, respectively (iii) Shandong Province contributes the largest portion of CO2 emission, Henan, Jiangsu, Hebei and Hei Longjiang rank the second, third, forth, and fifth, respectively. From different level of CO2 emission by agricultural crop residue open burning, we can find mitigation potential of greenhouse gas emission and give three suggestions: (i) generalizing straw returning field application (ii) improving the efficiency of straw utilization (iii) commercializing biomass energy. However, the mitigation potential, and varied policies and regulations need to be developed which are related to the local economic and environmental conditions in different China rural places. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the best ways to utilize CO2 so far considered is its conversion back into fuels using various strategies such as thermal, photochemical, electrochemical and enzymatic. In this critical review the concepts and mechanism of CO2 reducing biocatalysts have been summarized. Specifically, more emphasis was given to enzymes related to the selective conversion of CO2 to fuels (popularly known as artificial photosynthesis). Emphasis has been given to single enzyme and multi-enzymatic systems for CO2 conversion to carbon monoxide, methanol, and formic acid/formate.

As buildings are responsible for 40% of the total energy consumption in the European Union, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive sets energy consumption reduction targets for the member states. The rapidly increasing market for energy efficient buildings favours External Thermal Insulation Composite System (ETICS) usage in Europe. From the consumers' perspective the use of this façade system provides high thermal resistance and can be applied externally relatively fast with simple work methods. The façade system and each component of it need to meet specific technical performance criteria. The on-site construction process has the ability to modify technical performances with minor actions like mixing time, kneading water, insulation fixation, weather conditions, material moisture level and curing time. Minor deviations during construction can cause a variety of adverse consequences which lead to deterioration and reduced energy efficiency. The current paper proposes a methodology to rank the on-site degradation factors and provide a risk priority number. Based on the technical requirements set for building products, the significance of the collected degradation factors can be ranked by experts and the results ranked using a modified form of Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA).

On the one hand, supporters argue that REDD+ will help the environment and forest-dependent communities by generating payments for forest carbon services from industrialized countries seeking lower cost emissions reductions. Critics, by contrast, increasingly argue that REDD+ is a new form of colonization through capitalism, producing injustice by stripping forest communities of their rights, denying them capabilities for wellbeing, and rendering forest peoples voiceless in forest governance. This paper argues that current REDD+ debates are too focused on relatively simple visions of either distributive or procedural justice, and pay too little attention to the core recognitional justice concerns of REDD+ critics, namely questions of what values, worldviews, rights, and identities are privileged or displaced in the emergence, design, and implementation of REDD+ and with what effects. This paper examines the tensions that emerge when designing institutions to promote multi-scalar, multivalent justice in REDD+ to ask: what are the justice demands that REDD+ architects face when designing REDD+ institutions?

One of the most important parameters to calculate indirect nitrous oxide emissions due to leaching and runoff from all nitrogen added to managed soils is represented as fraction of nitrogen that is lost through leaching and runoff or FracLEAcH-(H). Default Fracleach-(h) value is 0.3 (kg N) according to the guidelines for the greenhouse gas emission inventory developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This approach of default FracLEACH-(H) value is generalized in order to allow widespread applicability. However, agricultural practice, climatic conditions, soil properties, hydrological flow processes and other factors play an important role in determining these losses. The potential of emission estimate improvement on national level by revision of FracLEACH-(H) is based on local data availability. However, there are often limited measurement data on leaching and runoff losses from various soils and agriculture practice.

Recently, LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2(NCM523) has been actively investigated due to its larger specific capacity and lower cost compared to conventional cathode materials. Presented here is a high energy density NCM523 cathode obtained by reducing the carbon content using the state-of-the-art carbon nanoparticles developed at Cabot Corporation. It is the first time that the nonlinear conductivity of NCM523 electrodes has been discovered, which is significantly impacted by the dispersion and surface crystalline quality of carbon black nanoparticles, especially when the loading of carbon black is only 1 wt%. The nonlinear conductivity of the cathodes can dramatically affect their electrochemical performances at high rates (≧3C), which is close to the tunneling saturated current. In addition, there is no discernable difference in terms of the rate and cycle performance of the NCM523 electrodes, when reducing the loading of novel carbon black nanoparticles from 5 wt% to 1 wt% in the cathode. Therefore, the energy density of the electrode can be increased by 9% by using existing commercially available electrode materials. ï¿½ The Author(s) 2016.",,"Carbon black; Cathodes; Dispersions; Electrodes; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese; Nanoparticles; Carbon black nanoparticles; Carbon Nano-Particles; Cath-ode materials; Crystalline quality; Electrochemical performance; High energy densities; Nonlinear conductivity; Specific capacities; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992186840

The shift to green economy is confirmed as the highest development aim, while establishing a balanced relationship between environmental policies, economic efficiency, technological upgrading and behavioural transition is one of main global assignments of our epoch. The importance of knowledge and innovations is also emphasised, while their availability, diffusion and exchange represent a key-reinforcement of green transition, especially in societies which are facing severe economic, social and environmental problems caused by sensitive local circumstances. The case of Serbia, which is the focus of this article, presents one of possible paths towards climate change adaptation, conditioned by more than two turbulent decades of the recent history of the country. Since democratic changes in 2000, environmental issues have become visible on institutional (governmental) level - through introduction of new environmental laws, research funding, preparation and implementation of specific documents or strategies, and on non-institutional (non-governmental) level - as different environmentally focused initiatives, usually supported by international, regional or local funds. However, on both levels information networks represent an inevitable structural ingredient, which enables a sustainable and locally adjusted approach to climate adaptation. Following global trends, information networks in Serbia are mainly used in the domain of public communication of climate changes, covering three major thematic areas of climate adaptability - human behaviour, ecological awareness and general efficiency. Considering all these specificities, the article provides a review of detected practices related to the use of information networks in climate change adaptation on both global and local level, stressing the possible benefits and limitations in the context of Serbia. The first part of the article introduces a global background of the problem of climate adaptation, summarising major environmental trends, research problems and policy responses, and emphasising the relation between climate change and urban(ised) environment. The second part is dedicated to the case of Serbia, focusing on three aspects - general condition of the environment, the legal framework and the perception/recognition of urban context and its environmental effects in recent development documents. The third part is focused on the relation between information networks, built environment/ cities and climate changes, providing an overview of global trends and Serbian practice, while possible improvements of detected local weaknesses are given in the concluding part.","City; Climate change adaptation; Environmental upgrading; Global warming; Information networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976340277

Data, information and services generated from Earth observation (EO) satellites, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or telecommunications satellites are now resulting in products that are part of knowledge-based decision-making processes in many countries, sometimes well streamlined in planning processes. To facilitate this integration, the United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER) implemented by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) bridges the gap between space technology providers and disaster managers, offering specific technical advisory and capacity building services that enable countries to use space-based information in disaster management. In the ten years since its establishment, UN-SPIDER helped more than 30 countries in increasing the access to and use of space-based technologies and information for disaster management. In the process, the platform built a significant knowledge base shared through a dedicated Knowledge Portal (www.un-spider.org) and has followed-up with capacity building efforts in most of those countries. A compilation of all recommendations and suggested actions identified through that assistance on issues such as ""policy and coordination"", ""awareness raising"", ""capacity building and institutional strengthening"", ""strengthening international cooperation"", ""accessing and processing data and information management"" now serves to develop collaborations at the national, regional and global levels for: 1) the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030; and 2) the development of capacity of nations to be prepared for the impacts of hazards during the full cycle of disaster management. This paper presents the approach of UN-SPIDER and how UNOOSA provides its support under the umbrella of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Through the design and promotion of innovative solutions integrating the capabilities of EO, GNSS applications and satellite telecommunications, UN-SPIDER will continue to serve as a global knowledge platform supporting authorities responsible for disaster management. It will also be argued that the approach and methods of UN-SPIDER will also guide UNOOSA in working with space actors in other important domains such as environmental monitoring and natural resources management, adaptation to climate change or public health.","2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; Disaster risk; Institutional strengthening; International coordination; Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; United Nations","Climate change; Data handling; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Emergency services; Environmental management; Global positioning system; International cooperation; Knowledge based systems; Planning; Satellites; Sustainable development; Adaptation to climate changes; Disaster risk reductions; Environmental Monitoring; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; International coordination; Knowledge-based decision making; Satellite telecommunication; United Nations; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016488570

The technology of waste coal recycling is offered that can be used in the production of coal fuel for bricks burning and preparation of the raw material for ceramics manufacture. On the basis of the pilot plant tests it is shown that the pneumatic waste classification allows coal residues to be extracted from argillites and a stable ceramic raw material to be obtained for the brick manufacture. Such complex processing of waste coal does not only provide a significant expansion of the raw material base for the production of building materials and generation of additional energy, but will also help to solve environmental problems and improve the environmental situation in industrial regions. Due to the introduction of the patented method of production and rational compositions of the granulated molding materials there is an increase in operational properties of ceramic wall materials produced from the waste coal after secondary processing. The study of thin sections using a polarizing microscope and SEM was conducted to examine the structures of the obtained ceramic cork.

Bangladesh is one example where environmental changes have long been amongst the multitude of reasons for migrating, with contemporary climate change suggested as a major impetus towards more migration. This paper examines local expert perceptions of migration as a climate change adaptation strategy for Bangladeshis. Seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted with local experts in Bangladesh and Assam (India) on environmental change and migration to understand the perspectives of those with formal education and expert-related jobs who come from the areas being directly affected by Bangladeshi migration. Findings show that local experts consider that migration is used and will be used for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh, but migration is not solely for climate change adaptation, instead interweaving with all other factors influencing migration-related decisions. © 2016 by the author.","Adaptation; Bangladesh; Climate change; Climate migration; Environmental migration; India; Migrants","adaptive management; climate change; education; environmental change; expert system; job search; migration; perception; Assam; Bangladesh; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007345411

It is called “Science Field Shops (SFSs)”. In these “Shops”, farmers, scientists/scholars and (where possible, so ideally) local extension officers meet to discuss and solve vulnerabilities and actual local problems expressed by farmers. In such context, agricultural extension is defined best as: “bringing new knowledge to farmers” and this is coordinated at these SFSs. We use SFSs to temporarily bridge the gap in availability and training of extension intermediaries by using farmer facilitators (FFs). Farmers are confused by consequences of climate change and want answers on questions that are related to local climate problems but also many other issues in growing their crops, among which rice is most important. Giving and discussing answers and predictions demand real dialogues in an agrometeorological learning approach to response farming. Farmers start to believe in their attempts to understand and reduce yield differences with the past and between them, by actively learning about consequences of climate change and how we can jointly fight them in such and otherwise changing environments.

However, research suggests that these efforts can backfire by breeding despair, denial and inaction. This may be especially true among younger audiences, as despair is highest among those who view climate challenges as out of their control, and children generally have lower perceived and actual control than adults in political and personal arenas. Though many studies have documented feelings of despair and sadness among younger audiences, few have explored how climate change hope may counteract despair and encourage productive responses to climate change concern. This study examined how climate change hope, despair, and concern predict pro-environmental behavior with a quantitative survey of a random sample of middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n = 1486). We did not find an interaction between climate change hope and concern or despair, but instead found climate change hope and concern independently and positively related to behavior and despair negatively related to behavior. These results suggest that climate change concern among K-12 audiences may be an important antecedent to behavior which does not dampen the positive impacts of hope. Further, rather than mitigating the negative effects of climate change despair, hope may be an independent predecessor to behavior. Students at Title I (a measure of low socioeconomic status) schools were less likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, suggesting climate literacy efforts should target schools with lower levels of socioeconomic status specifically. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate action; Climate literacy; Concern; Hope; Pro-environmental behavior","adolescence; antecedent conditions; climate change; human behavior; literacy; socioeconomic status; young population; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956701449

There is clear evidence that change has already occurred due to emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols from human activities, which affect the fundamentals of the Arctic ecosystems and the lives of the Northerners. Over the second half of the 20th century, warming in the Arctic led to increased loss of snow cover in spring and summer and simultaneously increased snowfall during boreal autumn and winter. Arctic sea-ice change has been linked to changes in mid-latitude weather patterns that increase the probability of extreme weather events. The warming trend also appears to result in increased precipitation in northern Europe. The sea level rise is another major concern. The eu can influence Arctic climate change by limiting its own emissions, including short-lived climate forcers, and championing an effective and broad global climate agreement. The eu has made progress in curbing ghg emissions, partly through policy measures in energy, transport and efficiency improvements, and has set targets for further gains in the period to 2030. The eu, as a key actor in the unfccc negotiations, can highlight the Arctic within international processes and support any potential initiatives coming from the Arctic Council. The eu is in a good position to support adaptation in the European Arctic. The eu is encouraged to increase its efforts and contributions to enhance sustained observation activities in the Arctic in order to improve monitoring of climate change and effects in the region. Current ground- or satellite-based earth observation systems do not fulfil monitoring needs and communication includes bottlenecks. Both for decision-making in the near term and for long-term guidance for Arctic adaptation and sustainable development, climate indicators specific to the Arctic should be identified and corresponding data obtained. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2016",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051199618

These are identified as regions of positive longwave feedback and are regions of a super greenhouse effect (SGE). These SGE regions are identified from feedback analysis of the 4 × CO2 abrupt experiments of CMIP5, and despite their existence, there is little agreement across models as to the magnitude of the effect. The general effects of clouds on the SGE are to amplify the clear-sky SGE, but there is also poor agreement on the magnitude of the amplification that varies by an order of magnitude across models. Sensitivity analyses indicate that localized SGE regions are spatially aligned with a large moistening of the upper troposphere. The reduction in clear-sky OLR arises from a reduction in emission in the far IR with nonnegligible contributions from mid-IR emission from the midtroposphere. When viewed in the broader context of meridional heat transport, it is found that of the 1.03-PW rate of heat gained globally, 0.8 PW is absorbed in the tropics and is contributed almost equally by reductions in clear-sky longwave emission (i.e., the clear-sky SGE) and increased absorbed clear-sky solar radiation associated with increased water vapor. The processes that define the clear-sky SGE are shown to be fundamental to the way models accumulate heat and then transport it poleward. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Circulation/ Dynamics; Climate models; Coupled models; Deep convection; Feedback; Hadley circulation; Meridional overturning circulation; Models and modeling","Feedback; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouses; Sensitivity analysis; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Coupled models; Deep convection; Hadley circulation; Long-wave emissions; Meridional heat transports; Meridional overturning circulations; Model experiments; Climate models; atmospheric convection; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate feedback; climate modeling; CMIP; greenhouse effect; Hadley cell; troposphere; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987708350

During relaxation of the S1 surface intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold is possible via the T2 state which enables an El-Sayed allowed transition. The time-resolved photoelectron spectra show indications of a triplet state formed on an ultrafast timescale. We suggest that the ultrafast timescale of the intersystem crossing process is possible due to the shape of the potential energy surface directing and restricting the dynamics along the carbonyl group de-planarization coordinate, where an El-Sayed allowed intersystem crossing is possible at all times, and where the S1 and T2 states are nearly iso-energetic all the way along the reaction coordinate. © 2016 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984996433

In its response, society needs to prioritize which of these impacts to address and what share of resources to spend on each respective adaptation. A prerequisite to achieving that end is an economic impact analysis that is consistent across sectors and acknowledges intersectoral and economy-wide feedback effects. Traditional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are usually operating at a level too aggregated for this end, while bottom-up impact models most often are not fully comprehensive, focusing on only a subset of climate sensitive sectors and/or a subset of climate change impact chains. Thus, we develop here an approach which applies climate and socioeconomic scenario analysis, harmonized economic costing, and sector explicit bandwidth analysis in a coupled framework of eleven (bio)physical impact assessment models and a uniform multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model. In applying this approach to the alpine country of Austria, we find that macroeconomic feedbacks can magnify sectoral climate damages up to fourfold, or that by mid-century costs of climate change clearly outweigh benefits, with net costs rising two- to fourfold above current damage cost levels. The resulting specific impact information - differentiated by climate and economic drivers - can support sector-specific adaptation as well as adaptive capacity building. © 2016 The Authors.","Adaptation; Climate impact; Economic evaluation; Local impact","adaptive management; assessment method; bottom-up approach; climate change; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; macroeconomics; nature-society relations; scenario analysis; socioeconomic conditions; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971383855

A questionnaire based survey confirms that ventilation is a major cooling strategy. Further investigation is conducted on window operation patterns through simulation tools. After a thorough analysis of a large number of urban vernacular dwellings, a representative vernacular dwelling located in the urban core of Nicosia was selected as a case study. Its architectural layout reflects the typical arrangement of a two-storey dwelling with a three-bay interior arrangement and thus ensures a number of passive design strategies related to natural ventilation. The study explores two types of natural airflow; namely, wind effect, in single-sided and cross ventilation mode, and stack effect. The impact of daytime, night-time and all day ventilation is also assessed comparatively. The results indicate that occupant behaviour concerning window operation has significant impact on the overall thermal performance of the building.

Forest response and recovery from drought may be a result of position within landscape. Longleaf pine forests in the United States have been observed to reduce their carbon sequestration capacity during drought. We collected eddy covariance data at the ends of an edaphic longleaf pine gradient (xeric and mesic sites) over seven years; two years of normal rainfall were followed by 2.5 years of drought, then 2.5 years of normal or slightly above-average rainfall. Drought played a significant role in reducing the physiological capacity of the sites and was compounded when prescribed fire occurred during the same periods. The mesic site has a 40% greater basal area then the xeric site, which accounts for its larger sequestration capacity; however, both sites show the same range of variance in fluxes over the course of the study. Following drought, both sites became carbon sinks. However, the xeric site had a longer carry-over effect and never returned to pre-drought function. Although this study encompassed seven years, we argue that longer studies with greater spatial variance must be undertaken to develop a more comprehensive understanding of forest response to changing climate. © 2016 by the authors.","Carbon dynamics; Drought recovery; Ecosystem respiration (Reco); Gross ecosystem exchange (GEE); Longleaf pine; net ecosystem exchange (NEE); Orthonormal wavelet analysis","Carbon; Drought; Ecosystems; Rain; Carbon dynamics; Ecosystem exchange; Ecosystem respiration; Longleaf pine; Net ecosystem exchange; Orthonormal wavelet analysis; Forestry; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; drought; forest dynamics; net ecosystem exchange; respiration; wavelet analysis; United States; Pinus palustris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971331000

The Water Management and Planning Simulation (WaterMAPS) model was created specifically for the City and updated to include the County. Climate change studies were used to develop inputs to WaterMAPS that impact the availability of supply. Population projections, as well as unit demand variability due to climate change, were used in the model to simulate demand variation. With these inputs, the WaterMAPS model simulates, on a monthly timestep, a single year of water demands (the year 2055) through repeated realizations reflective of the past range of variability in the sources of water supply for the City and County. The model projected a water supply gap of 5.549 to 15.043 million cubic meters per year (MCMY) (4,500 to 12,200 acre-feet/year (AFY)), which proved there was a critical need for additional water supply or water supply strategies. In response, several water supply portfolios were developed and simulated in the model to determine more reliable supplies strategies in meeting demand given certain levels of risk.

Throughout the European Union, hard coal has an important place in the structure of primary energy consumption. In the years 1990–2014, primary energy consumption in the European Union (calculated for all 28 Member States) has changed between 1507 and 1722 million toe. Between 2014 and 1990, there was a decrease of primary energy consumption, and the average rate of decline amounted to –0.2%. According to Council Directive 2013/12/EU, by the year 2020 energy consumption throughout the EU is expected to be no more than 1483 Mtoe of primary energy, and already in 2014 total primary energy consumption in the EU28 was higher than assumed by this target by only about 24 million toe (2%). Actions taken to protect the climate result in reducing the consumption of hard coal in the European Union. Between 1990 and 2014, the consumption of hard coal decreased by 41% (a decrease of 126 million toe), and the average rate of decline in consumption of this fuel amounted to –2.1%. Throughout the EU, households are not as significant a consumer of hard coal, as in Poland. Although EU28’s coal consumption in this sector in the years 1990 to 2014 varied between 6.5– –15.8 million toe, its share in the overall consumption of this fuel usually maintained at around 3–5%. The changing fuel mix, closing of mines or gradual extinction of coal mining, environmental policy of the individual countries meant that coal has lost its position in some of them. Analyzing the structure of hard coal consumption by households in the EU28 countries in the years 1900 to 2014, one may notice that the leaders are those countries that have their own coal mines. Due to the structure of consumption of hard coal by the customers, the article discussed two countries: Poland and Great Britain in greater detail. In 1990, Poland (50%) and Britain (18%) were close leaders, and twenty-five years later, only Poland has remained in first place (84%) and Great Britain has fallen to fourth place (4%). Between 2014 and 1990, the consumption of hard coal by the British residential sector decreased by 88% to only 0.3 million toe. In the case of Poland, it admittedly decreased by 6%, but still exceeds 6 million toe. The decrease in hard coal consumption in Great Britain was largely a consequence of The Clean Air Act introduced in 1956. In Britain, the process of replacing coal with other fuels (mostly natural gas) lasted several decades. Domestic coal was replaced with another mainly domestic resource – natural gas which ensured the security of its supply. The article also describes the households in the European Union and in Poland. The overall housing stock was taken into account, together with the distribution of population according to the degree of urbanization. Regulations that have a significant impact on the consumption of energy in the European Union were also discussed. © 2016, Polska Akademia Nauk.

Supporting DFT calculations on HL4 suggest that the two isomers may be closely isoenergetic with a relatively high barrier to exchange of ca. 100 kJ mol-1. These new ligands were cyclometalated with Pt(ii) to give complexes [Pt(L1-4)(acac)] (acac = acetylacetonate). The spectroscopically characterised complexes were studied using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy including 195Pt{1H} NMR studies which revealed δPtca. -2785 ppm for [Pt(L1-4)(acac)]. X-ray crystallographic studies were undertaken on [Pt(L3)(acac)] and [Pt(L4)(acac)], each showing the weakly distorted square planar geometry at Pt(ii); the structure of [Pt(L3)(acac)] showed evidence for intermolecular Pt-Pt interactions. The UV-vis. absorption studies show that the spectral profiles for [Pt(L2-4)(acac)] are a composite of the organic chromophore centred bands and a broad 1MLCT (5d → π∗) band (ca. 440 nm) associated with the complex. Luminescence studies showed that complexes [Pt(L2-4)(acac)] are dual emissive with fluorescence characteristic of the tethered fluorophore and long-lived phosphorescence attributed to 3MLCT emission. In the case of the pyrenyl derivative, [Pt(L4)(acac)], the close energetic matching of the 3MLCT and 3LCpyr excited states led to an elongation of the 3MLCT emission lifetime (τ = 42 μs) under degassed solvent conditions, suggestive of energy transfer processes between the two states. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Chromophores; Energy transfer; Fluorophores; Geometry; Isomers; Ligands; Luminescence; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Plants (botany); Spectroscopic analysis; Synthesis (chemical); X ray crystallography; Aromatic chromophores; Crystallographic studies; Energy transfer process; Fluorescence characteristics; Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy; Spectroscopic property; Spectroscopic studies; Square planar geometry; Platinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976878647

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85°C (0.65–1.06°C) over the period of 1880–2012. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year on record. Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4% of land and 4% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive pressure on natural resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6°C, which is likely to impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased temperature, water stress, and reduction in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have been projected under medium-term (2020–39) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by 4.5–9%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since agriculture currently contributes about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly range from 0.7% to 1.35% of GDP per year. Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers being smallholders (<0.5 ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with changed climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion. Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops, fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening the livelihoods of rural poor. Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor, small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be over $7 billion that will severely affect the income of at least 10% of the population. However, this could be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective climate resilient measures are implemented. Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious and improved management of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources through adoption of best bet practices. CRA is a way to achieve short- and long-term agricultural development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes in order to meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience and the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change, and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) are referred to as the “triple win” of overall CRA. The concept of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to provide stability to farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of CRVs warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and recover from climate risks. The overall program of establishing CRVs have structured village level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC), custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based on bottom-up approach with village community taking a central role in decision making on institutional requirements, technological interventions and supporting systems with able support from experts. In our knowledge, the CRV network of National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program involving farmer's participation ever undertaken in the field of climate change adaptation anywhere in the world. Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building of the program at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the district level, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under the Division of Agricultural Extension under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology divisions of various ICAR Institutions across the country are responsible in implementing the project at village level through farmers’ participatory approach. To address the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages, different interventions were planned under the four modules; however, the specific intervention under each module for a particular village was need based and decided based on climatic vulnerability and resource situation of the particular village. The four intervention modules being implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, soil health card–based nutrient application, water harvesting and recycling for supplementary or life saving irrigation, improved drainage in high rainfall/flood prone villages, conservation tillage, and water saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production module consisting of introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant varieties, modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops to cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of Rice Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in fruit/vegetables, community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in onset of monsoon, energy-efficient farm machinery through village CHC with timely completion of farm operation in limited sowing window, location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry systems. (3) Module III covers livestock and fisheries interventions through augmentation of fodder production, fodder storage methods, prophylaxis, and improved shelters for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy. (4) Module IV consists of village level institutions, collective marketing groups, introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate literacy though establishment of automated weather stations. Impacts of these climate resilient interventions in the villages were assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly, improved farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and measurements of GHG emissions which were correlated with ex ante assessment of village level carbon balance and overall contribution to global warming potential. These 151 CRVs are learning sites for further expanding resilient villages to adjoining clusters and districts so that large number of villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led climate change mitigation mission in the country. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","adaptation; carbon balance; climate change; climate resilient village; India; institutional innovations; rainwater management; resilient technologies; soil health; Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999853155

The risk involved in successful cultivation of crops depends on the nature of drought (chronic and contingent), its probable duration, and frequency of occurrence within the season. These aberrations are expected to further increase in future. A significant fall in food production is often noticed with increase in intensity or extension in duration of drought prevalence. Drought affects not only the food production at farm level but also the national economy and overall food security. Location-specific rainfed technologies are available to cope with different drought situations. Much of the research done in rainfed agriculture in India relates to conservation of soil & rainwater and to drought proofing. The key technologies for drought mitigation are in situ moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting and recycling, resilient crops and cropping systems including contingency crop plans, foliar sprays, and integrated farming systems. However, drought preparedness and real time implementation of contingency measures at field level needs well structured institutional support for farmers with strong government policy and convergence among various institutions. Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, needs to facilitate the convergence process of various government schemes such as MGNREGA, RKVY, Mega Seed Project, NFSM, NHM, IWMP, Soil health schemes etc. for drought preparedness. National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), one among the missions under the Prime Minister National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) may take a lead role in implementation of contingency, by inclusion of this activity in State Action Plans (SAP) with a dedicated Nodal Institution/officers and budget provision. © 2016, India Meteorological Department.

Vehicles have been becoming ever more sophisticated and the main direction of their development is placed primarily into the areas of environment, design, safety and comfort. The main current trend with regard to the environment, reducing emissions, fuel economy etc. is reduction of vehicle weight. A large amount of manufacturers and research works is concerned on a reduction of the weight of individual vehicle components primarily by application of unconventional materials. We've been finding highly sophisticated composite material which by targeted influencing of their properties can replace conventional steel materials with considerable weight reduction. As a long-time neglected part in this area we can generally mark the steel frames of car seats, especially their big mass which reduction can be a good challenge in future optimizations. In this work based on experiments with the normalized loading and numerical simulations we found how big stress and strain arise in the frame and especially their distribution. The experiment was based on loading of the back rest with a controlled torque relative to the R point of the seat. The overall deformation was monitored with using a laser and local deformation using strain gages. For a more detailed description of the emerging stresses, primarily about their distributions and directions a quasi static numerical model has been created. The found results will be applied mainly for the future construction of a composite backrest.","Car seat; Experimental loading; Real stress; Simulation; Steel frame","Automobile manufacture; Deformation; Fuel economy; Numerical models; Steel construction; Stress analysis; Structural frames; Vehicles; Car seats; Conventional steel; Local deformations; Reducing emissions; Simulation; Steel frame; Stress and strain; Vehicle components; Loading",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986331463

To identify REDD+ actors and how they participate in decision-making we used a stakeholder analysis; to assess actors' views and the extent to which these views are included in the country's official REDD+ documents we conducted a discourse analysis. We found low level of input legitimacy in so far as that the federal government environment agencies concentrate most decision-making power and key land-use sectors and local people's representatives are absent in decision-making forums. We also observed that the REDD+ discourse held by government agencies and both multilateral and international conservation organisations is dominant in policy documents, while the other two identified discourses, predominantly supported by national and civil society organisations and the academia, are partly, or not at all, reflected in such documents. We argue that Mexico's REDD+ readiness process should become more inclusive, decentralised, and better coordinated to allow for the deliberation and institutionalisation of different actors' ideas in REDD+ design. Our analysis and recommendations are relevant to other countries in the global South embarking on REDD+ design and implementation. © 2016 by the authors.","Discourses; Legitimacy; Mexico; REDD+; Stakeholder analysis","Behavioral research; Land use; Discourses; Legitimacy; Me-xico; REDD; Stakeholder analysis; Decision making; decision making; deforestation; emission control; federal system; governance approach; local participation; stakeholder; Decision Making; Degradation; Environments; Forests; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007344246

Our objective in this study was to compare headspace concentrations of ammonia (NH3), total reduced sulfides (TRS), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) when pine wood chips (Pinus spp.) and corn stover (Zea mays L.) were mixed in various ratios (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, and 100% pine chips) and used as bedding with manure. Air samples were collected from the headspace of laboratory-scaled bedded manure packs weekly for 42 d. Ammonia concentrations were highest for bedded packs containing 0, 10, and 20% pine chips (equivalent to 501.7, 502.3, and 502.3 mg m-3, respectively) in the bedding mixture and were lowest when at least 80% pine chips were used as bedding (447.3 and 431.0 mg m-3, respectively for 80 and 100% pine chip bedding). The highest NH3 concentrations were observed at Day 28. The highest concentration of TRS was observed when 100% pine chips were used as bedding (11.4 μg m-3), with high concentrations occurring between Days 7 and 14, and again at Day 35. Greenhouse gases were largely unaffected by bedding material but CH4 and CO2 concentrations increased as the bedded packs aged and N2O concentrations were highly variable throughout the incubation. We conclude that a mixture of bedding material that contains 30 to 40% pine chips may be the ideal combination to reduce both NH3 and TRS emissions. All gas concentrations increased as the bedded packs aged, suggesting that frequent cleaning of facilities would improve air quality in the barn, regardless of bedding materials used. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"Agriculture; Air cleaners; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur compounds; Wood products; Ammonia concentrations; Bedding materials; CO2 concentration; Gas concentration; Headspace concentrations; Nitrous oxide; Pine wood chips; Total reduced sulfides; Ammonia; ammonia; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; sulfide; ammonia; sulfide; air sampling; Article; concentration at steady-state; greenhouse gas; laboratory; maize; manure; pH; pine; temperature; analysis; animal; animal housing; gas; greenhouse gas; maize; pine; Ammonia; Chips; Pinus; Sulfides; Ammonia; Animals; Gases; Greenhouse Gases; Housing, Animal; Manure; Methane; Pinus; Sulfides; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960337857

In particular, oil overall consumption and production are expected to continue growing, especially in emerging economies, though more slowly than in the past due to international policies aimed at slowing down climate changes. Plants and infrastructures related to the oil industry are often inherently related to challenging projects, which, in most of the cases, have to fulfill strict technical, environmental, and economical specifications. For instance, refinery sites located in sub-urban contexts have to face stringent environmental requirements both during production and after their dismantling to ensure that no pollution spreads across the surrounding areas. On the other hand, the construction of offshore platforms in difficult geotechnical conditions presents issues, which can be solved only by means of innovative technical solutions. This paper presents two case histories in which deep-mixing techniques were used to produce improved-soil elements for environmental and structural purposes related to the oil industry, i.e. a cut-off wall in an ex-refinery site and foundation piles for the support of offshore platforms in carbonate sands. Deep-mixing (DM) of soil is a well-established methodology in geotechnics introduced more than 50 years ago in Japan. DM methods have been used so far in numerous applications both on-shore and offshore projects. The use of DM is expected to become more and more popular in the future due to its economic and environmental advantages compared to other traditional construction techniques. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Climate change; Drilling platforms; Economics; Investments; Mixing; Natural gasoline plants; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refineries; Refining; Sand; Urban growth; Emerging economies; Environmental requirement; Geotechnical conditions; Global energy market; International policies; Off shore platforms; Technical solutions; Traditional constructions; Offshore oil wells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002061829

One potential solution for reducing fuel consumption is to increase the wing aspect-ratio as it improves the lift-to-drag ratio. However, higher aspect-ratio wings result in higher deections which in turn may lead to non-linear aeroelastic behaviour. In this work, the aeroelastic behaviour of a conventional regional aircraft with high aspect-ratio wings is investigated. The structural design aims to ensure that the wing is able to withstand a load limit of 3.8g. Aeroelastically scaled models using two classical scaling methodologies have been evaluated and compared. The two methodologies use scaling factors derived from the governing aeroelastic equations of motion. The first methodology consists of a direct modal response matching, while the second method uncouples the mass and stiffness distribution to achieve the modal response. The scaled structure design parameters are optimized to obtain the target scaled values. Also, an alternative non-linear aeroelastic scaling methodology using equivalent static loads is presented, which uses two different optimization routines to match the non-linear static response and the mode shapes of the full model. The results show a good agreement between the full-scale and reduced-scale models. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The idea behind sustainability is not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions, hut also increasing the quality-of-life of citizens. Furthermore, sustainahility level should be evaluated somehow, although it is a complex task because smart cities concept encompasses multiple fields such as energy efficiency, quality of processes, ICT tools, and socio-economic aspects, among others. Even standards as BREEAM or L.EED do not case their implementation. For this reason, in this paper and under the CITyFiED project, a novel and holistic assessment protocol is proposed which glues main features of aforementioned standards and energy efficiency, economics, social acceptance, life cycle assessment and smart homes to simplify the calculation of sustainability in districts. This protocol is being applied in three residential districts with the aim of reducing the pollution due to buildings (around 60% in Europe) which are (he main contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, this paper describes how this general protocol is being deployed in one out of the demonstrators of the project: district located in Soma, Turkey. Within this demonstrator, a portfolio of Key Performance Indicators are defined with the objective of detennining the sustainability level taking into consideration the different parts of the protocol, the relationship between them and the peculiarities of the demonstrator.","Energy efficiency; Life cycle assessment; Protocols; Social acceptance; Sustainable districts","Automation; Benchmarking; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Network protocols; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Assessment protocols; Key performance indicators; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Residential districts; Social acceptance; Socioeconomic aspects; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable districts; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986888101

That one has been dated to Ha C2, that is, to the second half of the 7th cent. BC. During the excavations, samples for archaeobotanical analysis were taken from both tumuli; this paper presents the results of that analysis. From tumulus 13, 140 carbonized plant remains were recovered. Predominant among them were various fruits gathered from the environment, with greatest presence of common hazel (Corylus avellana). In tumulus 14, 3880 carbonized plant remains were recorded. Predominant among them were various cereal species, with a noticeable proportion of ‘fruit’ grave goods, primarily wild apples (Malus sylvestris). Grave goods of plant origin were undoubtedly very important in the Hallstatt grave ritual, but for a more precise reconstruction of the customs of the time we have to complete the ongoing analysis of finds from other tumuli within the same site. © 2016, Institute of Archaeology.

The estimated emissions from the use of natural gas indicated a decrease for 35 of the 40 pollutants. When changing from fuel oil to natural gas, it is important to use the best available control technology for NOx, including low NOx burners, due to some potential negative impacts, e.g., the formation of ozone which is a severe atmospheric pollution problem in the MCMZ.

Perturbed runs follow a surrogate climate change approach, in which a uniform temperature perturbation is specified, but the large-scale flow and relative humidity are unchanged. The differences between control and perturbed simulations are therefore mainly due to the imposed warming and moisture changes and their feedbacks to the synoptic-scale flow. Results show that the LPS precipitation increases by 13%/K, twice the imposed moisture increase, which is on the same order as the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. This large precipitation increase is attributed to the feedbacks in vertical velocity and atmospheric stability, which together account for the high sensitivity. In the perturbed simulations the LPSs have higher propagation speeds and aremore intense. The storms intensification to the uniformtemperature perturbation can be interpreted in terms of the conditional instability of second kind mechanism where the condensational heating increases along with low-level convergence and vertical velocity in response to temperature and moisture increases. As a result, the surface low deepens. © 2016.

However, little attention has been paid to the potential placement of floating photovoltaic (PV) systems operated on mine pit lakes because it was assumed that the topographic characteristics of open-pit mines are unsuitable for installing any type of PV systems. This study analyzed the potential of floating PV systems on a mine pit lake in Korea to break this misconception. Using a fish-eye lens camera and digital elevation models, a shading analysis was performed to identify the area suitable for installing a floating PV system. The layout of the floating PV system was designed in consideration of the optimal tilt angle and array spacing of the PV panels. The System Advisor Model (SAM) by National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA, was used to conduct energy simulations based on weather data and the system design. The results indicated that the proposed PV system could generate 971.57 MWh/year. The economic analysis (accounting for discount rate and a 20-year operational lifetime) showed that the net present value would be $897,000 USD, and a payback period of about 12.3 years. Therefore, we could know that the economic effect of the floating PV system on the mine pit lake is relatively higher than that of PV systems in the other abandoned mines in Korea. The annual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions was analyzed and found to be 471.21 tCO2/year, which is twice the reduction effect achieved by forest restoration of an abandoned mine site. The economic feasibility of a floating PV system on a pit lake of an abandoned mine was thus established, and may be considered an efficient reuse option for abandoned mines. © 2016 by the authors.","Economic analysis; Floating photovoltaic system; Pit lake","Conservation; Economic analysis; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Lakes; Lime; Open pit mining; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Digital elevation model; Economic feasibilities; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Operational lifetime; Optimal tilt angles; Photovoltaic systems; Pit lakes; Renewable energy technologies; Abandoned mines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958559723

However, the narrow operating range of LTC engines limits the use of these engines in conventional powertrains. Extended range electric vehicles (EREVs), by decoupling the engine from the drivetrain, allows the engine to operate in a limited operating range; thus, EREVs offer an ideal platform for realizing the advantages of LTC engines. In this study, the global optimum fuel economy improvement of an experimentally developed 2-liter multi-mode LTC engine in a series EREV is investigated. The engine operation modes include Homogeneous-Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI), and conventional Spark Ignition (SI). The simulation results show in the city driving cycle, the single-mode HCCI and RCCI engines offer 12% and 9% fuel economy improvement, respectively over a single-mode SI engine in the EREV. These improvements increase to 13.1% and 10.3% in the highway driving cycles. In addition, the mode-switching fuel penalty is included in the optimization problem and the results are used to determine number of LTC modes. The results show that the multi-mode LTC engine offers 2% more fuel economy improvement over the best single-mode LTC engine operation. These results depend on the type of driving cycle and mode-switching fuel penalty. HCCI and RCCI engine modes can be the dominant optimal engine operating modes depending on the mode-switching fuel penalty value.

The experimental omnivorousfuel engine was operated at 1400 rpm and 6 bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) with 20% cooled EGR. The mass ratio of n-butanol injected comprised of 50% of the total fuel mass. The dual fueling strategy of RCCI changed the conventional diesel combustion (CDC) apparent heat release profile. With the new fueling strategy the heat release was split into two regions of high temperature heat release when using CS100. The first occurred before top dead center (BTDC) from the high reactivity fuel and the second peak occurred due to the combustion of the low reactivity fuel (n-butanol) after top dead center (ATDC). ULSD did not produce this same split in heat release due to the longer ignition delay. The ignition delay for CS100 was shortened by 0.15 ms when compared to ULSD because of the high palmitic acid content in the biodiesel. The RCCI process itself extended the ignition delay about 0.17 ms (about 1.4 CAD) suggesting the possibility of controlling combustion phasing for both RCCI fueling strategies of ULSD and CS100. The CA50 occurred similarly at 10° ATDC for ULSD and CS100 however, RCCI shifted the CA50's (7° and 8° ATDC for CS100 and ULSD respectively). Soot emissions exhibited a decrease with the PFI of n-butanol because of the highly oxygenated nature of the fuel by 80%. In summary, RCCI stratification using n-Butanol as the low reactivity fuel significantly reduced soot emissions when using either a high linoleic acid content biofuel or ULSD while also suggesting control over combustion phasing.

The systematic biases in simulating monthly mean temperature and precipitation from the 2 sets of RCM simulations were identified. The Climate Research Unit dataset was used as a reference. The systematic model errors were more dependent on the RCMs than on the driving GCMs. Most RCMs showed a systematic temperature overestimation and precipitation underestimation over the La Plata Basin region. Model biases were not invariant, but a temperature-dependent temperature bias and a precipitation-dependent precipitation bias were apparent for the region, with the warm bias amplified for warm months and the dry bias amplified for wet months. In a climate change scenario, the relationship between model bias behaviour and the projected climate change for each individual model revealed that the models with the largest temperature bias amplification projected the largest warming and the models with the largest dry bias amplification projected the smallest precipitation increase, suggesting that models' bias behaviour may affect the future climate projections. After correcting model biases by means of a quantile-based mapping bias correction method, projected temperature changes were systematically reduced, and projected precipitation changes were systematically increased. Though applying bias correction method - ologies to projected climate conditions is controversial, this study demonstrates that bias correction methodologies should be considered in order to better interpret climate change signals. © Inter-Research 2016.","La Plata Basin; Regional climate change; Regional Climate Models; South America; Systematic bias","amplification; climate change; climate modeling; climate signal; data set; ensemble forecasting; European Union; precipitation intensity; regional climate; sampling bias; temperature effect; La Plata Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966658382

The discussion of data filtering algorithms is aimed at improving the noise immunity of the acoustic emission system. Method: Noise filtering methods (frequency filtering, time series disorder detection, etc.) are examined for AE testing. Findings: One problem of the acoustic emission testing is a great number of noises affecting the diagnosis results. Electric noises, electromagnetic interference, background acoustic noise, rubbing noises are far from the full list of noises available during measurements. At the high level of noises, the operator has to increase the recording threshold of the acoustic emission impulses through reducing the testing sensitivity at the risk of missing a dangerous defect. Lack of the data filtering can result in an incorrect localization and erroneous definition of the danger level of acoustic emission source. Different noise types have been investigated and noise classification method according to the filtering complexity has been suggested to solve effectively the problem of the acoustic emission test data filtering. Wavelet-filtering efficiency for white stochastic noise removal has been shown. Algorithm for impulse noise filtering has been described.

Harnessing the solar-thermal energy in crowded urban areas for heating spaces and preparing domestic hot water in decentralized technical systems of producing heat is, most of the times, hard to implement given the restrictive conditions resulted from the local urban regulations, the limited available space for mounting the collectors fields and the operating regimes of the existing district heating systems. In this regard, the purposes of this paper are: identifying and analyzing the specific performance indicators applicable to urban consumers (buildings) equipped with decentralized solar-thermal systems which quantifies the impact of integrating solar-thermal energy in the classic heating systems and the hybrid systems’ efficiency thus obtained. The following concepts were approached simultaneously and synergistic: the energy efficiency of the buildings and the harnessing efficiency of the solar-thermal energy in the buildings connected to the district heating system. The criteria for a global evaluation of the performances achieved by the thermal energy systems in accordance with the particularities of the working hypotheses and objectives pursued were established. The case-study was carried out for an urban thermal area characterized by high thermal energy density in two hipotheses of energy efficiency of the buildings, the existing ones and the thermo-energetically optimized respectively. The computational modeling and setting of the operational frames of heating systems’ simulations for the suggested working scenarios was achieved.

The team used the modeling and simulation tools for evaluating different outcomes based on hybrid powertrain architecture changes (hardware), and controls code development and testing (software). The first step was model validation to experimental data, as the plant models had not yet been validated. This paper includes the results of the team's work in the U.S. Department of Energy's EcoCAR 2 Advanced vehicle Technical Competition for university student teams to create and test a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle for reducing petroleum oil consumption, pollutant emissions, and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Plant model validations and advancements brought the vehicle plant model directionally closer to the actual vehicle's experimental data and achieved error reduction in 10 of 11 metrics detailed in the research.

Thorough validation and advancement of the internal combustion engine powertrain fell outside of the research scope, so only some validation and advancement was performed. Not adding a torque converter to the plant model was a main item for future work.

To support these trends in engine development turbocharger turbines have been required to meet ever increasing aerodynamic performance requirements, resulting in more elaborate designs, whilst also being subject to ever more demanding service conditions in terms of rotational speed, pressures and gas temperatures. All turbocharger turbine stages whether vaned or vaneless are subject to High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) driven by vibratory loading. In all cases the vibratory loading occurs when the harmonic of the frequency of the unsteady aerodynamic loading matches one of the blade natural frequencies. This unsteady aerodynamic loading is due to the interaction between the stationary and rotating parts in the turbine stage. In the case of a vane less turbine the stationary part of the stage contributing to the interaction is the scroll or volute specifically the tongue region where it comes closest to the passing blades creating non uniformity. When this unsteady aerodynamic loading reaches a sufficient level, and the blade is in resonance, it can cause excessive mechanical loading resulting in the formation of cracks in the blades and ultimately failure. Since HCF can be very challenging to detect during the development of new turbine stages this type of failure can potentially occur late in the engine development cycle or even in the field. This paper highlights the steps that have been taken to improve the design, analysis, measurement and verification of HCF in vane less turbine stages, the intent being to improve both the HCF robustness and maintain performance. In making these improvements the impact on the aerodynamic performance of the turbine stages was also strongly considered to ensure that improvements made for HCF were not made at the expense of performance. The investigation of these new design options required developments in analytical capabilities, specifically 3D unsteady CFD, in order to make the necessary iterations with adequate fidelity in a practical timeframe. To verify the analysis techniques comprehensive experimental measurement of blade strain levels across multiple designs was also conducted and the results compared with analysis. Finally endurance testing was conducted to confirm that the measured improvements in HCF resulted in longer (and sufficient) service life of the turbine stage. Estimation of the required service life was accomplished using the process presented by Kulkarni et al (IMechE 2010). Based on the results of this work it has been possible to propose new design and analysis practices that ensure future turbine stage designs are robust to HCF without any impediment to the continual improvement of aerodynamic efficiency. These practices have been validated through experimental and endurance testing of real world parts and will facilitate the design of future generations of turbine stage designs with state of the art performance that are able to withstand the increasingly severe service conditions required by modern engines. © The author(s) and/or their employer(s), 2016.",,"Aerodynamic loads; Axial flow turbomachinery; Computational fluid dynamics; Efficiency; Gas turbines; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Aero-dynamic performance; Aerodynamic efficiency; Emissions legislation; Measurement and verification; State-of-the-art performance; Turbine stage design; Turbocharger turbines; Unsteady aerodynamics; Aerodynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052052656

In order to adequately estimate CH4 emissions, it is important to include data representing the range of environmental, climatic, and cultural factors occurring in rice production, particularly from Arkansas, the leading rice-producing state in the US, and from clay soils. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of previous crop (i.e., rice or soybean (Glycine max L.)) and cultivar (i.e., Cheniere (pure-line, semidwarf), CLXL745 (hybrid), and Taggart (pure-line, standard-stature)) on CH4 fluxes and emissions from rice grown on a Sharkey clay (very-fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Epiaquerts) in eastern Arkansas. Rice following rice as a previous crop generally had greater (p &lt; 0.01) fluxes than rice following soybean, resulting in growing season emissions (p &lt; 0.01) of 19.6 and 7.0 kg CH4-C ha-1, respectively. The resulting emissions from CLXL745 (10.2 kg CH4-C ha-1) were less (p = 0.03) than those from Cheniere or Taggart (15.5 and 14.2 kg CH4-C ha-1, resp.), which did not differ. Results of this study indicate that common Arkansas practices, such as growing rice in rotation with soybean and planting hybrid cultivars, may result in reduced CH4 emissions relative to continuous rice rotations and pure-line cultivars, respectively. © 2016 Alden D.

Quantification of freshly severed stipes suggested that the 'warm water' kelp L. ochroleuca was more susceptible to storm damage than L. hyperborea. Overall, kelp canopies were highly resistant to storm disturbance because of the low vulnerability of L. hyperborea to intense wave action.

Conventional fuels vacuum towers produce products for downstream cracking and have reasonable energy efficiency. However, less common configurations may allow for either diesel recovery more effective energy recovery or both. Dieselization of the European auto fleet has shifted world-wide refining patterns. In all regions, diesel now often makes up the most valuable product from the refinery. The most profitable diesel is the diesel already in the crude oil. Adept molecule management to recover that diesel maximizes refinery profits. Current energy prices do not favor intensive investment for direct energy savings. Nevertheless, energy savings are becoming more important. This is mainly driven by regulatory pressure from: • Energy intensity regulations. • Avoiding emissions (nitrous oxides and others). Dieselization and energy recovery combine to focus attention on the crude vacuum unit. Significant diesel remains in most vacuum tower feeds. Many refiners find recovering diesel as a vacuum tower product attractive. Diesel recovery also changes temperatures in the vacuum unit, this may change heat recovery. Understanding how diesel recovery and temperature levels interact is critical to evaluating both new units and revamping existing units. Multiple vacuum tower configurations can allow the top vacuum tower product to meet a diesel boiling range specification. Results are shown for running a typical crude oil for the most common configuration changes. These include: • Additional pumparounds for heat recovery improvement. Diesel recovery with internal fractionation with net top-bottom reflux. Diesel recovery with internal fractionation with zero top-bottom reflux. Diesel recovery with no internal fractionation. The results show that: • Increased fractionation will increase diesel yields. • Increased fractionation reduces pumparound temperatures and makes heat recovery more expensive (more capital) or less efficient (less heat recovered). The more diesel the unit produces, the more difficult the heat integration. Trade-offs for adding diesel recovery to both existing plants and to new units must balance the value of diesel recovery against capital costs, yields, and energy recovery. © 2016 Andrew W. Sloley.

Within the developed societies female’s contribution tent to be less than male’s on average, due to different social roles but also to different environmental consciousness and behaviour. E.g. women have different consumption habits (use of public transport, walking or cycling trips) and are more likely to support greenhouse gas emissions reduction policies related (support of recycling and energy efficiency initiatives). In Europe, direct and indirect energy consumption tend to be higher among male than female habitants a fact that is independent of income and age, approximately 39 % higher in Germany and 22 % higher in Sweden. Worldwide, it is declared that money paid to females is more mainly consumed on family needs, e.g. food and clothing, while money paid to males is more likely to be consumed on leisure, energy-intensive goods that cause high emissions. Thus, a greater proportion of an average man's carbon footprint is due to leisure than an average woman’s. Last but not least, women are more sensitive to extreme weather conditions, such as floods and heatwaves and more likely to experience fuel poverty due to income inequalities. At the same time, the global economic system is male dominated and while women have an increasingly significant role in the economic system that led to global warming, they are underpresented in the decision making, industries and organisations focused in the environmental (climate change, transport and energy) sector. Female often surpass the male participation in voluntary environmental campaigning actions, accounting for approximately two thirds in Europe. The average proportion of women in national ministries responsible for the environment, transport and energy, by level of authority in the EU-27 is extremely low, reaching the 25.6 % in 2012 according to data generated from the European Institute for Gender Equality. The aim of the current study is to review the current conditions in Europe and Greece and identify the gaps, if any, of women’s involvement in climate change and global warming decision making. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Burning; Europe; Mercury; Migration; Transportation","Air quality; Carbon footprint; Combustion; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leisure; Mercury (metal); Transportation; Consumption habit; Environmental campaigning; Europe; Extreme weather conditions; Global warming and climate changes; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Migration; Urban environments; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044462196

The recorded observations on climate change is in line with the projected increase of the average annual temperature in Europe between 2 and 4 °C until the end of the century, as well as with the change of rainfall patterns and the prevalence of drier conditions in the summer months in the Mediterranean area and wetter winters in the Nordic countries. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves and floods are expected to increase in the coming years. The socioeconomic impacts of climate change in urban areas are also very important. Demographic changes, such as the increase of the average life expectancy and the intense urbanization will increase the percentage of people who are vulnerable to conditions of high temperature and heat waves, with negative effects on health, productivity, social life and use of open public spaces. Furthermore, high temperatures can cause problems in fields such as transport, energy and water supply, along with an indirect effect on agriculture, tourism, urban microclimate and air quality. The current paper attempts to analyze the ambient air temperature in Athens and Thessaloniki for 30 years, namely the period 1983–2012, in order to explore trends in the two largest Greek cities. Descriptive statistics such as average minimum, average maximum and average monthly values of dry-bulb temperature, minimum, average and maximum daily temperature values of the three decades (80s, 90s and 00s) and the cumulative frequency of hourly temperatures per decade, were calculated, analyzed and presented. The number of days with maximum temperature above 25 °C (summer day) and equal or greater than 35 °C, in accordance with internationally agreed criteria and indicators, were also calculated. Likewise, long periods with daily maximum temperature above 35 °C were recorded and presented. The analysis was based on hourly measurements of two meteorological stations, of the National Observatory of Athens and the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, for the relevant period. The results prove a statistically significant raising trend in temperature values in the studied areas from decade to decade, in addition to the statistically significant increase in the number of days with average above 25 °C and with a maximum equal or greater than 35 °C. The conclusions drawn are particularly useful for planning and implementing policies of adaptation to climate change in different sectors in favour of environment protection and human well-being. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Ambient air temperature; Climate change; Extreme temperatures; Temperature cumulative frequency","Agricultural robots; Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Extreme weather; Tourism; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Water supply; Adaptation to climate changes; Ambient air temperature; Average life expectancy; Criteria and indicators; Cumulative frequencies; Descriptive statistics; Environment protection; Extreme temperatures; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029357214

Modern diesel engine injection system is under strict requirements to fulfil the purpose to not only reduce the fuel consumption but also the exhaust emissions and noise levels. The Common Rail injection system gives engine developers the possibility to reduce both exhaust emissions and engine noise. The Common Rail (CR) fuel injection system allows accurately regulatingof the fuel injection rate, the rate of fuel discharge from the nozzle holes, distribution and timing with the engine operating within a wide range of loads and speeds. The CR fuel injection system with piezo or electromagnetic nozzles speeds up the nozzle opening and closing, allowing adjusting the injection pressure, injection rate and atomization characteristics. This paper presents numerical modelling of injection characteristics in a diesel engine. The numerical model was performed by using AVL BOOST Hydsim fluid dynamic simulation. The experiment results were compared with the numerical ones. The injection characteristics were measured and analysed using the injection rate measuring system. The injection rate, injection quantity per cycle, injection delay, and injection duration were analysed across a range of injection pressure and injection energizing time. The comparison of the results shows that the numerical model is reliable and the results of the numerical model are close to the experimental test results.","Common rail fuel injection; Injection rate characteristics; Numerical simulation","Computer simulation; Diesel engines; Electric discharges; Engines; Fluid dynamics; Fuel injection; Fuels; Ignition; Nozzles; Regional planning; Atomization characteristics; Combustible mixture; Common rail fuel injection; Common rail injection system; Diesel engine injection systems; Fuel injection systems; Injection durations; Injection rates; Numerical models; alternative fuel; diesel engine; electromagnetic method; energy use; exhaust emission; fuel; fuel consumption; numerical model; railway; simulation; software",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976566074

Sulphur recovery facilities are necessary to meet emissions regulations and are therefore often viewed as a cost of production. However, the sulphur plant is normally a net energy exporter, providing a frequently overlooked benefit to the energy balance of the processing complex. This is because the Claus reaction, which is employed to convert H2S to elemental sulphur, is exothermic, and the waste heat from the process can be recovered as HP and LP steam. This paper will explore the energy benefits of various sulphur recovery technologies. Benchmark key performance indicators (KPIs) will be provided as guidance to operators on how their sulphur recovery facilities should be performing, from an energy efficiency perspective. A Case Study for a sulphur recovery facility in a large sour gas plant will be presented and compared to the Benchmark Plant KPIs. Options for improving energy efficiency will be investigated. In 2016 the Middle East became the world's largest sulphur producing region. Current UAE sulphur production is approximately 19,000 MTPD (7 MMTPA), equivalent to roughly 11% of global production. The total power export from UAE sulphur recovery facilities should be in the range of 250 MW, which would be extremely beneficial for supplementing the power requirements of the sour gas processing facilities in which they are installed. However, certain factors may be eroding these energy benefits, some of which may be correctable via operational changes, while others may require hardware modifications. Within the next decade, UAE sulphur production could double, which presents the possibility for producing around 500 MW of power from all SRUs in the country. This figure could increase if technologies which maximize energy efficiency are employed and best operating practices are followed.",,"Benchmarking; Gas industry; Recovery; Sour gas; Sulfur; Waste heat; Cost of productions; Emissions regulations; Hardware modifications; Key performance indicators; Oil and Gas Industry; Operating practices; Operational changes; Power requirement; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010789959

(Part of ROSEN Group), Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, United Kingdom","Whilst there is extensive industry experience of under pressure welding onto operational natural gas and liquid pipelines, there is limited experience for Carbon Dioxide (CO2) pipelines, either in the gaseous or dense phase. National Grid has performed a detailed research program to investigate if existing natural gas industry under pressure welding procedures are applicable to CO2 pipelines, or if new specific guidance is required. At IPC 2014 a paper was presented (IPC2014-33223) that dealt with the results from one part of a comprehensive trial program, which defined the cooling time from 250 °C to 150 °C (T250-150) in CO2 pipelines and compared them to the typical decay times for natural gas pipelines. The results from this part of the work identified that maintaining the pre-heat using the established guidance in T/SP/P/9 during under pressure welding on dense phase CO2 pipelines would be very difficult, leading to potential operational issues.1 The previous paper gave a brief summary of the effect that cooling time had on the mechanical properties. The aim of this paper is to present the findings of the T800-500 weld decay trials in more detail including the full testing programme, detailing the affect that variables such as CO2 phase, CO2 flow velocity and the welding parameters had on the weld and heat affected zone (HAZ) hardness. The main finding is that although there is an indication that a higher cooling rate measured in the weld pool (characterized by the cooling time from 800 °C to 500 °C) leads to increased hardness in the HAZ region, there are no clear correlations. No hardness values were recorded that were considered unacceptable, even for the dense phase CO2 case which delivered the fastest cooling time. A significant finding was the requirement for controlling the buttering run procedure. A discussion of the critical aspects, including the link between weld cooling time and hardness, is presented with guidance on how this essential variables need to be controlled. The paper is aimed at technical, safety and operational staff with CO2 pipeline operators. Read in conjunction, this paper and the previous IPC paper form a comprehensive review of this critical work that is contributing to the development of dense phase CO2 transportation pipelines and will facilitate the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)1 projects which is a critical part of the transition to a low carbon economy. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"C (programming language); Carbon capture; Cooling; Flow velocity; Gas industry; Hardness; Heat affected zone; Mechanical properties; Natural gas; Natural gas pipelines; Pipelines; Pressure welding; Renewable energy resources; Welding; Welds; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Industry experience; Low carbon economy; Operational staff; Pipeline operator; Transportation pipelines; Welding parameters; Welding procedures; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996836196

Seedlings were cultivated for 4 weeks under optimal or limiting water supply (respectively, 100% and 25% of field capacity, FC). After 2 weeks of treatment, a lot of stressed plants were rehydrated to 100% FC. In the Control, B. vulgaris was more productive than B. macrocarpa, whereas Enfidha provenance showed the highest biomass production (1.6- and 3-fold compared with B. vulgaris and Soliman, respectively), under water deficit stress. A partial re-establishment of growth occurred in both species upon recovery at 100% FC. The sensitivity of B. vulgaris and Soliman provenance to drought was associated with the disturbance of leaf water status and the sharp decrease in net CO2 assimilation (-66% and -82% as compared with the Control, respectively). On the contrary, the better behaviour of Enfidha provenance was related to its better photosynthetic capacity and leaf relative water content, along with a higher accumulation of amino acids (proline, glycine, and glutamine) implied in the osmotic adjustment. Leaf hexose concentration increased significantly under drought stress in both species whereas leaf sucrose concentration declined only in drought-stressed B. vulgaris and Soliman provenance. Leaf glutamate dehydrogenase activity increased under water deficit in both species despite to a higher extent in B. vulgaris. As glutamate dehydrogenase is implied in catabolism of glutamate to oxoglutarate, it might contribute to provide stressed plants with carbon skeletons. Enfidha provenance of the spontaneous species B. macrocarpa could be used in the marginal arid ecosystems in order to limit the deficit in fodder and to improve the pastoral value of these regions. In addition, this species could serve as a source of genes for genetic improvement to water deficit stress. © 2016 CSIRO.","amino acid; nitrogen metabolism; photosynthesis; soluble sugars; water statue.","amino acid; comparative study; drought stress; growth; metabolism; nitrogen; photosynthesis; physiological response; phytochemistry; root vegetable; sugar; water stress; wild population; Tunisia; Beta procumbens; Beta vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973349097

Community energy schemes are a popular policy targeted to reduce a country's carbon emissions but the effect they have on energy use depends on whether people can work together as a community. We often find ourselves caught in a dilemma: if others are not doing their bit, why should I? In our experiment, participants (N = 118) were matched in groups of 10 to play in a collective-risk game framed as a community energy purchase scheme. They made only one decision about energy use for their virtual household a day, while a full round of the game lasted 1 week in real time. All decisions were entered via personal phone or a home computer. If in the end of the week the group exceeded a pre-paid threshold of energy use all group members would share a fine. Each day participants received feedback about decisions of their group partners, and in some groups the feedback was manipulated as high (unfair condition) or low (fair condition) use. High average group use created individual risk for participants to be penalized in the end of the week, even if they did not use much themselves. We found that under the risk of having to pay a fine, participants stayed significantly below the fair-share threshold regardless of unfair behavior of others. On the contrary, they significantly decreased their consumption toward the end of the game. Seeing that others are doing their bit - using a fair-share - encouraged people to take advantage of the situation: those who played against fair confederates did not follow the normative behavior but conversely, increased their consumption over the course of the game. These opportunistic strategies were demonstrated by impulsive participants who were also low in punishment sensitivity. We discuss the findings in the light of policy research as well as literature on cooperation and prosocial behavior. © 2016 Skatova, Bedwell and Kuper-Smith.","Collective purchasing; Collective-risk social dilemma; Community energy; Cooperation; Environmental behaviour; Impulsivity; Public good; Punishment sensitivity","Climate change; Energy utilization; Community energy; Cooperation; Environmental behaviour; Impulsivity; Public goods; Punishment sensitivity; Social dilemmas; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038960726

These advanced systems are supplanting a fraction of traditional ammonia systems as well as the raft of R22 refrigerated sites across the world that will all need to be replaced by 2030 in developing countries and by 2020 in developed countries. This growing trend for advanced natural refrigerant-based solutions is evident in all major regions, as shecco's on-going data collection has already found that there are already 115 CO2-based industrial refrigeration plants in North America, 34 such installations in China, more than 300 NH3/CO2 installations in Japan and over 150 CO2 transcritical industrial installations in Europe.

This paper addresses the impacts of improperly managed gas disposal systems including lost revenue potential as well as the contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. It is tailored to the energy industry of Trinidad and Tobago which aims to achieve a reduction in overall emissions by 15% by 2030 from BAU (Business As Usual baseline) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The study highlights and evaluates the major opportunities for emissions reduction including, but not limited to, conversion from cold vents to flares, implementation of hybrid flare-vent systems, conversion from natural gas to inert gas purge systems and proper monitoring and optimization of flaring rates. Supporting calculations and case studies are based on actual and theoretical data (from mass balances or otherwise) from local oil and gas operators. The lack of reliable measurement data and trends for flare volumes was indicative of an industry that has grown callous to wastefulness. Findings revealed that significant value can be extracted through modest monitoring improvement projects, optimization of existing operations and increased operator conscientiousness.

In order to be usable, the generated datasets must accurately reproduce the spatiotemporal features of the coarse-scale LST time series with greater spatial detail. This work concerns this issue and exploits the high temporal resolution of the data to address it. Specifically, it assesses the accuracy, correct pattern formation and the spatiotemporal inter-relationships of an urban three-month-long downscaled geostationary LST time series. The results suggest that the downscaling process operated in a consistent manner and preserved the radiometry of the original data. The exploitation of the data inter-relationships for evaluation purposes revealed that the downscaled time series reproduced the smooth diurnal cycle, but the autocorrelation of the downscaled data was higher than the original coarse-scale data. Overall, the evaluation process showed that the generation of high spatiotemporal LST data for urban areas is very challenging, and to deem it successful, it is mandatory to assess the temporal evolution of the urban thermal patterns. The results suggest that the proposed tests can facilitate the evaluation process. © 2016 by the authors.","Diurnal evolution; Evaluation; Hotspots; Land surface temperature; LST downscaling; MODIS; MSG-SEVIRI; Thermal remote sensing; Urban heat island","Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Time series; Diurnal evolution; Down-scaling; Evaluation; Hotspots; Land surface temperature; MODIS; MSG-SEVIRI; Thermal remote sensing; Urban heat island; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971671457

Compressed Natural gas (CNG) has been widely used in India to address the menace of pollution from commercial vehicles in cities like Delhi. Hydrogen blended compressed natural gas (HCNG) as a fuel has potential for further reducing harmful emissions and greenhouse gases. Enriching hydrogen in CNG improves combustion characteristic of CNG and reduces carbonyl emissions. Due to growing concerns over un-regulated emissions and their effect on human health, it is imperative to estimate un-regulated emissions from such alternatives for assessing overall impact of such fuels. Presently world over, emission legislations mainly addresses pollutants like CO, HC, NOx, CH4, NH3, PM etc. Relatively higher quantity in exhaust qualifies these pollutants to be monitored and controlled. But as the consumption of alternative fuels becomes comparable to that of the liquid fuels, other unregulated emissions like Methanol (CH3OH), Ethanol (C2H5OH), Formaldehyde (HCHO), Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), Formic Acid (HCOOH), Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), Propene (C3H8), Ethylene (C2H4), Ethyne (C2H2) Benzene (C6H6), 1,3-Butadiene (1,3-C4H6), Toluene (C7H8), Butene (C4H8) etc. become significant. This paper presents the study of unregulated emissions on a heavy duty six cylinder engine used in the transport buses with CNG and HCNG as fuels. A transient engine dynamometer set up was used along with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Gas Analyzer (FTIR) for measuring unregulated emissions. It was observed from the test results that regulated emissions like CO, NO, HC and PM are considerably reduced with HCNG fuel. Also, unregulated emissions like Formic Acid (HCOOH), Propane (C3H8), Ethylene (C2H4), Ethyne (C2H2), Benzene (C6H6), 1,3-Butadiene (1,3-C4H6), Toluene (C7H8) and Butene (C4H8) are significantly reduced with HCNG fuel. Whereas, there is slight increase in Methanol (CH3OH), Ethanol (C2H5OH), Formaldehyde (HCHO) and Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) with HCNG. It can be inferred from the study that HCNG has reduced significant amount of unregulated emissions and it is the most promising fuel for transport sector in future. Beside this it is also observed that with HCNG Fuel, there is increase in NH3 and NO2 which create favorable condition for effective working of exhaust after treatment device like selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for Euro VI compliant vehicles.

Design/methodology/approach: Limitation on availability of inputs is represented in the form of constant sum of inputs (CSOI) constraint. The amount of excess input of an inefficient decision-making unit (DMU) is redistributed among other DMUs in such a way so that there is no reduction in their efficiency. DEA models have been developed to design the optimum strategy to reallocate the excess input. Findings: The authors have developed the method for reallocating the excess input among DMUs while under CSOI constraint and parameter weight restrictions. It has been shown that in this work to improve the efficiency of an inefficient DMU one needs the cooperation of selected few DMUs. The working of the models and results have been shown through a case study on carbon dioxide emissions of 32 countries. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of the study is that only one DMU can expect to benefit from the application of these methods at any given time. Practical implications: Results of the paper are useful in situations when decision maker is exploring the possibility of transferring the excess resources from underperforming DMUs to the other DMUs to improve the performance. Originality/value: This strategy of reallocation of excess input will be very useful in situations when decision maker is exploring the possibility of transferring the excess resources from underperforming DMUs to the other DMUs to improve the performance. Unlike the existing works on efficiency improvement under CSOI, this work seeks to address the issue of efficiency improvement when the input/output parameter weights are also restricted. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Assurance region; Data envelopment analysis; DEA; Efficiency; Input/output analysis; Performance evaluation; Performance measurement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988945076

TOC avoids local (sub) optimization and ensures that actions are aligned with “end-to-end” process performance. When a Smelter TOC operating strategy is cascaded down to the Carbon Plant, and then to the Paste Plant, it provides context for how to best approach Paste Plant operating and maintenance activities. In addition to defining the most appropriate strategy, TOC principles and tools can be applied to activities such as routine maintenance and larger non-routine maintenance projects. For example, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) is a TOC technique that increases the speed and quality of these activities and can increase asset reliability and available run time, giving lower cost production runs and greater predictability. This paper describes the cascading of TOC thinking and strategies down through a Smelter, leading to an example of how CCPM can be applied to a Carbon Plant maintenance project. © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society 2016.","Constraint; Critical chain; Project buffer; Protective capacity","Chains; Cost reduction; Costs; Decision theory; Maintenance; Productivity; Project management; Constraint; Critical chain; Critical Chain Project Management; Maintenance activity; Project buffers; Protective capacity; Routine maintenance; Theory of constraint; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042498564

Tropical peat soils are the result of thousands of years of dead biomass accumulation, and when burned are globally significant net sources of carbon emissions. The El Nino year of 2015 saw huge areas of Indonesia affected by tropical peatland fires, more so than any year since 1997. However, the Depth of Burn (DoB) of these 2015 fires has not been assessed, and indeed has only previously been assessed in few tropical peatland burns in Kalimantan. Therefore, DoB remains arguably the largest uncertainty when undertaking fire emissions calculations in these tropical peatland environments. We apply a SfM photogrammetric methodology to map this DoB metric, and also investigate combustion heterogeneity using orthomosaic photography collected using the UAV system. We supplement this information with pre-burn airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, reducing uncertainty by estimating pre-burn soil height more accurately than from interpolation of adjacent unburned areas alone. Our pre-and post-fire Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) show accuracies of 0.04 and 0.05 m (root-mean-square error, RMSE) respectively, compared to ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys. Our final DoB map of a 5.2 ha degraded peat swamp forest area neighboring Berbak National Park (Sumatra, Indonesia) shows burn depths extending from close to zero to over 1 m, with a mean (±1σ) DoB of 0.23 ± 0.19 m. This lies well within the range found by the few other studies available (on Kalimantan; none are available on Sumatra). Our combustion heterogeneity analysis suggests the deepest burns, which extend to 1.3 m, occur around tree roots. We use these DoB data within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default equation for fire emissions to estimate mean carbon emissions as 134 ± 29 t·C·ha-1 for this peatland fire, which is in an area that had not had a recorded fire previously. This is amongst the highest per unit area fuel consumption anywhere in the world for landscape fires. Our approach provides significant uncertainty reductions in such emissions calculations via the reduction in DoB uncertainty, and by using the UAV SfM approach this is accomplished at a fraction of the cost of airborne LiDAR-albeit over limited sized areas at present. Deploying this approach at locations across Indonesia, sampling a variety of fire-affected landscapes, would provide new and important DoB statistics for producing optimized carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates from peatland fires. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Carbon emissions; Depth of burn (DoB); Indonesia; Light detection and ranging (LiDAR); Peat fire; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+); Structure from motion (SfM); Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Climate change; Combustion; Deforestation; Fires; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global positioning system; Greenhouse gases; Importance sampling; Mean square error; Peat; Photogrammetry; Sampling; Soil pollution; Soils; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wetlands; Carbon emissions; Depth of burn (DoB); Forest degradation; Indonesia; Light detection and ranging; Structure from motion; Optical radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002943961

Methods: The research was conducted through a comprehensive review of available secondary data and interviewing key informants in various national organizations involved in climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. Results: Climate change-related health problems, such as mortality and morbidity due to floods and heat waves, vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases, meningitis, and air pollution-related respiratory diseases are increasing in Ethiopia. Sensitive systems such as agriculture, health, and water have been affected, and the effects of climate change will continue to magnify without the right adaptation and mitigation measures. Currently, research on climate change and health is not adequately developed in Ethiopia. Research and other activities appear to be fragmented and uncoordinated. As a result, very few spatially detailed and methodologically consistent studies have been made to assess the impact of climate in the country. There has often been a lack of sufficient collaboration among organizations on the planning and execution of climate change and health activities, and the lack of trained professionals who can perform climate change and health-related research activities at various levels. Conclusion: Firstly, there is a lack of organized structure in the various organizations. Secondly, there is inadequate level of inter-sectoral collaboration and poor coordination and communication among different stakeholders. Thirdly, there are no reliable policy guidelines and programs among organizations, agencies and offices that target climate change and health. Fourth, the existing policies fail to consider the gender and community-related dimensions of climate change. Fifth, the monitoring and evaluation efforts exerted on climate change and health activities are not strong enough to address the climate change and health issues in the country.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009512548

In this respect, cities need to cope with these new threats and get prepared. One way of doing this is to develop climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, focusing on local vulnerabilities in relation to the current societal development needs and adaptation options. There are many recent initiatives and examples for climate change adaptation strategies and plans for large cities, but only a few examples for small and medium-size cities. This paper investigates the mid-(2021–2050) and far-future (2071–2100) climate change signals in an urban area located in northern Romania (Baia Mare town), with around 200,000 inhabitants, exploring the results of some CORDEX GCMs under the new IPCC RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The study analyzes these signals in relation to the local awareness of key institutional stakeholders, as well as to the current social and economic constraints towards considering the climate change adaptation. The findings, based on a survey, highlight how the local authorities perceive and include climate change aspects in their activities as an important step towards real implementation of specific climate-based decisions, as well as their needs in terms of climate information and data. The study provides useful scientific insights about future climate and expected impacts in the Baia Mare Urban System to stakeholders, which could increase their awareness and knowledge in terms of climate change. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Awareness; Baia Mare town; Climate change adaptation; Urban area",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071369992

A global market forecast (2015-2034) from Airbus [1], depicts an average growth rate of 4.6% per year. Air traffic is forecasted to double in the next 15 years. It is expected, to triple in the next 20 years, according to the speech given by RRUK CEO during the Aerodays 2015 in London [2]. This high level of growth in demand for air travel represents huge opportunities as well as significant challenges for the aerospace industry. Research and Technology through collaborative European projects addresses the environmental penalties of air traffic. Europe's aviation industry therefore faces a huge challenge to satisfy the demand whilst guaranteeing competitiveness, safety and more environmentally friendly air travel. Innovative engine configurations consequently need to be investigated in order to reduce significantly the pollutant emissions (15 to 20% for fuel consumption and CO2 and 80% reduction for NOx). Such reductions can only be achieved by considering innovative components that could be integrated and optimized in new engine configurations. In response to the above demands, aero-engine manufacturers are constantly aiming to improve gas turbine efficiency for two main reasons: To reduce environmental impact and to minimize operating costs. The E-BREAK project is aimed at the development of generic enabling technologies needed to address the challenges for future engines with higher overall pressure ratios (OPR) and bypass ratio (BPR). These technologies are developed at subsystem and component level and validated in test rigs which are equivalent to Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 5. The utility of the developed technologies are assessed using four standard study powerplants. These are turboshaft, regional turbofan, mid-size open rotor, and large turbofan, covering most of the expected future commercial aero-engine market. This article describes the technical approach followed in E-BREAK for the various technologies being investigated, these are: Advanced sealing to reduce oil and air leakages Variability control to ensure stability of thermodynamic cycle High temperature resistant material and abradables to prevent fast degradation at high temperatures Light material to prevent significant mass increase Health monitoring system to anticipate sub-systems degradation The envisaged outcomes from E-BREAK are enablers to other EUfunded research projects focused on module maturation progress, such as LEMCOTEC dealing with high OPR modules and ENOVAL dealing with high BPR LP components. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Accident prevention; Aerospace industry; Air transportation; Aircraft engines; Blowers; Bypass ratio; Carbon dioxide; Civil aviation; Commerce; Competition; Engines; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Fighter aircraft; Gas turbines; International trade; Operating costs; Thermodynamic properties; Turbomachinery; Aero engine manufacturers; Enabling technologies; Engine configuration; Environmental Penalties; Gas turbine efficiency; Health monitoring system; High-temperature resistant; Overall pressure ratios; Marine engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991383988

CO2-WAG consists of the alternated injection of CO2 and water in the reservoir for tertiary oil recovery. However, this process may lead to the enhanced deposition of CaCO3 in production wells. This may occur since, in a CO2-WAG scheme, CO2 dissolves in the water slug causing a decrease in the pH. At lower pH levels, carbonate rock is dissolved causing an increase in the carbon and calcium content in the water slug. As fluids are later produced, the operating pressure is reduced and dissolved CO2 is evolved from solution, causing an increase in the pH. At these less acidic pH levels, CaCO3 may become oversaturated and precipitate. In order to address each process involved in CaCO3 formation, an integrated modelling approach between aqueous scale prediction modelling, Vapour-Liquid Equilibria (VLE) modelling and reservoir modelling is proposed. In particular, acid equilibria and precipitation reactions coupled with the Pitzer equations are used to build the scale prediction model. The facility to calculate CaCO3 co-precipitation with other minerals, such as BaSO4, FeCO3, FeS, etc., is also introduced. Five different equations of state (namely SRK, PR, PRSV, PT and VPT) are used in VLE calculations to model the solubility of CO2 (or a mixture of CO2, H2S and CH4) in brine. To model the reactive flows in the reservoir, the advection-diffusion equation is coupled with the scale precipitation equations. The reactive transport model addresses carbonate rock-brine interactions and fluid flow through a porous medium. Once integrated in one single model, these equations have been shown to address all steps in CaCO3 formation relevant for CO2-WAG, i.e., the geochemical processes taking place in the reservoir and at the production wells, thus capturing the full dimension of the scaling problem. In addition, the proposed model has been successfully validated with experimental data on the injection of seawater adjusted to various pH levels into a CaCO3 packed column. The measured effluent pH levels and calcium concentrations were used to validate the model.

Particulate Matter are suspended particles which are present in the air, these particles when inhaled can lead to negative health effects. Statistical models are estimated using daily data from EPA’s Air Quality System which measures particle pollution (PM10) as well as air quality (AQI). Estimates using PM10 measurements and AQI reveal similar outcomes, although the Air Quality Index model has a better fit. Significantly higher levels of pollution are observed on Super Bowl Sunday while accounting for a variety of confounding factors. The concentration of pollution varies by distance from the stadium hosting the event, it would be beneficial for future research to have more active monitoring stations on the day of mega-events such as the Super Bowl in order to increase the ability to analyses and understand the environmental consequences of hosting the event. © 2016, ASERS Publishing House.

Enhanced nutrient removal requires the right amount of carbon to be present at the right process area at the right time and in the right form, ideally balanced with supplying carbon to solids stream energy recovery systems. Diurnal patterns of secondary influent nitrogen and carbon can be offset enough to create significant differences in the C:N ratio from one time of day to another, contributing to carbon limitations in nutrient removal processes. Online process monitoring of secondary influent total organic carbon (TOC) and ammonia at the city’s WWTF have unveiled these impactful fluctuations, previously masked by daily composite sampling. Understanding the dynamics of process loading presents opportunities for enhancements in internal carbon management, reductions in external carbon dosing, and improved nutrient removal efficiency. TOC is a faster, easier, and more accurate alternative to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The City of Boulder (city) has proposed the inclusion of its long-term site-specific correlations between BOD and TOC and between carbonaceous BOD (cBOD) and TOC in the renewal of its Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) permit with the purpose of allowing the city to use linear regression equations from these correlations to convert TOC data into BOD and cBOD data.

These small carbon cages are important in designing synthesized nano structures. In order to use the fullerenes in the nano structures, functionalizing the surface of these compounds may be required. Considering this fact, many attempts have been already taken to find certain ways to functionalize these substances. Methods: Several different geometries were assumed for each species in order to be used as input files, followed by optimization to give the most possible states. The structures corresponding to the reactants, TS, and product were optimized and the electronic structures and harmonic vibrational frequencies of all stationary points along the reaction pathway were calculated. Results: The present research introduces an ultra-fast way for the functionalization of C20 fullerene via its diels-Alder reaction with 1,3-butadiene. The reaction proceeds via a transition state with a relatively high asynchronous mechanism. This method facilitates the attachment of C20 fullerene and its derivatives to chemical species with a 1,3-diene functional group, and therefore it could provide a suitable approach in synthesizing some of the nano-sized molecules, devices or machines. Conclusion: The present way seems to be faster than other methods which have been already reported on the functionalization of C20 fullerene. The results showed that at least in this case, pericyclic reaction could carry out the functionalization of this small carbon cage with no need to a solvent engagement or any other accelerating agents such as catalysts, light or heat.","1,3-butadiene; C20 fullerene; diels-Alder; functionalization; nano-sized molecules; ultra-fast reaction.",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951813856

The model performance for LRT and local pollution (LP) of PM2.5 was evaluated to identify the model processes that need to be improved. CMAQ well simulated temporal and spatial variation patterns of PM2.5 but underestimated the concentration level by 15% on average. The contribution of LRT was estimated from the difference between the baseline simulation case and a zero-emission case for anthropogenic emissions in the continent. The estimated LRT contribution to PM2.5 was 50% on average and generally higher in the western areas of Japan (closer to the continent). Days that were dominantly affected by LRT or LP were determined based on the contribution of LRT to sulfate, which was fairly well simulated and strongly affected by LRT among major PM2.5 components. The underestimation of PM2.5 was larger in LP days (by 26% on average) than LRT days (by 10% on average). Therefore, it is essential to improve local emissions, formation, and loss processes of precursors and PM2.5 in Japan. © 2016 Hikari Shimadera et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979919040

The present article presents the spatial pattern of major environmental risk (in terms of climate disasters) of the world at medium-resolution, and ranks all countries and regions. The result indicates that the most populated countries (China and India) and major economies (United States, China, and Japan) are of the highest environmental risks. Climatic risk is a type of complicated risk. Coping with environment risks requires to develop the consilience mode, by deeply involving the government, enterprises, communities and families to achieve consensus of wills and coordination of actions (""Ning Xin Ju Li"" in Chinese saying), and thorough understanding of the integrated multi-element disaster system consisting of hazard, environment and exposed units. The consilience mode is a synthesis of multi-scale adaptation (global, regional, country and local), multi-process mitigation (prevention, relief, response and relocation), and multi-measure prevention structural, non-structural, and integrated structural and non-structural. Simulation results confirm that the consilience mode for integrated risk governance can substantially improve the efficiency and benefit of disaster prevention and mitigation resources use. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

Although climate change is not expected to favour invasive plants in every case, in Aotearoa-New Zealand a large pool of potential new weeds already exists and this country is predicted to be an ‘invasion hotspot’ under climate change. In particular, ornamental garden plants originating from warmer native ranges are likely to naturalise and become invasive when climatic constraints are lifted. This forum article synthesises research on potential synergistic effects of plant invasion and climate change and discusses the general implications for management of weeds under climate change in New Zealand. A comprehensive assessment of three recently naturalised subtropical species (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana, Psidium guajava and Schefflera actinophylla) illustrates the potential risk of invasions by such species arising with climate change. Despite two recent Department of Conservation reports giving policy recommendations for conserving biodiversity under climate change, in which the potential of new weeds was highlighted as one of the most imminent threats, very little action has been taken. We argue that climate change needs to be accounted for in current weed management policies. Specifically, prediction of potential new weeds needs to be improved, considering up-to-date research and using best-practice modelling tools. Better surveillance for new infestations through spatial prioritisation by habitat suitability and use of well-managed citizen science projects is required. Education campaigns to raise awareness of climate change effects and new weed threats are essential. With an ever-increasing number of potential weeds but limited resources available, it is crucial that more preventative management is taken. Conservation managers, scientists and the general public need to combine their efforts to future-proof New Zealand weed management for the effects of climate change. © 2016, New Zealand Ecological Society.

In order to utilise the capability of renewable resources to follow the load variations, the proposed matching approach is to restrict the output of renewable generators by a load-related bound in each dispatch time period. The dispatch problem is formulated to minimise the system cost comprising fuel, emission, and regulation costs as well as renewable power curtailment penalty. Compared with the traditional approach of treating renewable resources as negative loads, the proposed matching approach can significantly reduce the system cost by including the dynamic control of renewable power output. Moreover, the multi-objective function provides a way to study the trade-off among different costs in power systems with renewable resources. Solution is obtained by transforming the optimisation problem into its equivalent form and using local search algorithms. Simulations are implemented on a specific isolated power system with four generators to demonstrate the advantage of proposed approach.

As part of DOE's Office of Fossil Energy, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) implements research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) programs that address the challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To meet these challenges, NETL evaluates advanced power cycles that will maximize system efficiency and performance, while minimizing CO2 emissions and the costs of CCS. NETL's Hydrogen Turbine Program has sponsored numerous R&amp;D projects in support of Advanced Hydrogen Turbines (AHT). Turbine systems and components targeted for development include combustor technology, materials research, enhanced cooling technology, coatings development, and more. The R&amp;D builds on existing gas turbine technologies and is intended to develop and test the component technologies and subsystems needed to validate the ability to meet the Turbine Program goals. These technologies are key components of AHTs, which enable overall plant efficiency and cost of electricity (COE) improvements relative to an F-frame turbinebased Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) reference plant equipped with carbon capture (today's state-ofthe-art). This work has also provided the basis for estimating future IGCC plant performance based on a Transformational Hydrogen Turbine (THT) with a higher turbine inlet temperature, enhanced material capabilities, reduced air cooling and leakage, and higher pressure ratios than the AHT. IGCC cases from using system-level AHT and THT gas turbine models were developed for comparisons with an Fframe turbine-based IGCC reference case and for an IGCC pathway study. The IGCC pathway is presented in which the reference case (i.e. includes F-frame turbine) is sequentiallymodified through the incorporation of advanced technologies. Advanced technologies are considered to be either 2nd Generation or Transformational, if they are anticipated to be ready for demonstration by 2025 and 2030, respectively. The current results included the THT, additional potential transformational technologies related to IGCC plant sections (e.g. air separation, gasification, gas cleanup, carbon capture, NOx reduction) are being considered by NETL and are topics for inclusion in future reports.

While it is renowned as a reliable drilling technique tackling operational problems such as reduced Non Productive Time (NPT) and eliminating induced damage resulting from conventional drilling practice, modern Under-Balanced Drilling (UBD) applications have seen significant advancement enabling efficient reservoir re-development. Following the promising results and significant learnings yielded from the UBD pilots executed in onshore Abu Dhabi oil fields, wider application of UBD was considered for productivity enhancement in tight reservoir units in addition to maximizing reservoir knowledge through inflow data analysis while drilling. Consequently, a UBD campaign commenced by drilling two wells (X1 and X2) located in a challenging multi-layered tight reservoir with complex heterogeneities, including vertical/lateral permeability contrast and presence of faults/fractures. Overbalanced drilling in these zones causes formation damage resulting in limited contributing intervals within long horizontal drains, affecting communication and conformance between injectors and producers. Conventional stimulation techniques have proved inefficient in restoring well productivity/injectivity. The wells were drilled in stepping down trajectory maximizing reservoir contact and homogenizing inflow per subunit, with the laterals planned to cross existing reservoir features in order to evaluate their impact on flow contribution. Real time flow data were interpreted using service providers proprietary tool of Rate Transient Reservoir Characterization (RTRC). Current state of art RTRC method uses a rate integral productivity index (RIPI) that filters instantaneous PI while drilling in order to enable simultaneous evaluation of flow features and proper geo-steering to optimize well targets. In addition, multi rate tests at the end of each section were analyzed to establish a permeability/PI profile followed by mini build ups - when necessary - to confirm the reservoir pressure. Lessons learnt from the first well enabled improvent in the operational aspects of UBD control on the subsequent well through adequate design of UBD tools and conditions. RTRC analysis showed that the two wells were dominantly matrix producers with the well X2 indicated the presence of a secondary permeability attributed to fractures, which resulted in a higher well potential than expected. The acquired productivity baseline per sub layer will be useful in optimizing the completion strategy, considering smart completions and enhanced reservoir contact per sub layer. As a way forward, extending UBD application to other areas of the reservoir is also considered as an opportunity for future development. The case study presented herein, highlights the outcomes of RTRC in deploying strategic re-development options to improve reservoir performance and deliverability in the long term.

However, the complex displacement mechanisms in CO2 flooding, in particular adverse mobility and gravity segregation can reduce its effectiveness. It has been demonstrated earlier that by adjusting the well rates, we can manage the flood front and improve the sweep during waterflooding. In this paper, we present the application of rate optimization to CO2 flooding in order to maximize areal and vertical sweep, and minimize CO2 recycling by delaying CO2 breakthrough. Field-scale rate optimization problem for CO2 EOR processes involve complex reservoir models, production and facility constraints and geological uncertainty. We propose an efficient approach for computing optimal rates for CO2 flooding with application to smart wells completed with inflow control valves (ICV). The approach is based on equalizing the arrival time of flood front at the producers within a selected sub-region to maximize the areal sweep efficiency under hierarchy of production and facility constraints. An additional 'norm' constraint on the arrival times is also included to achieve high viscous-to-gravity ratio (VGR) to minimize gravity segregation. The 'optimal' strategy is decided based upon the trade-off between maximizing sweep and accelerating production. We use streamlines to compute the analytical sensitivity of arrival times with respect to injection/production rates. Analytical gradient and Hessian of the objective function are also derived, making the approach computationally efficient for fieldscale applications. The approach has been demonstrated using a synthetic 2D example and a 3D benchmark field case. The results clearly demonstrate that rate optimization can improve sweep, delay CO2 breakthrough and increase oil recovery for the same amount of CO2 injection. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of our approach for WAG flooding in the 3D benchmark field case. We incorporate geological uncertainty via a stochastic optimization framework based on the combination of the expected value and variance of a performance measure from multiple realizations.

A possible application could be to locally-produce bulk explosives at remotely-distributed coal mining locations. Incorporating Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) in fossil fuel based processes is one of the most viable options to reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the short run. Coal and biomass have been selected as two promising hydrogen sources, keeping in mind the remotely-distributed coal mining locations and substantial availability of eucalyptus biomass in Australia. CCS is incorporated in coal based ammonia scenario to restrict the carbon footprint. Ammonia (NH3) production from any of the fossil fuels implicitly involves CO2 removal. Though, there is still the need to pressurise the CO2 to supercritical state in addition to the need to capture it in a pure-enough (95% pure) form. To gain a better understanding of economic and environmental trade-offs, two representative flowsheets have been modelled in ASPEN Plus® simulation software for the two feedstocks. The ASPEN Plus® output is used to predict the economics and the CO2 footprint for the ammonia process. Multi-objective optimization was employed to generate a Pareto plot representing the minimum ammonia production cost for different CO2 footprint values. The coal based ammonia process was found to be economically better than the biomass based ammonia process for a similar CO2 footprint. The biomass based process, however, can be carbon negative by capturing the biogenic CO2, which is not possible for coal based process. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","Ammonia production; Biomass; CCS; Coal; Economics",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084245093

Gas phase odour abatement systems within sewer networks typically target hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an odorant and overall odour indicator. However other compounds can occur naturally, or be present from trade waste, that are either odorous themselves or may impact on the performance of odorant removal in odour abatement systems. Activated carbon (AC) systems adsorb most contaminants during their lifetime until most active sites are depleted. Samples from the inlet and outlet of 6 AC filters in Sydney and Melbourne (Australia) were taken monthly over 18 months and analysed for volatile sulfurous compounds (VSCs) using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with a sulfur chemiluminescence detection (SCD). H2S was measured by Jerome 631-X hydrogen sulfide analyser for each sample. Each sample returned approximately 14 VSCs. After screening the data for wet weather and cooler periods, 6 VSCs were studied further. This paper evaluates and compares the performance of 6 activated carbon filters for each compound identified and each appropriate grouping of compounds. H2S and methyl mercaptan were found to be removed well, yet dimethyl disulfide was found to have a negative removal more often than it had a positive removal. Dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl trisulfide also suffered from negative removals, yet not as often as dimethyl disulfide. Carbon disulfide was removed as often as it was released. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Activated carbon; Gas chromatography; Hydrogen sulfide; Odor control; Odors; Sewers; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Wastewater treatment; Activated carbon filters; Chemiluminescence detection; Dimethyl disulfides; Dimethyl sulfide; Methyl mercaptans; Odour abatements; Sewer infrastructure; Wastewater utilities; Carbon disulfide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988836291

It was shown that modern technologies of water disposal system do not allow reaching a proper level of ecological safety mainly due to the insufficient degree of wastewater treatment and existing environmental risks associated with the recycling of their sediments. We made a conclusion about the need for improvement of the environmental safety of water disposal systems functioning due to the development of a new technology. For this, when applying traditional mechanical and biological treatment methods, it was proposed to carry out additional wastewater purification and to improve the ways of treatment and recycling of their sediments. For additional treatment, it was proposed to use wastewater as a medium for the cultivation of energy microalgae in photobioreactors of the closed type with subsequent production of liquid biofuel of the third generation. For sediment treatment and recycling, it was proposed to use anaerobic digestion with the scheme organization in compliance with the kinetics of digestion processes and subsequent use of digested masses organic fertilizer. Based on this, we proposed a new technological water disposal scheme, which would make it possible to obtain renewable energy sources for partial or full provision of the needs of enterprises for thermal and electrical energy, and in case of its excess to obtain commercal renewable energy sources, to receive environmentally safe organic fertilizer, commercial carbon dioxide, as well as to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from cogeneration plants of local thermal and electric power plants into the atmosphere. © Sergii Shamanskyi, Sergii Boichenko, 2016.","Aviation enterprise; Recycling of wastewater sediment; Renewable energy sources; Wastewater treatment; Water disposal technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010223418

These planetary waves are typically excited by diabatic or orographic forcing and can be subject to considerable downstream modification. Because of differences in wave properties, including vertical structure, phase speed, and group velocity, Rossby waves exhibit a wide range of behaviors. This study demonstrates the combined effects of eastward-propagating stationary barotropic Rossby waves and westward-propagating very-low-zonal-wavenumber stationary barotropic Rossby waves on the atmospheric response to wintertime El Niño convective forcing over the tropical Pacific. Experiments are conducted using the Community Atmosphere Model, version 4.0, in which both diabatic forcing over the Pacific and localized relaxation outside the forcing region are applied. The localized relaxation is used to dampen Rossby wave propagation to either the west or east of the forcing region and isolate the alternate direction signal. The experiments reveal that El Niño forcing produces both eastward- and westward-propagating stationary waves in the upper troposphere. Over North Africa and Asia the aggregate undamped upper-tropospheric response is due to the superposition and interaction of these oppositely directed planetary waves that emanate from the forcing region and encircle the planet. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","El Nino; ENSO; Planetary waves; Rossby waves; Stationary waves; Teleconnections","Climatology; Troposphere; Wave propagation; EL Nino; ENSO; Planetary Waves; Rossby wave; Stationary waves; Teleconnections; Mechanical waves; climate forcing; El Nino; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; orographic effect; planetary wave; Rossby wave; standing wave; teleconnection; troposphere; Asia; North Africa; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994035687

With its higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, natural gas has the potential to reduce engine out carbon dioxide emissions, which has shown to be a strong greenhouse gas contributor. For part-load conditions, the lower flame speeds of natural gas can lead to an increased duration in the inflammation process with traditional port-injection. Direct-injection of natural gas can increase in-cylinder turbulence and has the potential to reduce problems typically associated with port-injection of natural gas, such as lower flame speeds and poor dilution tolerance. A study was designed and executed to investigate the effects of direct-injection of natural gas at part-load conditions. Steady-state tests were performed on a single-cylinder research engine representative of current gasoline direct-injection engines. Tests were performed with direct-injection in the central and side location. The start of injection was varied under stoichiometric conditions in order to study the effects on the mixture formation process. In addition, exhaust gas recirculation was introduced at select conditions in order to investigate the dilution tolerance. Relevant combustion metrics were then analyzed for each scenario. Experimental results suggest that regardless of the injector location, varying the start of injection has a strong impact on the mixture formation process. Delaying the start of injection from 300 to 120°CA BTDC can reduce the early flame development process by nearly 15°CA. While injecting into the cylinder after the intake valves have closed has shown to produce the fastest combustion process, this does not necessarily lead to the highest efficiency, due to increases in pumping and wall heat losses. When comparing the two injection configurations, the side location shows the best performance in terms of combustion metrics and efficiencies. For both systems, part-load dilution tolerance is affected by the injection timing, due to the induced turbulence from the gaseous injection event. CFD simulation results have shown that there is a fundamental difference in how the two injection locations affect the mixture formation process. Delayed injection timing increases the turbulence level in the cylinder at the time of the spark, but reduces the available time for proper mixing. Side injection delivers a gaseous jet that interacts more effectively with the intake induced flow field, and this improves the engine performance in terms of efficiency.

The study regards a protected area, the so-called Mosaico Bocaina, in the municipalities of Angra dos Reis and Paraty, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and Ubatuba, in the state of São Paulo, where traditional communities from three different ethnic groups live (indigenous, quilombolas and caiçaras). The knowledge of nature and of the physics of climate change (including its causes, consequences and characteristics) isn’t always accompanied by the understanding and science of how climate change affects the well-being and health of populations. The analysis of the public policies and science production for the field concluded that the situation for the region in question is no different from that of other regions in Latin America: (1) public policies have not become effective interventions against climate change in general, and the interest in its implications over the health of populations is recent; (2) the science of climate change is insufficient, especially regarding its effects over the health of populations, whether in this specific region or more encompassing scales; (3) there is no information on how traditional communities perceive climate change, their impacts on health and well-being and tackling strategies. This chapter seeks to contribute to the knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the health and well-being of traditional communities, focusing on the governance tools required to address it. What strategies have traditional communities been using to deal with it? How does the official agenda of efforts reflect the socio-cultural perceptions and mitigation and survival strategies of traditional communities? Qualitative methods of participant observation that combined participation, observation, informal open interviews and analysis of documents were employed. The results generated territorialized knowledge in the social, economic, political and cultural dimensions of climate change and their implications on the health and well-being of traditional communities, as well as allowed the identification of governance mechanisms and socio-cultural strategies that can be used to mitigate, adapt to and help avoiding climate change. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Bocaina; Climate change; Climate governance; Extreme events; Health; Traditional communities",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071356729

Despite advances in purely aftertreatment aspects, the performance of the diverse aftertreatment devices is very dependent on the operating temperature. This makes them rely on the engine design and calibration because of the imposed turbine outlet temperature. The need to reach target conversion efficiency and to complete regeneration processes requires controlling additional parameters during the engine setup. For that reason, exploring the potential of different solutions to increase inlet aftertreatment temperature is becoming a critical topic. Nevertheless, such studies cannot be tackled without considering concerns on the engine fuel consumption. In this paper, the influence of several design parameters is studied by modelling approach under steady state operating conditions in a Diesel engine. An engine model has been setup with experimental data using GT-Power software coupled to an external heat transfer and friction losses turbocharger model to predict correctly turbine outlet temperature. The analysis covers parametric studies focused on the exhaust and intake valves diameter, valves timing as well as the use of multi-step openings. The exhaust ports total length and distribution into several branches are also explored. Differences in the potential of every proposal are also considered as a function of the engine operating range. Finally, discussions on the influence on turbine outlet temperature and fuel consumption are conducted to define general guideline criteria. These are affected by the need to look for solutions providing a suitable balance between exhaust temperature increase and minimized impact on engine fuel economy.

Most research has been focused on replacement reactions that occur in sI hydrates due to their prevalence in natural gas hydrates. However, sII hydrates in nature have been also discovered in some regions, and the replacement mechanism in sII hydrates significantly differs from that in sI hydrates. In this study, we have intensively investigated the replacement reaction of sII (C3H8 + CH4) hydrate by externally injecting CO2/N2 (50:50) gas mixture with a primary focus on powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and gas chromatography analyses. In particular, it was firstly confirmed that there was no structural transformation during the replacement of C3H8 + CH4 hydrate with CO2/N2 gas injection, indicating that sII hydrate decomposition followed by sI hydrate formation did not occur. Furthermore, the cage-specific replacement pattern of the C3H8 + CH4 hydrate revealed that CH4 replacement with N2 in the small cages of sII was more significant than C3H8 replacement with CO2 in the large cages of sII. The total extent of the replacement for the C3H8 + CH4 hydrate was cross-checked by NMR and GC analyses and found to be approximately 54%. Compared to the replacement for CH4 hydrate with CO2/N2 gas, the lower extent of the replacement for the C3H8 + CH4 hydrate with CO2/N2 gas was attributable to the persistent presence of C3H8 in the large cages and the lower content of N2 in the feed gas. The structural sustainability and cage-specific replacement observed in the C3H8 + CH4 hydrate with external CO2/N2 gas will have significant implications for suggesting target gas hydrate reservoirs and understanding the precise nature of guest exchange in gas hydrates for both safe natural gas production and long-term CO2 sequestration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CO2/N2; Gas hydrate; Replacement; sII hydrate; Structural sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Chromatography; Gas chromatography; Gases; Hydration; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Substitution reactions; Sustainable development; X ray diffraction; Gas chromatography analysis; Hydrate decomposition; Hydrate formation; Natural-gas production; Powder X ray diffraction; Replacement; Replacement reactions; Structural transformation; Gas hydrates; carbon dioxide; exploitation; gas chromatography; gas hydrate; gas production; methane; nitrogen; nuclear magnetic resonance; replacement; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979939271

To follow this agreement, there should be efforts such as carbon emission reduction and eco design etc. One of these efforts is development of eco-VE function that applied eco-friendly concept on VE which is commonly used at design phase. Concept of this model includes carbon productivity concept and potential environment pollution index that reflects eco-VE function on original VE. The carbon productivity concept is a cause of production increase that offset production decrease factor depending on green-house gas reduction. The potential environment pollution index presents the possibility of environment pollution through construction phase. The carbon productivity is 'Construction cost/Carbon emission'. The construction costs are consisted of material, equipment, labour cost and indirect expenses. Carbon emissions are calculated by emission for material production and equipment fuel consumption. The potential environment pollution index is composed of environmental pollution and conservation cost. The environmental pollution cost includes environmental damage and destruction cost. The environmental conservation cost includes environmental pollution prevention cost, waste treatment cost, environmental pollution compensation, environmental pollution test research funds and law cost. © 2016 The Authors.","carbon productivity; Eco Cost; Eco VE; potential environment pollution index","Compensation (personnel); Construction equipment; Costs; Emission control; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Productivity; Urban planning; Wages; Waste treatment; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon productivities; Eco VE; Eco-costs; Environment pollution; Environmental conservation; Environmental damage; Environmental pollutions; Environmental regulations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997627084

In the ideal case this cooling method is chosen in combination with conventional drilled or milled tempering channels where the heat transfer medium flows. These wide-spread ways of cooling are not very often effective enough and they do not provide required accuracy of heat transfer control during production by injection moulding technology. Implementation of capillary tubes that bring the liquid CO2 to critical zones enables local increasing of heat transfer. Regulation of liquid CO2 amount that is injected into mould enables removal of required heat quantity in a very short time period. In this way the homogenous rate of part cooling can be achieved which is very difficult when producing the parts with complex geometry or with combination of various wall thickness.

There still exists, however, a margin for further savings, which is associated with well-tailored designs of road lighting installations. The critical impediment that has to be overcame beforehand is the computational complexity related to preparing such a well-suited design.

First, the national commitments of reduction or limitation of the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) will be described. These commitments result from the Kyoto Protocol (KP), the Doha amendment of the KP, and the European legislation related to the Europe 2020 targets on energy and climate change. Then, the time-series of the GHG emissions of the country will be presented, both aggregated at the country level and at the level of the main source sectors. The trends of the emission time-series will be assessed using specific indices. Moreover, based on the latest official GHG inventory of Greece, the level of achievement of the national commitment under the KP and the expected surplus of GHG emission allowances is estimated. By the consideration of the official GHG emission projection scenarios, the progress of the country in achieving the emission reduction targets for the period 2013–2020 will be assessed, especially for the sectors that are not included under the Emission Trading System of the European Union. The effect of the implemented, adopted and planned mitigation policies will be also presented. Although an over-arching adaptation strategy is not yet available in Greece, adaptation measures are currently under implementation as part of a broader network of measures that apply to the specific areas of identified vulnerabilities. A summary of these measures will be presented in this work. The main sector specific strategies and action plans on climate change adaptation issues will be also presented. These are mainly incorporated in the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 ‘Aleksandros Mpaltatzis’, the National Strategy for the Management of Water Resources, the General and the Specific National Frameworks for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development, the National Biodiversity Strategy, and the National Action Plan for Combating Desertification. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation","Biodiversity; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; International law; Planning; Regional planning; Time series; Water management; Adaptation; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Combating desertification; Emission reduction targets; Emission trading systems; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Mitigation; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044478124

In this work, experiments have been carried out on a two-staged combustor, with a jet-stabilized main stage and a swirl-stabilized pilot stage. Both stages have been run separately to allow a more detailed understanding of the flame stabilization within the combustor and its range of stable operation. All experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure and preheating temperatures of 650 °C. The air was fed to both stages of the combustor for all experiments. The flame was analyzed in terms of shape, length and lift-off height, using the OH∗ chemiluminescence signal detected by an ICCD-camera. Emission measurements for NOx, CO and UHC emissions were carried out. The pilot stage was examined at a local air number between 0.14 and 1.43, which corresponds to a global air number of 2.0 to 20.7. For lowest air numbers, the combustor works with the RQL principle with lowest emissions in pilot stage only operation. This is because the remaining fuel fed to the pilot stage mixes rapidly with the air from the main stage and reacts under lean conditions. The optimum operating range of the main stage is at global air numbers between 3 and 3.2 with a blow-off limit beyond λg = 4.0. At a global air number of λg = 2, a fuel split variation was carried out from 0 (only pilot stage) to 1 (only main stage). In combined operation and at higher fuel splits, the NOx emissions are reduced compared to the main stage only operation, while the opposing effect on NOx emissions was observed for lower fuel splits. CFD simulations of the combustor test rig showed higher residence times in the pilot stage compared to the main stage which facilitates higher NOx formation rates in the pilot stage. This could be improved by a geometry optimization. The operation of the pilot stage was beneficial at fuel splits above 90 %, especially concerning an extended operating range to higher global air numbers. In addition, the capability of the combustor to operate at higher thermal power inputs was investigated. Originally designed for the Turbec T100 micro gas turbine, the combustor was operated at 160 % of the original design point. At a constant air number, this led to a decrease in NOx and to an increase in CO emissions, caused by shorter residence times in the combustion chamber at higher power input. An operation strategy of constant pilot air number increases the envelope of a stable operation regime further.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes the results achieved by a small Austrian aeronautical innovations company in developing a cyclogyro propulsion system capable of vertical launch and efficient forward flight. The research team progressed from concept definition and simulation (2004-2006), through experimental validation and concept demonstration (2006), component optimization (2006-2012), full system demonstration (2012-2014) and examination of ability to scale (both larger and smaller) (2015 onwards). This paper provides details of the results of each of these stages. Findings: The research team proved that cyclogyro propulsion can be used for the vertical launch, and that, in forward flight, it has the potential to achieve efficiency beyond the range of conventional fixed wing and rotorcraft. Research limitations/implications: This research indicates that the efficiency increases with forward speed within the range achieved in standard wind tunnels (up to 35 m/s). This efficiency appears to be caused by a unique chamber effect within the cyclogyro rotor assembly. Future research should be conducted to analyse this chamber effect in greater detail and to test the cyclogyro rotor for speeds beyond 35 m/s. Practical implications: This work indicates that cyclogyro propulsion could have the potential to provide vertical launch, high speed and highly efficient aircraft that have reduced wing span, no external rotors and exceptional agility. This technology could therefore be feasible for vertical take-off and landing aircraft that can safely form densely packed swarms. Social implications: It could be researched as an efficiency increase in forward flight completely different to existing propulsion systems. This could open a way for a more efficient air traffic in future and faster reduction of CO2 and NOX emission an allow an environment-friendlier air travelling. Originality/value: This paper provides the details of the first cyclogyro aircraft to have flown and will serve the aeronautical community by stimulating the debate on this new disruptive technology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cyclocopter; Cyclogyro aircraft; Cyclogyro-rotor; D-dalus; VTOL","Air transportation; Aircraft landing; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Fighter aircraft; Fixed wings; Propulsion; Aeronautical innovations; Concept demonstration; Cyclocopter; Cyclogyro; Design/methodology/approach; Experimental validations; Vertical take-off and landings; VTOL; VTOL/STOL aircraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990182295

Their population and infrastructure is affected in different ways and degrees. Events are likely to become more frequent and severe with climate change, which increases the risk of disasters and associated losses and damage to people and assets. Insurance plays a role in spreading or sharing the risk across communities and all sectors of the economy, over large geographical areas and time. The sharing and transfer of risk therefore enhances the resilience of society, but does not necessarily reduce its risk in the long-term. Many governments are challenged to provide a timely disaster response and longer-term resilient recovery due to financial constraints. Assistance can be provided through a more integrated approach, including risk analysis, prevention, preparedness and disaster and climate risk transfer solutions. By integrating risk transfer solutions, such as insurance, into disaster risk management and climate adaptation efforts, governments and individuals are able to (1) soften the financial impact through timely access to finance after a disaster, (2) increase the effectiveness of the implementation of contingency plans, and (3) plan preventive measures that mitigate disaster-induced poverty traps and long-term development setbacks. The insurance industry is uniquely placed to play a strong role in providing risk management and enhancing the resilience of communities. Internationally, policy makers are increasingly recognising this approach as highlighted by the G7 ""InsuResilience"" initiative and reference to risk transfer and insurance as part of a comprehensive climate risk management approach in the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC COP21). Integrated climate risk management concepts are currently being developed for four themes across sectors such as agriculture, energy and tourism as well as urban areas. The project Agriculture and Climate Risk Insurance Plus (ACRIplus) in the overall programme Promoting Integrated Climate Risk Management is funded through the International Climate Initiative (ICI) of the German Ministry of Environment (BMUB) and implemented by GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH) and the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative e.

Arguing that multipolarity leads to a highly differentiated global system, it conceptualizes global order as negotiated order revolving around issue-specific global governance arrangements subject to constant negotiation processes. In this context, transatlantic leadership depends not only on a US and EU willingness to lead individually and collectively, but especially on their capacity to define joint purposes and mobilize followers in issue areas relevant to global order. To test whether the two parties fulfil these conditions, the article first engages in a discourse analysis comparing US and EU leadership ambitions and visions of world order as expressed in their global strategies. US and EU rhetoric is subsequently compared to their (inter)action in the major global policy domain of climate change, focusing on the negotiations of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The article finds that opportunities for US-EU leadership generally exist, but that sustained future leadership will depend on renewed commitments and tend to be, rather than cross-cutting and relatively stable as during the Cold War, issue-specific and contingent, necessitating regular negotiation with other major global forces. © 2016 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052729601

Therefore, the leaching of contaminants needs to be studied, and its effects on the hydration of cement quantified. XRD analysis can be a powerful tool in this regard, but challenges can arise due to the complex and often varying composition of MSWI bottom ash. For this reason it is necessary to combine other characterisation techniques such as SEM/EDX.

Underprivileged members of society often lack access to these networks and are therefore unable to migrate internationally because they cannot reduce the costs and risks of potential migration projects to an acceptable level. Climate change might aggravate this situation by having an adverse impact on people’s socio-economic condition. This in turn increases the pressure to adapt in situ or migrate and adds to existing social inequalities. Based on empirical data from the Mexican states of Zacatecas and Veracruz, this chapter describes how access to migration networks depends not only on economic resources but also on the cultural context, individual preferences, and personal attributes, such as age and gender. Thus, people who might not be able to migrate now will be even less able to do so under more severe socio-economic conditions brought about by climate change, as they do not have access to existing migrant networks. On the other hand, some people never sought access to migration networks because they never wanted to leave their communities, and this view doesn’t change in the context of climate change stressors. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate migration; Interstate migration; Mexican migration; Migrant networks; Social inequality; Veracruz; Zacatecas",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040179659

The CV consists of 2 ellipsoidal heads connected by a cylindrical shell and is constructed of carbon steel. The AP1000 plant design has four large penetrations (two airlocks and two equipment hatches) located in approximately the same quadrant of the circumference of the shell which imposes asymmetric effects in the shell structure. The CV is designed and constructed in accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Subsection NE. Traditionally, the local and global stability of freestanding steel containments have been designed by use of formulae using conservative assumptions based on an axisymmetric structure. ASME Code Case N-284 ""Metal Containment Shell Buckling Design Methods, Class MC Section III, Division 1"" outlines methodology for satisfying the stability of the CV using two approaches. Section 1710 provides a stress based buckling approach using detailed formulae that assumes an axisymmetric structure. The second approach provides guidance and acceptability based on a linear bifurcation analysis (2D (1720) or 3D (1730)). Due to the asymmetric structure of the CV, the 3D linear bifurcation method delivers the most accurate results. The methodology and assumptions implemented by Westinghouse to qualify stability of the CV via Code Case N-284 are outlined. Also, the procedure to properly amplify the stresses as required by N-284 is included as justification of the methods used.

Their accumulation in thyroid cancer tissue is dependent on the expression and activity of the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Scintigraphic imaging using either planar or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) cameras allows the visualization of their distribution within the human body. Due to only a poor visualization of morphology by these techniques, their diagnostic accuracy is, however, limited. This limitation is overcome when hybrid systems integrating a SPECT camera with an X-ray CT scanner are used. Roughly one third of patients with diagnostically unclear foci of radioiodine accumulation will benefit from the use of SPECT/CT, also in terms of therapeutic management. SPECT/CT has, therefore, become the gold standard of nuclear imaging in DTC. NIS expression may be absent in DTC. In this case, the glucose transporters are usually upregulated.

Fewer studies investigated the soil microbiota and their potential to increase cycling and mobilization of nutrients in biochar-amended soils. This review is discussing the latest findings in the bacterial contribution to cycling and mobilizing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur in biochar-amended soils and potential contributions to plant growth promotion. Depending on feedstock,. pyrolysis, soil type, and plant cover, changes in the bacterial community structure were observed for a majority of the studies using amplicon sequencing or genetic fingerprinting methods. Prokaryotic nitrification largely depends on the availability of ammonium and can vary considerably under soil biochar amendment. However, denitrification to di-nitrogen and in particular, nitrous oxide reductase activity is commonly enhanced, resulting in reduced nitrous oxide emissions. Likewise, bacterial fixation of di-nitrogen appears to be regularly enhanced. A paucity of studies suggests that bacterial mobilization of phosphorus and sulfur is enhanced as well.

The paper examines how DRR and adaptation can inform development to tackle the underlying drivers of disaster risk. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a risk-based approach to the management of climate variability and change, the paper draws from a critical review of the literature on DRR and adaptation. The study finds that known and emerging risk from disasters continues to increase dramatically in many parts of the world, and that climate change is a key driver behind it. The authors also find that underlying causes of social vulnerability are still not adequately addressed in policy or practice. Linking DRR and adaptation is also complicated by different purposes and perspectives, fragmented knowledge, institutions and policy and poor stakeholder coordination. Findings: The author’s analysis suggests that future work in DRR and adaptation should put a much greater emphasis on reducing vulnerability to environmental hazards, if there is truly a desire to tackle the underlying drivers of disaster and climate risks. Originality/value: This will require coherent political action on DRR and adaptation aimed at addressing faulty development processes that are the main causes of growing vulnerability. The study concludes with a first look on the new Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and how it aims to connect with adaptation and development. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Governance; Natural disasters; Risk reduction; United Nations; Vulnerability","climate change; community development; environmental hazard; governance approach; institutional framework; natural disaster; risk assessment; stakeholder; United Nations; vulnerability; Honshu; Japan; Miyagi; Sendai; Tohoku",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010677125

Lake sediments preserve characteristic event layers, offering the potential to develop widely distributed and unique chronologies of historical floods. Inferring flood magnitude remains a greater challenge, previously overcome in part by analyzing sharply laminated polar or alpine sequences. Here we demonstrate an approach to obtain flood frequency and magnitude data from an unexploited resource, the largely visually homogeneous, organic sediments that typify most temperate lakes. The geochemical composition and end-member modeling of sediment trap and adjacent short core particle size data for Brotherswater (northwest England) discriminates the signature of infrequent, coarse-grained flood deposits from seasonal and longer term allogenic (enhanced discharge and sediment supply during winter) and autogenic (summer productivity, thermal mixing) depositional processes. Comparing the paleoflood reconstruction to local river discharges shows that hydrological thresholds censor event signature preservation, with 4 yr recurrence intervals detectable in delta-proximal sediments declining to 9 yr in the lake center. Event threshold (discharge) and process characterization are essential precursors to discerning flood magnitude from sediment archives. Implementation of our approach in globally prevalent temperate lakes offers a vast, unique repository of long-term hydrological data for hydrologists, climate modelers, engineers, and policy makers addressing future flood risks. © 2015 The Authors.",,"Data visualization; Floods; Lakes; Particle size; Depositional process; Geochemical composition; Historical floods; Hydrological data; Northwest england; Organic sediments; Process characterization; Recurrence intervals; Sediments; chemical composition; flood frequency; geochemistry; lacustrine deposit; paleoflood; particle size; river discharge; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953402121

This can only be achieved by a further intensification of existing cropping systems and will require even higher inputs of N fertilisers, which may result in increased losses of nitrous oxide (N2O) from cropped soils. Enhanced efficiency fertilisers (EEFs) have been promoted as a potential strategy to mitigate N2O emissions and improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in cereal cropping systems. However, only limited data are currently available on the use of different EEF products in sub-tropical cereal systems. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three different EEFs on N2O emissions, NUE and yield in a sub-tropical summer cereal cropping system in Australia. Over an entire year soil N2O fluxes were monitored continuously (3h sampling frequency) with a fully-automated measuring system. The experimental site was fertilised with different nitrogen (N) fertilisers applied at 170kgNha-1, namely conventional urea (Urea), urea with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), polymer-coated urea (PCU), and urea with the nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (Nitrapyrin). Nitrous oxide emissions were highly episodic and mainly controlled by heavy rainfall events within two months of planting and fertiliser N application. Annual N2O emissions in the four treatments amounted to 2.31, 0.40, 0.69 and 1.58kgN2O-Nha-1year-1 for Urea, DMPP, PCU and Nitrapyrin treatments, respectively, while unfertilised plots produced an average of 0.16kgN2O-Nha-1year-1. Two of the tested products (DMPP and PCU) were found to be highly effective, decreasing annual N2O losses by 83% and 70%, respectively, but did not affect yield or NUE. This study shows that EEFs have a high potential to decrease N2O emissions from sub-tropical cereal cropping systems. More research is needed to assess if the increased costs of EEFs can be compensated by lower fertiliser application rates and/or yield increases. © CSIRO 2016.",,"Efficiency; Fertilizers; Metabolism; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Rain; Tropics; Urea; Application rates; Cropping systems; Enhanced efficiency; Field experiment; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Nitrous oxide emissions; Sampling frequencies; Cereal products; agricultural intensification; cereal; crop yield; farming system; fertilizer application; flux measurement; nitrification; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; rainfall; soil nitrogen; subtropical region; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981554814

However, there is still a high level of uncertainty around the relationship of N fertiliser rate and N2O emissions for many cropping systems. We conducted year-round measurements of N2O emission and lint yield in four N-rate treatments (0, 90, 180 and 270kgNha-1) in a cotton-fallow rotation on a black vertosol in Australia. We observed a non-linear exponential response of N2O emissions to increasing N fertiliser rates with cumulative annual N2O emissions of 0.55, 0.67, 1.07 and 1.89kgNha-1 for the four respective N fertiliser rates, but no N response to yield occurred above 180kgNha-1. The annual N2O emission factors induced by N fertiliser were 0.13, 0.29 and 0.50% for the 90, 180 and 270kgNha-1 treatments respectively, significantly lower than the IPCC Tier 1 default value of 1.0%. This nonlinear response suggests that an exponential N2O emissions model may be more appropriate for estimating emission of N2O from soils cultivated to cotton in Australia. It also demonstrates that improved agricultural N-management practices can be adopted in cotton to substantially reduce N2O emissions without affecting yield. © CSIRO 2016.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Cotton; Cultivation; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Application rates; Atmospheric nitrous oxide; Cropping systems; Emission factors; Emissions model; Management practices; Measurements of; Non-linear response; Fertilizers; agricultural management; cotton; crop rotation; crop yield; emission inventory; fallow; fertilizer application; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nonlinearity; soil emission; subtropical region; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981484480

Two years following Tropical Storm Irene, our team interviewed 15 farmers in order to investigate their perceptions of climate-related risk and how their decision-making was influenced by these perceptions. Our results show that Vermont farmers are concerned with both ecological and economic risk. Subthemes that emerged included geographic, topographic, and hydrological characteristics of farm sites; stability of land tenure; hydrological erosion; pest and disease pressure; market access; household financial stability; and floods. Farmers in our study believed that these risks are not new but that they are significantly intensified by climate change. Farmer responses were heavily focused on adaptation activities, with discussion of climate change mitigation activities notably absent. Psychological distance construal theory and hyperbolic discounting emerged as well-suited frames to explain why farmers reported adaptation activities but not mitigation strategies. Farmers will probably experience an increasing severity of climate-related impacts in the northeast region; therefore, information about climate-related risks coming from farmers' personal experience should be integrated with forecasting data to help farmers plan effective adaptation strategies. © 2016 Schattman, Conner and Méndez.",,"adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision making; farmers attitude; Hurricane Irene 2011; management practice; perception; questionnaire survey; research work; risk assessment; storm surge; United States; Vermont",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015851163

ITS technology is an infrastructure that promotes integrated information sharing that can be used to improve system performance. ITS combines better infrastructure with information and control technologies to (a) reduce traffc congestion by maintaining traffc ?ow, (b) reduce transportationgenerated pollution, (c) improve transport effciency, and (d) produce economic benefts. A statistical analysis of partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test three hypothesized relationships. Primary data were collected from U.S.-based commercial vehicle transportation service providers. Respondents were parceled with a geographic information system analysis of secondary data from the U.S. Department of Transportation National ITS Deployment Tracking Survey. On the basis of their level of regional ITS experience, primary data respondents were matched to regions and split between regions with low ITS experience and high ITS experience as a proxy for regional public investments in ITS. Performance measures were based on effciency, reliability, responsiveness, quality, carbon emissions reduction, and equipment utilization for commercial vehicle operators. Results indicate that private investments in ITS signifcantly positively affect the responsiveness performance measure for commercial vehicle operators in regions with high public ITS investments. The same relationship is not signifcant in regions with low public ITS investments, which indicates at least some transportation performance improvements for regions with higher investments in ITS.

According to the forecasts, by 2030, they will continue to be in the major position of approx. 60% share in Poland and approx. 11% share in the EU. The current policy of the European Union aims at the implementation of the climate and energy package. It is based on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption by 20% and increasing the share of energy production from renewable energy sources (RES) to 20%. The commitments made by Poland on renewable energy sources involve achieving a 15% share of renewable energy in total energy consumption in the country in 2020. The quickest way to fulfill the EU requirements is the coal and biomass co-firing in the existing power plants. There are problems with the preparation of material for combustion, because biomass has different physicochemical properties than coal. For this reason, the share of biomass co-firing process stability deteriorates and reduces the capacity and efficiency of the boiler. Combustion tests were carried out on the test bench at the Institute of Energy. Measurements were made at the position of the camera perpendicular to the axis of the flame for different variants of power. After the initial analysis of the images of the co-pulverized coal and biomass, the images sequences corresponding to stable and unstable combustion were determined. Image classification method was used to determine the state of the process. The article compared two methods for image classification with SSN and support vector machine with varying participation of biomass. This study presents the possibility of increasing the weight fraction of the biomass to 20%. The consequence, of course, is the deterioration of the stability of the combustion process. However, from the point of view of the boiler operator, the most important parameter is the sensitivity of the classification, which directly determines the probability of detecting an unstable state. © 2018, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

These case studies are a major component of an international research project: “Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Extremes in the Americas” (VACEA). This project is very much interdisciplinary; with social and natural science providing context and direction for research in the other realm of scholarship, producing insights that very likely would not arise from a more narrow disciplinary perspective. A large number of interviews with local actors revealed that agricultural producers and local officials recognize their high degree of exposure and sensitivity to climate variability and extreme weather events, although they generally do not associate this with climate change. Case studies of exposure demonstrate that the perceptions of the local actors are consistent with the nature of the regional hydroclimatic regimes. In all four river basins, climate variability between years and decades masks any regional expression of global climate change. These modes of periodic variability dominate the paleoclimate of past centuries and the recorded hydroclimate of recent decades. The exposure variables examined in this paper, indices of stream flow, snowpack, water excess and deficit, vary in coherence with the characteristic frequencies of large-scale ocean–atmosphere circulation patterns, specifically the ENSO and PDO. Projections of the future states of these variables require the use of climate models that are able to simulate the internal variability of the climate system and the teleconnections between ocean–atmosphere oscillations and regional hydroclimate. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Argentina; Canada; Climate change; Climate variability; Colombia; Exposure; Rural agricultural communities",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053781181

The present work aims to explore the electrical conduction process at variable temperatures, in order to probe the room and low temperature ferromagnetism triggered in transparent Zn0.95Co0.05O films using inert xenon ion irradiation. The origin of the paramagnetism and the tunable ferromagnetism in transparent Zn0.95Co0.05O films is explained from different degree of concentric bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) stabilization inside variable range hopping spheres through implication of strongly and weakly bound carriers to O/Zn related lattice defects and tetrahedrally substituted Co2+ions. The paramagnetic behavior in as deposited Zn0.95Co0.05O film arises from the smallest density of isolated concentric BMPs resulted mainly from marginal concentration of strongly localized carrier due to its highly insulating nature. The progressive enhancement in strongly localized carriers in post irradiated Zn0.95Co0.05O films as a function of fluence results in overlapping of static concentric BMPs to trigger onset of ferromagnetism. The strength of ferromagnetism is found to be maximal at a particular density of concentric BMPs optimized from the highest concentration of strongly localized carriers in insulating regime and substantial substituted Co2+ions. Further enhancement in carrier concentration and reduction in substituted Co2+ions is detrimental to ferromagnetism owing to non-static concentric BMPs percolation from the presence of weakly localized nature of carriers in intermediate regime. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Dilute magnetic semiconductors; Opto-spintronics; Transparent conducting oxides","Carrier concentration; Diluted magnetic semiconductors; Ion bombardment; Ions; Magnetic semiconductors; Paramagnetism; Polarons; Semiconducting zinc compounds; Semiconductor doping; Solvents; Temperature; Transparent conducting oxides; Bound magnetic polarons; Dilute magnetic semiconductors; Electrical conduction; Ferromagnetic properties; Paramagnetic behavior; Progressive enhancement; Variable range hopping; Variable temperature; Ferromagnetism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975230929

However, this approach is based on the first law of thermodynamics and considers only the quantity of energy used without considering its “quality” and leads to a lack of information about the energy conversion processes. This is particularly true in the new low-energy buildings where sometimes high temperatures sources are used to meet low-temperature needs. The exergy analysis of a system, based on first and second thermodynamic laws, can be used to overcome this. In this work, it is proposed to compare the energy and the exergy consumption of several kinds of buildings to determine the best systems in terms of energy and exergy needs. The energy demand calculations are performed using the official software available in Belgium and some assumptions are implemented to consider the exergy approach. As exergy calculations require a reference state, some different climatic conditions are also investigated. Finally, some conclusions are discussed to rank the sources of energy and their related exergy losses. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","Building performance; CO2 reduction; Exergy; Exergy analysis","Buildings; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Temperature; Ventilation; Building performance; Climatic conditions; CO2 reduction; Energy performance of buildings; Exergy Analysis; First law of thermodynamics; Low energy buildings; Performance of buildings; Exergy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084244858

In the area of sustainability, there is an urgent need to apply technologies and methods that deliver better and more sustainable performance in a way that is cost-effective. Sustainability, adaptive and mitigative approaches to climate change, in the design of infrastructure, are therefore important steering elements [1]. A systematic and iterative analysis of the environmental impact of various design solutions is commonly suggested for infrastructure projects, but rarely happens. The lack of appropriate tools and skills for sustainable design was often quoted as a barrier to sustainable design [2]. To stay competitive and to meet upcoming stricter environmental regulations and customer requirements, designers have a key role in designing civil infrastructure so that it is environmentally sustainable. These and other factors have compelled the engineer to design with greater care and in more detail. The changing roles of engineers will be highlighted, to react to changes in climate. This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of eco efficient criteria on infrastructure projects. The use of the proposed criteria would ensure a sustainable design for township infrastructure services through the consideration of scare resources, ecological sensitivity in the design and planning of infrastructure projects. This paper also gives an overview of the proposed Green Township Infrastructure Design toolkit and promotes the use of green practices on infrastructure services design that is environmentally sound, placing fewer burdens on the environment. © 2016 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.","Eco-efficiency; Green infrastructure; Green technology; Infrastructure Design; Sustainable development","Climate change; Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Deforestation; Design; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Health hazards; Iterative methods; Water pollution; Eco-efficiency; Ecological sensitivity; Green infrastructure; Green technology; Infrastructure design; Infrastructure project; Infrastructure services; Sustainable performance; Sustainable development; construction industry; design; environmental impact; environmental technology; infrastructure; project design; standard (regulation); sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964624168

The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 2009 has envisaged adaptation through adoption of climate smart agriculture. Although the literature on agricultural adaptation in general has noticeably increased in recent times, little is known about the adoption of climate smart agriculture as a strategy of adaptation against climate change and extreme events. This study is intended to achieve two objectives. First, to assess the status of the adoption of climate smart agriculture as an adaptation strategy and second to examine the factors that influence the adoption of climate smart agriculture in environmentally stressed areas of coastal Bangladesh. The empirical part of this study was conducted in Dacope Upazila (sub-district) of south-west coastal Bangladesh. Two hundred and thirty five randomly selected households were interviewed through a semi-structured questionnaire during March–June in 2011. From a literature review, 25 indicators which capture three dimensions of climate smart agriculture, such as sustainability of production, resilience to change and the potential for mitigation of emissions were used in the questionnaire. Responses against each of these were rated in a 5-point Likert scale. Information about various socio-demographic, economic, ecological, and adaptive behavioural characteristics of households and their farms were collected as well. By employing the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) technique, weak adopters and strong adopters of the three dimensions of climate smart agriculture are identified. Finally, by employing the Multivariate Probit model, the influence of various factors on the adoption of climate smart agriculture are assessed. The adoption of sustainable production is mostly related to the frequent exposure to rainfall (irrigation facility), sharecropping, and the age of the household head. The adoption of adaptive measures for resilient agriculture are related to frequent exposures to dry spells, the size of farm landholding and frequent exposures to saline water. On the other hand the adoption of measures for the reduction of emissions are related to land degradation by salt, membership of a social group, and the education of the head of household. Other factors have very limited influence in this regard. Finally this study came up with some policy suggestions, the implementation of which would help the coastal inhabitants to better adopt climate smart agriculture as an adaptation strategy to ensure livelihood and food security against climate change and extreme events. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation; Bangladesh; Climate smart agriculture; Coastal livelihood; Food security",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071356880

This work also examines the variation of ambient air quality with various climatic conditions. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The quality of air was determined based on National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). This was carried out based on measuring four major air pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 at different climate conditions during January 2015 to December 2015. Respirable Dust Sampler (RDS) and Fine Particulate Sampler were used to determine PM10 and PM2.5 respectively. Findings: The present work shows its significance because there is no such data available for researchers for reference. Industrial (foundry units) and automobile emissions are the major pollution source which determines the quality of ambient air in the city. Among the different climatic conditions, summer exhibits more pollution level in the air while monsoon exhibits less pollution level. Results also reveals that the Industrial area experiencing more pollutants followed by commercial and residential areas. As per the AQI category, all locations are coming under moderate category except industrial location which requires stringent control measures to reduce the particulate matters in the air. Applications: Since no data is available for the Air Quality Index study of the region, this can be taken as a reference for future study.","Air quality index; Automobile emission; Dust sampler; Pollution level and particulate matter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995784766

While the debate over whether divestment is in line with fiduciary duty continues, there is some consensus that divestment, in theory, is consistent with meeting fiduciary duty. Yet, in practice, institutions fear divesting due to a lack of clear law on the issue and fiduciary standards that discourage departure from the status quo. The relatively new movement has largely avoided the courts up to this point. However, in November 2014, a group of Harvard students paved the way with a lawsuit against Harvard alleging claims of (1) ""mismanagement of charitable funds"" and (2) ""intentional investment in abnormally dangerous activities"" for failing to divest from fossil fuel stocks. Previous literature on the subject has focused on legislative and regulatory solutions rather than looking at possible legal claims that could compel divestment under current laws. The Harvard suit suggests, however, that there is a role for courts to play; litigation might be the only viable solution as legislative and regulatory attempts are moving too slowly and ineffectively to deal with the pressing nature of climate change. This Note argues that courts should recognize the special threat posed by climate change to humanity as well as to portfolio risks and returns, take an expansive view of the special duties charitable institutions and public entities owe, and require charitable and public institutions to take into account the effects of climate change when making investment decisions.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962082150

To tackle such problems, European-wide emission targets are becoming stricter and urban mobility plans are being drawn. Future scenarios for EU urban centres see a modal shift in personal mobility from cars to lighter, smaller, more specialised and environmentally friendly alternatives.ELVs (Electric L-category Vehicles) are part of such alternatives that can cater to the average commuter's needs because of their small size and light weight; that means low on board energy requirement and small batteries, which allows lower costs and faster recharge. However, this modal shift offers new challenges: many urban users do not consider LVs as a viable and comfortable option for their needs. Urban policies could encourage ELV adoption, but four limiting factors are slowing down the diffusion of ELVs: cost, energy efficiency, attractiveness of ELVs and drivers willingness to use. RESOLVE EU project, co-funded under European Green Vehicles Initiative, is aimed at making ELVs practical alternatives to cars, by encouraging a number of commuters to switch to narrow-track ELVs. Led by 2 largest LV manufacturers in EU and complemented by top component suppliers, Research Institutes and Universities, RESOLVE will give a contribution to reduction of overall urban traffic congestion, cutting commuting time and easing parking. To achieve its ambitious objectives, RESOLVE uses a holistic approach to explore solutions, culminating in two demonstration vehicles that will show the advances to the State-of-the-Art and could form a basis for attractive commercial ELV propositions. The project will start with user needs definition and market analysis, in order to ensure that expected technical results will be properly aimed. User needs will be identified taking into account the actual usage of either ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) PTWs or light-heavy quadricycles (L6-L7 category) and of supermini (M1 category) cars in cities and suburban areas, throughout European countries. The task will also allow seeing which is the market potential size and share (shift from car drivers) by analysing database on market data and trends for ICE and electric L vehicles. User needs will be both quantitative data (e.g. km ridden per days, travel path, time stop, required performance etc.) and qualitative ones (such as parking easiness, manoeuvrability, acceptability by women/men, elderly/young, experienced/inexperienced, riders/drivers, protection from rain, etc.). Outcomes are the basis to develop a number of technological advances that aim to maximise the energy efficiency of ELVs, such as regenerative braking and lightweight design, as well as to optimise ELV rider experience, such as active vehicle stability and handling, human machine interface (HMI) and measures to enhance comfort and weather protection. © 2016 The Authors.","electric vehicles; energy efficiency; L-category; powered-two-wheelers; urban mobility",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991627619

Americans use ∼30% of the world's energy, and in the US, small commercial buildings account for approximately 10% of the nation's energy consumption. As such, small commercial buildings became a focus of a $6 M investment by the US Department of Energy. One project included in the DOE's small building efforts developed a Small Commercial 2030 District Program and Toolkit. This toolkit helps small commercial buildings participate in Architecture 2030 Districts that have been proven successful at reducing energy and CO2 consumption, predominantly in large commercial buildings in urban areas. Part of this toolkit is a case study library that includes more than thirty small commercial building projects that achieved energy savings of up to 100%. The case study library includes small commercial building retrofits that address electricity, natural gas, and steam systems. This paper reports the end uses impacted from the retrofits and explores correlations with retrofit measures implemented, climate zone, end uses impacted, building type, and energy savings. In particular, we explore retrofit measures selected in different 2030 Districts and discuss why these trends may hold true. The paper concludes with a discussion of next steps in the research and possible implications of this project.","Energy efficiency; Retrofits; Small Commercial Buildings","Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Investments; Office buildings; Retrofitting; Sustainable development; Building types; Commercial building; End-uses; Retrofits; Small buildings; Steam systems; Urban areas; US Department of Energy; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999693646

Twenty-four 32-year-old teak trees were selected from Mae Jang and Mae Moh plantations, which were 5 km and 15 km from the Mae Moe power plant, respectively. Forty-eight sample cores were collected from the 24 trees (two cores per tree). The growth patterns of all the cores were analyzed following the standard methods of dendrochronology. The relationships between the growth pattern and the amounts of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter were measured as average daily rates and then analyzed. The study showed that the best-fit model for the relationship between the radial current annual increment at breast height (CAIdbh) and time (Y) was an exponential equation. The fitted equations were: CAIdbh = 10.657e(−0.031Y) for Mae Moh plantation and CAIdbh = 12.518e(−0.032Y) for Mae Jang plantation. The coefficient of determination for the fitted equations was 0.410 and 0.423 for the Mae Moh and Mae Jang plantations, respectively. Moreover, carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) had a statistically significant effect on radial teak growth (RT) in the Mae Jang plantation, with a coefficient of determination of 0.69 (RTmj = 0.571 + 0.429(CO) − 0.023(SO2)). © 2016","Gases; Growth; Mae Moh power plant; Particulate matter; Teak",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984640090

The high level of mainly informal urbanization in the Kathmandu Valley has led to severe environmental problems and loss of ecosystem services. As a consequence, the livelihoods of the 2.5 million inhabitants in the almost entirely built-up Kathmandu Valley are increasingly at risk, as seen in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquakes that caused widespread damage in the urban area. Combined risks from natural hazards and unsuitable urban planning are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Due to political instability during the past decades, the poor execution of existing plans and policies as well as the enactment of new ones remain challenging, without real signs for improvement. In addition, the complex governance system involving local, national and international actors is another challenge being faced in this urban agglomeration. Understanding of human-nature interactions, including values attached to natural assets by local communities, is crucial for the development of successful long-term strategies for risk reduction that integrate ecosystem-based solutions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Cultural values; Disaster risk reduction; Ecosystem services; Kathmandu; Livelihoods; Urban risk",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013996623

In particular, the depth at which sinking organic carbon is broken down and respired in the mesopelagic zone is critical, with deeper remineralization resulting in greater carbon storage. Until recently, however, a balanced budget of the supply and consumption of organic carbon in the mesopelagic had not been constructed in any region of the ocean, and the processes controlling organic carbon turnover are still poorly understood. Large-scale data syntheses suggest that a wide range of factors can influence remineralization depth including upper-ocean ecological interactions, and interior dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature. However, these analyses do not provide a mechanistic understanding of remineralization, which increases the challenge of appropriately modeling the mesopelagic carbon dynamics. In light of this, the UK Natural Environment Research Council has funded a programme with this mechanistic understanding as its aim, drawing targeted fieldwork right through to implementation of a new parameterization for mesopelagic remineralization within an IPCC class global biogeochemical model. The Controls over Ocean Mesopelagic Interior Carbon Storage (COMICS) programme will deliver new insights into the processes of carbon cycling in the mesopelagic zone and how these influence ocean carbon storage. Here we outline the programme's rationale, its goals, planned fieldwork, and modeling activities, with the aim of stimulating international collaboration. © 2016 Sanders, Henson, Martin, Anderson, Bernardello, Enderlein, Fielding, Giering, Hartmann, Iversen, Khatiwala, Lam, Lampitt, Mayor, Moore, Murphy, Painter, Poulton, Saw, Stowasser, Tarling, Torres-Valdes, Trimmer, Wolff, Yool and Zubkov.","Biogeochemical model; Biological carbon pump; Field campaign; Ocean carbon cycle; Science plan",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008684391

Applications of various construction methods are recognised as one of the options to minimise emissions at the construction stage of a building. The focus of this study is to compare emission distribution of different construction methods. Two case studies of conventional and semi pre-fabrication construction methods in Australia are employed to compare this emission variation of adopting different construction methods. It sets a system boundary of embodied emissions from building materials, emissions from construction equipment, transportation of building materials, prefabricated materials and construction waste. Quantitative models are developed to compute both greenhouse gas (GHG) and non-GHG emissions. An impact assessment was also carried out to examine the relative importance of impacts at global, regional and local perspectives. The case study results indicated that adopting pre-fabrication method offers a GHG emission reduction of 1.7% while an increase of non-GHG direct emissions by 0.9 to 3.5%. Global Warming Potential (GWP) remained the highest impact category for all the perspectives considered, with an overpowering 86.8% contribution from global perspective. However, this relative importance is reduced to 52%, with a relative increase in Eutrophication (EP) and Photochemical Oxidant Formation Potential (POFP) up to 21.74% and 27.14% at regional and local perspective. Emission increase due to transportation shows a relative increase in POFP potential for pre-fabrication. These results signify that non-GHG emissions should be given importance at regional and local perspective when using pre-fabrication method in construction. © 2016 International Committee of the SCMT conferences.

Installing biorefineries is an interesting alternative to address this problem because biomass can capture CO2 emissions during its growth. On the other hand, a new interesting approach to promote economic growth in low-income regions is through new eco-industries dedicated to cultivate trees and taking care of the forest. These forest plantations help to capture CO2 emissions produced by petroleum refineries and biorefineries. Therefore, a system able to integrate production of fuels through refineries and biorefineries with the use of forest plantations to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions can be an attractive solution to significantly improve the environmental sustainability. However, the implementation of this project has to consider several factors, including the life time of the project, the availability of resources, the amount and type of products that should be produced, the allocation and capacity of the involved refineries, biorefineries and forest plantations, among others. For this reason, this paper presents an optimization model for the optimal planning of an integrated system for the production of fossil fuels and biofuels considering the interaction with eco-industries, which are able to capture emissions from biorefineries and refineries and receive an economic benefit. The proposed mathematical model takes into account the availability of biomass, the production of oil, a set of existing biorefineries and refineries as well as the possibility to install new facilities. The mathematical approach was applied to a nationwide case study from Mexico, considering the creation of new jobs, overall emissions and net profit as objectives. The results are shown through a Pareto curve, which is useful to make decisions about the planning of the interactions between these types of industries as well as determining the supply chain configuration in order to satisfy overall demand of products. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biorefineries; Forest Plantations; Multi-objective; Optimization; Refineries",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994330145

However, capabilities to recirculate the processed gas are oftentimes compromised by the inability to surmount the pressure differential between the intake and exhaust manifolds. The issue is dealt with successfully by the turbocharged EGR system discussed in this article. The increased complexity of such an EGR system requires a multivariable control system in order to achieve the EGR set-point tracking across the desired operating range. In this work, model predictive control is used to naturally incorporate the information about system internal couplings and constraints via the prediction model. The states of the partially observed EGR system required for the feedback control are recovered by using the unscented Kalman filter. Finally, the designed unscented MPC (UMPC) system is validated by numerical simulations.

The methodology combines traffic and emission modelling at micro and macro scales. The integration of these scales is an important feature because a measure to influence the behaviour of single vehicles may have an impact on the whole network, while traffic management at the network level may influence the behaviour of the single vehicles. The paper presents results of a number of ITS systems including Variable Speed Limit (VSL), Green Navigation (GN), Urban Traffic Control (UTC), Ecodriving and Adaptive Cruise Control Systems (ACC). These measures have been tested for concrete application cases implemented in the cities of Turin, Madrid and Rome. Starting point were real-world data collected by means of floating cars. The investigations have taken into account different penetration rates of ICT measures, as well as different traffic conditions (e.g. free flow, congested). Each case has been modelled for the current and at least on future fleet composition. The results indicate that ITS are overall able to contribute to CO2 emissions reduction by several percent points; the effects, nevertheless, are different depending on local conditions. The CO2 benefit is also found to be constrained by the penetration rates of the on-road ITS equipped vehicles: as this share increases a maximum is reached at up to 50% penetration rate and under non-congested conditions. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","ADAS; CO2 quantification; eco-driving; energy consumption; ITS; mathematical models; sustainable mobility; traffic management systems",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991396303

Drought risk is one such threat which is projected to increase in frequency and intensity under such changing conditions. Many households are expected to suffer from these changes and associated risks such as drought. These risks may expose many vulnerable households in the absence of effective mitigation and adaptation measures. This study analyses climate change and drought risk vulnerability of marginal households exposed to such hazards. For this purpose, a field survey of 220 households in Balangir district of Odisha state in India was carried out using multistage random sampling technique. Using Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) and other indicators of vulnerability to socioeconomic domains defined by IPCC, the current level of household’s exposure and coping capacity is evaluated. Results indicate that vulnerability is a function of both climatic and non-climatic factors. The socio demographic characters like low literacy rates, resource availability and accessibility, social structure, etc., make people more vulnerable whereas access to social networks plays a significant role in uplifting the poor rural households.

Drought risk is one such threat which is projected to increase in frequency and intensity under such changing conditions. Many households are expected to suffer from these changes and associated risks such as drought. These risks may expose many vulnerable households in the absence of effective mitigation and adaptation measures. This study analyses climate change and drought risk vulnerability of marginal households exposed to such hazards. For this purpose, a field survey of 220 households in Balangir district of Odisha state in India was carried out using multistage random sampling technique. Using Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) and other indicators of vulnerability to socioeconomic domains defined by IPCC, the current level of household’s exposure and coping capacity is evaluated. Results indicate that vulnerability is a function of both climatic and non-climatic factors. The socio demographic characters like low literacy rates, resource availability and accessibility, social structure, etc., make people more vulnerable whereas access to social networks plays a significant role in uplifting the poor rural households. The research concludes that the impacts of climate change and drought risk expose those households disproportionately who are already vulnerable due to poverty, inequality and marginalisation.

However, opportunities for creating new areas of green space within cities are often limited and tree planting initiatives may be constrained to kerbside locations. At this scale, the net impact of trees on human health and the local environment is less clear, and generalised approaches for evaluating their impact are not well developed. In this review, we use an urban ecosystems services framework to evaluate the direct, and locally-generated, ecosystems services and disservices provided by street trees. We focus our review on the services of major importance to human health and well-being which include 'climate regulation', 'air quality regulation' and 'aesthetics and cultural services'. These are themes that are commonly used to justify new street tree or street tree retention initiatives. We argue that current scientific understanding of the impact of street trees on human health and the urban environment has been limited by predominantly regional-scale reductionist approaches which consider vegetation generally and/or single out individual services or impacts without considering the wider synergistic impacts of street trees on urban ecosystems. This can lead planners and policymakers towards decision making based on single parameter optimisation strategies which may be problematic when a single intervention offers different outcomes and has multiple effects and potential trade-offs in different places. We suggest that a holistic approach is required to evaluate the services and disservices provided by street trees at different scales. We provide information to guide decision makers and planners in their attempts to evaluate the value of vegetation in their local setting. We show that by ensuring that the specific aim of the intervention, the scale of the desired biophysical effect and an awareness of a range of impacts guide the choice of i) tree species, ii) location and iii) density of tree placement, street trees can be an important tool for urban planners and designers in developing resilient and resourceful cities in an era of climatic change. © 2016 Salmond et al.","Climate; Ecosystems services; Health impacts; Street trees","volatile organic compound; climate change; decision making; ecosystem service; greenspace; health impact; health services; holistic approach; public health; sustainability; trade-off; tree planting; urban area; urban planning; vegetation dynamics; air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric dispersion; city planning; climate; climate change; cultural factor; cultural value; environmental management; health status; human; microclimate; noise reduction; pollen; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; tree; urban area; vegetation; wellbeing; air pollution; city; city planning; environmental health; prevention and control; public health; tree; urban health; Air Pollution; Cities; City Planning; Environmental Health; Humans; Public Health; Trees; Urban Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995543025

However, MF treatment had significant positive effects on vegetative growth (number of leaves, growth rate, and fresh and dry weights) and also enhanced all gas exchange parameters including chlorophyll, net photosynthesis, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency, but reduced the intercellular CO2 concentration. At all salinity levels, a 40 mT was most effective. Therefore, water salinity up to 5000 ppm could be used through a MF at 40 mT to overcome the scarcity of irrigation water in arid areas such as the Alahsa Oasis, KSA.

Therefore, it is very important and challenging to properly integrate depositional and diagenetic facies in 3D static models. 3D property modeling routinely relies heavily on geostatistical propagation of well data, without considering and honoring depositional or diagenetic geological conceptual models. Hence the resulting images can be unrealistic and unreliable in predictions. Nevertheless, even when used, the facies don't tend to have any relationship with petrophysical properties if classified using the classical approaches which are based on depositional texture (e.g. Dunham Classification). The main objective is to build an integrated 3D static model that incorporates carbonate sequence stratigraphic zonation scheme, uses a suitable facies classification/clustering scheme other than ""Dunham Textural Classification"" to capture areal and vertical facies distribution as well as diagenetic overprints, and successfully and realistically constrains the petrophysical properties distribution within the 5th order carbonate cycles. 3D depositional and diagenetic facies modeling workflow has been established by considering an integrated approach to capture reservoir heterogeneities in the lower cretaceous carbonate reservoir. Consequently hierarchical 3D facies model was built in which large scale depositional facies form main framework per sequence by honoring conceptual depositional geological model. Within each depositional facies region the diagenetic facies are distributed stochastically under the guidance of established diagenetic trends to capture possible local variations. The petrophysical properties were then modeled, conditioned to the distributed diagenetic facies constraining the porosity and permeability ranges and trends to each particular diagenetic facies. In this study, in particular, diverting from the usual Dunham classification scheme has provided the advantage and freedom of being able to incorporate more information about the rock final state and texture into its nomenclature. Being sensitive to diagenetic overprint, it gives an insight into the reservoir quality and associated petrophysical properties variations. The established workflow enabled successful integration of the depositional and diagenetic patterns within the sequence stratigraphic framework and the ability to model it to establish a spatial link between geology and petrophysics. Blind tests revealed promising results in terms of properties predictability. Overall, the model is believed to be more representative of the geological understanding as it combines sedimentological framework and diagenetic overprint in carbonate reservoirs. This provides a robust tool for predicting reservoir architecture which can potentially lead to a better field development planning and improved decision making.

This article deals with problems related to POPs from the standpoint of their total life cycle and examines each category of intentionally and unintentionally produced chemicals. Environmental control challenges and experiences of dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, and brominated flame retardants were addressed. Polychlorinated dioxins have their various release sources, but in particular, thermal processes such as waste incineration are the main emission sources. The international community has addressed this issue by adopting technologies for complete combustion and advanced emission gas treatment. With these technologies, Japan has successfully achieved more than 95% reduction of dioxin emission. PCB-containing products manufactured in the past are thought to be the main source of PCB presence now in the environment. Thermal destruction and chemical dechlorination processes have been applied for such waste PCBs. It becomes clear that brominated flame retardants (BFRs) accumulate in the environment as well as in humans. Global-scale efforts have just begun to control BFRs. From now on, we should also address the problem of brominated dioxins and try to improve the related technologies and/or develop new technologies also in the future. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Brominated flame retardants; Environmental control; Polybrominated dibenzodioxin and dibenzofurans (PBDDs/DFs); Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs/DFs); Product life cycles",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975855883

HR6W (44Ni-23Cr-7W) is a candidate material for application in the maximum temperature areas of A-USC boilers. In this study, the creep rupture properties of plastic deformed material were investigated in comparison with those of solution treated material, in order to clarify the capability of HR6W as a material for use in A-USC plants. The creep strength of 20% pre-strained HR6W was found to increase substantially as compared with the solution treated material. 20% pre-strained material is in a state where high dislocation density has been introduced by plastic forming strain, with M23C6 and Laves phase precipitating preferentially by dislocation diffusion from the early stages of creep. In particular, since high dislocation density is accumulated in connection with creep deformation near the grain boundaries, precipitation is accelerated and the grain boundaries are covered with M23C6 from the early stages of creep. Then, even though the intragranular precipitate density decreases, given that the fraction of grain boundaries affected by precipitation is maintained in a high state, it is presumed that a high density of dislocation is maintained in the long-term region.

Although the first PhD programme in music was established in 2005, there are only four universities that provide doctoral programmes in music in 2016. However, there are a couple of universities that plan to launch doctoral music programmes in the near future. If the number of doctoral programmes in music and the number of graduates has started to grow, it is important to consider the barriers to doctoral music student socialisation because they relate to the completion of the degree. This paper aims to investigate barriers that Thai doctoral music students encounter in doctoral socialisation. This leads to the main question: What are the barriers that Thai doctoral music students encounter in doctoral socialisation? The key instrument used for this research was in-depth interviews with 12 doctoral students and graduates during four different stages of doctoral education across four Thai universities that have launched PhD programmes in music. The results indicated that barriers to Thai doctoral music student socialisation emerge from three segments: 1) student-related barriers (backgrounds, predispositions, investment, personal communities, self-concept and psychological issues); 2) barriers of integrating into the doctoral programme (learning, peer climate, relationships with faculty and friends and dissertation phases); and 3) institutional barriers (admissions, academic programme curriculums and requirements).","Barriers in doctoral socialisation; Doctoral education; Doctoral music student; Doctoral socialisation; Thai PhD music",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026773754

Regardless of energy consumption, the treatment plants have been designed based on experience rather than the latest scientific findings. The treatment plants are considered as a part of energy equipment which largely consumed electrical energy. Thus, electricity is the great part of the costs of plant utilization so that 25% -40% of the total costs of the wastewater treatment process is related to energy supplies. Therefore, energy is regarded as an important factor in treatment plant costs. This has caused designers to adopt new methods to reduce energy consumption. The study in 2010 indicated that 50-60% of energy consumed by treatment plants is related to the aeration process. Nowadays, due to the rapid population growth along with recent advances in technology and industry, the amount of pollution has been increased. In addition, environmental standards for effluent quality and its recycling process for different utilization have become much stricter. What was mentioned above increases energy consumption. Hence, energy efficiency, effectiveness of the plan and the utilized equipment and technologies, energy recovery processes and effective cost management has been recently considered more seriously. Additionally, enhancement of energy efficiency, which means a further reduction in energy consumption, greenhouse gases production and operation costs of wastewater treatment plants, has become more important. The principal concern of the wastewater industry has always been measures to meet water quality standards in order to keep public trust. Thus, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are usually designed to meet certain effluent requirements, without major energy consideration. Wastewater treatment plants are generally very energy-intensive and expensive to operate. WWTPs are hardly designed for energy efficiency in mind. Their design and operation are often based on intuition and experience, rather than on optimal trajectories or set points. The amount of energy consumed by treatment plants is counted as a major factor to determine optimum performance. Moreover, due to the fact that the treatment plant system of industrial zones is energy consuming. The energy subsidies have been cut and water and electricity tariffs have been raised, thus, energy management has become far more important. To design treatment plant equipment, it is necessary to adopt approaches which lead to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency. Knowledge of the real operating efficiency of WWPTs is the starting point for any energy saving initiative. A study was conducted in 2012 in Sweden on WWTPs energy consumption in which aeration was controlled to reduce energy consumption in a treatment plant to employ activated sludge which affected the amount of dissolved oxygen, the efficiency of the aeration process, and equally the results from treatment process. The amount of energy consumed by treatment plants depends on air flow rate and consequently the rate of oxygen consumption. The rate of oxygen consumption in the activated sludge system is changed by changing the concentration of ammonium or ammonia in the effluent. Therefore, reduction in the amount of ammonium in the effluent, have reduced air flow rate and consequently the rate of oxygen and the amount of electricity consumption. A study in 2011 in Spain performed on the factors affecting the plant energy consumption. The results indicated that the average amount of energy consumed by WWTPs depends on the input quality parameters, treatment technology, effluent quality and the size of the plant. Furthermore, the amount of energy consumed by smaller plants per unit area is higher compared with the larger plants. In an article in 2012, the amount of energy consumption was studied in each physical unit. This study found that there is a strong relationship between biological activity and demand for electricity. In 2013, a study conducted to optimize pumps performance and aeration process in treatment plants. The results suggested that the pumping stations and the aeration in activated sludge process are the most energy consuming parts in treatment plants which consume 22% and 42% of electrical energy, respectively. Thus, in order to reduce energy consumption, the pumps performance should be improved and aeration processes should be optimized. In the present study, the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of industrial zone of Nasirabad was studied which works with a combination of Up flow Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (UABR) system and Integrated Fixed Activated Sludge (IFAS). Material and methods: The aim of this paper is to calculate the electrical energy in different processes for industrial wastewater treatment plants and also to estimate effective electrical energy to remove 1 Kg COD. To this end, Nasir Abad industrial wastewater treatment plant was investigated on the basis of energy. The treatment process includes up flow Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (UABR) coupled with Intergraded Fixed/Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) reactors. The present study was conducted using statistical methods and data collection through observation and field study of wastewater treatment plant of industrial town of Nasirabad. Data were analyzed through drawing tables and charts in Excel along with making engineering judgment. In order to study electrical energy consumption in treatment plant of the industrial zone of Nasirabad, the electricity bills for different months of 2012 and 2013 are checked. The average daily electrical energy consumptions per 1 cubic meter of wastewater as calculated during these years were 9.42Kwh and 9.73 KWh, respectively. Energy consumption varies at different times of day. Thus, electrical energy falls in three categories namely Peak Load, Medium Load, and Low Load periods. According to the table, the Peak Load was set up by the Electricity Distribution Company of Mazandaran province, Iran. Thus, 12 hours out of 24 hours a day is considered to be the Medium Load, 6 hours is considered to be the Low Load, and the remaining 6 hours is considered to be the Peak Load period. However, the beginning and ending time of the each group varies from season to season. The electrical energy consumption related to each group (Peak Load, Medium Load, and Low Load periods) is multiplied by the corresponding times and the sum is considered as the electrical energy consumption relating to the period. Results and discussion: The electromechanical equipment of plant in each unit was examined separately and the energy consumption for each unit was evaluated. The units consist of Pumping station, Grit and grease removal tank, equalization tank, Aeration tank, sand filter, disinfectant system, sludge storage, and filter press. The electrical energy obtained from electrical bills includes the energy consumed by the treatment plant equipment, control room, laboratory, and electrical lighting. In this study, the energy used in the treatment plant units was considered as effective energy and the one used in the sections outside of the units was considered as ineffective energy. For exact specification of the energy consumed by the units (the effective energy) and ineffective energy, the electro mechanic equipment should be examined. Therefore, the field study on the treatment plant of the industrial town of Nasirabad was conducted and different treatment processes were examined. The inflow discharge entered into the treatment plant was approximately 620 m3/day. In order to measure the amount of electrical energy used to remove one kilogram COD, the input and output COD were achieved in mg/lit. The entire procedure of the sampling and testing was performed according to the instructions and guidelines provided in the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater. Given the fact that the average inflow discharge was in m3/day, the removed COD was defined in Kg/day and the effective energy was in Kwh/m3, the amount of energy per 1 kilogram COD is in Kw. In this WWTP, about %32 of total electrical energy were used for aeration purposes and about %43 in sludge treatment equipment and %25 in primary treatment, disinfectant system and etc. The influent was measured 620 cubic meter for day and the pump efficiency was assumed %80. The effective daily electrical energy as the energy used in the treatment process was 5.6 Kwh. The non-effective electrical energy that used in other process in Nasirabad industrial wastewater treatment plant for the years of 2012 and 2013 were calculated 3.82Kwh and 4.13kWh. In addition, the amount of electrical energy per 1 kilogram of the removed chemical oxygen demand (COD) was obtained. The use of energy for removing 1 kg COD for the years of 2012 and 2013 were equal to 2.68 Kwh and 2.5 Kwh. Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that energy consumption is not effectively managed in the treatment plant of Nasirabad and that efficient use of electrical energy, make it possible to preserve electrical energy sources as a national asset and also for considerable economization. Moreover, the effective aeration optimization of the pumps and blowers performance in the aeration basin is an important tool to minimize energy consumption in WWPTs. This is a tool to control the aeration system for aeration is a costly process and closely linked to energy consumption. Therefore, the efforts to reduce the overall energy use in WWTPs have largely concentrated on improvement of pumping and optimization aeration. The sludge management and reduction should be considered more seriously. The electrical energy consumed in pumps and blowers has a direct relationship with the rate of aeration in the basins and the level of pressure drop.","COD; Electrical energy consumption; Industrial wastewater treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012299304

Here we provide findings of an international research project investigating the health and wellbeing impacts of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments. Methods: Five European and two Chinese city authorities and partner academic organisations formed the project consortium. The methodology involved modelling the impact of adopted urban climate-change mitigation transport, buildings and energy policy scenarios, usually for the year 2020 and comparing them with business as usual (BAU) scenarios (where policies had not been adopted). Carbon dioxide emissions, health impacting exposures (air pollution, noise and physical activity), health (cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer and leukaemia) and wellbeing (including noise related wellbeing, overall wellbeing, economic wellbeing and inequalities) were modelled. The scenarios were developed from corresponding known levels in 2010 and pre-existing exposure response functions. Additionally there were literature reviews, three longitudinal observational studies and two cross sectional surveys. Results: There are four key findings. Firstly introduction of electric cars may confer some small health benefits but it would be unwise for a city to invest in electric vehicles unless their power generation fuel mix generates fewer emissions than petrol and diesel. Second, adopting policies to reduce private car use may have benefits for carbon dioxide reduction and positive health impacts through reduced noise and increased physical activity. Third, the benefits of carbon dioxide reduction from increasing housing efficiency are likely to be minor and co-benefits for health and wellbeing are dependent on good air exchange. Fourthly, although heating dwellings by in-home biomass burning may reduce carbon dioxide emissions, consequences for health and wellbeing were negative with the technology in use in the cities studied.Conclusions: The climate-change reduction policies reduced CO2 emissions (the most common greenhouse gas) from cities but impact on global emissions of CO2 would be more limited due to some displacement of emissions. The health and wellbeing impacts varied and were often limited reflecting existing relatively high quality of life and environmental standards in most of the participating cities; the greatest potential for future health benefit occurs in less developed or developing countries. © 2016 Heaviside et al.","Air pollution; Buildings; China; Energy; Europe; Greenhouse gas emission reduction policies; Health; Transport; Urban; Wellbeing","atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; building; car use; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; electric vehicle; emission control; energy policy; environmental policy; health impact; policy approach; pollution exposure; power generation; public health; quality of life; urban policy; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; cardiovascular disease; China; city planning; climate change; cost benefit analysis; energy conservation; Europe; exhaust gas; health hazard; housing; human; leukemia; neoplasm; noise reduction; physical activity; policy; priority journal; public health; respiratory tract disease; socioeconomics; traffic and transport; urban area; wellbeing; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; climate change; cross-sectional study; European Union; gas; government regulation; greenhouse effect; health care policy; legislation and jurisprudence; longitudinal study; prevention and control; public health; China; Europe; air pollutant; gas; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Climate Change; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe; European Union; Gases; Government Regulation; Greenhouse Effect; Health Policy; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995695073

The industrial area of Mamonal includes companies producing chemicals, plastics, soft drinks, tanneries, cement, metallurgy, oil, pesticides, and processing of dairy products, meat, fish and seafood. This area contains 70% of the petrochemical sector in the region. The implementation of a regulatory modeling analysis using AERMOD, which simulated air quality concentrations in the area, was studied. The results of different modeling scenarios showed that contributions from wind erosion were less than 50% with respect to the modeled impact of the overall operation of the port. Even in the most critical scenarios, pollutant concentration occurred especially within port operations. Under normal expected conditions and measures according to the particle size analysis, the effects of wind erosion were up 2.4% of measured air quality in the docking station. Analysis of particle size of the piles and local weather conditions revealed that it can be argued that windbreak wall do not contribute to reducing emissions and wind erosion are not representative in the study area.

Background: Pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common complaint, especially in the abdomen, back, and shoulder region. Patients and methods: In a double blind randomized clinical trial, 150 patients were assigned to the three groups (50 patients in each group). Group A received intraperitoneal irrigation normal saline (NS). Groups B and C received irrigation sodium bicarbonate and none irrigation, respectively. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) for 6, 18 and 24 hours postoperatively, as well as one week after the surgery. Data analysis was performed using SPSS ver18 and chi-square, Fisher's Exact Test, on-way ANOVA and repeated measure ANOVA tests. Results: Patients in groups showed no significant difference in terms of age, gender, past medical history and smoking history (p>0.05). Left shoulder tip pain was significantly lower only between the sodium bicarbonate group and non-washing group at 6, 18, and 24 hours postoperatively (P=0.04, P=0.02 and P=0.009 respectively). There was no significant difference between the three treatment groups in right shoulder tip pain, back pain and port site incisional pain. Conclusion: In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, peritoneal irrigation with sodium bicarbonate may reduce the intensity of postoperative shoulder tip pain and is an effective method for improving the quality of life within the early recovery period. © 2016 RIGLD, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases.","Intraperitoneal irrigation; Laparoscopic cholecystectomy; Postoperative pain; Sodium bicarbonate","bicarbonate; adult; age; application site pain; Article; backache; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; human; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; major clinical study; male; medical history; outcome assessment; pain assessment; peritoneum lavage; postoperative pain; postoperative period; randomized controlled trial; sex difference; shoulder pain; smoking; treatment response; visual analog scale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976321983

Road emission was estimated based on the data from 2012 in regard to the traffic volume and the types of vehicles. Meteorological data were acquired from the station located in the vicinity of the examined canyon. Ambient air quality was determined based on the monitoring data from the urban background station in Krakow. The calculation results were compared with the 1-hour concentration measurements from the traffic station located on the green belt between the two lanes of the analysed canyon. The analysis was restricted to the nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) and the PM10 and PM2.5 particulate matter concentrations. Model evaluation was carried out according to the methodology of the air quality models assessment. Values of OSPM model statistical evaluation parameters fall within the range of “good models”, which indicates a very good quality of this model calculation results. A very strong correlation between the results of calculations and the observations was found, particularly for the particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 . Correlation coefficient values for these pollutants are 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. A detailed analysis revealed that the overall quality of the model is better with respect to nitrogen dioxide than for the analysed dust pollutants. However, this model is burdened with a tendency to underestimate 1-hour concentrations of particulate matter, which can be associated with: negligence of the lifting effect of the dust deposited on the road surface, the effect of removing the particulate filters from vehicles and the adequate ambient air quality for the analysed monitoring site. Very good agreement of the simulation results and observations indicates that the OSPM modelling system can be successfully applied to support the air quality management system in Krakow. © 2018, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

A Three-wheeled Urban Electric Vehicle is one of the new concept of future vehicles. This concept is getting popular due to CO2 emission regulation, environmental pollution and rising energy demands. The Three-wheeled Urban Electric Vehicle (TWUEV) has high-efficiency and easy-parking mechanism because of its three-wheeled structure and in-wheel motor technology. However, the vehicle has different handling and ride feeling and lateral stability by the characteristics of three-wheeled structure and rear-wheel steering system. From this reason, reference model following controller (MFC) has developed to emulate ideal four-wheel steering vehicle’s dynamic characteristic. Furthermore, the controller should be applicable in real world. So, 1/5 scaled model vehicle is designed with R/C car component. Wheel speed encoder and 6-DOF IMU sensor are installed with Arduino controller. Arduino control logic is developed with considering hardware limitations such as motor torque limitation and road-tire friction coefficient.

Substituted cobalt ions and manganese ions were in a mixed valence state consisting of Co3+/Co2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+, respectively. The Co K-edges were shifted toward low energy by an increase in the Co content, which indicates that Co3+ (0.55 Å) is reduced to Co2+ (0.65 Å). The decrease in the difference in ionic radii between B-site elements relieved the octahedral distortion as confirmed by a decrease in the peak intensity in the Fourier transformed EXAFS of the Co K-edge. The lattice volume increased up to 1.4 and 1.9 vol.% with Co content and temperature, respectively. The Co-O bond angle was closer to 180°C with an increase in Co content thereby leading to an increase in the oxygen ion conductivity. Therefore, the relaxation of the distortion by substitution of cobalt ions should affect the improvement in the oxygen mobility. The polarization resistances of the SCMCo-SDC composite cathodes at 650°C were decreased up to four times with an increase in the cobalt content, and the power densities of the single cells (Ni-SDC/SDC/SCMCo-SDC) were also enhanced up to 177% with increasing cobalt content. © The Author(s) 2016.

The enhancement effect (described in terms of the oxidation current increases) is even more pronounced when the catalytic centres have been supported on nanostructured ZrO2. In the case of Pd catalysts, a large population of hydroxyl groups and a high mobility of interfacial protons (on zirconia) seem to favour the direct oxidation path to CO2, whereas in the case of Pt-based systems, the enhancement effect is related to the oxidative removal of otherwise passivating CO adsorbates (indirect oxidation path).

Longterm goal is the simulation of real fluid cooling channel flows for liquid rocket engines (LREs). To verify the infrastructure of the code, a numerical micro-tube flow test case based on methane is selected. Due to severe problems in solving the stiff thermodynamics for real propellants and that security restrictions for experiments impede the use of hydrogen as propellant, most of the validation experiments are conducted with nitrogen. The use of nitrogen under supercritical pressure is an accepted strategy towards high pressure liquid rocket engine flows. To enable the computations, a modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin (MBWR) real fluid thermodynamic treatment and several boundary conditions have been implemented accounting for high pressure internal flow with heat transfer. Fluid properties have been chosen to supercritical pressure and subcritical temperatures at the inflow and supercritical pressure and temperature at the outflow due to heating. This ensures fluid conditions in the pseudo-critical region. In conclusion it can be shown that the TAU code is suitable to deal with real fluid convective heat transfer, although there are still a few stability concerns regarding realistic propellants like hydrogen and methane. By changing the infrastructure of the MBWR lookup table it is, eventually, possible to get a good trade-off between stability and performance. © 2016 Avestia Publishing.","Heat transfer; Pseudo-critical; Supercritical fluid; Turbulent pipe flow",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053289824

With California's Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP) as a case study, this paper assesses the distribution of rebates across census tracts and socioeconomic divisions. Race-ethnicity, income, and socioeconomic and environmental disadvantage were used to understand variations in rebate allocation across census tracts in California between 2010 and 2015. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and negative binomial regressions were conducted to identify the definitive effect that income played in obtaining rebates: wealthier census tracts secure more rebates. Furthermore, this analysis determined a significant and negative relationship between the proportion of Hispanic and African-American residents and the number of rebates received per household, even when controlling for income. These findings suggest that the distribution of CVRP rebates is problematic across economic and racial-ethnic lines, especially given current policies pertaining to climate change equity.

An analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations was made using hourly data on ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the period from May to September 2008 to 2012 from automatic air quality monitoring stations in Warsaw. The analysis uses data for seven stations located in different parts of the conurbation, which represent different types of areas. WE was then calculated using four methods, one of which was based on a calculation of the difference between the maximum daily ozone concentrations on weekends and the concentrations on weekdays. The results showed that most stations see higher concentrations of ozone during the weekend than on weekdays. This confirms the existence of WE, especially in the area of Granica, west of Warsaw in Kampinos National Park. At stations located within the city, average and maximum values of daily ozone concentrations are 13% and 8% higher on weekends than on weekdays, respectively, despite a reduction in NO2 concentrations of about 20%. Analysis of the diurnal ozone and nitrogen oxide (NOx) behaviour confirms the hypothesis that the most likely cause of the higher mean ozone levels on weekends is a reduction in ozone suppression due to lower NOx emissions on weekend mornings. The reduction in emissions in industrial/traffic-heavy sectors on Sunday leads to a greater reduction in NOxrelative to volatile organic compounds (VOC), and thus an increase in VOC/NOx ratios during weekends. © 2016, HARD Publishing Company.

Such particulars assisted with crossing the hurdles of standing of Dutch citizens in a climate change case, and the imposition of liability on the State for transboundary harm. Secondly, in relation to the separation of powers, there is clearly a marriage of ‘diffused’ jurisprudence from other jurisdictions and Dutch legal particulars with the primary effect of providing Connecticut v AEP a second life. Thirdly, aspects of the Court’s reasoning are ‘diffusible’ or amenable to transnational borrowing. Notable in this regard is the Court’s adoption of a procedural version of the precautionary principle, whereby the onus of proving adequacy and effectiveness of climate policy is shifted on to the State. However, caution must be exercised in adopting the Court’s reasoning as to why the international (namely the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is identified as a preferred benchmark for allocation of climate targets as against the supranational (namely the Effort Sharing Decision of the EU) and the implicit economic reasoning as to why the State’s policies are ineffective. To overcome this problem, it is suggested that the appointment of experts by judicial bodies may be the way forward. © 2016 The Author(s).","Climate litigation; Comparative law; Cost-benefit analysis; Precautionary principle; Separation of powers; The Netherlands; Urgenda case",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007165597

However, beef production in well-managed grazing systems can aid in soil carbon sequestration (SCS), which is often ignored when assessing beef production impacts on climate change. To estimate the carbon footprint and climate change mitigation potential of upper Midwest grass-finished beef production systems, we conducted a partial life cycle assessment (LCA) comparing two grazing management strategies: 1) a non-irrigated, lightly-stocked (1.0 AU/ha), high-density (100,000 kg LW/ha) system (MOB) and 2) an irrigated, heavily-stocked (2.5 AU/ha), low-density (30,000 kg LW/ha) system (IRG). In each system, April-born steers were weaned in November, winter-backgrounded for 6 months and grazed until their endpoint the following November, with average slaughter age of 19 months and a 295 kg hot carcass weight. As the basis for the LCA, we used two years of data from Lake City Research Center, Lake City, MI. We included greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with enteric CH4, soil N2O and CH4 fluxes, alfalfa and mineral supplementation, and farm energy use. We also generated results from the LCA using the enteric emissions equations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We evaluated a range of potential rates of soil carbon (C) loss or gain of up to 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Enteric CH4 had the largest impact on total emissions, but this varied by grazing system. Enteric CH4 composed 62 and 66% of emissions for IRG and MOB, respectively, on a land basis. Both MOB and IRG were net GHG sources when SCS was not considered. Our partial LCA indicated that when SCS potential was included, each grazing strategy could be an overall sink. Sensitivity analyses indicated that soil in the MOB and IRG systems would need to sequester 1 and 2 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 for a net zero GHG footprint, respectively. IPCC model estimates for enteric CH4 were similar to field estimates for the MOB system, but were higher for the IRG system, suggesting that 0.62 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 greater SCS would be needed to offset the animal emissions in this case.","GHG emissions; Grass-finishing beef; Soil organic carbon sequestration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011076330

The Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM) simulates representative crop, beef, or dairy farms over many years of weather to predict performance, economics, and environmental impacts including various emissions and a farm-gate life cycle assessment of carbon, energy, water, and reactive nitrogen footprints of the feed, meat, or milk produced. To illustrate use of the model, a representative dairy farm in central New York was simulated over 25 years of recent historical weather to determine the environmental benefits and economic costs of alternative manure handling strategies. Use of an enclosed manure storage with a flare to burn the methane produced decreased the farm-gate carbon footprint of the milk produced by 20% at an increased annual cost of $42 cow-1. Using an anaerobic digester to produce gas and electricity used on the farm reduced the carbon footprint by 19% and reduced profitability by $56 cow-1. The addition of subsurface injection of manure along with a reduction in N fertilizer use greatly reduced ammonia emission from the farm and increased annual profit by $9 cow-1. Climate change is projected to affect many aspects of dairy production, including growing season length, crop growth processes, harvest timing and losses, cattle performance, nutrient emissions and losses, and ultimately farm profitability. Climate projections for high and low emission scenarios were downscaled from nine general circulation models. IFSM was then used to simulate the same New York dairy farm over 25-year periods using recent, mid-century, and late century climate projected by each of the climate models. Simulations were done without and with adaptation through modified crop varieties and planting and harvest dates. Forage production normally increased with projected climate change and corn grain yields decreased, and together feed production was maintained. Warmer temperatures increased volatile loss of ammonia N, and changes in precipitation patterns increased nutrient runoff losses in surface water. The reactive N footprint of the milk produced was increased by 2% to 11% with the change in climate, but other environmental footprints were relatively unaffected. With appropriate adaptation to climate change, annual farm profitability increased by about $100 cow-1. However, for the high emission, late century projection, profit decreased by $10 cow-1 and the risk or annual variance in profit increased by 34%, reflecting greater annual variation in crop and animal productivity. Whole-farm and climate models provide useful tools for studying the benefits and costs of greenhouse gas mitigation and the adaptation of farms to changing climate. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Adaptation; Climate change; Farm model; Greenhouse gas; IFSM; Mitigation","Ammonia; Carbon footprint; Climate models; Costs; Crops; Dairies; Environmental impact; Farms; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Manures; Nutrients; Profitability; Surface waters; Adaptation; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Farm model; Greenhouse gas mitigation; IFSM; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mitigation; Climate change; adaptive management; annual variation; carbon footprint; climate change; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; dairy farming; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; general circulation model; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; mitigation; performance assessment; surface water; variance analysis; New York [United States]; United States; Animalia; Bos; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007377007

The characterization is undertaken as part of a Phase III project conducted by the Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP). The target unit is the upper most Morrow sandstone bed (Morrow B Sand). Extensive data acquired from FWU was used to improve previously constructed static and dynamic models. The Morrow B reservoir was deposited as fluvial low-stand to transgressive clastic fill within an incised valley. It is predominantly, subarkosic, brown to grey, upper medium to very coarse sands and fine gravels with sub-angular, to sub-rounded poorly sorted grains either planar to massively bedded. It was shown that primary depositional fabrics have less effect than post depositional diagenetic features do on reservoir performance, although subtle variations in deposition may have had some effect on later diagenetic pathways. Three new wells were drilled for the purpose of field infilling and characterization. Cores and advanced wire-line logs from these wells were analyzed for stratigraphic context, sedimentological character and depositional setting in order to better predict porosity and permeability trends within the reservoir. Structural modeling was conducted through the integration of depth-converted 3D seismic data with well log data to create the framework stratigraphic intervals. This information, together with additional core, UBI image logs and an improved hydraulic flow unit methodology (HFU) was used to characterize and subsequently create a fine scale lithofacies based geological model of the field. Core and log analysis allowed subdivision of the target interval into Hydraulic Flow Units (HFUs). The HFU approach enhanced core analysis and was used to elucidate porosity - permeability correlations. This methodology proved to be an exceptional approach to assigning permeability as a function of porosity during petrophysical modeling. The integrated approach of combining seismic attributes with core calibrated facies and the HFU methodology was able to better constrain uncertainty within inter-well spacing and accurately quantify reservoir heterogeneity within FWU. The approach illustrated in this study presents an improved methodology in characterizing heterogeneous and complex reservoirs that can be applied to reservoirs with similar geological features.

A large number of those are naturally fractured and oil-or mixed-wet. Waterflooding efficiency is often very low for such reservoirs because of both high fracture-To-matrix permeability contrast and unfavorable wettability. The recovery of the oil trapped in the matrix is then very challenging. To enhance this recovery, several recovery mechanisms can be assessed: - capillary imbibition by using wettability modifiers, - viscous drive by imposing a pressure gradient in the fracture network, - water-oil gravity drainage by using low IFT surfactants formulation. This paper presents an experimental approach that evaluates different chemical EOR alternatives using one or several of the three previous recovery mechanisms. The experiments consist in injecting an aqueous chemical solution or a foam containing chemical additives into an artificially fractured carbonate core. The imbibition is monitored with a recent CT-scanner allowing the local quantitative monitoring of three phases, including accurate quantification of matrix oil recovery. This paper is mainly focused on the impacts of foaming agents and of wettability modifiers, implemented separately or jointly. The experiments have also been conducted on several cores of different permeability, resulting in various permeability contrasts between matrix and fracture. A major result concerns the kinetics of oil recovery by chemical additives, that is greatly increased when a viscous drive is applied across the matrix medium via the circulation of foam in the fracture. Experiments in fractured cores of different permeabilities indicate that foam does not penetrate the matrix but drives the chemical aqueous phase into the matrix due to the generated pressure gradient. Detailed analysis of oil mobilization dynamics is provided. These foam flow experiments are compared with former chemical imbibition tests on non-fractured cores, for further insight of the role played by viscous forces. The comparison of tested recovery scenarios leads to conclusions regarding optimal chemical EOR strategies for naturally-fractured carbonate reservoirs with poor secondary recovery prognosis.

The region covers an area of 1,395,975 ha. We used images made by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor (OLI/Landsat-8) to produce mappings, and image segmentation techniques to produce vectors with homogeneous characteristics. The training samples and the samples used for classification and validation were collected from the segmented image. To quantify the C stocked in aboveground live biomass (AGLB), we used an indirect method and applied literature-based reference values. The recovery of 205,690 ha of a secondary Native Forest (NF) after 1985 sequestered 9.7 Tg (Teragram) of C. Considering the whole NF area (455,232 ha), the amount of C accumulated along the whole watershed was 35.5 Tg, and the whole Eucalyptus crop (EU) area (113,600 ha) sequestered 4.4 Tg of C. Thus, the total amount of C sequestered in the whole watershed (NF + EU) was 39.9 Tg of C or 145.6 Tg of CO2, and the NF areas were responsible for the largest C stock at the watershed (89%). Therefore, the increase of the NF cover contributes positively to the reduction of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) may become one of the most promising compensation mechanisms for the farmers who increased forest cover at their farms. © 2016 SPIE.","Eucalyptus; Forestry dynamics; Native forest; Paraíba do Sul River watershed; Remote sensing","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Hydrology; Image segmentation; Land use; Remote sensing; Secondary recovery; Timber; Watersheds; Aboveground live biomass; Compensation mechanism; Eucalyptus; Land use and land cover change; Native forests; Operational land imager; River watersheds; Segmentation techniques; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011110643

In natural photosynthesis, the water oxidation reaction is catalyzed by μ-oxido-Mn4Ca clusters in photosystem II (PSII). Herein, we report the fabrication of nanostructured biomimetic calcium manganese oxides (CaxMnOy) via a simple process under mild conditions utilizing H2O2 as an oxidant and TMAOH (tetramethylammonium hydroxide) as an alkaline source. CaxMnOy materials with x higher than 0.26 are composed of nanoparticles with particle sizes ranging from 15 to 30 nm according to the result of HRTEM. The results of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) indicate that calcium manganese oxides have similar structural motifs to the catalytically active site for water oxidation in PSII. It was also found that the content of Ca and the concentration of H2O2 in the initial mixture could affect the crystallinity and the average Mn valence state of calcium manganese oxides. Water oxidation experiments for both chemical and photocatalytic systems suggest that the disordered structure of calcium manganese oxides and a modest valence state of Mn (+3.7 to +3.8) are necessary for achieving high activity. Our method provides a strategy for synthesis and modulation of nanostructured biomimetic water oxidation catalysts. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Alkalinity; Biomimetic processes; Biomimetics; Calcium; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Energy conversion; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Manganese removal (water treatment); Oxidation; Oxides; Pollution control; Water absorption; X ray absorption; Carbon dioxide reduction; Disordered structures; Manganese oxide catalyst; Photocatalytic systems; Photocatalytic water splitting; Tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide; Water oxidation catalysts; X ray absorption fine structures; Manganese oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968750645

The viability study is conducted through technical and life cycle cost analysis, complemented with impact on greenhouse gas emissions reduction when energy efficiency measures are implemented on: lighting, pumps, chiller and building envelope of an existing hotel located in the resort. Results of the analysis demonstrate that overall, the proposed energy efficiency measures may provide significant savings, but the lighting and use of more efficient chiller (higher COP) are the most effective measures for energy savings. The energy savings resulting from the replacement of lighting and chiller are of the order of 35% and 45%, respectively, while emissions reduction resulted in the order of 34% and 45%, respectively. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the importance of the cost of electricity, which played the role as the most fundamental element in favor of the proposed efficiency measures. The overall proposed measures would lead to a reduction of 695 tCO2/year, an equity-IRR of 22%, NPV 4450 , Benefit-Cost of 2.93 and equity payback time of 5.1 years, which proves the remarkable financial and environmental advantages of the proposed energy efficiency measures. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

It begins with workforce skill assessment, followed by an organizational commitment to effective, lasting training. This paper is for middle and upper level managers, facility managers, energy managers, engineers, and project managers seeking to prepare their FM departments for the sustainable workplace. Topics include a review of operation and maintenance (O&M) best practices for energy efficiency, an assessment of the O&M workforce within the facilities department, and a summary of the competency areas for improved O&M practices. It therefore continues to be the policy of the United States that agencies shall increase efficiency and improve their environmental performance. Improved environmental performance will help us protect our planet for future generations and save taxpayer dollars through avoided energy costs and increased efficiency, while also making Local, State, Federal facilities more resilient. To improve environmental performance and federal sustainability, priority should first be placed on reducing energy use and cost, then on finding renewable or alternative energy solutions. Pursuing clean sources of energy will improve energy and water security, while ensuring that State, Local and Federal facilities will continue to meet mission requirements and lead by example. Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across federal operations and the federal supply chain.

The new approach utilizes knowledge about the interdependency of air temperature, precipitation, radiation, relative air humidity, cloud cover, and visibility to develop empirical functions for determining the probability margins for the co-occurrence of specific conditions in tropical mountains and deserts. It can also be applied to other geographic settings by adjusting the parameters derived from the data itself.

Penetration of alternative energy generation also has had a positive impact. However, current emissions of sulfur dioxide are still voluminous, amounting to 3,242,000 short tons annually in the USA [2]. As wet flue gas desulfurization is both real-estate- and capital- intensive, infurnace dry sorbent injection has been considered over the years to be a viable alternative. However there is still uncertainty on the best selection of the sorbents for particular coals and furnace operating conditions. This is particularly the case when it is economically attractive for the power-plant operator to burn locally-sourced high-sulfur coal, such as the case of Illinois bituminous coals. This manuscript presents experimental results on the reduction of sulfur oxide emissions from combustion of a high-sulfur content pulverized bituminous coal (Illinois #6 Macoupin). The coal particles were in the size range of 90-125 μm and were blended with dry calcium-, sodium-, potassium-, and magnesium-containing powdered sorbents at different proportions. The alkali/S molar ratios were chosen to be at stoichiometric proportions (Ca/S=1, Mg/S=1, Na2/S=2, and K2/S=2) and the effectiveness of each alkali or alkali earth based sorbent was evaluated separately. Combustion of coal took place in a drop-tube furnace, electrically-heated to 1400 K under fuel-lean conditions. The evolution of combustion effluent gases, such as NOx, SO2 and CO2 were monitored and compared among the different sorbent cases. The use of these sorbents helps to resolve the potential of different alkali metals for effective in-furnace sulfur oxide capture and possible NOx reduction. It also assesses the effectiveness of various chemical compounds of the alkalis, such as oxides, carbonates, peroxides and acetates.

In seasonal climates, plants flowering for long periods should assure reproductive success when resources are more predictable. In this work, we evaluated the relationship between flowering phenology and synchrony and reproductive success in Hypericum balearicum, a shrub flowering all year round but mainly during spring and summer. We studied two contrasting localities (differing mostly in rainfall) during 3 years, and at different biological scales spanning from localities to individual flowers and fruits. We first monitored (monthly) flowering phenology and reproductive success (fruit and seed set) of plants, and assessed whether in the locality with higher rainfall plants had longer flowering phenology and synchrony and relatively higher reproductive success within or outside the flowering peak. Secondly, we censused pollinators on H. balearicum individuals and measured reproductive success along the flowering peak of each locality to test for an association between (i) richness and abundance of pollinators and (ii) fruit and seed set, and seed weight. We found thatmost flowers (~90 %) and the highest fruit set (~70 %) were produced during the flowering peak of each locality. Contrary to expectations, plants in the locality with lower rainfall showedmore relaxed flowering phenology and synchrony and set more fruits outside the flowering peak. During the flowering peak of each locality, the reproductive success of early-flowering individuals depended on a combination of both pollinator richness and abundance and rainfall; by contrast, reproductive success of late-flowering individuals was most dependent on rainfall. Plant species flowering for long periods in seasonal climates, thus, appear to be ideal organisms to understand how flowering phenology and synchrony match with biotic and abiotic resources, and how this ultimately influences plant reproductive success. © The Authors 2016.","Balearic islands; Flower synchrony; Flower visitors; Hypericum balearicum; Mediterranean plants; Rainfall effect on reproduction; Resource limitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010703425

However, in most populated regions, topographic data obtained by in-situ measurements is not available. In this case, digital elevation models derived from remote sensing date are usually applied. Moreover, this digital elevation models have intrinsic errors that introduce bigger uncertainty in results than the associated to hydrological projections. On the other hand, estimations of flooded areas through remote sensing images provide accurate information, which could be used for the construction of river level-flooded area relationships regarding vulnerability assessment. In this work, this approach is applied for the city of Porto Velho in the Brazilian Amazonia to assess potential vulnerability to floods associated with climate change projections. The approach is validated using census data, provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, and information about socio-economical injuries associated to historical floods, provided by the Brazilian Civil Defence. Hydrological projections under climate change are carried out using several downscaling of climate projections as inputs in a hydrological model. Results show more accurate estimation of flood impacts than the obtained using digital elevation models derivate from remote sensing data. This reduces uncertainties in the assessment of vulnerability to floods associated with climate change in the region.","Climate change impacts; Climate change vulnerability; Floods","Climate models; Digital instruments; Floods; Geomorphology; Image reconstruction; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Surveying; Accurate estimation; Climate change impact; Climate change projections; Digital elevation model; Hydrological modeling; Remote sensing imagery; Remote sensing images; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979500295

Demand management strategies, such as land use, transit, and auto pricing policies, are also needed. These measures, however, have historically faced political challenges and have been difficult to implement. Emerging ridesharing systems now suggest the possibility of a new demand management strategy that may be more politically palatable and reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT). To date, however, little research has evaluated their potential travel effects, especially on a regional scale. This study used the San Francisco, California, Bay Area activity-based travel demand model to simulate business-as-usual, transit-oriented development, and auto pricing scenarios with and without high, medium, and low ridesharing participation levels. The analysis suggests that relatively large VMT reductions are possible from moderate and high participation levels, but at low participation levels, VMT reductions are negligible. Moderate dynamic ridesharing alone compares favorably, with a 9% reduction in VMT, to transit-oriented development and auto pricing scenarios. The analysis also suggests a potentially promising policy combination: a moderately used regional dynamic ridesharing system with a 10- to 30-cent increase in the per mile cost of auto travel, which together may reduce VMT on the order of 11% to 19%. © 2016, SAGE Publications Ltd.

This study is based on a review of planning and policy documents, a household questionnaire survey and interviews with various institutions, planners and rural development organisations. A number of policies implemented at the local government level were analysed and reflected upon irrespective of whether they contain the components of green growth and green economy and the extent to which they contribute to attaining green economy. The article argues that the need for economic diversification is important as far as green economy is concerned. The article recommends the need to invest in research and development in order to find more carbon-free economic activities.

The method combines two well-established approaches of population manipulation (conventional optical pumping and coherent population transfer), offering the ability to achieve higher population of a sublevel with the highest or lowest quantum number m (the ""end state"") than obtainable with either of the techniques. To accomplish this task, we propose to use coherent-population-transfer technique (e.g., adiabatic fast passage) to arrange the system in such a way that spontaneously emitted photon (conventional optical pumping) carries away more entropy than in conventional schemes. This enables reduction of a number of spontaneous decays Nsd required to pump the system with the total angular momentum J from Nsd = J decays in the conventional scheme to Nsd ≤ log2(2J) decays in the proposed scheme. Since each spontaneous-emission event is potentially burdened with a loss of population (population is transferred to a dark state), this enables increasing population accumulated in the ""end state"", which is important for many applications. © 2016 SPIE.",,"Angular momentum; Momentum; Optical pumping; Pumps; Quantum theory; Units of measurement; Adiabatic fast passages; Coherent population transfer; Conventional schemes; Dark state; Emitted photons; Novel techniques; Quantum numbers; Spontaneous decay; Slow light",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982104823

Communities reliant on rain-fed rangelands are potentially the most vulnerable to increasing climate variability given their dependence on highly climate-sensitive resources. Droughts, which are gradual natural hazards, pose substantial and recurrent economic and ecological stresses to these systems. This study examined management decision-making based on survey responses of 479 California ranchers to: (1) identify the types of drought strategies in-place across California's rangelands and the operation variables driving strategy selection; and (2) examine how individual drought adaptation is enhanced by decision-making factors. Four types of in-place drought strategies were identified and ordered along a gradient of increasing intensity (number) of practices used. Significant background variables driving strategy selection were operation experience with drought, type of livestock operation, grazing system, and land ownership types. Information resource networks, goal setting for sustainable natural resources, and management capacity all acted to enhance individual drought adaptation-defined here by active drought planning and the number of both reactive and proactive drought practices used. Overall, analyses revealed that flexibility in management is a key component of adapting to and coping with drought. Climate policy planning should take into account the diversity of strategies that have been developed by ranchers for multiple generations and within the context of their unique operations, as well as support these working landscapes via a range of adaptation and mitigation options to reduce vulnerability across all types of operations. © 2016 by the author.","Adaptive capacity; Climate variability and change; Drought policy; Livestock production; Ranching; Sustainability science; Working landscapes","adaptive management; decision making; drought; ecosystem service; livestock farming; living standard; natural resource; rainfed agriculture; ranching; rangeland; sustainability; sustainable development; vulnerability; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007369416

In India, agroforestry practices are prevalent in different agro-ecological zones and occupy sizeable areas. These practices have great potential for climate change mitigation through sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Carbon sequestration potential was studied in four districts of Gujarat (Anand, Dahod, Patan and Junagarh), for which field survey was conducted to collect primary data on existing agroforestry systems. The extent of agroforestry area in these districts was estimated by sub-pixel classifier using medium resolution remote sensing data (RS-2/LISS III). By sub-pixel classifier, the highest area under agroforestry was estimated in Dahod (12.48%) followed by Junagarh district (10.95%) with an average of 9.12%. Sapota (Manilkara zapota) based agroforestry was also mapped in Junagarh district, which occupied an area of 1.13%. An accuracy of 87.2% was found by sub-pixel classifier in delineation of sapota-based agroforestry in the district. Dynamic CO2FIX model has been used to estimate total carbon (biomass + soils) and net carbon sequestered in existing agroforestry systems. Net carbon sequestered over a simulated period of 30 years in Anand, Dahod, Patan and Junagarh districts was found to be 2.70, 6.26, 1.61 and 1.50 Mg C ha-1 respectively. Total carbon stock in all four districts for baseline and simulated period of 30 years was estimated to be 2.907 and 3.251 million tonnes respectively. Thus, agroforestry systems in Gujarat have significant potential in carbon storage and trapping atmospheric CO2 into biomass and soils. Hence, CO2FIX model in conjunction with remote sensing techniques can be successfully applied for estimating carbon sequestration potential of agroforestry systems in a district or a region.","Agroforestry; Geospatial; Remote sensing; Sub-pixel; Tree cover",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973326553

The data used has been computed from a survey (ECHO) that describes in details a very large sample of French shipments. Two scenarios were set up, which differ mainly by the type of available electric vehicle: In scenario E1, the electric vehicle has a payload of 2 tons, versus 6 tons in scenario E2. The vehicle range is not very binding for urban deliveries in our scenario, except in the Paris Urban area. The CO2 reduction is nearly the same in the two scenarios, but the congestion is much higher in scenario E1, showing that the payload is an important issue for the generalisation of electric vehicles in urban freight. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Electric vehicle; Simulation; Urban freight",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021264407

ATM systems apply proactive strategies to improve safety and mobility, as well as to reduce emissions, noise, and fuel consumption. As one of the key elements in the ATM toolbox, variable speed limit (VSL) systems are being increasingly deployed around the United States. In the past, most VSL systems in Europe have included automated enforcement as part of the system, while systems in the United States have relied on traditional speed enforcement strategies. In the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, a new traffic-and weather-responsive VSL system has been deployed. It uses variable advisory speeds (VAS), allowing law enforcement to rely on the basic rule for enforcement. Thanks to the availability of high-resolution intelligent transportation systems data, it is possible to conduct post hoc analysis after VSL deployments. This paper focuses on driver compliance with displayed VAS messages. ""Compliance"" is defined as the difference between the displayed speed and the measured speed of traffic. In addition to analyzing more than 35 days at the Portland site, for comparison purposes, some additional analysis of a VSL site in Munich, Germany, is also included. The analysis of compliance for VSL-VAS deployments is useful for understanding the benefits of these important ATM strategies, assisting with targeting enforcement actions, and better understanding where and when to employ VSL-VAS systems. © 2016, National Research Council.

This technology aims to improve safety while reducing congestion and emissions. VSL is common on German freeways, harmonizing traffic flow during congestion and weather events. Portland, Oregon installed a VAS system (advisory meaning it is not automatically enforced) on an eleven km (7 mile) segment of heavily congested urban freeway. The Portland region maintains archived, high-resolution data of both VAS sign messages and speed detection loop feedback, permitting reconstruction of traffic and sign data. This work analyses over 30 days of archived data from the Portland site in order to study driver compliance to the VAS signs. The focus is to suggest methods and parameters to score system performance. Such an analysis could benefit new rollouts of VAS corridors by providing system performance feedback and shed light on options for improving system performance. © 2016 The Authors.

This paper is presenting results from the EU FP7 funded CHANGE project, where different concepts to adapt a UAV wing airfoil to different demands were investigated. The paper is concentrating on the design and experimental testing of a droop nose, which transforms the leading edge part of the 60 cm chord airfoil from a NACA 6510 shape for loiter and low speed to a NACA 2510 shape for a high speed mission. This paper is presenting the use of an especially soft skin, which reduces the needed force for morphing. That way the requirements for the servos driving the droop nose could be reduced significantly. This paper is showing the implications of such a soft design on the accuracy of the shape generated. For such a skin design, the driving mechanism of the system is designed as a compliant mechanism, which was generated by topology optimization, taking into account aerodynamic loads. For easy manufacturing reasons, thermoplastic polylactic acid (PLA) with zero warp property was used for the manufacturing of this compliant mechanism. Finally deformation measurements of the morphing skin were carried out in a series of lab tests. The match between measured and numerically derived section is quite good, especially in the root region of the wing. Finally an example of an alternative concept to the soft approach is presented. It is the metal based compliant mechanism with a rather stiff GFRP skin. A discussion on the use of different materials and the way forward towards 3D skin optimization is wrapping up the paper.

Several synthetic jet fuels have been developed including sustainable bio-kerosene, a low-carbon fuel. Over the last years, the technical feasibility as well as the compatibility of alternative jet fuels with today's planes has been proven However, when burning a jet fuel, the exhaust gases are a mixture of many species, going beyond CO2 and water (H2O) emissions, with nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) including aromatic species and further precursors of particles and soot among them. These emissions have an impact on the local air quality as well as on the climate (particles, soot, contrails). Therefore, a detailed knowledge and understanding of the emission patterns when burning synthetic aviation fuels is inevitable. In the present paper, these issues are addressed by studying numerically the combustion of four synthetic jet fuels (Fischer-Tropsch fuels). For reference, two types of crude-oil based kerosenes (Jet A-1 and Jet A) are considered, too. Plug flow calculations were performed by using a detailed chemicalkinetic model validated previously. The composition of the multi-component jet fuels were imaged by using the surrogate approach. Calculations were done for relevant temperatures, pressures, residence times, and fuel equivalence ratios φ. Results are discussed for NOx, CO as well as benzene and acetylene as major soot precursors. According to the predictions, the NOx and CO emissions are within about ± 10% for all fuels considered, within the parameter range studied: T = 1800 K, T = 2200 K; 0.25 ≤ φ ≤ 1.8; p = 40 bar; t = 3 ms. The aromatics free GtL (Gas to Liquid) fuel displayed higher NOx values compared to Jet A-1/A. In addition, synthetic fuels show slightly lower (better) CO emission data than Jet A-1/A. The antagonist role of CO and NOx is apparent. Major differences were predicted for benzene emissions, depending strongly on the aromatics content in the specific fuel, with lower levels predicted for the synthetic aviation fuels. Acetylene levels show a similar, but less pronounced, effect.

Three field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the nitrification inhibitors 3, 4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), 3-methyl pyrazole plus 1H-1,2,4 triazole (3MP+TZ), and dicyandiamide (DCD) on N2O emissions and yields in broccoli (Brassica oleracea), lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) crops in southern Australia. The inhibitor treatments on fertilisers and poultry manure were compared with standard commercial practice for vegetable crops in this region, and N2O emissions were measured using manual chambers through to harvest. Daily fluxes ranged from 0.81gN2O-Nha-1day-1 for untreated soil to 11.65gN2O-Nha-1day-1 for manure treated soil. Extrapolation of these results translate to annual emissions of 0.30kgN2O-Nha-1year-1 to 4.24kgN2O-Nha-1year-1, respectively. Cumulative soil N2O fluxes from the manure treatments were ∼4-fold greater than the standard inorganic fertiliser program for a given crop. Nitrous oxide direct emission factors were in the range 0.02-0.16% for inorganic fertilisers and from 0.19% to 0.43% for poultry manure. The greatest decrease in N2O emissions occurred when DMPP or a combination of 3MP+TZ were added to poultry manure (62% and 66% decrease, respectively). Decreases in N2O emissions from nitrification inhibitors were smaller and less consistent when used with inorganic fertilisers, but DMPP decreased emissions in two out of three trials, with a maximum decrease of 32% observed in the broccoli trial. DCD proved ineffective for mitigating N2O emissions in all trials. © CSIRO 2016.","dicyandiamide; dimethylpyrazole phosphate; fertiliser; manure; nitrogen.","Crops; Manures; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Vegetables; Brassica oleracea; Dicyandiamide; Dimethylpyrazole phosphates; Direct emissions; Intensive vegetable productions; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide emissions; Three-field experiments; Fertilizers; agricultural emission; agricultural soil; crop yield; cropping practice; denitrification; emission control; experimental study; fertilizer application; leafy vegetable; manure; mitigation; nitrification; nitrous oxide; phosphate; poultry; Australia; Animalia; Brassica oleracea; Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Brassica oleracea var. italica; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981554536

Aeristech has developed a 48V electric supercharger with dual functions: steady state supercharger and transient booster, for application to heavily downsized engines. The electric supercharger has been designed in two variants: with electronics and compressor motor in a single integrated package and with these subsystems housed in separate, non-integrated packages. As much as 60% engine downsizing can be achieved when the electric supercharger is paired with a conventional mechanical turbocharger to create a two-stage boosting arrangement. This arrangement takes advantage of the rapid transient response of the electric supercharger and also of the continuous steady-state power delivery of which this electric supercharger is capable. This allows the electric supercharger to supplement a conventional boosting system and allows the electric supercharger with a single mechanical turbocharger to function as a multi-stage boosting system with superior transient response. The electric supercharger incorporates a new compressor design with high efficiency and large map width, benefiting from the unique high speed capability of Aeristech's electric supercharger, which in turn is derived from Aeristech's high-speed electric motor control technology. © Aeristech Ltd, MAHLE Powertrain Ltd, 2016.",,"Electric power transmission; Internal combustion engines; Power quality; Superchargers; Turbomachinery; Boosting systems; Compressor designs; Compressor motor; Electric motor control; Electric supercharger; Engine downsizing; Integrated packages; Steady-state power; Transient analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028957989

In this study, five light-duty vans, operating on alternative fuels and propulsion systems, were tested on a chassis dynamometer for emissions and efficiency. The vehicles were powered with Tier 2 gasoline, low blend ethanol (E10), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and an electric battery. Four test cycles were used representing city driving and cold-start (FTP-75), aggressive high speed driving (US06), free flow highway driving (HWFCT), and a combination of urban, rural, and motorway driving (WHVC). Tests were performed at a temperature of 22°C, with select tests at -7°C and -18°C. Exhaust emissions were measured and characterized including CO, NOX, THC, PM and CO2. On the FTP-75, WHVC, and US06 cycles additional exhaust emission characterization included N2O, and CH4. On the FTP-75, carbonyl compounds and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were also characterized. Fuel and energy consumption, CO2,e and NMOG emissions were calculated. The emissions impact of alternative fuels varied with temperature and driving cycle. Compared to conventional gasoline, the use of alternative fuels generally resulted in reduced CO2 equivalent emission rates: 12-14% reduction with the use of LPG fuel, 18-21% reduction with the use of CNG fuel, and 60-75% reduction with the use of battery electric propulsion (assuming the average Canadian mix for electricity generation). With E10 fuel, the reductions in tailpipe CO2 equivalent emission rate were generally not statistically significant.

Contrary to the minimal competitive options available over the last several decades, new companies are now emerging with a variety of locomotive designs aimed at low emissions and low horsepower solutions. Some technologies involve alternative fuels (e.g. natural gas, bio-diesel, battery power, etc.), while others incorporate very low horsepower diesel engines (400hp- 1000hp) in order to meet the Tier 4 regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Yet another option available to railroads and local industries is the mobile railcar mover. Typically used within railroad yard limits or on industry tracks, yard and industrial switchers and mobile railcar movers travel short distances, but must be capable of moving large loads. Subject to high forces when moving cars, these technologies must be both resilient (requiring minimal maintenance) and safe (not subject to derailment or loss of control). As the current market for yard and industrial switchers continues to expand, both railroads and local industries served by rail are placing greater emphases on the environmental and economic benefits of the emerging technologies. This paper aims to analyze the current yard and industrial switcher market and draw conclusions based on emissions data and lifecycle costs. Industrial switchers are compared with yard switchers and mobile railcar movers. Although industrial switchers are more limited in horsepower and operational versatility than yard switchers, many of the daily operations between the two are similar. Mobile railcar movers (e.g. Trackmobile ® and Rail King®) offer lower initial costs as well as the versatility of both on-track and off-track movement. However, they may require additional maintenance and offer reduced tractive effort compared to locomotive technologies. As the demands on railroad yard and industry operations grow increasingly complex due to environmental regulations and economic demands, these new technologies have the potential to increase competition in the marketplace and offer improved engineering solutions. By developing a hierarchy of key requirements of yard or industry switchers, this paper provides a framework for identifying the best options available to a railroad or local industries. The scope of this paper will include a review of all options available, but will place a greater emphasis on technologies that are commercially available for wide distribution. By sampling and analyzing the current industrial market, much insight can be gained into daily operational requirements and challenges faced by this sector of the industry.

For this purpose, seven models for adsorption of N2O gas on the exterior surfaces of BPNTs have been considered and then all structures are optimized by B3LYP level of theory and 6–31G (d) base set. The optimized structures are used to calculate the electrical, structural, quantum and NMR parameters. The computational results revealed that the adsorption energy of all studied models of BPNTs is negative; all processes are exothermic and favorable in thermodynamic approach. When N2O gas is adsorbed from its O atom head on the B site of nanotube, N2O gas is dissociated to O atom and N2 molecule. The adsorption energy of this process is more than those of other models and more stable than other models. In A, B and C models, the global hardness decreases significantly from original values and so the activity of nanotube increases from original state. On the other hand, the electrophilicity index (ω), electronic chemical potential (μ), electronegativity (χ) and global softness (S) of the A, B and C models increase significantly from original value and CSI values of the C model are larger than those of other models. The results demonstrate that the Ga-, Si- and SiGa- doped BPNTs are good candidates to adsorb N2O and make N2O gas sensor. © 2016, Isfahan University of Technology.

The aim of this study is determination of the air's health status relying on AQI index in Dogonbadan City. Materials and methods: In this research, using the information provided by air quality monitoring stations of environmental protection organization of Dogonbadan City, the average concentration of air criteria pollutants (PM10, SO2, O3, and NO2) during different months and seasons of 2012-2013 has been investigated. The obtained concentrations were then converted to AQI index using AQI calculator software. Further, the averageconcentration of the mentioned pollutants was compared with the country's environmental organization standards. Results: In general, during the years of 2012-2013, the air quality index was in a good and medium level (AQI &lt; 100) in 96% of cases, while in 4% of cases, it was beyond the standard limit. The PM10, SO2, O3, and NO2 pollutants had the greatest and slightest rules in the air pollution of Dogonbadan City. August was the worst month in terms of PM10 pollution, since in this month 30% of pollution status had lied within the range of hazardous and above, whereas for other pollutants in this month, new unhealthy status was observed. Conclusions: Suspended particles were recognized as the major factor of air pollution in Dogonbadan City. Considering high levels of this pollutant, through timely notification, it is possible to prevent further complications for people with heart or lung diseases.","Air pollution; Air quality index; Dogonbadan City; Suspended particles","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality standard; air sampling; Article; cross-sectional study; environmental protection; health hazard; health status; heart disease; Iran; lung disease; particulate matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015152468

Each requires the presence of both carbon dioxide and acetylene in the jet, and (from observed rotational spacings) involves clusters containing about 4 to 7 molecules. Structures are predicted for mixed CO2 + C2H2 clusters using a distributed multipole model, and the bands are assigned to a specific pentamer, (CO2)3-(C2H2)2, and hexamer, (CO2)4-(C2H2)2. The hexamer has a box-like structure whose D2d symmetry is supported by observed intensity alternation in the spectrum. The pentamer has a closely related structure which is obtained by removing one CO2 molecule from the hexamer.

The C4N+2 show cumulenic structures with equal bond lengths and C4N form structures with clear bond length alternation. The doubly Hückel aromatic nature of C4N+2 is revealed through two cyclic delocalized π-molecular orbitals and highly negative nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) parameters while the doubly Hückel antiaromatic nature of C4N is brought out through two localized π-molecular orbitals and highly positive NICS parameters. Further, the uniform electron distribution over the delocalized CC bonds in C4N+2 and the alternate electron rich and electron deficient regions in C4N are assessed on the basis of the critical features of the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP). The contrasting geometric, electronic and magnetic features of C4N+2 compared to C4N result in a drastic difference in their intermolecular bonding behaviour. The C4N showed a much higher tendency than C4N+2 for dimer formation as the former, in general show a 4N number of intermolecular C⋯C interactions due to complimentary electrostatic interactions between electron rich shorter CC bonds and electron deficient longer CC bonds. In C4N dimers, a perfect sandwich configuration is preferred to maximize the attractive complementary electrostatic interactions while in C4N+2 dimers a shifted-parallel stacked arrangement indicated the non-complementary character of interactions arising from smooth aromatic distribution of electrons. The comparative stability of the carbon rings and unsubstituted polyynes is quantified by measuring the homodesmotic reaction energy (Ehdr) with acetylene. The Ehdr indicated significant stabilization of C4N+2 compared to C4N. The energy required to open up a carbon ring to the linear form is computed as Eopening and this quantity is used to estimate the aromatic stabilization of C4N+2 as well as the antiaromatic destabilization of C4N systems. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Bond length; Chemical bonds; Chemical shift; Density functional theory; Electrons; Electrostatics; Molecular orbitals; Stabilization; Aromatic stabilization; Bond length alternation; Carbon-carbon interaction; Electron distributions; Inter-molecular bonding; Molecular electrostatic potentials; Nucleus independent chemical shifts; Sandwich configuration; Dimers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971357104

The number of transit buses exceeding weight limits has been exacerbated by regulatory changes directed at improving emissions and accessibility. These changes have required manufacturers to include heavy auxiliary equipment, such as emissions reduction components and hydraulic systems, on transit buses and have been introduced without commensurate increases in the weight limits of transit buses. Public agencies have limited knowledge about transit bus weights and their pavement impacts. Further, estimating in-service weights of transit buses is difficult. To help improve knowledge about issues of transit bus weights, this paper describes the legal and regulatory factors surrounding transit bus weight, basic estimates of in-service bus weights, contributing factors to transit bus weights, challenges for reducing bus weights, pavement impacts of transit buses, and challenges for estimating in-service weights of transit buses. The paper also develops and applies a methodology for estimating in-service weights of transit buses by using Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, as a case study. Application of this methodology (a) demonstrates the need for reliable local data when in-service weights of transit buses are estimated and (b) empirically corroborates regulatory compliance and pavement-related concerns by using data collected from in-service transit buses.",,"Auxiliary equipment; Axles; Bus transportation; Emission control; Hydraulic equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Pavements; Regulatory compliance; Contributing factor; Emissions reduction; Hydraulic system; Manitoba , Canada; Public agencies; Regulatory change; Regulatory factors; Weight limits; Buses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994310867

Internationally community-based adaptation (CBA) is recognised as a promising approach to help vulnerable populations adjust to climate change. However, with pilot projects in their infancy documented experience for Pacific Islands remains scarce. This limits the ability of the region – faced with persisting development challenges and predicted significant climate impacts – to learn from and build on previous experiences and develop robust responses to climate change. Design/methodology/approach – By using a community-based initiative in response to environmental challenges and unsustainable development as a proxy, the paper interrogates the potential usefulness of the CBA framework for the Pacific and identifies potential strengths and weaknesses. Sketching out the process and its outcomes, it shows how the initiative has resulted in a diversity of strategies, ranging from pollution control measures, to improved governance of resources and community participation in decision making, to livelihood and income diversification. Findings – Findings indicate that CBA could have a lot of potential for building more resilient communities in the face of climate change and other pressures associated with modernising Pacific societies. However, to be effective, interventions should pay attention to people’s development aspirations; immediate economic, social and environmental benefits; dynamics of village governance, social rules and protocols; and traditional forms of knowledge that can inform sustainable solutions. Originality/value – The conclusions provide a reflection on the CBA framework in general and make concrete suggestions for practitioners on how the framework could be usefully implemented in the Pacific context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate change adaptation; Community-based adaptation; Development; Fiji; Pacific; Vulnerability","decision making; development strategy; environmental planning; local adaptation; local participation; methodology; organizational framework; pollution control; Fiji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971556239

Thus, the deformation of FRP reinforced concrete slabs that are designed for Ultimate Limit State (ULS) will be much higher. Limiting deformation under service load requires additional reinforcement. Therefore, unwanted costs may arise through added material, labour and space for arrangement. Ultra-high modulus (UHM) carbon fibres reach a Young’s modulus of more than 900 GPa at a high tension strength of 3.7 GPa. CFRP reinforcement bars made out of these fibres have higher extension stiffness as steel bars despite the smaller cross section. The structural behaviour of eight reinforced concrete slabs is analysed in an experimental parameter study with varying reinforcement material and quantity. The results show that UHM carbon fibres can significantly reduce the deflection under service load without losing load bearing capacity. A promising alternative to CFRP reinforcement with HT carbon fibres is demonstrated by using pitch-based UHM carbon fibres instead of highly expensive PAN-based UHM carbon fibres.

In its 2006 rulemaking, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identified sample projects that would likely be POAQCs, including a new highway project with annual average daily traffic (AADT) greater than 125,000 and at least 8% diesel truck traffic. The objective of this study was to identify project characteristics that could reasonably exclude the project from consideration as a POAQC. Scenario analyses were performed for a hypothetical project that featured a new freeway with four mixed-flow lanes and baseline traffic activity of 125,000 AADT and 8% diesel truck traffic. The MO Vehicle Emission Simulator and the Emission FACtors models were used to quantify PM10 and PM2.5 emissions for a 2006 analysis and to evaluate the impact of fleet turnover and truck percentages on project-level emissions from 2006 to 2035. Fleet turnover effects sharply reduce project-level PM2.5 emissions over time. For an analysis year of 2015, impacts from a highway project with 125,000 AADT and 8% trucks are approximately 50% less than impacts from such a project in 2006. In contrast, fleet turnover effects do not substantially reduce PM10 emissions, since re-entrained road dust emissions and tire wear and brake wear emissions increasingly dominate projectlevel inventories over time, and these emissions vary little by analysis year.",,"Air quality; Crashworthiness; Environmental Protection Agency; Highway engineering; Highway planning; Particles (particulate matter); Transportation; Transportation routes; Trucks; Air quality impacts; Annual average daily traffics; Particulate Matter; Project characteristics; Road dust emissions; Traffic activities; Transportation projects; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Fleet operations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976293624

The system was designed on TRNSYS software in order to perform dynamic simulation. A solar thermal system operating with various control strategies has been designed with an integrated ground source heat pump and a seasonal borehole storage to provide domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating (SH) for community-size demand. The system has two short term storage tanks, a hot tank and a warm tank. The impact of the considered system solutions on electricity consumption has been evaluated and compared as a function of the different collector control modes and different tank configurations (short term tanks sizes). Results have shown that the proposed system was able to provide a 78-83% renewable energy fraction. Total electricity consumption of the heating system varied by 20% between the best and the worst cases. Furthermore, system performance was better when solar energy was mainly stored in the warm tank. During a 5-year simulation, the annual seasonal storage efficiency improved from 0.23 to 0.31, whereas the heat pump electricity consumption reduced from 57.17 MWh to 45.93 MWh. The demand in winter was met mainly through ground heat and the rest was provided by the heat pump compressor. However, the demand in summer was met almost completely by solar energy. © 2016 The Authors.","district heating; seasonal storage; solar community; Solar thermal energy; system control","Computer software; District heating; Electric power utilization; Heat pump systems; Heating; Heating equipment; Pumps; Solar energy; Solar heating; Tanks (containers); Thermography (temperature measurement); Electricity-consumption; Renewable energy fractions; Seasonal storage; solar community; Solar heating system; Solar thermal energy; Solar thermal systems; System control; Geothermal heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85005992194

Compliance with these regulations requires significant financial investments in new technologies, all designed to increase fuel efficiency while decreasing emissions. One solution to this problem is the opposed-piston engine. Achates Power has spent the past 12 years modernizing this historically efficient engine architecture to deliver a step-wise improvement in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) over the most advanced conventional four-stroke engines. In addition, with the elimination of parts such as the cylinder head and valve train, it is also less complex and less costly to produce-making it even more appealing to manufacturers. Measured steady state results from the 13-mode Supplemental Emissions Test (SET) cycle on the Achates Power research grade three-cylinder, 4.9L opposed-piston engine equipped with a two-speed supercharger demonstrate the ability of the technology to achieve high fuel efficiency while satisfying emissions criteria. The SET cycle average of 199 g/kWh, with a best point of 190 g/kWh, highlights the flat nature of the fuel map. With an optimized, production intent engine design, an estimated 180 g/kWh SET cycle average is expected. Work with Johnson Matthey and their patented Selective Catalytic Reduction Technology (SCRT®) system has shown that the Achates Power OP Engine can satisfy HC, CO, PM, and NOx U.S. EPA10 emissions over the SET cycle [1]. Initial transient results are encouraging with cycle averaged BSFC similar to steady-state BSFC, and engine out emissions compliant with regulatory standards when coupled with commercially available after-treatment equipment [2]. These results highlight the capabilities of the opposed-piston engine to perform transient maneuvers successfully without compromising fuel economy and emissions. Light-duty estimations of the OP Engine simulated in a pickup truck suggest a 30% improvement in fuel economy over an efficiency-optimized, four-stroke diesel research engine [3]. Results show that with the OP Engine, 2025 CAFE regulations for light-duty trucks can be met and superseded without any advanced vehicle level solutions. Achates Power is also working on developing a 2.7L Opposed-Piston Gasoline Compression Ignition (OPGCI) engine, largely funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, ideal for light-duty applications [4]. The OPGCI technology has the potential to cost-effectively deliver more than 50% improved fuel economy over conventional gasoline engines while maintaining low emissions. © 2016, VDI Verlag GMBH.

There is an association between the incidence of climate-sensitive diseases and changes in temperature and precipitation trends. The study data suggests that climate change is likely to have impacts on the health sector in Nepal; however current adaptation policies, strategies, and response measures in this sector are insufficient to address such impacts. The lack of response measures has resulted in increased risk and vulnerability among the poor and marginalized communities living in both rural and urban areas of Nepal.

Expanding the transmission system to collect this energy production and connect it to the National Interconnected System has been a big challenge. Transmission Lines on 69kV, 138kV, 230kV and 500kV are in the process of design and construction to allow for proper flow of all energy generated in these wind farms. Due to problems with the legal schedules for environmental licensing and land legalization, the assembling and operation of important connection lines to these generation plants had delays, while more wind turbines kept on being installed. As the increasing amounts of power produced by the wind farms cannot be stored, without new transmission lines, it would be wasted at a time when hydraulic generation is constrained due to the reduced reservoir levels caused by lack of rain. This paper presents a case where the real time monitoring and the thermal modelling of an existing 230kC line allowed increased transmission capacity in the connection of several wind generation plants to the national grid. The increased utilization of the existing line was accomplished without exceeding the line’s design temperature, and thus safely. In the case presented here, the relatively short transmission line (~16 km) over a flat terrain was monitored at the extremities, with meteorological stations measuring ambient temperature, wind velocity and direction, solar radiation, and with line instruments measuring conductor current and temperature. This proved to be sufficient due to the relatively uniform conditions over the short line. However, in order to apply similar techniques to longer lines, over irregular terrains or with non-uniform ambient conditions, a more complete approach must be developed. The analysis presented is intended to start the development of a safe approach to increase transmission capacity of overhead lines that connects wind power farms, provided that there is correlation between higher generated currents and high winds at line's conductors. © 2016 CIGRE.

Benefits such as the flexibility to adapt the type of fuel to the market situation, fail-safe operation and lower NOx emissions than diesel engines are convincing arguments for engine operators. However, diesel-gas engine concepts still suffer from lower efficiency than state-of-the-art monovalent diesel engines and spark ignited gas engines when operated in the corresponding fuel mode. To meet stringent NOx emission legislation, high diesel substitution rates are necessary, which in turn often lead to poor combustion stability. Especially with these small diesel fractions, the challenge remains to ensure stable ignition, fast combustion of the air-fuel mixture and low hydrocarbon emissions. The aim of this paper is to identify and investigate the potential and limitations of diesel-gas combustion concepts for high speed large engines operated in gas mode with very small amounts of pilot fuel (&lt; 5 % diesel fraction1). Experimental tests were carried out on a flexible single cylinder research engine (swept volume approximately 6 l) equipped with a common rail system. Various engine configurations and operating parameters were varied and the effects on the combustion process were analyzed. The results presented in this paper include a comparison of the performance of the investigated dual fuel concept to those of a state-of-the-art monovalent gas engine and a state-of-the-art monovalent diesel engine. Evaluation reveals that certain limiting factors exist that prevent the dual fuel engine from performing as well as the superior gas engine. On the other hand, the potential is already present for the dual fuel concept to compete with the diesel engine. Since the injection of pilot fuel is of major importance for flame initialization and thus for the main combustion event of the dual fuel engine, optical investigations in a spray box, measurements of injection rates and 3D-CFD simulation were conducted to obtain even more detailed insight into these processes. A study on the influence of the diesel fraction shows that diminishing the diesel fraction from 3 % to lower values has a significant impact on engine performance because of the effects of such a reduction on injection, ignition delay and initial flame formation. An investigation of the influence of the injection timing reveals that with diesel fractions of ≤ 1.5 %, the well-known relationship between the injection timing and combustion phasing of conventional engine concepts is no longer valid. The presented results illustrate which operating strategy is beneficial for engine performance in terms of low NOx emissions and high efficiency. Moreover, potential measures can be derived which allow for further optimization of the diesel-gas combustion process.

XRD and TEM results reveal that the NiO films are oriented and that the NiO/n-GaN interface has a good quality. XPS analysis demonstrated that the NiO films clearly showed Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks at 854 eV and 872 eV along with the O 1s peak at ∼529.1 eV. Then, we fabricated an Au/NiO/n-GaN heterojunction Schottky diode with a NiO insulating layer and compared its electrical properties with the Au/n-GaN Schottky junction. The Au/NiO/n-GaN heterojunction presents excellent rectifying behaviour with a low reverse-leakage current compared to the Au/n-GaN Schottky junction. Calculation revealed that a higher barrier height is achieved for the Au/NiO/n-GaN heterojunction than for the Au/n-GaN Schottky junction, implying the barrier height was modified by the NiO insulating layer. Using Cheung's and Norde functions and an ΨS-V plot, the barrier heights are estimated and we found that the values are comparable with one another. The results suggest that the interface state density (NSS) of the Au/NiO/n-GaN heterojunction decreases compared to the Au/n-GaN Schottky junction, which indicates the NiO insulating layer plays a significant role in the reduced NSS. The results demonstrate that Poole-Frenkel emission governs the reverse leakage current in both junctions, which could be associated with structural defects and trap levels in the insulating layer. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Heterojunctions; III-V semiconductors; Insulating materials; Insulation; Interface states; Interfaces (materials); Leakage (fluid); Nickel oxide; Oxide films; Schottky barrier diodes; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Chemical characteristic; E beam evaporation; Insulating layers; Interface state density; Nickel oxides (NiO); Poole-Frenkel emission; Reverse leakage current; Schottky junctions; Gold compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994509715

Eddy covariance measurements of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes allow for integrated field measurement of the interaction between the landscape and the atmosphere. Measurements of these fluxes using eddy covariance were made in 2012 in a 60 ha rice (CL XL 745) field with typical production practices of the region. One hundred plants were monitored to track plant growth stage. Variability in measured fluxes was related to plant growth and production practices. Peak fluxes were measured during late vegetative stages. Corrected for energy balance closure, the maximum water flux was 6.05 mm d-1 and occurred during later vegetative stages. Average water fluxes during late vegetative and early reproductive stages were approximately 4.45 mm d-1. Diurnal variability in H2O and CO2 flux peaked in early afternoon. Net CO2 influx to the plant dominated the production season; hence, rice was a CO2 sink. These findings begin to address the increased interest in understanding agricultural impact on net greenhouse gas (GHG) production and consumption. Future work might include similar data collection with the addition of methane flux from multiple fields where water management is varied to measure its impact on net GHG flux. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Eddy covariance; Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Growth stage; Oryza sativa; Rice","Evaporation; Evapotranspiration; Greenhouse gases; Plant shutdowns; Plants (botany); Water management; Eddy covariance; Eddy covariance measurements; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Growth stages; Mississippi River Basin; Oryza sativa; Production and consumption; Rice; Carbon dioxide; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; crop production; eddy covariance; evaporation; evapotranspiration; greenhouse gas; growth rate; landscape ecology; methane; rice; seasonal variation; water management; Mississippi River; United States; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960896468

In this study, an experimental investigation at the micro-scale and also a numerical simulation at the macro-scale of a typical urban environment in Adelaide were conducted to estimate the potential for mitigating the UHI effect. The results showed that existing low albedo materials such as asphalt, metal roofs and brick pavements contribute to the heat island potential. Also, urban development and a lack of natural vegetation contribute to increased temperatures in cities. The ability of two types of extensive and intensive green roofs to reduce the surrounding micro-climate temperature were monitored. The results showed that they have significant cooling effects in summer time and could behave as an insulation layer to keep buildings warmer in the winter. Furthermore, different scenarios of adding green roofs to the Adelaide urban environment were investigated using the Envi-MET model. The scenario modelling of adding green roofs in a typical urban area in Adelaide, Australia, supported the hypothesis that this can lead to reductions in energy consumption in the Adelaide urban environment. Also an increased use of other water sensitive urban design technologies such as green walls and street trees together with the adoption of high albedo materials is recommended for achieving the optimum efficiency in terms of reducing urban temperatures and mitigating urban heat island effects. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.","Climate change adaptation; Green roofs; Urban heat island","albedo; climate change; energy use; greenspace; heat island; metropolitan area; microclimate; roof; temperature effect; urban area; urban design; urban development; vegetation cover; Adelaide; Australia; South Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957105509

These goals, combined with increasing energy prices, have led to elevated interest in alternative, low to zero carbon and pollutant emission technologies in this sector. The challenge is to assess the impacts of various technologies, policies, and market practices in order to develop a roadmap to meet energy and environmental goals. To this end, a spatially and temporally resolved resource dispatch model is developed that simulates an electricity market while taking into account physical constraints associated with various components of an electricity grid. Multiple technology simulation modules are developed to provide inputs to the model. The model is used to design a market-based grid, and to develop and evaluate different dispatch strategies. To maintain the system cost at acceptable levels and reduce emissions, the results reveal that the best approach is a combination of economic and environmental dispatch strategies. The methodology and the tools developed provide a means to examine various aspects of future scenarios and their impacts on different sectors, and can be used for both decision making and planning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity market; Electricity price; Grid design; Grid emissions; Resource dispatch; Unit commitment","Air quality; Carbon; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Power markets; Electricity prices; Grid design; Grid emissions; Resource dispatch; Unit-commitment; Electric load dispatching; air quality; cost analysis; decision making; design method; electricity generation; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; greenhouse gas; numerical method; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979928335

City and climate are two man-made and natural systems that have close interactions with each other. Climate, to the extent that interacts with human comfort, is the result of factors such as: radiation, temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation. Climate of any geographic location has particular suitable conditions; however, it has limitations in the design of urban and rural areas as well. In the design of its various spaces, such as buildings, green spaces, streets and train stations, in addition to functional, visual and aesthetic qualities, the climate of the city and climatic design rules are essential; and lack of attention to this issue creates special problems in the city and its urban activities; problems such as preventing the flow of pleasant air in urban spaces and buildings, flooded streets and so on.

However, as green roof implementation in hotter and drier climates increases, there is a need to evaluate plant performance under these climatic conditions. Succulents have been shown to be successful in hot and dry green roofs, although survival differs between species and the role of leaf succulence in survival has not been fully explored. For non-succulent plants, habitats with conditions similar to green roofs ('habitat templates') have been used to select plants, although few studies have discussed the performance of these selections under green roof conditions. Therefore, we evaluated establishment of 32 plant species on an unirrigated extensive (125 mm deep) green roof in Melbourne, Australia over a 42 week period (from winter through summer into autumn). Plants were selected on the basis of life-form, succulence, appropriate habitat templates and/or successful use on green roofs internationally. Climatic conditions during the experiment were often extreme, with evaporation regularly exceeding rainfall and a hot and dry summer (mean maximum air temperature 35 °C and 80.6 mm total rainfall), leading to roof temperatures of 65 °C. After 42 weeks, only succulent plants remained alive and only three of the succulent species had 100% survival. Survival was positively related to the degree of leaf succulence (g H2O leaf area cm-1) making this a useful trait for plant selection for unirrigated green roofs in hot, dry climates. The failure of most species, despite being chosen from appropriate habitats, demonstrates the need to evaluate potential plants on green roofs under extreme climatic conditions. Supplementary irrigation may be essential to sustain non-succulent species during extreme weather in hot and dry climates. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.",,"air temperature; climate conditions; evaporation; leaf; plant community; rainfall; roof; seasonal variation; temperature effect; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957808975

The Environmentally Friendly Drilling Program (EFD) and Gulf Coast Green Energy (GCGE) teamed up early this year to field trial the Power+ Generator. This technology utilizes the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) to convert waste heat into electricity that can be purposed for onsite power needs or sold back to grid. This technology can be implemented in any situation where waste heat is generated (Produced hot water, flare gas etc.) Produced gas, that would otherwise be flared, is sent to a low NOx, hot water boiler. The gas is burned inside the hot water boiler and the generated hot water will then enter a heat exchanger that excites a working fluid in the ORC generator. This in turn drives a twin screw expander to create the electricity. The Power+ System, which consists of the ORC Generator and the Boiler, was installed at a well site in the Bakken Shale region in North Dakota and ran continuously, with minimal interruption, for 90 straight days. The EFD team monitored the technology during the field trial in order to validate its ability to produce electricity from produced gas, prove that the technology could work without interfering with well operations and to determine the environmental impacts associated with the flare gas reduction. The field trial successfully demonstrated the ability of the ORC generator to produce onsite power from wasted flare gas. The generator had a cumulative runtime of 1937 hrs, generating roughly 104,000 kWh of electricity. An emissions study conducted by The Texas A&M Institute for Renewable Natural Resources (IRNR) studied the effect on the environmental impact of the ORC system. This emissions study concluded that the Power+ System reduced CO by 89%, NOx by 48%, and VOCs by 93%. This system was able to reduce key air pollutants by factors ranging from half to less than 10%. The emissions study showed that the Power+ generator would meet the goals of the US EPA and North Dakota Department of Health- Air Quality by reducing emissions and providing useful energy through the reuse of the produced natural gas.

The sustainability of a biofuel production system includes energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) saving along with environmental and social acceptability. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an internationally recognized tool for determining the sustainability of biofuels. LCA includes goal and scope, life cycle inventory, life cycle impact assessment, and interpretation as major steps. LCA results vary significantly, if there are any variations in performing these steps. For instance, biofuel producing feedstocks have different environmental values that lead to different GHG emission savings and energy balances. Similarly, land-use and land-use changes may overestimate biofuel sustainability. This study aims to examine various biofuel production systems for their GHG savings and energy balances, relative to conventional fossil fuels with an ambition to address the challenges and to offer future directions for LCA based biofuel studies. Environmental and social acceptability of biofuel production is the key factor in developing biofuel support policies. Higher GHG emission saving and energy balance of biofuel can be achieved, if biomass yield is high, and ecologically sustainable biomass or non-food biomass is converted into biofuel and used efficiently. © 2016 BRTeam.","Biofuels; Energy balance; Greenhouse gas (GHG) balance; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Sustainability","Biomass; Energy balance; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Biofuel production; Emission energies; Emission saving; Energy gas; Greenhouse gas balance; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gases savings; Life cycle assessment; Production system; Social acceptability; Biofuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989930402

In this project, we develop and demonstrate a systematic methodology for institutional campuses to transform themselves into energy sustainable communities. The methodology starts with an investigation of the electricity consumption trend, followed by the determination of the seasonally variant solar generation capacity. We then compute the minimal geographical area to reach sustainability and present an economic viability model taking into account local energy costs. The methodology is experimentally piloted in a 400-acre campus community of 10000+ residents in rural monsoon dominated tropics of Southern India. Sustainability can be achieved through the deployment of 20 acres' solar panels together generating 13,369 MWh (annually). On the consumption side, smart control panels can help to limit usage to 4,338 MWh, allowing the possibility that a surplus of 9,031 MWh to be re-routed to humanitarian causes of lighting up adjoining low income village households (which otherwise would have been without power), powering campus vehicles and dining services, with potential to reduce the overall carbon footprint by 6452 tons. The initial investment gets paid back in eleven years' time, which is about half the panel lifespan, thereby proving economic viability.

Air quality and meteorological parameters across 25 locations were monitored during the wet season (April to October) 2015 to ascertain major air pollutant sources. The parameters monitored were, Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Carbon ii oxide (CO), Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM) 1, PM2.5, PM4, PM7, PM10, TSP, wind speed, humidity and temperature. Descriptive statistics, agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (AHCA), Principal component analysis (PCA), Multiple linear regression (MLR) and Principal component regression (PCR) were used in the data analysis and modeling of Air quality index. Results showed that SO2 values ranged from 0.04 ppm to 0.15 ppm, NO2 values ranged from 0.025 ppm to 0.162 ppm, CO concentration ranged from 0.24 ppm to 6.36 ppm, VOC values ranged from 0.18 ppm to 2.19 ppm across all study locations. Particulate matter also varied across the study locations. Three clusters were obtained from AHCA. The dendogram plot from AHCA showed that the observed variation can be attributed to the land use pattern in the study area. Three principal components were extracted from the PCA based on eigenvalue of &gt;1 and from the biplot after varimax rotation revealed that the major sources of air pollution in the area based on land use type are markets, major bus stops, residential and commercial centers. Vehicular emissions, biomass burning and dusty roads are the major sources of air pollution in the study area. MLR performed better than PCR with MLR and PCR having an R2 of 0.967 and 0.930 respectively. PCA, AHCA, MLR and PCR proved to be useful tools in air quality analysis for source apportionment and prediction as this can aid in air pollution abatement planning.

Six, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 g of powder TSS were dissolved during 5, 7, 4, 3, 3 and 2 days, respectively, and infused into the rumen of four rumen-cannulated Brahman steers (234 ± 13.6 kg LW; least-squares means ± s.e.m.) or mixed in the basal diet [BD: 0.15 Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay plus a high-grain feed (0.85)] of two non-cannulated (253 ± 19.3 kg) steers. Overall, DMI was not affected, by the sequential infusion of TSS (5.3 ± 0.15 kg) or addition to the BD (5.4 ± 0.18 kg), but relative to all diets, 6 g of TSS supplementation reduced DMI (P &lt; 0.05), while the administration above 30 g of the supplement was associated with significantly (P &lt; 0.001) reduced DMI, scours and bloat disorders. Clinical symptoms disappeared 8 days after withdrawal of the supplement. LW increased with time (P &lt; 0.05) and the final LW was similar for cannulated (258 ± 13.6 kg) and non-cannulated (276 ± 19.3 kg) steers. Saponin supplementation reduced total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration (P &lt; 0.05), modified pattern of individual molar VFA concentrations and moderately increased ruminal pH (P &lt; 0.05). Cannulated and non-cannulated steers fed the BD had similar daily (g) methane or yield (CH4 g/kg DMI) emissions while in respiratory chambers. However, compared with cannulated (8.0 ± 1.20 ng/mL) animals, the addition of 30 g of TSS in the BD increased (P &lt; 0.01) blood CH4 concentration in non-cannulated (15.6 ± 1.74 ng/mL) animals. Diets supplemented with 30 g of TSS were associated with higher chloride (P &lt; 0.01) and alkaline phosphatase (P &lt; 0.05) blood concentrations, and lower serum concentrations of potassium and urea nitrogen (P &lt; 0.01), iron and total lipase (P &lt; 0.05), than was the BD.

If odor is regarded solely as a nuisance, and not an environmental hazard (as in this research), such that the objective of treating ventilation exhaust air is to prevent odor from impacting nearby receptors, it is unnecessary to treat exhaust air when dispersed odor is not identifiable. This approach maximizes odor reduction potential when most needed, with economic benefit through decreased energy and resource usage by simply operating the mitigation device for less time. The objectives of this article were: to develop an on-off, real-time control system for on-farm odor mitigation devices and provide insight on the potential reduction in operation time of any odor mitigation strategy for climatic variability. The Impact Based Odor Control System (IBOCS) monitors wind speed, wind direction, and insolation to determine atmospheric stability, and utilizes location of nearby receptors relative to a facility to conclude if exhaust air requires treatment. A prototype of IBOCS was developed and consisted of an Arduino to execute the control algorithm and manage sensor measurements, receptor directional locations, and device activation or deactivation. The user interface included an eight-direction toggle switch indicator (i.e., receptor directional location), power switch, automatic/manual switch to override IBOCS, and additional tactile inputs for manual control. The feasibility of implementing IBOCS was evaluated at five simulated locations (MN, IA, MO, IN, and NC) in the United States by computing the reduction in annual mitigation device operation based on IBOCS logic from Typical Meteorological Year 3 data sets. Regardless of receptor location relative to a simulated facility site, IBOCS logic estimated annual mitigation technology operation to range from 64.4% (NC) to 71.4% (IN). Further, the minimum estimated annual operation ranged from 14.2% (IA) to 27.9% (MO) with only one receptor present. The overall goal of IBOCS is to reduce the impact of dispersed odor while concurrently decreasing operational expenses for expensive mitigation technologies. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Dispersion; Emissions; Mitigation; Swine; Ventilation","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Computer control systems; Control systems; Dispersion (waves); Location; Particulate emissions; Real time control; Reconfigurable hardware; User interfaces; Ventilation; Ventilation exhausts; Wind; Atmospheric stability; Climatic variability; Environmental hazards; Mitigation; Mitigation strategy; Operational expense; Swine; Typical meteorological year; Odor control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989306741

In this chapter, we look at the main environmental agencies of each of these countries, namely the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) in the US and the Ministry of the Environment (MoE) in Japan. We examine and analyze the major enacted laws of the EPA and MoE that have been designed to achieve environmental protection, restoration, and preservation, and to protect human health and the health of flora and fauna. And we also discuss various initiatives implemented by the two agencies to protect local and global environments, such as those aimed at reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and climate change, protection of air and water quality, removal of toxins from the environment, more efficient use of resources, and recycling, among others. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The mosquito lifecycle is known to be influenced by temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity. This retrospective study was planned to investigate whether climatic factors could be used to predict the occurrence of dengue in East Delhi.METHODS: The number of monthly dengue cases reported over 19 years was obtained from the laboratory records of our institution. Monthly data of rainfall, temperature, and humidity collected from a local weather station were correlated with the number of monthly reported dengue cases. One-way analysis of variance was used to analyse whether the climatic parameters differed significantly among seasons. Four models were developed using negative binomial generalized linear model analysis. Monthly rainfall, temperature, humidity, were used as independent variables, and the number of dengue cases reported monthly was used as the dependent variable. The first model considered data from the same month, while the other three models involved incorporating data with a lag phase of 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively.RESULTS: The greatest number of cases was reported during the post-monsoon period each year. Temperature, rainfall, and humidity varied significantly across the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon periods. The best correlation between these three climatic factors and dengue occurrence was at a time lag of 2 months.CONCLUSIONS: This study found that temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity significantly affected dengue occurrence in East Delhi. This weather-based dengue empirical model can forecast potential outbreaks 2-month in advance, providing an early warning system for intensifying dengue control measures.","Dengue; Empirical model; Humidity; Rainfall; Temperature","rain; dengue; female; forecasting; human; humidity; incidence; India; male; procedures; retrospective study; statistical model; temperature; transmission; Dengue; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; India; Male; Models, Statistical; Rain; Retrospective Studies; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014108626

Such an analysis also helps in targeting adaptation investments, specific to more vulnerable regions. Adopting the definition of vulnerability given by IPCC, vulnerability was assessed for 572 rural districts of India. Thirty eight indicators reflecting sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure were chosen to construct the composite vulnerability index. Climate projections of the PRECIS model for A1B scenario for the period 2021-2050 were considered to capture the future climate. The data on these indicators were normalized based on the nature of relationship. They were then combined into three indices for sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity, which were then averaged with weights given by experts, to obtain the relative vulnerability index. Based on the index, all the districts were divided into five categories with equal number of districts. One more district was added to 'very high' and 'high' categories. The analysis showed that districts with higher levels of vulnerability are located in the western and peninsular India. It is also observed that the highly fertile Indo-Gangetic Plains are relatively more sensitive, but less vulnerable because of higher adaptive capacity and lower exposure.","Adaptive capacity and exposure; Agriculture; Climate change; Sensitivity; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973358420

In a plant growing experiment, under otherwise equal conditions, two different radiation sources were used with different photosynthetic photon flux but practically the same illuminance of 10 kLx in the plant-growing zone. In the first irradiation facility an induction 400 W lamp was installed. The ratio of emission intensity between three spectral bands (blue kB 400-500 nm, green kG 500-600 nm and red kR 600-700 nm) was kB: kG: kR = 22 %: 41 %: 37 %. In the second irradiation facility the sodium lamps with the same wattage were used. The ratio was kB: kG: kR = 10 %: 61 %: 29 %. During the plant growing period the dynamic pattern of irradiance in the plant cultivation zone was recorded; the samples of plants were taken with a certain time interval; dry matter content and the total leaf area in the sample plants were measured. The hodograph curves were plotted in the coordinates of dry matter increments, accumulated in plant leaves, and the increments of optical radiation flow dose up-taken by plants during the growing period. Reference hodograph was plotted for the lettuce plants grown under standard climate parameters and cultivation regimes. The level of energy and ecological efficiency of indoor plant lighting was estimated by the value of the normed sum of squared differences (NSSD) of coordinates of points of the experimental and the reference hodographs. In the first irradiation facility the value of NSSD = 0.0039 arbitrary units is smaller than that in the second IF (NSSD = 0.0016 arbitrary units). This indicates the higher level of energy and ecological efficiency for conditions in the second irradiation facility. The experiment proved that the level of indoor plant lighting energy and ecological efficiency essentially depends on the type of the irradiation source.","Energy and ecological efficiency; Growth curve; Hodograph; Indoor plant lighting; Lettuce; Monitoring","Cultivation; Ecology; Energy efficiency; Facilities; Forestry; Irradiation; Kinematics; Lighting; Monitoring; Radiation; Regional planning; Ecological efficiency; Growth curves; Hodographs; Indoor plants; Lettuce; Plants (botany); agricultural technology; cultivation; ecological modeling; energy efficiency; estimation method; graphical method; growth curve; herb; irradiation; leaf area; leafy vegetable; light effect; monitoring system; photosynthesis; spectral analysis; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976553745

The exterior envelope, building form and orientation, service core placement, plan layout, and special design elements like atria and sky gardens were the subject of investigation. effectiveness of different design strategies for reducing the cooling, heating, ventilation and electric lighting energy usage. Finally, lessons from these buildings’ were defined for the three climates. Furthermore, a comparison of building energy performance data with international benchmarks confirmed that in temperate and sub-tropical climates sustainable design strategies for high-rise buildings were performing well, as a result leading to lower energy consumption.

The CPP was developed to CO2 emissions from affected fossil fired (coal, oil, or natural gas) electricity generating units by a 32% reduction in CO2 emissions from the electric power sector in the US compared to 2005 levels of those affected united. For the CPP, the best system of emissions reduction defined by EPA is a set of measures, or ""building blocks"" and guidelines to be used by states to develop state system plans that reflect the system. The CPP scenario alternatives available for states developing individual plans but needing to coordinate across regions were studied to develop cost-effective compliance pathways for power generators.

This poses an enormous risk to the performance, reliability, durability and service life of engines that employ exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as a prime technology to meet stringent emission regulations, laid out by various regulating bodies across the globe like the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and International Maritime Organization (IMO). Operating on fuels with higher Sulfur content poses a risk of reduced engine component life, due to the formation of concentrated Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which, if not handled carefully, would lead to higher rates of corrosion on engine parts. Hence, the ability to predict the potential for H2SO4 formation as well its quantity to be handled is essential. This research paper focuses on the development of an empirical model to predict the amount of H2SO4 condensate that can be formed in the air handling system of medium speed diesel engines. The model utilizes a combination of fundamental physics, chemistry, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. The H2SO4 prediction calculation employs basic measurable parameters from a running engine, such as engine speed, load, EGR flow rate, fuel flow rate, fuel Sulfur concentration to compute a molar balance of hydrocarbon fuel and combustion air quantities along the entire range of engine operation, providing the amount of H2SO4 condensate formed. This is done primarily at EGR cooler, where the recycled exhaust gas gets cooled primarily and the EGR mixer, where it gets cooled further after coming in contact with the charge air and are identified as critical locations.

Bangladesh is a small country in South Asia with a huge population. The country has many isolated areas that are not connected to the national grid. People living in those off-grid areas mainly use diesel generators that emit GHGs into the atmosphere contributing to global warming. Electricity production using solar energy can be an attractive alternative from economic and environmental perspective. The present study attempts to conduct a techno-economic assessment by developing a bottom-up data-intensive spread-sheet-based model. The model estimates the unit cost of electricity generated by a 3.40 kWp stand-alone solar photovoltaic system (PV) for an isolated locality in Char Godagari, Rajshahi. The island has geographical coordinates of 24°28'6""N and 88°19'25""E and is situated in Rajshahi district. The unit cost of electricity by solar energy was found to be $0.72/kWh or 55.47 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT)/kWh with a net present cost of $12,027.83 or BDT 926,142.55 for the selected location, Char Godagari. The results show that battery is the most expensive component of the solar PV system.

Due to their reduced emissions, no reliance on public infrastructure and acceptable cost of ownership, hybrids are seen as a feasible intermediate step to deliver clean and affordable transportation for the masses. Such systems are immensely complex due to the number of interplaying systems and advanced control strategies used to deliver optimum performance under widely varying loads. Resonant torsional impacts arise out of the interactions due to rotational speed variations providing impulses at specific frequencies to the spinning inertias connected by members of finite stiffness. The effects, depending on the magnitude and duration of the impacts range from unacceptably harsh vibrations to catastrophic component failure. A large portion of these impact loads stem from low speed, near-stall driving maneuvers that are quite common on Indian urban roads and hence merits attention.

Calculation of emissions has therefore gained institutional importance in the European Community. Recently, the scientific community has assessed evidence that exposure to outdoor air pollution causes lung cancer and increases the risk of bladder cancer. Because air pollution in urban areas is mainly caused by transportation, it is necessary to evaluate pollutant exhaust emissions from vehicles during their real-world use. Nevertheless their evaluation and reduction is a key problem, especially in the cities, that account for more than 50% of world population. To obtain emission factors several methods make use only of vehicle mean velocity, which can be easily obtained by vehicle flow and density in the road. Among them it is worth mentioning COPERT IV, MOBILE, INFRAS, MEET models that are widely used in the practice. In ARTEMIS FP project, a new statistical approach has been developed capable to consider more attributes than the simple mean speed to characterize driving behaviour, not only in the determination of driving cycles but also in the emission modelling. In this context, a meso scale emission model, named KEM, Kinematic Emission Model, able to calculate emission factor was developed. However, it is necessary to consider that the input to this model is, in any case, the driving cycle, and that to develop a quantitative method capable to determine the exact mix of driving cycle, on the basis of road characteristics and traffic management rules, results a very hard job. In addition a particular attention could be given to the slope variability along the streets during each journey performed by the instrumented vehicle. So in this paper we try to develop a second version of KEM model that dealt with the problem of describing and introducing same variables relative to road gradient variability in a quantitatively way. In the context of correlation study between driving cycles/emission/geographical location, we have to solve some problems for the reconstruction of GPS coordinates and altitude, during an experimental campaign realized with an instrumented car. © 2016 The Authors.","air pollution; driving cycles; emission model; slope",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991387275

The study was undertaken to analyse the active regional thermal series over the 1950-1999 period, rigorously treated by the SNHT (Standard Normal Homogeneity Test) method. In this context, fifteen years later, it was considered judicious to verify the validity of the trends and conclusions that the regional climate offered at the end of the 20th century. The objectives of this study are twofold: the verification of the Significant Climate Warming in the Spanish Mediterranean concluded in the National Plan on Climate Change (1950-1999) and the evaluation of the importance that the Urban Heat Island (UHI) has on the warming process. Within the context of the thermal evolution of the region over the 1950-2013 period, this verification has been supported by an experimental research plan aimed at analysing the thermal processes inherent to the urbanisation effect. Although the effect is undeniable, its importance is a matter of controversy. The results obtained have shown both the nature of the phenomenon and its significant magnitude. This magnitude could account for between 70 and 80% of the recorded warming trend in Western Mediterranean cities. Therefore, failure to take this process into account might seriously bias any analysis of regional thermal evolution, the main aim of this study and an aim that equally affects the hypothesis of global climate change. © 2016, Associacio Catalana de Meteorologia.

This paper investigates the crucial factors that affect technological capability development by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) in China. It identifies how differently sized ESCOs make progress in developing TCs. Through looking at the successes achieved by developed countries in the field of energy conservation, ESCOs are able to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions and are deemed to provide an effective means of conserving energy in China. Existing literature indicates that limited TC levels of are one of the crucial barriers facing Chinese ESCOs. Through investigating three different sizes of Chinese ESCO - small, medium-sized and large - this paper provides a framework to present the idea that Chinese ESCOs' TC development is affected by four key internal and external capabilities: management capability, investment capability, innovation capability and linkage capability. Through comparative analysis, the paper establishes that small and medium-sized private ESCOs are mainly affected by investment and linkage capabilities. Large state-owned ESCOs are mainly affected by innovation and management capability. In addition, all three types of ESCO exhibit a strong desire to develop their technological capability, but small and medium-sized ESCOs exhibit a stronger desire to conduct research and development (R&D) than large ESCOs, whilst large ESCOs prefer to increase their technical reserves through acquisition.

We provide statistically significant evidence of an inverted U-shaped curve between per capita income and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions per capita. We find a negative relationship between a typical TAFTA member's capital to labor ratio and pollution levels, and suspect this is due to the reduction of its labor force. Most surprisingly, we show that an increase in income inequality may actually help reduce carbon dioxides, GHGs, and sulfur oxides per capita emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

By carefully tuning the parameters influencing the morphologies of hematite, including the synthetic procedure, the concentration of etching solution, temperature, etching time and the morphology controlling surfactant, hematite films grown on iron foil with various morphologies (e.g. nanorod, nanowire, ultrathin nanoflake and cauliflower-like shape) have been achieved. In particular, it is found that F- is an effective surfactant to control the morphology as well as the crystallization process of hematite. Ultrathin nanoflakes having a minimized feature size exhibit the best photocurrent of 0.5 mA cm-2 (1.23 V vs. RHE, RHE is reversible hydrogen electrode) among the samples tested as a result of facilitated hole diffusion to the electrolyte and thus lowered carrier recombination. Compared with pristine hematite, a nearly tripled photocurrent is observed when H2O2 is added in the electrolyte as a hole scavenger, suggesting the presence of a charge injection barrier in the surface of samples. According to this, the strategy of Co2+ treatment is utilized and the improved photocurrent is seen, likely due to the improved water oxidation kinetics and surface state passivation. We believe that this convenient and economical method can be extended to the synthesis of other alkaline metal oxide nanomaterials as long as the redox potential of S2O82-/SO42- is higher than Mn+/M (M refers to metal). © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Alkalinity; Conductive films; Electrolytes; Etching; Hematite; Metals; Morphology; Nanorods; Photocurrents; Redox reactions; Surface active agents; Ultrathin films; Alkaline metal oxides; Carrier recombination; Charge injection barriers; Conducting substrates; Crystallization process; Photo-electrochemistry; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Synthetic procedures; Film preparation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992187840

The natural processes are represented by biological activities such as bacterial methane oxidation and plant uptake for carbon dioxide at topsoil layer. Landfill gas is transported through soil layers in landfill top or in nearby areas before being released to the atmosphere. Whilst transported in the soil layers the biogas is mixed with atmospheric air and the methane may hence be oxidized by the methanotrophic bacteria in the soil using oxygen from atmosphere. Methane oxidation is affected by different environmental factors such as; temperature, water content, nutrients, substrate and oxygen concentrations. One of the ways to decrease greenhouse emissions in the future is to plant fast growing woody crops thereby sequestering carbon and displacing fossil fuels by harvesting woody biomass for bio-energy, or by storing carbon in long-lived woody products. Plant uptake for carbon dioxide is affected by some parameters such as; CO2 concentration, nitrogen concentration, water content and temperature. The engineered processes are represented by various physical biogas extractions; gas is collected using network of collection pipes and wells. The gas collection efficiency in landfills is between 40-90%. Landfill gas can be collected by either a passive or an active collection system. Passive gas collection systems use existing variations in landfill pressure and gas concentrations to vent landfill gas into the atmosphere or a control system. Active gas collection is considered a good means of landfill gas collection. An active collection system composed of extraction wells connected to header pipe to a pump that delivers gas for energy recovery. © 2016 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Biogas; CO2 plant uptake; Gas extraction; GHGs; Methane oxidation","biogas; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; oxidation; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947585373

Therefore, this research is carried out in order to identify the level of adaptability of biomass as a fuel in the local manufacturing sector and corresponding problems, thereby to develop a model which can be utilized for policy development in the future. Methodology consists of several phases; in the first phase, surveys were conducted for different manufacturing sectors, which have adapted this technology recently, through a structured survey which covered supply chain management, maintenance issues, health and safety and history in related to biomass.

CO2 is the most common of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and is a main contributor to climate change. For this reason, efficient policies and control strategies have to be implemented in order to reduce the output of CO2 from road traffic. Fine-scaled information on the spatial and temporal distribution of traffic-related CO2 emissions can support the decision making process with regard to emission mitigation measures. For the purpose of providing such information, commonly traffic emission models are applied. However, such models are often restricted in their spatiooral resolution due to a lack of adequate input data. A potential data source could be provided by the extended Floating Car Data (xFCD) approach, where vehicle operation parameters like fuel consumption are read out on-trip via the vehicles onboard diagnostic system (OBD-2) and get correlated with vehicle positions and timestamps at short recording intervals. In this work, the potential of fuel consumption recordings from xFCD for quantifying traffic-related CO2 emissions is evaluated. For this, three different methodologies of calculating representative fuel consumption-based emission factors from xFCD on the level of road segments and 15-minute intervals are developed and applied in case studies in the city of Salzburg, Austria. The results indicate that the determination of representative driving patterns, based on vehicle kinematic parameters derived from vehicle position sequences, which are correlated with xFCD driving patterns with fuel consumption recordings, are suitable to calculate representative and fine-scaled CO2 emission factors.","CO2 emissions; Extended floating car data; GNSS; Traffic emission models","carbon dioxide; climate change; data assimilation; decision making; emission control; environmental modeling; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; measurement method; pollution policy; temporal distribution; traffic emission; vehicle component; Austria; Salzburg [Austria]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960851102

The incapability to model capillarity with the consideration of imperative pore size distribution (PSD) characteristics using commercial software may lead to inaccurate results for CCUS.

PWHT is required for carbon steels above a Code-defined thickness threshold and other low-alloy steels to mitigate the propensity for crack initiation and ultimately, brittle fracture. Additionally, PWHT is often employed to mitigate stress corrosion cracking due to environmental conditions. Performing local PWHT following component repairs or alterations is often more practical and cost effective than heat treating an entire vessel or a large portion of the pressure boundary. In particular, spot or bulls eye configurations are often employed in industry to perform PWHT following local weld repairs to regions of the pressure boundary. Both the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel (B&PV) Code and the National Board Inspection Code (NBIC) permit the use of local PWHT around nozzles or other pressure boundary repairs or alterations. Additionally, Welding Research Council (WRC) Bulletin 452 [1] offers detailed guidance relating to local PWHT and compares some of the Code-based methodologies for implementing local PWHT on pressure retaining equipment. Specifically, local PWHT methodologies provided in design Codes: ASME Section VIII Division 1 [2] and Division 2 [3], ASME Section III Subsection NB [4], British Standard 5500 [5], Australian Standard 1210 [6], and repair Codes: American Petroleum Institute (API) 510 [7] and NBIC [8] are discussed and compared in this study. While spot PWHT may be appropriate in certain cases, if the soak, heating, and gradient control bands are not properly sized and positioned, it can lead to permanent vessel distortion or detrimental residual stresses that can increase the likelihood of in-service crack initiation and possible catastrophic failure due to unstable flaw propagation. It is essential to properly engineer local or spot PWHT configurations to ensure that distortion, cracking of adjacent welds, and severe residual stresses are avoided. In some cases, this may require advanced thermal-mechanical finite element analysis (FEA) to simulate the local PWHT process and to predict the ensuing residual stress state of the repaired area. This paper investigates several case studies of local PWHT configurations where advanced, three-dimensional FEA is used to simulate the thermal-mechanical response of the repaired region on a pressure vessel and to optimize the most ideal PWHT arrangement. Local plasticity and distortion are quantified using advanced non-linear elastic-plastic analysis. Commentary on the ASME and NBIC Code-specified local PWHT requirements is rendered based on the detailed non-linear FEA results, and recommended good practice for typical local PWHT configurations is provided. Advanced computational simulation techniques such as the ones employed in this investigation offer a means for analysts to ensure that local PWHT configurations implemented following equipment repairs will not lead to costly additional damage, such as distortion or cracking that can ultimately prolong equipment downtime.

'Local provenancing' is the established strategy for sourcing germplasm for ecological restoration plantings, yet this approach gives little consideration to the persistence of these plantings under future climates. This paper provides a synopsis of recent and ongoing research that the authors are undertaking on climate adaptation in eucalypts, combining new genomic approaches with ecophysiological evidence from provenance trials. These studies explore how adaptive diversity is distributed within and among populations, whether populations are buffered against change through capacity for phenotypic plasticity, and how this informs provenancing strategies. Results to date suggest that eucalypts have some capacity to respond to future environmental instability through adaptive phenotypic plasticity or selection of putatively adaptive alleles. Despite this, growing evidence suggests that eucalypts will still be vulnerable to change. Provenancing strategies that exploit adaptations found in non-local provenances could thus confer greater climate-resilience in ecological restoration plantings, although they will also need to account for potential interactions between climate adaptations and other factors (e.g. cryptic evolutionary variation, non-climate-related adaptations, herbivory and elevated CO2).","Acclimation; Adaptive capacity; Eucalyptus; Genome-wide scans; Plasticity","adaptation; agricultural land; allele; ecological stability; ecosystem resilience; environmental restoration; evergreen tree; germplasm; natural selection; persistence; phenotypic plasticity; Australia; Eucalyptus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990955029

Using a long-term data set on seven alpine lakes (3126 to 3620 m) in Colorado, USA, we show that ice-off dates have shifted 7 days earlier over the past 33 years and that spring weather conditions—especially snowfall—drive yearly variation in ice-off timing. In the most well studied lake, earlier ice-off associated with increases in water residence times, thermal stratification, ion concentrations, dissolved nitrogen, pH, and chlorophyll a. Mechanistically, low spring snowfall and warm temperatures reduce summer stream flow (increasing lake residence times) but enhance melting of glacial and permafrost ice (increasing lake solute inputs).

It has proven worldwide its technical capabilities for more than 50 years for gas-insulated switchgear, circuit breakers and instrument transformers as well as for gas-insulated transmission lines. SF6 gas technology represents the state-of-the art, with very good arc-quenching properties and dielectric strength for insulation purposes. SF6allows an easy and accurate gas density respectively leakage measurement. Moreover it can be handled without health risks for human beings or the environment as it is non-toxic. Nevertheless, SF6 has a significant potential impact on world ecological system with its contribution to the Global Warming Potential (GWP), whenever emitted. Therefore, in parallel to the optimization of the above mentioned factors in order to reduce gas emission and losses, the manufacturers of transmission equipment have done extensive research and development activities to seek for alternatives. These alternatives should have a lower environmental impact over their entire life-cycles. Several alternative solutions for high-voltage products have been presented during the last 20 years. For example, products from Asian and European manufacturers are already available with Dry Air/CO2 insulation in the market. Applications with CO2 as arc-quenching gas have also been presented and installed. At Cigré 2014, alternatives gases to SF6 based on hydrofluorocarbons including gas groups such as fluoroketones (perfluorinated ketones), or fluoronitriles (fluorinated nitriles) with mixtures of N2 or CO2 were presented for arc-quenching and insulating purposes. Another alternative technology to SF6 for switching is the utilization of vacuum interrupter units for arc-quenching, which is a proven technology in medium voltage. Vacuum interrupter units have proven reliable making and breaking capabilities through many switching operations without any significant ageing of materials and depreciation of functionality. For example, 72.5 kV life- and dead tank vacuum circuit breakers are successfully in operation at several European utilities. In conjunction with alternative gases for insulation the solution can result in multifunctional compact switchgear designs. Siemens has started to implement GIS technology based on fluorine-free gas insulation with Clean Air and vacuum circuit breaker. Hence this paper compares the new solution with the SF6 GIS products and other approaches with alternative gases. Operational experiences are presented as well as results from testing of specific high-voltage products. Moreover the different SF6 alternative approaches are discussed based on life cycle assessment to underline the environmental sustainable impact. © 2016 CIGRE.

Among weather extremes, summer drought, monsoon flood, strong wind (blows in Palghat Gap from November to February, other than cyclonic wind across the State), hailstorms, unusual rains, landslides and warming may adversely affect plantation crops’ production and its quality. Heat wave and cold waves are not relevant with reference to plantation crops under the Humid Tropics. The effect of summer drought on coconut yield was noticed in 1983, 2004 and 2013. In the case of coffee, it appears that crop matures early in recent years due to increase in temperature and climate change. The quality of coffee and black pepper, nut size in coconut and cashew are also influenced due to global warming and climate change.

The Aviation industry has transformed the way of travelling across globe. Now it is more economic, comfortable and accessible to travel. Unfortunately, this revolution in aviation has brought various environmental issues; gaseous emissions and noise nuisance. These gaseous emissions disrupt the eco-system normal operating process. These gases have serious implications on the global environment and pose a great risk for human health. The NOx (NO and NO2) is a major concern; especially around the airports locality, where it can create ozone gas which is harmful to the wellbeing. In spite of much advancement in fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the rapid growth of air travel in recent years has contributed to an increase in total emissions. According to the ICAO, the contribution of civil aircraft to global greenhouse emissions has been estimated at around 2%. The Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), which assists ICAO in the formulation of new policies on aircraft noise and emissions, has presented a number of policies in the last decade in order to curb down the aviation emissions. Due to these emission regulations, the aviation industry is looking into the ways to cut down its global emission imprints.The primary objective of this paper is to assess the suitability of the stirred reactor modelling approach to predict NOx emissions of a Rich-Burn Quick-Quench Lean-Burn (RQL) combustor concept. This paper further illustrates the axial variation in the main parameters such as equivalence ratio, NOx mass fractions and temperature for a NASA test rig experiment combustor geometry from the RQL combustor model based on the stirred reactor method.

Atmospheric compensation methods typically perform optimally when ancillary ground truth data are available, e.g., high fidelity in situ radiometric observations or atmospheric profile measurements. When ground truth is incomplete or not available, additional assumptions must be made to perform the compensation. Meteorological climatologies are available to provide climatological norms for input into the radiative transfer models; however no such climatologies exist for empirical methods. The success of atmospheric compensation methods such as the empirical line method suggests that remotely sensed HSI scenes contain comprehensive sets of atmospheric state information within the spectral data itself. It is argued that large collections of empirically-derived atmospheric coefficients collected over a range of climatic and atmospheric conditions comprise a resource that can be applied to prospective atmospheric compensation problems. A previous study introduced a new climatological approach to atmospheric compensation in which empirically derived spectral information, rather than sensible atmospheric state variables, is the fundamental datum. The current work expands the approach across an experimental archive of 127 airborne HSI datasets spanning nine physical sites to represent varying climatological conditions. The representative atmospheric compensation coefficients are assembled in a scientific database of spectral observations and modeled data. Improvements to the modeling methods used to standardize the coefficients across varying collection and illumination geometries and the resulting comparisons of adjusted coefficients are presented. The climatological database is analyzed to show that common spectral similarity metrics can be used to separate the climatological classes to a degree of detail commensurate with the modest size and range of the imaging conditions comprising the study. © 2016 SPIE.","Atmospheric compensation; Climatology; Empirical line method; HSI; Hyperspectral; Remote sensing","Climatology; Earth atmosphere; Radiative transfer; Spectroscopy; Atmospheric compensation; Atmospheric conditions; Climatological conditions; Detection and identifications; Empirical line; Hyper-spectral imageries; HyperSpectral; Radiative transfer model; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987858669

Considering the global warming and limited energy resource issues as well as international energy regulations, Switzerland has set self-energy strategies for the horizon of 2050, called as ""Swiss energy strategy 2050"". In accordance with the Swiss Confederation, the canton of Vaud has set strategic objectives to develop renewable energies, to ensure security of energy supply and to promote energy efficiency. With these perspectives, several specific actions have been launched, among which the three programs of Energy Audit of Large Consumers (EALC), Energy Saving Buyback through Tender (ESBT), and Territorial Energy Planning (TEP) will be described in detail. A novel Energy Audit program for Large Consumers (EALC) has been proposed to encourage companies to optimize their energy consumption. With 33% of final energy consumption in the canton of Vaud, large consumers represent an important target for energy saving and have been mentioned in the revision of the cantonal energy law with the obligation for energy efficiency. This program is emphasizing on the multiple benefits linked to the energy efficiency measures. Its main feature in addition to the economic benefit is helping companies to improve their competitiveness by considering three components: adding a value, decreasing their risk exposure and cost reduction. The Energy Saving Buyback program through Tender (ESBT) is another encouragement action proposed within a similar vision. The ESBT addresses the importance of improving the efficiency in companies even before promoting renewable energy sources. The subsidy attribution is merit based and will be granted to project drafts with the best value for money and energy efficiency. In the framework of regional and local development, the program of Territorial Energy Planning (TEP) has been proposed to promote the use of renewable energy and to better integrate energy infrastructures in land-use planning. The TEP program determines the energy supply strategies for each land development planning in the canton of Vaud using the estimated existing and future energy demand and the potential of renewable energy. The proposed programs are part of the canton's plan to reduce CO2 emission to 1.5 million tons and to increase the renewable energy share in total energy consumption up to 30% by 2050. © 2016 University of Ljubljana.","Energy Efficiency; Energy Strategy; Energy Tender; Large Consumers; Territorial Energy Planning","Cost reduction; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Land use; Renewable energy resources; Risk management; Energy planning; Energy strategy; Energy Tender; Large consumers; Limited energy resource; Renewable energy source; Total energy consumption; Use of renewable energies; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084244904

In the ACCSEAS project (2012-2015) the future accessibility of the North Sea region was investigated from a shipping perspective. The EfficienSea project (2009-2012) and the two MONALISA projects (2010-2013, and 2013-2015) investigated Sea Traffic Management (STM) as a way to optimize ship traffic that might satisfy safety and efficiency demands as well as the demands for lower emissions. The paper will look in detail on the navigational solutions and the user tests that has been done with ship officers, pilots and VTS operators. The EU commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 2050 is another factor acting on the shipping industry. By ""slow steaming"" and just-in-time-arrival, substantial reduction in emissions can be made. A surprising finding was the large number of planned offshore windmill installations in the North Sea. Managing a growing number of ships in a shrinking sea space will led to issues of who is in control: the master onboard or the central coordination mechanism overseeing the whole traffic situation. The task of the mariner risk being reduced to keeping the ship in a time-slot-box, monitoring an ever better automation. In addition, slower speeds lead to longer voyages, which risk being less socially attractive. Lack of competent seafarers is already today a problem. Finally, the issue of unmanned ships will be considered, the MUNIN project (2013-2015), Maritime Unmanned Navigation through Intelligence in Networks. Even before this project has finished the industry has picked up some of these new possibilities and has proposed different solutions for unmanned ships, one of them electrical, with zero emission. © 2016 The Authors.","ACCSEAS; e-navigation; EfficienSea; MONALISA project; MUNIN; route exchange",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991288233

However, not all the nutrient ions in a fertilizer applied to soil are taken up by crops, thus certain amount of the applied fertilizer is lost from agricultural fields leading to increases in nitrogen surplus, nitrogen losses to the environment and harmful impacts on biodiversity, air and water quality. This study aims to focus on crop fertilisation planning which is based on the knowledge of physical and chemical properties of soil and involves performing soil tests, designing a fertilisation plan and its practical implementation as well as calculating the balance of N, and to evaluate crop fertilisation planning as a tool for achieving balanced economic and environmental benefits in crop farming, which play an important role in efficient farming. In this study, the authors have analysed current situation in Latvia regarding requirements for fertilization planning in crop farms and have assessed potential costs and benefits from fertilisation planning. The research finds out that total cost of introducing of fertilisation planning ranges from 34 to 22 EUR ha-1, however, fertilisation planning is a neutral measure where costs are compensated by savings from N inputs which ranges from 10 to 40 kg N ha-1.Fertilisation planning generates environmental benefits, i.e. - reduces direct N2O emissions from agricultural soils by 47 - 187 kg CO2eq ha-1 through reduced N fertilizer inputs.","Fertilisation planning; GHG emissions; Nitrous oxide; Savings","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Costs; Crops; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Regional planning; Soil testing; Soils; Water quality; Agricultural production system; Economic and environmental benefits; Environmental benefits; Fertilisation; GHG emission; Nitrous oxide; Physical and chemical properties; Savings; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036642678

In this study, congested area cordon entry and Park-and-Ride (P/R) facility use are priced for automobiles. Increase in these prices may reduce private auto demand by impelling some of the auto passengers to use public transport from the origin of their trips, or encouraging them to park their cars at the P/R facilities and use buses, or pay the entrance fee and drive inside the cordon. A Markov decision process has been devised to find an optimal policy for pricing the P/R facilities and cordon entry in a city within a variable demand context. This process is sensitive to weather condition (more favorable atmospheric condition allows lower prices). It leads to a balance between the costs of pollution hazards to the public at large on one side and the cost imposed upon auto drivers to take the next best decisions and their travel times and costs on the other side, thus giving a resilient character to the city.

One of the more relevant aspects studied is the demand for risk management in terms of exposure to disasters of the agricultural areas and their vulnerability. Crossing this analysis with the policy scheme, it is possible to assess its effectiveness in covering climatic risks.

Most of the production comes from large reservoirs during the late stage of development, which makes us look for reliable methods to increase production while reducing capital expenditures. Traditionally carbonate reservoir acidizing is considered to be an effective method to increase oil recovery. However, this is not always true for the Devonian carbonate formations of Timan-Pechora region. In conditions of low reservoir temperature (60-70 C), dissection cut, high tectonic stress and the tendency to water cut increasing classic acidizing and acid fracturing are ineffective without the use of advanced technologies. Acid Fracturing has been selected by JC RUSVIETPETRO as a basic method for the pilot stimulation campaign in 2015. 15% HCl was used as the main fluid for reservoir with a temperature of 65C. Heavy oil tendency to deposit paraffins and create sludge promoted the use of an acid emulsion with the solvent. Low permeability and dismembered reservoir structure required formations merging into a single system of fractures and leveling inflow profile. Viscoelastic surfactant was applied to this end, having the properties of both the classic diverter in matrix acidizing and as a ""buffer stage"" for acid fracturing, helping to increase the fracture half-length. Also in 2016 in addition to the described systems, fiber diverter was applied for acid fracturing the first time in Russia in the fields of the Timan-Pechora. It allows to achieve even greater results in stimulation by natural fractures plugging in reservoir and redirecting acid fractures flows. The oil fields are located in the Nenets Autonomous District, which automatically imposes a large number of restrictions on the methods of stimulation because of complex logistics and low temperatures. In 2015 winter season, when winter roads were availble from February to April, the first stimulation campaign was performed. Most of the wells produce from two clusters of Famennian stage at a depth of 3200 m. The main inflow of the hydrocarbons comes from the lower, more permeable interval, while the top remains untapped. Thus, after water cut increasing of the lower cluster, wells keep sufficient production capacity at the top cluster if stimulated by selective acid fracturing. Hydraulic acid fracturing was performed after mechanical isolation of the lower cluster and with application of new modern technologies, which increased the productivity of wells on average 4.3 times, with an average increase in production by 20.4 tonnes of oil/day. Taking into account the results of the first stimulation campaign in 2016 stimulation jobs continued with using of fiber diverter, the uniqueness of which is the ability to temporarily block fractures and redirect their development in heterogeneous reservoir. Whereby a multi-fractures structure is created and increases the contact area of the fracture and the formation, and as a result the efficiency of acid fracturing increases. According to the results of the second winter stimulation project the average increase of production rate was 21.9 tons/ day/well. © 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Acidization; Carbonation; Chlorine compounds; Crude oil; Emulsification; Gasoline; Heavy oil production; Low permeability reservoirs; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Proven reserves; Capital expenditures; Carbonate formations; Fracture half-length; Heterogeneous reservoirs; Increase productions; Mechanical isolation; Reservoir temperatures; Viscoelastic surfactants; Fracture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048558599

Due to the functional and structural changes of special subsections of the district substantial local climatic changes occurred in the past few decades. The local government made efforts to complete several block rehabilitation programs already starting from the 1980s. Within the framework of these programs inner parts of the blocks were demolished, thus, inside the blocks more public green areas could be created.

Chemical species considered include the atmospheric trace gases CO, H2, and CH4, as well as the non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), i-butane (i-C4H10), and n-butane (n-C4H10). The correlation between atmospheric variability and lifetime was applied on a global scale spanning 42 sites with observations covering a period of 5 years. More than 50,000 individual flask measurement results were included in this analysis, making this the most extensive study of the variability-lifetime relationship to date. Regression variables calculated from the variability-lifetime relationship were used to assess the ""remoteness"" of sampling sites and to estimate the effect of local pollution on the measured distribution of atmospheric trace gases. It was found that this relationship yields reasonable results for description of the site remoteness and local pollution influences. Comparisons of seasonal calculated OH concentrations ([OH]) from the variability-lifetime relationships with six direct station measurements yielded variable agreement, with deviations ranging from ∼20% to a factor of ∼2-3 for locations where [OH] monitoring results had been reported. [OH] calculated from the variability-lifetime relationships was also compared to outputs from a global atmospheric model. Resutls were highly variable, with approximately half of the sites yielding agreement to within a factor of 2-3, while others showed deviations of up to an order of magnitude, especially during winter. © 2016 Pollmann et al.",,"air sampling; atmospheric gas; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); ethane; NOAA satellite; pollution incidence; pollution monitoring; propane; site characterization; speciation (chemistry); trace gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015949501

Kyoto Protocol and subsequent climate change conferences leading upto the Paris submit this year has put still more emphasis on this agenda. Construction of heavy traffic unpaved access roads require huge amount of aggregate mining and long haulage in the areas of scarce virgin aggregate. Conventional practices in these road constructions seek structural adequacy but never specifically address the sustainability issue. Innovative technology that can reduce the volume of aggregate material while maintaining the structural integrity is required to address the sustainability issue of these roads construction. This paper discusses the construction of these roads with high strength Geocell (Neoloy) reinforcement giving special reference to Oil Sand region of Alberta. These Geocells improve the modulus and strength of the reinforced composite and durability of the road structure by drastically reducing the required quantity of aggregate material. Operation of these access roads has also demonstrated saving on running cost, maintenance and down time. Neoloy Geocells also make it possible to use recycled and locally available cheaper materials for road construction still exceeding the overall performance of conventional construction. In terms of sustainability the benefit will be more visible when the carbon footprint is analyzed for the virgin material mining and haulage to the construction site. A basic analysis of CO: Emission reduction and how it is applied to new emission standards in Alberta industry with this innovative method is also discussed.","Access roads; CO2 emission; Neoloy geocells; Sustainable construction","Aggregates; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Geotechnical engineering; Oil sands; Reinforcement; Road construction; Roads and streets; Sustainable development; Access roads; CO2 emissions; Conventional constructions; Geocells; Innovative technology; Reinforced composites; Sustainability issues; Sustainable construction; Transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030726163

Grassland soils have particularly high soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. In Europe (EU 25), grasslands cover 22% of the land area. It is therefore important to understand the effects of grassland management and management intensity on SOC storage. City lawns constitute a unique study system in this context, since they provide a high functional diversity and thus a wide range of different management intensities per unit area. In this study we investigated frequently mown (on average eight times per season) utility lawns and rarely mown (once per season) meadow-like lawns at three multi-family housing areas in each of three Swedish cities: Uppsala, Malmö, and Gothenburg. The two different lawn types were compared regarding their aboveground net primary production (NPP) and SOC storage. In addition, root biomass was determined in Uppsala.We found significantly higher aboveground NPP and SOC concentrations and significantly lower soil C :N ratio for the utility lawns compared with the meadow-like lawns. On average, aboveground NPP was 24% or 0.7MgCha1 yr1 higher and SOC was 12% or 7.8Mgha1 higher. Differences in SOC were well explained by differences in aboveground NPP (R2 D 0:39), which indicates that the increase in productivity due to more optimum CO2-assimilating leaf area, leading to higher carbon input to the soil, was the major driver for soil carbon sequestration. Differences in soil C :N ratio indicated a more closed N cycle in utility lawns, which might have additionally affected SOC dynamics. We did not find any difference in root biomass between the two management regimes, and concluded that cutting frequency most likely only exerts an effect on SOC when cuttings are left on the surface. © Author(s) 2016.

A comprehensive laboratory study procedure for free volume and core sample testing in simulated reservoir conditions is represented. Certain test results for acid injection through a rock sample are given and acidizing impact on rock properties was assessed. At the present time, oil companies are facing increasing problems with hydrocarbon recovery associated with late reservoir development stages, when flow properties of a bottomhole zone are significantly reduced [1-4] or reservoirs are initially marginal. In this case, in order to enhance oil recovery, various techniques are used aimed at increase in near-wellbore permeability. The most efficient and widely used bottomhole zone stimulation method is hydraulic fracturing with preliminary bottomhole zone acidizing. Ideally, target interval acidizing should enhance the reservoir-to-well connectivity and reduce initial fracture pressure, however, permeability increase after acidizing is not always observed. Rather often there is no more increase, but decrease in permeability. A production-scale process in wells involves acids containing various surfactants and inhibitors used to change any given chemical reaction behaviour. Usually, mud acid which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used as a basis for terrigenous reservoir acidizing. Percentages of these acids in the acid formulation are 15% HCl and 3% HF, but they can be increased or reduced depending on carbonate or clay component concentration in the rock. Many researchers have found that multiphase chemical dissolution of carbonate component, silicate minerals, colmatant particles introduced in the process of well drilling, killing and operation, and precipitation of various kinds of settlings with their re-dissolution take place during bottomhole zone acidizing [5-8]. As a result of chemical interaction, the acid compound changes the inner structure of rock pores and matrix that in turn leads to change in flow and stress-strain behaviour of the entire treated reservoir area. The purpose of the study was to identify the patterns of ""rock-oil-water"" system stimulation by acid compounds. © 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Acidization; Boreholes; Chlorine compounds; Dissolution; Gasoline; Oil wells; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Precipitation (chemical); Rocks; Silicate minerals; Well drilling; Chemical interactions; Component concentration; Enhance oil recoveries; Hydrocarbon recovery; Permeability increase; Reservoir conditions; Reservoir development; Stress strain behaviours; Hydrofluoric acid",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048564645

In contrast to previous assumptions, claiming a separation between carbon corrosion and platinum dissolution, in both standard protocols platinum dissolution and carbon corrosion are present at low rates, which is also reflected by a comparably low ECSA decrease. On the other hand, a huge increase in rate of both processes is observed during transitions from low to high potential regimes experienced by a PEMFC in operation, here studied in a third protocol covering the whole potential range from 0.6 to 1.5 VRHE. The latter is typically not addressed in literature. This finding is explained by taking into account platinum catalyzed carbon corrosion and transient platinum dissolution.

Using the well-established method of life-cycle assessment (LCA), potential environmental impacts of agricultural production chains can be quantified and analyzed. This study presents three case studies of how the method can pinpoint environmental hot spots at different levels of agricultural production systems. The first case study centers on the tractor as the key source of transportation and traction in modern agriculture. A common Austrian tractor model was investigated over its life-cycle, using primary data from a manufacturer and measured load profiles for field work. In all but one of the impact categories studied, potential impacts were dominated by the operation phase of the tractor’s life-cycle (mainly due to diesel fuel consumption), with 84.4-99.6% of total impacts. The production phase (raw materials and final assembly) caused between 0.4% and 12.1% of impacts, while disposal of the tractor was below 1.9% in all impact categories. The second case study shifts the focus to an entire production chain for a common biogas feedstock, maize silage. System boundaries incorporate the effect of auxiliary materials such as fertilizer and pesticides manufacturing and application. The operation of machinery in the silage production chain was found to be critical to its environmental impact. For the climate change indicator GWP100 (global warming potential, 100-year reference period), emissions from tractor operation accounted for 15 g CO2-eq per kg silage (64% of total GWP100), followed by field emissions during fertilizer (biogas digestate) application with 6 g CO2-eq per kg silage (24% of total GWP100). At a larger system scale that includes a silage-fed biogas plant with electricity generated by a biogas engine, silage cultivation operations are no longer the largest contributor; the most important contributor (49.8%) is methane slip from the exhaust of the biogas engine. In the third case study, the biogas plant model is incorporated into an even larger system, where the existing waste management and energy system in an Alpine municipality of Western Austria is expanded to include a hypothetical system that uses mainly hay from currently unused alpine grassland in a local biogas plant. Here, the relative environmental impacts depend strongly on the fossil fuels that are assumed to be displaced by the local biogas plant; methane slip emissions from the exhaust dominate the impact of the hypothetical local biogas scenario. Taken together, the case studies demonstrate the potential and limitations of LCA as a technique to support decisions of agricultural stakeholders at a variety of scales. Choosing the proper system scale is key to a successful application of this method. © 2016, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Agriculture.

The objective of this work is to understand the influence on gasoline combustion of different injector parameters such as umbrella angle, number of injection and injection timing when a 95 RON gasoline is direct injected in a commercial Diesel engine. Experiments were performed in a single-cylinder Diesel engine fueled with direct-injected 95 RON gasoline at a constant fueling rate leading to a global fuel-air equivalence ratio of 0.3. Engine speed was set to 1500 rpm. Intake pressure was set to 1 bar in order to investigate typical low load operating conditions in which turbocharger can not supply extra pressure at the intake and a constant intake temperature of 205°C was employed to enable the autoignition of gasoline. Three different injectors with 156°, 120° and 90° umbrella angle were tested. For each injector, experiments were carried out with a single and a double injection strategy and over a wide range of injection timings. The behavior of the three injectors was compared in terms of engine performances and pollutant emission. Advanced injection timings were necessary to enable gasoline autoignition. Results showed that a wide umbrella angle can limit the advance in injection timing because of part of the fuel is directed towards the squish region and do not participate at the combustion event. A narrower injection angle allowed to better concentrate the fuel inside the piston head bowl: the autoignition of gasoline originated from fuel-air mixture characterized by richer distribution of the local equivalence-ratio, improving combustion efficiency and reducing the formation of HC and CO while maintaining low emission of NOx. However, such advanced injection timings led gasoline to autoignite under premixed conditions characterized by an intense heat release rate. For both injectors, a double injection strategy was employed to introduce the sufficient fuel stratification necessary to reduce the heat release rate and the combustion noise. For low load operation of GCI engine and for a fixed bowl geometry the two injectors with 156° and 120° offered better performance in terms of indicated efficiency while maintaining acceptable level of noise. On the other side, a 90° injector showed the lower emission of NOx and HC. © 2016, FISITA.

Natural gas is treated as more environmentally friendly with high methane content and lower emission factors. In order to calculate the environmental impact in the whole life cycle associated with combustion of coal and natural gas all stages from ""cradle to grave"" should be taken into account. In particular, the transportation stage, especially in the case of life cycle analysis of gas, seems to be crucial. The distance of transmission of gas from gas fields, for instance located in Siberia, could be mainly associated with high diffuse emission of methane. The comparison of environmental impact assessment of coal and natural gas utilization for heating purposes is presented in the paper. The additional factor taken into account is localisation of boilers. In the analysis the coal is sombusted in combined heat and power plants equipped with flue gas treatment units is that released emissions are relatively remote from an urban area. In contrast, the natural gas is burned in small domestic installations with no additional FGT systems. The results of the analysis are given in 6 major impact categories. Moreover, the results of the life cycle analysis were brought into comprehensive thermo-ecological cost index, which is a cumulated exergy consumption of non-renewable resources. The results presented in the paper refer to the contemporary problem of the choice of energy sources in the context of its overall environmental efficiency.","Coal; Energy; Environmental impact; Exergy; Life cycle analysis; Natural gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991585507

Given the complex and often degraded state of urban soils, there is great interest in soil biological processes that support plant growth but may also produce greenhouse gases in these new forests. We measured soil to atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) in order to determine how the presence/absence of shrubs and compost in urban afforestation site preparation affects the emission of this potent greenhouse gas. To complement the measurement of N2O flux, microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), potential net N mineralization and nitrification, microbial respiration, and soil inorganic N were measured in experimentally afforested plots in New York City, USA. Results suggest that afforestation with shrubs and trees stimulates smaller fluxes of N2O from soils than afforestation without shrubs and trees. The range of N2O flux observed from recently afforested plots was -0.031-0.641 ng N cm-2 h-1. There were no significant differences in N2O fluxes and microbial biomass C between sites with shrubs and/or one-time application of compost. The results suggest that afforestation efforts to create natural vegetation structure (i.e. canopy trees with understory plants) and foster a functional microbial community through additions of organic matter may not increase emissions of N2O to the atmosphere. Rather, this method of afforestation site preparation may tighten C and N cycles and leave N2O emissions in these urban ecosystems unchanged. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.","Carbon cycling; Compost amendment; Greenhouse gas; Parks; Urban forest; Urban soils","afforestation; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biogeochemical cycle; biomass; carbon cycle; compost; greenhouse gas; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; park management; project management; soil emission; soil microorganism; urban area; vegetation structure; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957047752

Although most countries and manufacturers agreed to environmental regulations to reduce the pollutant emissions, particularly in urban areas with high traffic density, the impact of road traffic emissions on the environment and human health has been growing in importance steadily. Due to stricter emission standards and the binding use of emission-reducing systems (e.g. three-way catalyst) hydrocarbon emissions from passenger cars have been reduced significantly since the last two decades. Unlike to passenger cars the emissions standards of powered two-wheelers have not been adjusted since 2006 although their share of hydrocarbon emissions to the total amount of hydrocarbon emissions of road traffic is estimated to be disproportionately high. Due to the new regulation (EU) No. 168/2013 powered two-wheelers have to fulfill new emission standards from 2016 (Euro 4) and 2020 (Euro 5) onwards. Besides new limits for the tailpipe emissions the evaporative emissions are regulated separately for the first time, as they make up a high proportion to the total hydrocarbon emissions in this vehicle class. In this context, the calculation and forecast of road traffic emissions is an important tool to verify compliance of climate targets and to assess the reduction potential of emission-reducing systems. For that purpose the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) uses the emission- and calculation tool TREMOD (Transport Emission Model) which provides baseline data and calculated results for pollutants in almost every differentiation e.g. vehicle category, traffic situation and road type. Moreover, estimations of future emission trends, stock information and mileage distribution can be made. The main objective is to illustrate the impact of the upcoming emission standards Euro 4 and Euro 5 on the operational hydrocarbon emissions of powered two-wheelers based on statistical estimations. The significant aspect is to generate scenarios to show the reduction potential of hydrocarbon emissions of powered two-wheelers, differentiated into motorcycles and small motorcycles, in relation to the total share of hydrocarbon emissions in this vehicle class and to the total hydrocarbon emissions from road traffic. As a part of our research, we can make initial statements about the possible effect of the new emission standards of regulation (EU) No. 168/2013 by means of modeling with TREMOD. © 2016 The Authors.","emission modeling; evaporative emissions; hydrocarbon emissions; powered two-wheelers",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991363499

In the German dairy industry, separate conversion with gas fired steam boiler, and cooling with ammonia chillers are the-state-of-the-art technologies. It is attractive due to its robustness and low investment costs. But given the ongoing energy transition to renewable energy, opportunities to reduce emissions will become increasingly important. There are other energy supply options, such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and Heat Pumps (HP), that if implemented need to compete against the conventional energy supply systems. One option is CHP to provide cogenerated electricity and heat while cooling remains supplied by ammonia chillers. In countries with high electricity Grid Emissions Factors (GEF) such as Germany and the USA, the use of decentralised CHP results in savings of primary energy and emissions. However, this option is less attractive for countries with low GEF such as France and Norway, and for places like Germany where the energy transition lowering its GEF by 50 % in 2030. In these cases, HP solutions provide the lowest emissions and highest primary energy efficiency.

The boiler was designed to generate up to 250,000 lb/hr of steam while firing biomass derived fuels on a traveling grate. In addition to biomass, the boiler can also fire reprocessed fuel oil. The unit is operated as the mill's swing boiler and fires a mixture of HOG fuel, OCC rejects, urban wood debris, and separated char on the grate along with reprocessed fuel oil (when required) through auxiliary burners to respond to pressure swings in the mill's main steam header. The unit has been successful in consistently achieving the state mandated nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions limits. Prior to the implementation of the Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boiler Maximum Allowable Control Technology (Boiler MACT) ruling, the unit did not have a carbon monoxide (CO) emissions limit. Operating data showed that typical CO emissions during normal boiler operation were more than 40% higher than required by the Boiler MACT mandated limit. PTPC's goal was to meet the Boiler MACT compliance requirements for CO emissions without significantly increasing the NOxemissions above historical levels. The mill first contracted Jansen Combustion and Boiler Technologies, Inc. (Jansen) to evaluate boiler operation and to develop design concepts to meet these emissions targets. The project was initiated by a thorough engineering evaluation, including a site visit where boiler operating data was collected to establish a baseline of boiler operation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling (conducted in-house by Jansen personnel) was utilized to identify pathways to improve CO burnout without significantly increasing NOxemissions. The modeling showed that the root cause of poor CO emissions was inadequate overfire air (OFA) penetration and mixing coupled with non-uniform fuel delivery profiles caused primarily by mechanical fuel distributors that were installed at a high elevation over the grate. Modeling of the furnace with larger and fewer OFA nozzles placed on the side walls in an interlaced pattern, and the installation of modern pneumatic fuel distributors at a lower elevation on the boiler front wall was shown to significantly improve CO burnout and allow operation at lower excess air levels to keep NOxemissions under control. In October 2015, the unit was upgraded with the new combustion system. Subsequent testing has shown that CO levels have been lowered by more than 60% and are now well below the Boiler MACT limit. Even with the significant lowering of CO levels, NOxemissions remain not only well below the permit limit, but also close to historical operating levels.

Researchers using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Data Base have disaggregated the electricity sector into generating technologies independently using largely disparate, incomparable methodologies.

The levelized input costs for each technology are estimated to be as close as possible to the original data, but consistent with the original GTAP 9 Data Base.

Roll2Rail is a research project which aims to develop key technologies that will overcome hurdles to innovation in rolling stock development and forms part of a longer term strategy towards revolutionising the rolling stock of today. The results will contribute to the increase of operational reliability and to the reduction of the life cycle costs. This project started in May 2015 and it is supported by the Horizon2020 programme of the European Commission (www.roll2rail.eu). Roll2Rail is one of the so called ""lighthouse projects"" of the Shift2Rail Joint Undertaking and will contribute to Innovation Programme 1. At the end of the project the outcomes will be incorporated into real vehicles or relevant environments within the Technical Demonstrators of Shift2Rail. In particular, Roll2Rail focuses on technological innovations in different subsystems of the vehicles which, individually, each and all together, contribute to achieve the desired impact at vehicle and whole railway system level on capacity, reliability, efficiency, comfort and life cycle costs. The project expects innovations in 8 different areas such as traction and power electronics, train communications, car bodyshell, running gear technologies, brakes, train interiors, noise and vibration and energy performance.

Projections emphasizing range shifts at continental scale, however, can mask contrasting patterns at local or regional scale where management and policy decisions are made. Moreover, models usually show potential for areas to become climatically unsuitable, remain suitable, or become suitable for a particular species with climate change, but each of these outcomes raises markedly different ecological and management issues. Managing forest decline at sites where climatic stress is projected to increase is likely to be the most immediate challenge resulting from climate change. Here we assess habitat suitability with climate change for five dominant tree species of eastern North American forests, focusing on areas of greatest vulnerability (loss of suitability in the baseline range) in Quebec (Canada) rather than opportunities (increase in suitability). Results show that these species are at risk of maladaptation over a remarkably large proportion of their baseline range. Depending on species, 5-21% of currently climatically suitable habitats are projected to be at risk of becoming unsuitable. This suggests that species that have traditionally defined whole regional vegetation assemblages could become less adapted to these regions, with significant impact on ecosystems and forest economy. In spite of their well-recognised limitations and the uncertainty that remains, regionally-explicit risk assessment approaches remain one of the best options to convey that message and the need for climate policies and forest management adaptation strategies. © 2016 Périé and De Blois.","Boreal forest management; Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Forest decline; Habitat suitability; Quebec; Risk assessment; Species distribution model; Tree species maladaptation","climate change; economic aspect; forest management; habitat; latitude; model; Quebec; risk assessment; species distribution; stress; taiga; uncertainty; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981523354

The emission spectra were dominated by a strong NIR (∼795 nm) band. Blue (∼475 nm), green (∼525 and 545 nm), and red (∼650 nm) bands were also observed. The origin of these bands was investigated using a combination of steady-state and time-dependent spectrofluorometry, elemental analysis, and Rietveld analysis of synchrotron X-ray diffraction data. The strong NIR emission at ∼795 nm was assigned to two-photon upconversion from Yb3+-sensitized Tm3+, which was found to be present at trace levels (∼1 ppm) in both NaYb(MoO4)2 and NaYb(WO4)2. Due to the high efficiency of the energy-transfer from Yb3+ to Tm3+, the intensity of the NIR emission exhibited a linear dependence on the excitation power. Green and red bands were assigned to two-photon upconversion from Yb3+-sensitized Er3+, which was also found to be present at trace levels in both hosts (∼1 ppm). In the case of the blue emission, power-dependence and time-dependent spectrofluorometric studies favored cooperative luminescence of Yb3+-Yb3+ dimers, rather than three-photon upconversion from Yb3+-sensitized Tm3+. Local clustering of Yb3+ ions yielding Yb3+-Yb3+ dimers that interact cooperatively under NIR excitation was feasible considering (i) the intrinsic disorder of Na+ and Yb3+ over the same crystallographic site, and (ii) the shortest distance between two adjacent Yb3+ ions (∼3.81 Å).

For example, gold price, which was above $1800 per ounce, is currently about $1250 per ounce. Price slumps were even more severe in the base metals. Furthermore, the resource degradation and complex geologic conditions give rise to operation costs. As a result, many mining operations and development projects were eventually suspended, cancelled or ceased. Environmental compliance is also another challenge to the mining industry. The fuel consumed by diesel trucks emits greenhouse gases, which are one of contributors to the global warming. In Canada, the provinces of Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta introduced carbon taxes with the objective of reducing gas emissions in attempt to mitigate climate change. In this scope, only way to stay in business for a mining company is to invest more efficient and environmental friendly production practices such that operation costs are reduced. Given that maintenance costs and energy consumption are the largest contributors to operation costs, the minimization of carbon emissions and the maximization of equipment availability would be beneficial. This paper addresses to quantify the relationship between equipment reliability and energy consumption through a case study. It shows that a maintenance policy based on equipment reliability can significantly reduce energy consumption and its associated gas emissions. © 2017 Central Mining Institute in Katowice","Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emission; Mining fleet; Reliability and maintenance; Sustainable production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029162260

Our results show that SO2 emissions had undergone three phases: an increase in the period of 2000-2005, a rapid decline in 2005-2008 and a slow decline in 2008-2011. Emissions from the south dominated the total emissions in the province. Cleaner production generally contributed to the reduced emissions, but rather, at the industrial scale. Pollution abatement was occasional and industrial structure was negligible in some years. The three phases also coincided with the three periods of the manufacturing transfer: transferred to the south from outside the province during 2000-2005, to the central from the south within the province during 2005-2008 and to the north from the south or partly from the inner central within the province during 2008-2011. With the manufacturing transfer, SO2 emission magnitudes and distributions were also changed. In the south, -12.36 and -5.62 Mt of SO2 emissions were transferred out during 2005-2008 and 2008-2011, respectively. Forty-three-point-four percent and 56.4% of the SO2 emissions in the south were transferred to the central and north during 2005-2008, respectively. The north region received 77.7% and 22.1% of SO2 emissions from the south and the central region during 2008-2011, respectively.

Here, two heuristic models relating moisture, vertical velocity, and rainfall distributions are developed-one in which the distribution of vertical velocity is prescribed and another in which it is predicted. These models are used to explore the response to warming and moistening as well as changes in circulation, atmospheric energy budget, and stability. Some key assumptions of the models include that relative humidity is fixed within and between climate states and that stability is constant within each climate state. The first model shows that an increase in skewness of the vertical velocity distribution is crucial for capturing salient characteristics of the changing distribution of rain, including the muted rate of mean precipitation increase relative to extremes and the decrease in the total number or area of rain events. The second model suggests that this increase in the skewness of the vertical velocity arises from the asymmetric impact of latent heating on vertical motion. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Atm/Ocean Structure/ Phenomena; Circulation/ Dynamics; Climate change; Physical Meteorology and Climatology; Precipitation; Vertical motion","Atmospheric humidity; Budget control; Climate change; Climate models; Higher order statistics; Precipitation (chemical); Velocity; Velocity distribution; Atmospheric energy; Changing distributions; Mean precipitation; Precipitation distribution; Rainfall distribution; Vertical motions; Vertical velocity; Vertical velocity distribution; Rain; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climatology; meteorology; precipitation assessment; rainfall; vertical distribution; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987994881

While the majority of low emissions gas turbine engine combustor technology has been necessary for powergeneration applications, the push for ultra-low NOx combustion in aircraft jet engines has been ever present. Recent state-of-the-art combustor designs notably tackle historic emissions challenges by operating at fuel-lean conditions, which are characterized by an increase in the amount of air flow sent to the primary combustion zone. While beneficial in reducing NOx emissions, the fuel-lean mechanisms that characterize these combustor designs rely heavily upon high-energy and highvelocity air flows to sufficiently mix and atomize fuel droplets, ultimately leading to flame stability concerns during low-power operation. When operating at high-altitude conditions, these issues are further exacerbated by the presence of low ambient air pressures and temperatures, which can lead to engine flame-out situations and hamper engine relight attempts. To aid academic and commercial research ventures into improving the high-altitude lean blow-out (LBO) and relight performance of modern aero turbine combustor technologies, the High-Altitude Relight Test Facility (HARTF) was designed and constructed at the University of Cincinnati Combustion &amp; Fire Research Laboratory (CFRL). This paper presents an overview of its design and an experimental evaluation of its abilities to facilitate optically-accessible combustion and spray testing for aero engine combustor hardware at simulated high-altitude conditions. Extensive testing of its vacuum and cryogenic air-chilling capabilities was performed with regard to end-user control - the creation and the maintenance of a realistic high-altitude simulation - providing a performance limit reference when utilizing the modularity of the facility to implement different aero turbine combustor hardware. Ignition testing was conducted at challenging high-altitude windmilling conditions with a linearly-arranged five fuel-air swirler array to replicate the implementation of a multi-cup gas turbine combustor sector and to evaluate suitable diagnostic tools for the facility. High-speed imaging, for example, was executed during the ignition process to observe flame kernel generation and propagation throughout the primary, or near-field, combustion zones. In the evaluation performed, the HARTF was found to successfully simulate the atmospheric environments of altitudes ranging from sea level to beyond 10,700 m for the employed combustor sector. Diagnostic methods found compatible with the facility include high-speed flame imaging, combustion emission analysis, laser light sheet spray visualization, phase Doppler particle analysis (PDPA), and high-speed particle image velocimetry (HSPIV). Herein discussed are correlations drawn - linking altitude simulation capability to the size of the implemented combustor hardware - and challenges found - vacuum sealing, low pressure fuel injection, fuel vapor autoignition, and frost formation.

It has been found that presence of aluminium nitride or oxide in the mixture of initial materials significantly changed the course of α-sialon formation, chemical composition of that solid solution and the resultant photoluminescence properties. It has been established that a small amount of η-Al2O3 with a suitable carbon addition was profitable for liquid formation and enhanced crystallization of Ca, Eu-α-sialon. The excessive oxide-rich liquid at reaction temperature led to sintering of phosphor particles and decreased emission intensity while lack of sufficient amount of liquid (nitrogen-rich starting composition) resulted in AlN presence and considerably reduced emission intensity of this phosphor. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Phosphors; Photoluminescence; Sialon; WLED","Alumina; Aluminum nitride; Aluminum oxide; Ceramic materials; III-V semiconductors; Liquids; Mixtures; Phosphors; Photoluminescence; Powders; Sintering; Solid state reactions; Chemical compositions; Emission intensity; Phosphor particles; Photoluminescence properties; Reaction temperature; Sialon; Temperature range; WLED; Nitrogen compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968732945

These were then exposed to 3.5 wt.% NaCI solution for 30 days, bubbled with 10MPa CO2. Tests were conducted at two different temperatures, 40°C and 80°C. Post-test microstructural characterization revealed that the coatings protected the steel substrate from CO2 corrosion when intact. The bare steel in the exposed region formed a siderite scale, while no such scale was seen in the case of undamaged CRA-coated steel. The substrate close to the coating showed accelerated corrosion due to galvanic effects. It can be concluded that thermally sprayed CRA coatings are a candidate to provide cost-effective corrosion mitigation in wet supercritical CO2. However, care must be taken to ensure that the thermally sprayed CRA layer does not have any through porosity or damage; else, such coatings may accelerate corrosion of the underlying steel due to galvanic interactions.",,"Alloy steel; Carbon dioxide; Carbon steel; Coatings; Corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Cost effectiveness; HVOF thermal spraying; Metal implants; Sodium compounds; Solutions; Sprayed coatings; Titanium alloys; 316 L stainless steel; Accelerated corrosion; Corrosion mitigations; Galvanic effect; Galvanic interaction; Micro-structural characterization; Steel substrate; Supercritical CO2; Stainless steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034420695

In case of such old samples, the natural surrounding levels of 14C from gases in the atmosphere, which may well be the source of contamination among others, are 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the samples themselves. Hence, serious efforts are taken during the preparation steps to have the samples pristine until measurements are performed. As samples often have to be temporarily stored until AMS measurements can be performed, storage conditions also become extremely crucial. Here we describe an assessment of this process of contamination in background AMS samples. Samples, both as pressed graphite (on AMS targets) and graphite powder, were stored in various storage conditions (CO2-spiked air) to investigate the extent of contamination. The experiments clearly show that the pressed targets are more vulnerable to contamination than the unpressed graphite. Experiments conducted with enriched CO2-spiked laboratory air also reveal that the contaminating carbon is not only limited to the target surface but also penetrates into the matrix. A combination of measurements on understanding the chemical nature of the graphitization product, combined with long-available knowledge on “adventitious carbon” from the surface science community, brought us to the conclusion that contamination is to a certain extent inevitable. However, it can be minimized, and should be dealt with by sputter-cleaning the samples individually before the actual measurement. © 2016 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.","Accelerator mass spectrometry; Adventitious carbon; Contamination; Radiocarbon","accelerator mass spectrometry; atmospheric pollution; carbon; experimental study; graphitization; radiocarbon dating; sampling bias; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017173894

However, there is still a strong requirement for assessing the prospectivity of emerging shale plays, both in the United States and internationally. This paper is an attempt to generalize the results from three major US shale plays: Bakken, Eagle Ford and Niobrara, and to use these to assess the prospectivity of emerging shale plays elsewhere. Porosity, permeability, total organic carbon (TOC) content, thickness, brittleness, composition and maturity of shales are all important in the generation and retention of hydrocarbons. Factors such as depositional environment, uplift and burial, proximity to porous media, presence of natural factures, and reservoir pressure distribution over geologic time all also affect the ability of shales to retain hydrocarbons and be economically productive reservoirs. As an example, in the Eagle Ford Shale, regional overpressure has been generated through disequilibrium compaction as a result of rapid burial from the Late Cretaceous to the Palaeogene. Post-burial uplift is least in the Central Eagle Ford and the generated over pressure is, therefore, best preserved there. Overpressured shale reservoirs usually have high free gas contents. This is critical for high fluid flow rates from shales. Across the Karnes Trough in the northeast of the play, there is a good seal to the Eagle Ford Formation and, hence, good production, despite the fact that the production from the overlying Austin Chalk reservoir is poor in this area. Thus, the potential of a particular shale reservoir to produce hydrocarbons could be generalized into a ""retention"" factor. The geologic features that control the retention and production of hydrocarbons in these three shale plays are compared and analyzed. An attempt is made to correlate these factors and their contributions over geologic time scales in order to estimate hydrocarbon in-place in each. The results obtained from the study of these three major shale plays are generalized to provide insights into the relationships between geologic features, retention and production trends for shale plays. 'Retention' factor charts are prepared to provide a quick assessment of the prospectivity of emerging shale resources plays.

While a number of studies have outlined various options for evaluating the performance of the reservoir, many are not applicable to depleted oilfields that are commonly encumbered with limited data availability. As interest in CO2-EOR grows beyond giving new life to old fields, into a means of reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, metrics that enable the analyst to assess the storage capacity of the reservoir in addition to oil recovery efficiency have also become increasingly desirable. This paper will present a streamlined set of metrics that meet these objectives, along with their implementation in a dashboard-style presentation. These metrics provide complementary and non-redundant information, and crucially, are still applicable where a paucity of pressure data exists. The analyst is equipped with four groups of critical information. These are (A) flow rate and cumulative production data; (B) EOR performance trends (incremental oil recovery efficiency, CO2 storage efficiency, and net CO2 utilization factor); (C) operational performance trends (voidage replacement ratio and producing CO2-oil ratio); and (D) storage performance trends (incremental oil recovery factor vs. CO2 storage and CO2 storage capacity vs. voidage). To facilitate comparison, all metrics are normalized to percentage of original hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) injected. The utility of the selected set of metrics is demonstrated with data obtained from CO2-EOR activities in depleted oilfields of the Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP) region. First, a nine-panel dashboard is populated using the metrics discussed for the D-33 reservoir, and will be shown to be useful in: quantifying CO2 storage capacity, highlighting reservoir performance parameters (CO2 breakthrough, oil recovery, voidage-related pressure changes during EOR etc.) and identifying CO2-flood maturity. Second, a four-panel dashboard is displayed as a comparative tool across all reservoirs in the region in order to highlight best and worst performing reservoirs and establish representative ranges for reservoir performance. Both dashboards will be useful when comparing performance against averages published in literature. This work's novelty is attributed to presenting an ideal set of performance metrics by streamlining the numerous options available. A unique dashboard-style presentation is suggested as a means of rapidly assessing oil recovery and CO2-storage performance, and collectively yielding useful insights.

IAQ is affected by many factors, such as firewood moisture, stove type, ventilation, etc. A monitoring system has been developed to find the general IAQ with Improved Cooking Stove (ICS) and Traditional Cooking Stove (TCS). Decay curve technique is utilized to calculate the Carbon Monoxide (CO) decay time. A preliminary health survey is also carried out to evaluate the dweller's health complaints. The study is carried out in two adjoining remote villages of Palpa District in Western Nepal. The mean CO and PM2.5 concentration for ICS and TCS are 27.11 ppm and 825.4 μg/m3 (27.11 ± 14.24 ppm and 825.4 ± 730.9 μg/m3) with significant correlation (p &lt; 0.0001) and 36.03 ppm and 1336 μg/m3 (36.03 ± 19.06 and 1336 ± 952.8) with significant correlation (p &lt; 0.0481), respectively. From the overall sample, the mean CO and PM2.5 concentration is reduced by 29.9% and 39%, respectively. The ventilation analysis result shows more than an 80 percentage deficit in ventilation as per the minimal rate of ventilation as prescribed by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Moreover, the placement of chimney at a short vertical height of 1.2 m adjoining to back window is the major cause of backflow.

The current form of the ozone air quality standard in the United States pertains to an extreme value (the design value) of the ozone distribution. Using atmospheric chemical transport modeling, we examine how well attainment metrics correlate with average exposure levels. We use forward sensitivity analysis to contrast the responses of two types of ozone metrics to widespread emission reductions. One such metric is based on extreme values of the ozone distribution used for attainment designation, while the other is the seasonal average ozone concentration indicative of long-term exposure levels. We find that in locations that have high day-to-day variability in ozone concentrations, design values are more sensitive to emission reductions and are least indicative of changing exposure levels with emission reductions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Attainment; Design value; Exposure; Ozone distribution; Spread",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060471201

Deficit or excess water irrigation quantities could create either crop health related problems or water over-consumption situation which lead to stored water reduction and toxic material depletion to deeper ground layers, respectively. In this context, and under the current conditions, where Cyprus is facing effects of climate changes, purpose of this study is basically to estimate the needed crop water requirements of the past (1995-2004) and the corresponding ones of the present (2005-2015) in order to test if there were any significant changes regarding the crop water requirements of the most water intensive trees in Cyprus. Mediterranean region has been identified as the region that will suffer the most from climate change. Thus the paper refers to effects of climate changes on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) using remotely sensed data from Landsat TM/ ETM+ / OLI employing a sound methodology used worldwide, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). Though the general feeling is that of changes on climate will consequently affect ETc, the results have indicated that there is no significant effect of climate change on crop evapotranspiration, despite the fact that some climatic factors have changed. Applying Student's T-test, the mean values for the most water intensive trees in Cyprus of the 1994-2004 decade have shown no statistical difference from the mean values of 2005-2015 decade's for all the cases, concluding that the climate change taking place the last decades in Cyprus have either not affected the crop evapotranspiration or the crops have manage to adapt into the new environmental conditions through time. © 2016 SPIE.","Algorithms; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation management; SEBAL","Algorithms; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Irrigation; Remote sensing; Toxic materials; Crop evapotranspiration; Environmental conditions; Health-related problems; Irrigation management; Remote sensing applications; SEBAL; Statistical differences; Surface energy balance algorithm for lands; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989807171

The benefits in applying TiO2 coatings - containing in particular the anatase phase - rely, first of all, on the UV-activated photocatalytic degradation of pollutants mediated by it, which can mitigate pollution arising from industrial sources, heating and transportation. Moreover, changes in wettability upon UV irradiation lead to a superhydrophilic state which, coupled with photocatalysis, results in the so called self-cleaning effect, allowing materials to retain a cleaner and more reflective surface over time. Reducing the impact of aging on the optical-radiative performance of built environment surfaces has a strong influence on the thermal comfort and energy consumption of buildings. Here we present a novel effect observed on long-term durability investigations of commercial siloxane paints containing anatase nanoparticles: an increase in reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range upon material aging. This could open the door for HNO3 treatment of TiO2 as a method to boost the self-cleaning efficiency and reflectance of surfaces for building, construction and solar technologies.","Near infrared; Reflectance; Self-cleaning; Solar technologies; Titanium dioxide","Aging of materials; Air cleaners; Air quality; Cleaning; Climate change; Coatings; Energy utilization; Infrared devices; Irradiation; Optical properties; Oxides; Photocatalysis; Reflection; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Near Infrared; Near-infrared wavelength; Photo catalytic degradation; Self cleaning; Self-cleaning effects; Solar technology; Titanium dioxides (TiO2); Titanium dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988883143

Thailand has mechanism for passing through partial renewable energy price that exceeds the average electricity wholesale price by Fuel adjustment charge (Ft). Each renewable energy unit has been subsidied to all end user by Ft. Moreover Ft has useful for policy making to illustrate, public is becoming more concerned about that electricity price will be higher than it should be due to increasing share of renewable electricity. Public support for renewable energy continues to expand rapidly from the 2006 until present. A wide variety of policies are designed explicitly to promote renewable energy, while other policies focus on power sector restructuring or environmental issues more broadly and have more indirectly affected renewable energy. Experience with renewable energy policy around the world is still emerging, and more understanding is needed of the impacts of various policies. Thus, many policies could still be considered experimental in nature. The institutions tasked with developing support schemes are concerned about many issues, from the cost of state support to ensuring the safe operation of the national electricity grid. At the same time, the government is worried about the sharp electricity price increases for end-users and has recently introduced price control measures. In view of this trend, it could be argued that supporting renewable energy, which is perceived to be more expensive than producing electricity from fossil fuels, would lead to higher electricity prices. These can be seen through higher renewable prices from Adder and Feed in Tariff policies. Such concerns among Thailand policymakers are understandable, particularly at a time when many other countries have reduced their support for renewables in the context of the economic slowdown and the resulting budget constraints. However, the use of renewables in Thailand tries to clear environmental, economic and energy security benefits. Any further delays in adopting the support measures announced will ultimately raise the costs of meeting the renewable energy target. There will also be indirect costs resulting from the ""missed opportunities"" to reap the benefits of renewables based generation. This paper provides an overview of cost of pricing, legal and regulatory, market performance, renewable energy promotion policy, public investment and market facilitation activities, emission reduction policies, power sector restructuring policy, distributed generation policies and rural electrification Policies. Then the previous and existing policies have been analyzed. Policy analysis bases on rational expectations equilibrium model describing the application of vector auto regression (VAR) model to economics. The study examines real gross domestic product, weight of renewable electricity share and with the structural vector autoregressive model. The result of the analysis has shown that the increasing share of renewable electricity affected the economics growth positively. The policy implication is that energy conservative policies on electricity might not have an economic cost in Thailand because the high initial capital costs for renewable investment. The conclusion is that complimentary policies such as project financing or providing access to credit to purchase or invest in renewable energy will be the enable tools that should be implementing and Microcredit lending for household-scale renewable energy system should be the supportive program for renewable energy project. © 2016 CIGRE.

CsrA also binds to the regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) CsrB and CsrC, which antagonize its activity. The BarA-UvrY two-component signal transduction system (TCS) directly activates csrB and csrC (csrB/C) transcription, while CsrA does so indirectly. We show that cAMP-CRP inhibits csrB/C transcription without negatively regulating phosphorylated UvrY (P-UvrY) or CsrA levels. A crp deletion caused an elevation in CsrB/C levels in the stationary phase of growth and increased the expression of csrB-lacZ and csrClacZ transcriptional fusions, although modest stimulation of CsrB/C turnover by the crp deletion partially masked the former effects. DNase I footprinting and other studies demonstrated that cAMP-CRP bound specifically to three sites located upstream from the csrC promoter, two of which overlapped the P-UvrY binding site. These two proteins competed for binding at the overlapping sites. In vitro transcription-translation experiments confirmed direct repression of csrC-lacZ expression by cAMP-CRP. In contrast, cAMP-CRP effects on csrB transcription may be mediated indirectly, as it bound nonspecifically to csrB DNA. In the reciprocal direction, CsrA bound to crp mRNA with high affinity and specificity and yet exhibited only modest, conditional effects on expression.

Often the coal seams are naturally fractured due to their mechanical fragility to different deformations caused by geodynamic movements or mechanical stress. This allows to exploit them without damaging the environment, in contrast to the shale gas, which requires to stimulate the production by hydraulic fracturing. The coal seam represents highly heterogeneous multi-scale fractured media, which often proves a similarity to different scales. The big fractures (face cleats) are alternated by the small fractures (butt cleats) and a network of microfissures, which are in contact with the microporous coal matrix. The matrix porosity is usually high, while the connection between blocks of coal is assured only by network of fractures. Methane is adsorbed onto the internal surfaces of coal micro-pores. At initial state the coal seams are filled with water. The water occupies all fractures and fissures and also enters into the micro-pores by spontaneous capillary imbibition, which leads to gas trapping. The coal is usually classified as non-wetting rock, but experiments show that wettability of coal is related to the coal moisture content. The coal is also wetted in the presence of water and some gases (CO2, CH4, nitrogen). The first stage of production is dewatering. The progressive reduction of pressure during this stage leads to desorption of methane. The desorbed gas arrives into the micro-fissures. Then, due to the good connectivity of fracture network, it can be produced. The problem is that desorbed gas cannot flow out from micro-fissures, being trapped by the water, because the wetting phase prefers the small pores. The capillary trapping does not allow to reduce the pressure in blocks, therefore it stops the gas desorption. The capillary trapping can be reduced by solvent injection (CO2). Having more strong chemical affinity with the coal surface, CO2 also helps to desorb the methane. To describe the mentioned phenomena we use the numerical model of two-phase flow with binary adsorption and capillary trapping on the scale of micro-pores. The modeling on the scale of one block was performed with the two-phase capillary network simulator, developed by authors. The objective of this study is to determine the qualitative mechanisms of the capillary trapping reduction and the desorbed gas liberation.",,"Carbon dioxide; Coal; Computer system recovery; Desorption; Flow of water; Fracture; Gases; Hydraulic fracturing; Methane; Nitrogen; Oil well flooding; Shale; Stresses; Two phase flow; Wetting; Binary adsorption; Capillary imbibition; Capillary network; Chemical affinities; Matrix permeability; Mechanical fragility; Mechanical stress; Solvent injection; Coal deposits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994495760

Relative stiffness value of all the DLC films with its particulate regions were determined and compared with respect to the relative stiffness of Si. Raman spectroscopic intensity mapping and AFAM studies revealed that carbon co-ordination and local elasticity distribution across the film and particulate of DLC films are observed to depend upon sp2 bonded carbons possessing different aromatic orders and sp3 content. The sp3 bonding content present in DLC films synthesized at different laser pulse energies was obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectra. DLC-300 was found to be the stiffest film (∼4.5 times of Si) with highest sp3 content (53%). © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Acoustic spectroscopy; Carbon films; Deposition; Elasticity; Emission spectroscopy; Laser ablation; Laser pulses; Mapping; Nanotechnology; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoelectrons; Photons; Pulsed laser deposition; Pulsed lasers; Raman spectroscopy; Stiffness; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Atomic force acoustic microscopy; Elasticity distributions; Laser-pulse energy; Nano-scale surfaces; Pulsed-laser deposition technique; Raman spectroscopic; X ray photoelectron spectra; X-ray photoelectrons; Diamond like carbon films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955480362

The study was assigned by the MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION OF PRO-DUCTION, ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY / Department of Environment / General Directorate of Environmental Policy, Department of Climate Change and Air Quality (former name: Dept of Air and Noise Control) - Division of Noise, Vibration and Radiation to the joint venture of TREDIT SA-I.K. PANAGOPOULOS, and the contract was signed on 03.31.2014. Noise Mapping is used to ""classify"" the city area into zones according to different Noise levels. It records Noise as is actually present in a location and compares it to the noise levels, as stipulated by the EU standards. In this context a study was conducted on the roads of Thessaloniki city, utilizing both Sound Level Meter measurements (SLM) and Cadna(A) software simulation (for Road Traffic Noise, Industrial/Port noise). Noise maps were constructed and the Population exposed per noise zone maps was calculated. This data was tabulated into different noise zones of the noise indices Lden & Lnight of the study area, in noise zones higher than 55, 65 and 75 dB(A) respectively, at a height of 4m. from the ground. Action plans were also prepared to help the local authorities deal with local-ized noise abatement. The noise mapping procedure for the Thessaloniki County area is presented along with a case study to evaluate several noise abating plans in specific areas.

The acidic fen Schlöppnerbrunnen emits denitrification derived N2O and is also capable of N2O consumption. Global warming is predicted to cause more extreme weather events in future years, including prolonged drought periods as well as heavy rainfall events, which may result in flooding. Thus, the effects of prolonged drought and flooding events on the abundance, community composition, and activity of fen denitrifiers were investigated in manipulation experiments. The water table in the fen was experimentally lowered for 8 weeks in 2008 and raised for 5.5 months in 2009 on three treatment plots, while three plots were left untreated and served as controls. In situ N2O fluxes were rather unaffected by the drought treatment and were marginally increased by the flooding treatment. Samples were taken before and after treatment in both years. The structural gene markers narG and nosZ were used to assess possible changes in the nitrate reducer and denitrifier community in response to water table manipulations. Detected copy numbers of narG and nosZ were essentially unaffected by the experimental drought and flooding. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) patterns of narG and nosZ were similar before and after experimental drought or experimental flooding, indicating a stable nitrate reducer and denitrifier community in the fen. However, certain TRFs of narG and nosZ transcripts responded to experimental drought or flooding. Nitrate-dependent Michaelis-Menten kinetics were assessed in anoxic microcosms with peat samples taken before and 6 months after the onset of experimental flooding. Maximal reaction velocities vmax were higher after than before flooding in samples from treament but not in those from control plots taken at the same time. The ratio of N2O to N2O + N2 was lower in soil from treatment plots after flooding than in soil from control plots, suggesting mitigation of N2O emissions by increased N2O-reduction rates after flooding. N2O was consumed to subatmospheric levels in all microcosms after flooding. The collective data indicate that water table manipulations had only minor effects on in situ N2O fluxes, denitrifier abundance, and denitrifier community composition of the acidic fen, while active subpopulations of denitrifiers changed in response to water table manipulations, suggesting functionally redundant subpopulations occupying distinct ecological niches in the fen. © 2016 Palmer, Köpp, Gebauer and Horn.","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Structural (functional) genes; Water table manipulation; Wetlands","nitrous oxide; RNA 16S; Article; biogeochemistry; community structure; controlled study; denitrification; flooding; gene; gene dosage; greenhouse gas; Michaelis Menten kinetics; microcosm; nitrate reducer; nonhuman; peatland; real time polymerase chain reaction; restriction fragment length polymorphism; RNA extraction; structural gene; terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism; water table",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980041330

The extent to which these measures could affect the air ticket price is examined by an emission fee scheme implemented in a selected flight network within the United States. Since the prevailing carbon price plays a critical role, three scenarios of unit carbon price are examined. The results indicate moderate increase in air fares after the emission fee implementation which in turn may lead to air travel demand decrease. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Aviation emissions; Carbon fee; Emissions trading scheme; Environmental policy","Carbon; Civil aviation; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Air transport; Aviation industry; Carbon price; Emissions Trading Scheme; Environmental policy; Market-based measures; Policy instruments; Ticket prices; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044458278

This will imply a shift of the energy demand from the oil sector to the electric energy utilities, and hence the development of an adequate recharge infrastructure to meet the electricity demand from electric vehicles. Moreover, the full integration of electric vehicles within future smart cities will call for the development of new Vehicle-to-Grid applications, enabling the grid operators and end-users to dynamically interact with the vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how driving patterns and data mining can be used for the design of a smart recharge infrastructure and for identifying Vehicle-to-Grid hot-spots over vast geographical areas. The analysis relies on a database of approximately 16,000 vehicles and 2.6 million of parking events, interfaced with an electric vehicle model and two recharge behavioural models. The results help to understand to which extent battery electric vehicles can replace conventional fuel cars under real-world constraints, quantifying their electric energy demand and their recursive parking locations, to design a customised recharge infrastructure and identify Vehicle-to-Grid hot-spots. This paper provides a description of the developed model, analysing its potential and limitations and underlining its possible future applications for smart cities, providing new insights towards the definition, assessment and development of future energy and transport policy. © 2016 The Authors.","alternative fuels recharge infrastructure;V2G; battery electric vehicle; data mining; GPS driving patterns; urban mobility",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991497779

Some of them are toxic, some are toxic when appearing in excess and some are essential for the environment and human health. They are ubiquitous constituents of various natural materials in the lithosphere, the hydrosphere and the biosphere. High-temperature processes in the primary non-ferrous metal industries are the major source of atmospheric arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), indium (In), antimony (Sb), and zinc (Zn), and an important source of lead (Pb) and selenium (Se). Combustion of coal in electric power plants and industrial, commercial, and residential burners is the major source of anthropogenic mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), and selenium and a significant source of arsenic, chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), antimony, and thallium (Tl). Combustion of oil for the same purpose is the most important source of vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni). Combustion of leaded gasoline is estimated to be the major source of lead. Atmospheric chromium and manganese derive primarily from the iron and steel industry. The largest discharges of these metals are estimated for soils followed by discharges to water. The degree of human alteration of metals biogeochemical cycles caused by their anthropogenic emissions affects human health impacts of these chemicals. The information on alteration degree on global and regional scale is discussed. Emissions of metals from various anthropogenic sources can be reduced using technological (e.g. Best Available Technology (BAT) solutions) and non-technological measures (e.g. Best Environment Practice (BEP) option).

Particularly from the ecophysiological and habitat frames, Fagus orientalis Lipsky is relatively less discovered species compared to European beech.The most suitable altitudinal ranges within Bartın watershed where multi-aged oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) stands (mapobs) exist, were aimed to be determined based on the LAI measurements. Investigating the trends of the temperature and precipitation were also purposed in order to account the climate dynamics in the region. Bartın watershed is located at the northwestern of Black Sea Region in Turkey. Three sample altitudinal transects covered with mapobs were divided into 50 m imaginary gradients from where three hemispherical photographs were taken. LAI was derived from these photographs using the image analysis technique. The increase in the annual average temperature and decrease in the summer precipitation together with the rising winter precipitation indicate summer droughts and silent climate change. More than 60% of all mapobs concentrated at the hillsides with moderate slope degrees (15°-30°) on the gradients between 400 and 800 m asl. where annual total precipitation and mean temperature were 1370 mm and 9.6°C respectively. The sample mapobs with mean LAI higher than 2.00 occur within a broad range of altitudes between 450 and 1150 m asl. The mean LAI was its minimum levels below 400 m asl. whereas it reached up to 2.71 at the 700-750 m asl. where could be defined as optimum growth gradient for mapobs of this watershed landscape. South facing hillsides were relatively less favored aspects for all mapobs. The significant vegetation parameter; LAI can readily be used as a precise indicator of forest growth and productivity. Possible consequences of climate change on the forest ecosystems should be evaluated at the landscape scale which allow comprehensive forest landscape planning. © 2016, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Climate change; Fagus orientalis lipsky; Hemispherical photography; Landscape ecology; Leaf area index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995680606

Bhd, Malaysia","The high prevalence of thin sand laminations in the Malay Basin is generally established and has the potential to unlock large resource volumes, not previously considered significant. Laminated sand intervals can sometimes have challenging fluid interpretation issues because of the masking of hydrocarbon response on resistivity logs. It is not uncommon to miss-out entirely on potentially producible hydrocarbon zones because of a failure to properly evaluate these laminated sands. Fluid sampling may provide information on hydrocarbon types but there still remains the difficulty of establishing the interval limits of the hydrocarbon zones. The problem becomes more complicated when wells are drilled with oil based muds which has near similar response with the light formation oils in the Malay basin. In many cases, hydrocarbon zones are basically assumed to be in virgin state at the time of discovery, with single fluid contacts defining the reservoir fluid distribution. In fact, fluid sampling depths are often rationalised to one (1) or two (2) sample depths once the presence of hydrocarbon has been established. This simplistic assumption changes with turbidite systems, where laminated sends tend to compartmentalise gross reservoir sections with little indications on conventional logs. In our case study, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 2D diffusion maps have been used to confront some of the fluid interpretation challenges. The NMR diffusion data acquired at selected station-stop depths were compared with results from the In-situ Fluid Analyzer (IFA) tool for defining distinct cluster patterns of different fluid types. The results of the fluid interpretation were not only informative on the type of formation fluids but provided a commonly overlooked observation of free water occurrence within gross hydrocarbon intervals. This presence of free water within hydrocarbon sand package raises the possibility of postac-cumulation flushing or prior migration. This has significant bearings on both the resource and reserves assessments of the hydrocarbon sands. © 2016, Offshore Technology Conference",,"Diffusion in liquids; Electric logging; Hydrocarbons; Laminating; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Oil well drilling; Oil well logging; Sand; Cluster patterns; Conventional logs; Formation fluids; Hydrocarbon response; Interval limits; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Resistivity logs; Turbidite systems; Nuclear magnetic resonance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051991744

Therefore, it is vital to understand the biology of plants that are already adapted to these extreme conditions. In this sense, extremophiles such as the halophytes offer valuable genetic information for understanding plant salinity tolerance and to improve the stress tolerance of crop plants. Turkey has ecological importance for its rich biodiversity with up to 3700 endemic plants. Salt Lake (Lake Tuz) in Central Anatolia, one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world, is surrounded by salty marshes, with one of the most diverse floras in Turkey, where arid and semiarid areas have increased due to low rainfall and high evaporation during the summer season. Consequently, the Salt Lake region has a large number of halophytic, xerophytic and xero-halophytic plants. One good example is Eutrema parvulum (Schrenk) Al-Shehbaz & Warwick, which originates from the Salt Lake region, can tolerate up to 600mM NaCl. In recent years, the full genome of E. parvulum was published and it has been accepted as a model halophyte due to its close relationship (sequence identity in range of 90%) with Arabidopsis thaliana (L. Heynh.). In this context, this review will focus on tolerance mechanisms involving hormone signalling, accumulation of compatible solutes, ion transporters, antioxidant defence systems, reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling mechanism of some lesser-known extremophiles growing in the Salt Lake region. In addition, current progress on studies conducted with E. parvulum will be evaluated to shed a light on future prospects for improved crop tolerance.","Eutrema parvulum; extremophiles; salinity; salt stress; Schrenkiella parvula","biodiversity; canola; climate change; Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; crop plant; dicotyledon; drought; endemic species; extremophile; gene expression; genome; global climate; halophyte; physiological response; salinity tolerance; tolerance; Anatolia; Turkey; Tuz Lake; Arabidopsis thaliana; Eutrema",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975743146

Many aircraft design changes have been proposed to meet the more demanding requirements. Switching from conventional pneumatic subsystem architectures to more-electric subsystem architectures is one of the proposed aircraft design changes to meet the requirements. However, changing subsystem supply from pneumatic to electric introduces a change in the load on the power supplying gas turbine spool. Consequently, the change in the load affects a gas turbine’s transient response. In the literature the focus has been on aircraft sizing and steady state performance with more electric subsystem architectures but not on the effects of the subsystem architecture changes on the gas turbine transient response. Therefore, this work aims to study the changes in transient performance due to the changes in subsystem architecture. The first step was to size a gas turbine for the conventional and bleedless subsystem architectures when one engine was inoperable. After the sizing process, the steady state models were converted into dynamic models by including only spool dynamics for each spool in the gas turbines. In parallel the customer bleed or power extraction demand from the gas turbines were calculated for the conventional and more electric subsystem architectures. Then, the transient response to these subsystem demands were simulated during climb. Transient performance evaluation focused on net thrust and stall margin consumption. Customer bleed extraction increased the compressor stall margin in line with literature and reduced net thrust significantly more than customer power extraction. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The year 2012 was chosen as base year since fuel quality had been improved from Euro II to Euro IV standard from that year. Speed of truck driven in study area was chosen as variable parameter for sensitivity analysis of its influence to the emissions of air pollutants because there are no further plans in upgrading or improvement of fuel quality during this period. Truck's Bangkok driving cycle was used as input data in the IVE model. Average speeds used in the model simulation were varied from existing condition (15 km/hr) to the maximum of 80 km/hr. It was found that an average speed of 40 km/hr was the optimal speed in reducing of air pollutants emitted from truck. At this speed, reduction of emission factors of air pollutants as compared with current average velocity of 15 km/hr were about 46%, 54%, 16%, 51%, 53% and 27% for CO, VOC, VOCevap., NOx, SOx and PM, respectively.

However, due to this increase of yield and tensile strength, fracture toughness decreases and notch sensitivity rises. Hence, the local weld geometry becomes more important, especially in case of ultra high-strength steels. This paper deals with the detection and assessment of common geometric weld defects, such as undercuts, and their effect on the fatigue strength of ultra high-strength steel joints. For this purpose, butt joint specimens are welded incorporating ultra high-strength steel as base material. All specimens are judged by visual testing and the detected weld defects undergo an additional surface topography measurement prior to fatigue testing. First, an image processing based Matlab ©-Routine is built up to evaluate the local geometrical properties of the weld toe including undercuts. Second, a numerical model of the actual weld geometry is generated. This is utilized to perform numerical analyses in order to compute the actual stress concentration factors as well as fatigue parameters in terms of notch stresses. The experimental work covers fatigue tests of undercut-imperfected and defect-free specimens in order to contribute to the effect of such defects on fatigue life. Finally, an enhanced fatigue assessment of welds with undercuts and high-quality joints is performed based on numerical investigations and validated by experimental results.","Fatigue; ultra high-strength steel; weld defects; weld topography; welding","Fatigue of materials; Fatigue testing; Fracture toughness; Hydrogen embrittlement; Image processing; Steel heat treatment; Surface defects; Surface topography; Tensile strength; Welding; Welds; Energy effectiveness; Fatigue strength; Notch sensitivity; Topography measurement; Ultra high strength steel; Visual testing; Weld defects; Yield and tensile strength; High strength steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992672493

This assessment is based on the simulation of different case studies investing both the current situation and likely future situations with a much higher level of renewable development, corresponding to the objectives of distributed generation development for 2020, set out by the French regional administrations in their Energy, Air and Climate Regional Schemes. The analysis of national load-shedding surveys and detailed datasets from three distribution control centers in France (operating distribution networks of Nîmes, Toulon and Dijon regions) establishes that currently, distributed generation do not have a significant impact on the balance of the low frequency demand disconnection (LFDD) scheme even if ""injecting"" MV feeders affected to the first three ""disconnection"" steps have been detected in Nîmes and Toulon's area. The future situation has been assessed with two theoretical scenarios of share of distributed generation between the ""disconnection"" steps: • A so-called favourable scenario, corresponding to a rather equal distribution of generation on the different steps of the load-shedding scheme. Even if the strict application of this scenario would imply a modification of the process of selection by the DSOs of MV feeders to constitute each load shedding step, this scenario corresponds more or less to an extrapolation of the current trend. A theoretical ""worst case"" scenario, which considers that distributed generation is mostly connected to the three first steps of load shedding plan (49 Hz, 48.5 Hz and 48 Hz) with the respective proportion of 70%, 20%, 5%, the 2 last steps (considered as ""prioritised"" regarding the security of supply) representing the last 5%. The projection to year 2020 of the two previous theoretical scenarios shows that imbalances of demand between ""disconnection"" steps can become problematic (this could lead to the disconnection of a large amount of generation together with load). Furthermore, the geographic distribution of distributed generation will be heterogeneous, leading to a risk of HV network constraint in case of load shedding activation. In order to manage these risks in a way compatible with the requirements of the draft of European network code for Emergency and Restoration, the impact of two possible evolutions of the existing load shedding scheme on future situation has been analysed: • A solution based on the inhibition of disconnection of ""injecting"" MV feeders: this scenario would require new functions/equipment in load shedding control command systems in order not to disconnect an MV feeder when the active power output of its connected generation is higher than the consumption of its connected consumers. • A solution based on a controlled distribution of distributed generation on the different steps of the load-shedding plan by DSOs: in this scenario which also implies an evolution of the existing process of selection, the MV feeders with generation are not affected to the first step of load shedding plan (which triggers at 49 Hz). The inhibition of disconnection of injecting MV feeders minimizes the generation lost while preserving a step size compatible with the requirements of the draft of European network code, without challenging its main principle: the automatic tripping of MV feeders. The implementation of such an evolution raises technical and economical questions as it needs an adaptation of power measurements and control command systems in HV/MV substations.

Calculation of carbon (C) stored and sequestered by urban trees is the actual and critical assessment of the real potential role of an urban park in reducing atmospheric CO2. This study provides a case study of the quantification of C storage and sequestration by two urban parks with two different landscape setting design in Subang Jaya and Damansara, a rapidly urbanized and populated city in West coast of Malaysia. The C storage or sequestration rate was estimated by biomass equations, using field inventory and analysis survey data. The calculation of biomass provides reasonably accurate estimation of the amount of carbon that was sequestered from trees over the years. The findings revealed that different landscape setting design contribute to marked differences in carbon stored. Curvilinear landscape setting design was found to sequester more carbon compared to informal landscape setting even though total green and built up areas for both sites are similar. These findings provide insights and better understanding of the role of urban park as carbon sink. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","Carbon sequestration rate; Concentric design; Curvilinear design; Landscape setting design; Urban parks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85005978380

Such compositional shifts can potentially alter ecosystem-level properties such as above-ground carbon storage, but our understanding of the factors linking compositional shifts to carbon storage is limited. We compared tree communities of contiguous and fragmented tropical rain forests in the Western Ghats (India) and assessed the ability of various plant functional traits associated with seed dispersal, establishment and survival processes to predict species' responses to fragmentation. Further, we assessed relationships between functional traits that predict tree community turnover and those that govern carbon storage to examine how fragmentation effects on species' composition can alter the ability of tree communities to store carbon. Seed size, as indexed by seed length, was the best predictor of species' responses, with larger-seeded species declining in fragments. Across species, seed length was positively correlated with maximum attainable height, which decreased by 10% on average at the community level in fragments. Such shifts towards smaller-seeded communities could decrease forest stature and reduce above-ground carbon stocks by 8%. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights a previously undescribed mechanism by which fragmentation-driven declines of large-seeded tree species can reduce above-ground carbon stocks by promoting shorter-statured forests. These results imply that strict protection alone might be insufficient and that a multipronged conservation strategy would be required to sustain carbon stocks in tropical forest fragments. Such interventions will need to combine restoration programmes for large-seeded tree species in fragments with broader-scale efforts to maintain hospitable and well-connected landscapes for their seed dispersers. © 2016 The Authors.

Up to 95% of the lifecycle cost can be already committed at the end of the design process. Case Study projects have demonstrated that savings available can range from 20% and even up to 50% improvement from a baseline design, however barriers often take precedence in the project setting to commence and then accomplish. The short time-bound period of design provides the greatest energy saving potential with the most attractive return on investment. A framework to manage and control the energy efficient design management processes is necessary. Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the Irish Government Agency responsible to lead the way for Ireland into our energy efficient future has been developing and proving the delivery in Energy Efficient Design (EED) through Special Working Groups and pilot projects. This work has been standardised with publication of IS399-Energy Efficient Design Management System Standard. In 2016 the EXEED Certified Program, a project asset certification scheme was launched. EXEED Certified will provide independent certification of assets, either new or reengineered, for optimum energy performance and energy management capability using energy efficient design management processes. The certification process can also be applied to the retro-commissioning processes. There are three distinctions of EXEED Certified which are aligned to the design process covering the full spectrum from a delivered energy efficient design to a state where energy performance is being continually improved within an energy management system. These distinctions are EXEED Designed, EXEED Verified and EXEED Managed.

The framework follows an integrated approach to long-term urban and energy planning. It uses several analytical tools and provides a step-by-step guideline to cities committed to develop and implement sustainable urban energy and emissions plan. The paper presents the SUEEP concept and results from the first two phases of its application in pilot cities in Southeast Asia. In the first phase, the SUEEP framework was developed and piloted in three cities—Da Nang, Vietnam; Surabaya, Indonesia; and Cebu, the Philippines. These pilots provided essential feedback on key SUEEP features including the importance of energy governance at the municipal level, institutional development needs, baseline diagnostics, and a preliminary list of priority energy efficiency projects. In the second phase, the in-depth SUEEP process was implemented in Da Nang, Vietnam. The paper presents results achieved in Da Nang, where the municipal government developed the green growth energy efficiency plan and the accompanying business plan for the public-private partnership in scaling-up energy efficiency across urban infrastructure. The key findings include: (a) SEA cities can become the global engines of green growth by choosing energy efficient solutions to their infrastructure needs; (b) Municipal governments need to reform institutions, develop energy efficiency governance and build institutional capacity; (c) Cities need to collaborate closely with the national government in the areas that are outside the city’s control; (d) Urban transport and building sectors present the largest opportunities for scaling up energy efficiency; (e) The Energy and Emissions Task Force or a similar institutional platform is essential for productive collaboration among municipal government, stakeholders, private investors, and financing institutions; (f) The green growth scenario in Da Nang for 2010-2030 period suggests that the city can achieve 13% reductions in energy consumption and 23% decline in GHG emissions compared to the “business as usual” baseline; and (g) Priority projects potentially bankable and attractive for private sector investments include: energy efficient LED street lighting, waste treatment, solar PV provision, landfill gas recovery, and a feeder route into the bus rapid transit system. © 2016 CIGRE.

After continuous laser irradiation for several minutes,the resulting film on the irradiated spot (2 mm in diameter) was found to be optically transparent,but to exhibit electrical conductivity. The Raman spectrum of the irradiated region contained clear G and 2D band peaks,a likely sign of thin layers of graphite structures,but it also contained a D band peak originating from defects.

The aim of this research is to provide a deeper understanding of the energy dissipation mechanisms exerted by tufts under various loading conditions and their inclusion in finite element models capable of predicting the response to delamination of tufted composite structures.

Less is known about the phyllosphere microbiota and its driving factors in built environments. To study the variability of the microbiome in relation to plant genotype and climate under different controlled conditions, we investigated 14 phylogenetically diverse plant species grown in the greenhouses of the Botanical Garden in Graz (Austria). All investigated plants showed specific bacterial abundances of up to 106 CFU cm-2 on their leaves. Bacterial diversity (H': 2.4-7.9) and number of putative OTUs (461-2013) were strongly plant species dependent. Statistical analysis showed a significantly higher correlation of community composition to plant genotype in comparison to the ambient climatic variables. In addition to the microbiome structure, we studied the antagonistic potential towards the foliar pathogen Botrytis cinerea as functional indicator. A high proportion of isolates (up to 58%) were able to inhibit pathogen growth by production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Data of structure and function were linked: frequently isolated VOCs producers (e.g. Bacillus and Stenotrophomonas) were highly present in phyllosphere communities, which were dominated by members of Firmicutes.

This article discusses the potential for such integrated systems in the stationary and portable power market in response to the critical need for a cleaner energy technology. Throughout the theme several issues relating to renewable energies, environment, and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. It is concluded that green energies like wind, solar, groundsource heat pumps, and biomass must be promoted, implemented, and demonstrated from the economic and/or environmental point view. Biogas from biomass appears to have potential as an alternative energy source, which is potentially rich in biomass resources. This is an overview of some salient points and perspectives of biogas technology. The current literature is reviewed regarding the ecological, social, cultural and economic impacts of biogas technology. This article gives an overview of present and future use of biomass as an industrial feedstock for production of fuels, chemicals and other materials. However, to be truly competitive in an open market situation, higher value products are required. Results suggest that biogas technology must be encouraged, promoted, invested, implemented, and demonstrated, but especially in remote rural areas. Study design: Anticipated patterns of future energy use and consequent environmental impacts (acid precipitation, ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect or global warming) are comprehensively discussed in this article. Place and Duration of Study: National Centre for Research, Energy Research Institute (ERI), between January 2013 and July 2014. Methodology/Approach: An approach is needed to integrate renewable energies in a way to meet high building performance. However, because renewable energy sources are stochastic and geographically diffuse, their ability to match demand is determined by adoption of one of the following two approaches: the utilisation of a capture area greater than that occupied by the community to be supplied, or the reduction of the community's energy demands to a level commensurate with the locally available renewable resources. Results/Findings: The adoption of green or sustainable approaches to the way in which society is run is seen as an important strategy in finding a solution to the energy problem. The key factors to reducing and controlling CO2, which is the major contributor to global warming, are the use of alternative approaches to energy generation and the exploration of how these alternatives are used today and may be used in the future as green energy sources. Originality/Value: This study highlights the energy problem and the possible saving that can be achieved through the use of renewable energy technologies. Also, this study clarifies the background of the study, highlights the potential energy saving that could be achieved through use of renewable energy technologies and describes the objectives, approach and scope of the study. The move towards a de-carbonised world, driven partly by climate science and partly by the business opportunities it offers, will need the promotion of environmentally friendly alternatives, if an acceptable stabilisation level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is to be achieved. This requires the harnessing and use of natural resources that produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases and provides comfortable coexistence of human, livestock, and plants. The increased availability of reliable and efficient energy services stimulates new development alternatives.

It further stated that third world countries such as Nigeria is likely to be at the fore of risk concerns, owing to their weak adaptive capacity and swindling political will to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases. Recent studies also demonstrated the practical perturbation in the geophysical equilibrium of the country - Nigeria over the last decade. As projected by a recent study, 9.7 million Nigerians are likely to be at risk of flood by 2050 (2). Already, over 200 villages have disappeared in the Northern region of the country due to drought and desertification (3). Crop production has witnessed an alarming decline since the 1960s which was the onset of abatement in rainfall and the birth of drought (4). Despite these impending doom and the global call for mitigation of emissions and strengthening of resilience, it seems to be an era of stiff deafening for the Nigerian government. The adaptive capacity has been a major concern since there is always an ontological rupture between policies on paper and its empirical applications. As a caveat however, this paper is based on the theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). In that context therefore, the paper aims to make a case of gas flaring as anthropogenic activity which is one of canonical contributor of greenhouse gases which causes global warming. Nigeria is the second largest flarer of gas after Russia and despite the obvious link between gas flaring and global warming; this activity has not received comparative attention in the country. Hence, this paper discusses how to adapt the communities to the risks associated with local climate change induced by gas flaring. Flooding is the precise parameter and the Niger delta region of Nigeria is the case study. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

Growth in U.S. sales of electric vehicles has been hindered by technical diffi culties and the high cost of the lithium-ion batteries used to power many electric vehicles (more than 50% of the vehicle cost). Groundbreaking has begun for a lithium-ion battery factory in Nevada that, at capacity, could manufacture enough batteries to power 500,000 electric vehicles of various types and provide economies of scale to reduce the cost of batteries. Currently, primary synthetic graphite derived from petroleum coke is used in the anode of most lithium-ion batteries. An alternate may be the use of natural fl ake graphite, which would result in estimated graphite cost reductions of more than US$400 per vehicle at 2013 prices. Most natural fl ake graphite is sourced from China, the world's leading graphite producer. Sourcing natural fl ake graphite from deposits in North America could reduce raw material transportation costs and, given China's growing internal demand for fl ake graphite for its industries and ongoing environmental, labor, and mining issues, may ensure a more reliable and environmentally conscious supply of graphite. North America has fl ake graphite resources, and Canada is currently a producer, but most new mining projects in the United States require more than 10 yr to reach production, and demand could exceed supplies of fl ake graphite. Natural fl ake graphite may serve only to supplement synthetic graphite, at least for the short-term outlook. © 2016 The Geological Society of America.

Mitigating these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is central to efforts aimed at curbing near-term climate change, but low-cost, practical technologies are needed to reduce fugitive CH4 from farms. Biofilters have mitigation potential, but current designs for odor are limited in their ability to capture CH4. Fungi have been shown to improve capture of hard-to-target gases in other biofilter applications and were investigated here for their ability to capture CH4. Using a lab-scale biofilter, several fungal species were shown to improve CH4 capture compared to a bacterial system and sterile control. A subsequent experiment with Pleurotus ostreatus found capture to increase with increasing levels of fungal biomass. Using a chromatographic isotherm, the ability of fungal materials to sorb CH4 was confirmed, and again greater sorption of CH4 was possible when fungal biomass was increased. These results demonstrate the ability of fungi to capture CH4 and warrant their investigation as a way to improve the CH4 mitigation capacity of livestock emission biofilters. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Biofilter; Chromatographic isotherm; Fungi; Methane; Pleurotus ostreatus; Sorption; Wood chips","Agriculture; Biofilters; Chromatography; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Isotherms; Methane; Sorption; Wood products; Bacterial systems; Fungal biomass; Fungal species; Isotherm studies; Livestock production; Pleurotus ostreatus; Target gas; Wood chip; Fungi; anthropogenic source; biofiltration; chromatography; climate change; design; emission; experimental study; fungus; greenhouse gas; isotherm; laboratory method; livestock farming; methane; mitigation; sorption; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Pleurotus ostreatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007383590

Taking a broader and consensual perspective, co-benefits are considered here to be emerging advantages of implementing measures to lower greenhouse gases. Starting with the analysis of policy documents referring to two European urban transportation strategies, the emergent co-benefits are problematized and discussed to better understand their moral aspect. Further ethical reflection is conducted after an analysis of some unintended consequences of the co-benefits rationale arising from the examples. The discussion focuses primarily on the challenges of an integrative moral justification for co-benefits and also for their role in the climate change mitigation effort. We also discuss the limitations of the current normative models that frame a co-benefits rationale, both from a moral viewpoint and in relation to the overall climate change mitigation strategy. In this article, we propose the concepts of well-being and freedom, as portrayed by the Capability Approach, as possible guiding notions for the moral and social evaluation of goodness of these emergent benefits as well as their rationale. Additionally, some preliminary conclusions are drawn regarding the potential of the presented concepts to support climate change mitigation action. Finally, we outline a scenario where the Capability Approach is the moral guideline for a co-benefits rationale and illustrates its potential in terms of enhancing climate change mitigation strategy.","Capabilities approach; Climate change; Co-benefits; Freedom; Well-being",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994544679

Many paleoflood reconstructions come from the arid dry climate of southwestern USA and from Europe, with few studies being conducted in temperate climates of North America. This study uses sediment cores from oxbow lakes to reconstruct past flood events in a temperate region. Cores extracted from two oxbow lakes along the Desert River in southwestern Quebec, Canada, were analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, loss on ignition, and grain size and were radiocarbon dated (14C). Using a combination of magnetic susceptibility variations, along with changes in grain size and organic material content, five floods were identified within the 220 cm core (1300 years) from the North oxbow lake, and six floods in the 118 cm core (600 years) from the South oxbow lake. This study provides evidence to support the use of oxbow lakes in temperate regions as a proxy of past floods, thus helping us understand hydroclimatic changes at regional scales. Data that span a longer period of time and in different environments are key to increase flood modelling accuracy to improve mitigation strategies under a changing climate. © 2016, National Research Council of Canada.

This study presents a dynamic model of a supercritical coal-fired power plant (SCPP) integrated with a dynamic model of MEA-based post-combustion CO2 capture plant (PCC). This study focuses on the impact of integrating PCC unit on the load following the mode of operation of the SCPP. The dynamic model of the PCC was validated against a pilot plant data and was scaled-up to capture the flue gas flow from 600-MWe SCPP. The SCPP model was validated with actual plant operational data for steady-state conditions at full load and at transient load ramp. The dynamic response of the integrated SCPP-PCC model due to changes in load demand is presented. The response of the following variables to changes in load level investigated includes the following scenarios: (i) the flue gas flow rates, (ii) the pulverized coal flow, (iii) the net efficiency of the SCPP, and (iv) and the CO2 capture level. The simulation shows that the CO2 capture level is very sensitive to the solvent-flue gas (L/G) ratio. In addition, steam reduction/stripper stop was analysed as a strategy for operating the SCPP integrated with PCC unit under the UK grid requirement as regards primary frequency response. The result shows that the stripper stop mechanism produces about 4.67 % MCR (~28 MWe) increase in the SCPP at full-load condition. This is however, not sufficient for the 10 % MCR required for the primary response (usually within 10-30 s). © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore and Tsinghua University Press 2016.","Dynamic modelling; Post-combustion CO2 capture; Supercritical","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Dynamic models; Flow of gases; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuel power plants; Frequency response; Pilot plants; Planning; Sustainable development; CO2 capture; Coal-fired power plant; Dynamic process modeling; Mode of operations; Modelling and analysis; Steady-state condition; Supercritical; Supercritical power plant; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044465143

Various clay pots part-filled with water, and other evaporative cooling devices, are used in less-resourced countries when home refrigeration is unavailable. This study examined the cooling efficacy of such devices. Methods: Thirteen devices used in Sudan, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mali, India, Pakistan and Haiti (10 clay pots, a goat skin, a vegetable gourd and a bucket filled with wet sand), and two identical commercially manufactured cooling wallets were compared. Devices were maintained according to local instructions. Internal and ambient temperature and ambient humidity were measured by electronic loggers every 5 min in Khartoum (88 h), and, for the two Malian pots, in Bamako (84 h). Cooling efficacy was assessed by average absolute temperature difference (internal vs. ambient), and % maximal possible evaporative cooling (allowing for humidity). Results: During the study period, mean ambient temperature and humidity were 31.0°C and 32.0% in Khartoum and 32.9°C and 39.8% in Bamako. All devices reduced the temperature (P < 0.001) with a mean (sd) reduction from 2.7 ± 0.5°C to 8.3 ± 1.0°C, depending on the device. When expressed as % maximal cooling, device efficacy ranged from 20.5% to 71.3%. On cluster analysis, the most efficacious devices were the goat skin, two clay pots (from Ethiopia and Sudan) and the suspended cooling wallet. Conclusions: Low-cost devices used in less-resourced countries reduce storage temperatures. With more efficacious devices, average temperatures at or close to standard room temperature (20–25°C) can be achieved, even in hot climates. All devices are more efficacious at lower humidity.

For NWP and Regional Climate modeling, upwind schemes of either third or fifth order have been recommended combined with an explicit numerical diffusion. We have implemented fully fourth order central difference horizontal schemes for the model's Euler equations with two types of discretization of the advection terms: the first is a natural extension of the COSMO fourth order scheme by introducing fourth order interpolation of the advecting velocity, and the second is a symmetric type discretization which is shown to conserve the rotational part of kinetic energy. We combine both advection schemes with fourth order discretization of the pressure gradient term. To make the schemes completely fourth order, we consider all metric terms resulting from coordinated transformations. Theoretical analysis of the new schemes compared to the model's existing third order upwind scheme exhibits: a slightly increased group velocity error due to a wider stencil, a similar dispersive error, a significant reduction of the amplitude error, a significantly minimized aliasing error due to symmetric advection-discretization, and a significant increase in effective Courant number which potentially allows longer time steps. Using 20-year climate simulations, we show that the new symmetric fourth order scheme is more stable than the extended COSMO fourth order scheme and third order upwind scheme, and that an explicit numerical diffusion can be avoided when using the symmetric scheme. We show that a 20% dispersive (phase) and diffusive (amplitude) errors limit result to the model's effective resolution of approximately 5?x for all 4th and 3rd order schemes. Considering the same error limit for simulated kinetic energy spectra show that the horizontal numerical diffusion is reducing the model's effective resolution to more than 10Δx and thus using the symmetric 4th order scheme without explicit horizontal diffusion increases the effective resolution by a factor of two to approximately 5Δx. We further show that both implicit diffusion in upwind schemes and explicit numerical diffusion necessary for the current model's stable runs have effects of equal magnitude on the model's predicted climatologies. Climatologies show that fourth order schemes enhance vertical turbulence mixing in the planetary boundary layer which reduces parameterized convection. This consequently results to approximately 20% peak reduction of summer precipitation and an increase of approximately 0.5 degrees Kelvin in summer 2m air temperature. © 2016 The authors 2016.","Climate modeling; Conservative scheme; COSMO; Effective resolution; Euler equations; Fourth order","climate modeling; climatology; computer simulation; equation; Eulerian analysis; mixing; pressure gradient; regional climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995466454

Therefore, also small hydro-power plants can be constructed at flow systems with small discharges. The city of Lübeck is located near the Baltic Sea in the Northern part of Germany. The river Trave surrounds the historic city center. Several hundred years ago another river (Wakenitz) was directly connected with the Trave flow system. But with beginning of the 12th century a continuous anthropogenic adaption of both river systems lead to the present situation, which also include a national waterway. Trave andWakenitz are arranged according to a water level difference of approximately 3.5 m. Via a culvert connection system several hundreds of liters per second are continuously available. Hence, a hydro-power plant was setup which produces small amounts of annual energy. Due to the European Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD) both river systems had to be connected with a fish-friendly open channel. But in consequence, less discharge could be guaranteed for the existing hydro-power plant. Hence, a new small hydro-power plant was investigated - in form of the Archimedes screw. Nevertheless, a large area of conflict has been identified: who owns the water? A local energy provider operates the existing hydro-power plant and the water passes a connected lake system, thus the water quality might be affected. Hence, the present paper deals with an engineering solution to produce renewable energy located next to the planned fish step and takes into account various conflict parties. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Engineering research; Environmental regulations; Fish; Hydroelectric power; Open channel flow; Rivers; Small power plants; Water conservation; Water levels; Water quality; Archimedes screws; Engineering solutions; European Water Framework Directive; Hydropower plants; Level difference; Present situation; Renewable energies; Small hydro power plants; Hydroelectric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015082358

We apply the mixedinteger model CCTS-Mod to compute a CCTS infrastructure network for Europe, examining the effects of different CO2 price paths with different regional foci. Scenarios assuming low CO2 certificate prices lead to hardly any CCTS development in Europe. The iron and steel sector starts deployment once the CO2 certificate prices exceed 50 €/tCO2. The cement sector starts investing at a threshold of 75 €/tCO2, followed by the electricity sector when prices exceed 100 €/tCO2. The degree of CCTS deployment is found to be more sensitive to variable costs of CO2 capture than to investment costs. Additional revenues generated from utilizing CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) in the North Sea would lead to an earlier adoption of CCTS, independent of the CO2 certificate price; this case may become especially relevant for the UK, Norway and the Netherlands. However, scattered CCTS deployment increases unit cost of transport and storage infrastructure by 30% or more. © 2016 by the IAEE.

These fuel injection strategies reduce emissions, including soot, NOx, and unburned hydrocarbons, by manipulating fuel/air mixtures and local equivalence ratios, local temperatures and cylinder pressure, as well as overall combustion phasing. This work seeks to describe the mechanisms by which multiple injection strategies reduce unburned hydrocarbons at low-temperature combustion conditions. The results show that unburned hydrocarbon emissions are reduced when multiple injections are used, and when combustion timing is thermodynamically favorable. Although multiple injection strategies can reduce unburned hydrocarbons at thermodynamically unfavorable timings, when injection occurs during the expansion stroke, the multiple injections are less effective at these conditions. The results indicate that both mixture preparation and thermal conditions have a significant effect on emissions.

Regarding PM emissions a disadvantage of biomass based residential heating technologies compared to fossil fuel fired systems still exists. Thus, new and sustainable technologies for residential heating with high efficiency and low emissions with a special focus on dust are required. A new ultra-low emission technology for small-scale pellet and woodchips combustion has been developed by Windhager Zentralheizung Technik GmbH in cooperation with BIOS BIOENERGIESYSTEME GmbH. The technology is based on the application of primary measures and has been successfully tested within the EU FP7- project EU-UltraLowDust. The new ultra-low emission boiler technology can achieve almost zero CO, OGC and dust emissions and also reduces NOxemissions in comparison to the present state-of-the-art. The most relevant achievement is the reduction of TSP in the flue gas by a factor of 10 at full and partial load which was confirmed not only at test stand but also in field measurements. With the new combustion technology based on extreme air staging ultra-low emission operation has been demonstrated and it has been shown that in future for ultra-low emission pellet and woodchips combustion secondary measures are not needed anymore, which represents a relevant technological milestone and a technological breakthrough.

Despite all shortcomings, the Paris Agreement may therefore be labelled a success. It also demonstrates that environmental multilateralism is not dead. The Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) were able to conclude a treaty under international law, with an innovative legal approach in order to satisfy the constitutional peculiarities of the United States of America (US). The successful outcome of Paris has thus restored some of the confidence in international diplomacy lost over the last decade. The Agreement's ambition of limiting global warming to 'well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1, 5°C above pre-industrial levels' represents a quantitative increase compared with the previous wording and a reinterpretation of the Convention's ultimate purpose: the Convention's objective is to avoid dangerous climate change; the Paris Agreement now posits that any global warming is dangerous. Furthermore, countries agreed that the temperature limit is to be reached by, first, a peaking of greenhouse gas emissions 'as soon as possible' and, secondly, 'a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century'. This is therefore the main message from Paris: the age of fossil fuels is over Shortcomings include the lack of legal bindingness as far as national contributions relating to mitigation, adaptation and finance are concerned. Indeed, contributions that countries have submitted fall far short of the stipulated global ambition: even if fully implemented, global mean temperature would most likely still increase in the range of 2.7°C to 3.5°C. This is a serious shortfall and action to strengthen those contributions, especially by large emitters, must start by 2018 in order to keep the world on a path that is considered safe for humanity. However international negotiations can rarely take decisions that have not previously been prepared nationally. The role the international climate process can play at the moment is to serve as a catalyst for national developments by keeping the issue on the agenda and forcing national policy-makers to revisit it continuously. The question is therefore not whether the Paris Agreement will deliver the emission reductions necessary, but whether the Agreement has the potential to catalyse further changes, whether it becomes a pacemaker for policy processes - at the international level and in the capitals of the world. From this perspective, the Paris Agreement is much stronger than many had expected. Instead of legal sanctions, the Paris Agreement relies on a mechanism of 'naming and shaming' to ensure implementation: it creates a reputational risk through the establishment of mandatory transparency and review provisions. This innovative review mechanism ('ratchet') aims for the Parties to enhance their contributions every five years. Starting in 2018, these 'stocktakes' will create moments of concentrated political attention every five years that may be used for fostering the dynamic of the process. While there is no legal obligation to strengthen the first round of contributions, they are thus not necessarily the last word, given the growing awareness of climate change impacts and the growing dynamics in renewable energy, battery technologies and other solutions, which may quickly render previous goals obsolete. To date, the climate regime has had no mechanism to confront governments with such developments - and to take up these dynamics. It will be crucial for the success of the regular stocktakings that countries transparently report the implementation of their contributions and subject their efforts to review. In this regard, the Agreement defines a 'transparency framework', which has yet to be fleshed out. Apart from increasing the level of ambition, the details of the transparency framework will be the most relevant field of work in the coming years. One reason the Paris Agreement won the support of developing countries was its recognition of two decade-long demands: first, it elevates the standing of adaptation in the international climate regime. Crucially, action on adaptation is to be reviewed and accelerated every five years in parallel to the contribution cycles for mitigation. However while the need for substantial adaptation finance has been recognised in the Paris Agreement, it does not include a collective, quantified goal for adaptation finance. Secondly, the Paris Agreement recognises that there are adverse climate impacts that cannot be adapted to - and that they must be dealt with. This was a crunch issue until the very end because, while developing countries wanted the concept of loss and damage' to be included in the final Agreement text, developed countries feared it could be used for compensation and liability claims. The final outcome gives consideration to both positions: while the Paris Agreement features an article on loss and damage, the decision text contains a clause that precludes the concept from being used as a basis for compensation and liability claims. The finance part of the Paris Agreement is weak. It does not contain any compulsory language to scale up climate finance. Only the accompanying decision text reiterates that the goal of mobilising an annual US$100 billion of North-South financial flows in 2020 and beyond, already promised in Copenhagen, is still valid. Furthermore, the Parties agreed to set a new, collective financing target by 2025. In this context, the US$100 billion figure is now considered the floor of financial contributions, rather than the ceiling as was the case before Paris. The adoption of the Paris Agreement is not the end, but the beginning of a process. Its effectiveness depends on whether the momentum of Paris can be turned into a political force. This momentum was to a large extent created by the 'high ambition coalition' of small island states, least developed countries and the European Union (EU). It ultimately even included traditional blockers such as Japan and the US and was one of the main drivers of an outcome at the upper end of what seemed politically possible. Keeping this coalition alive, at least in its core, would help to work towards a progressive implementation and evolution of global climate policy, both inside and outside of the UNFCCC regime. Global climate diplomacy requires such a driven as numerous occasions in the past have shown. The EU should not let this opportunity slip away and should strengthen ties with those countries originally forming this group. This coalition would be in a position to push for the Agreement's early entry into force and for the speedy strengthening of national contributions.",,"adaptive management; anthropogenic source; compensation system; cost analysis; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; future prospect; global climate; greenhouse gas; international agreement; international law; legal system; liability; renewable resource; temperature anomaly; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden; Japan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979735712

Mitigation of SO2 emissions from many industrial activities has produced by-product sulfur and by-product synthetic gypsum essentially mineralogically identical to the primary materials extracted using mines and wells. Regulation to reduce anthropogenic SO2 emissions was one of the fi rst environmental protection efforts in the United States, which later became mandated under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The availability of by-product sulfur has increased over the years, and following the closure of the last domestic sulfur mine in 2000, it became the only domestic source of elemental sulfur in the United States. The most widely adopted means of reducing SO2 emissions from coal-burning facilities has been to install fl ue gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment, which produces synthetic FGD gypsum. The decrease in SO2 emissions since 1980 has signifi cantly improved air quality in parts of the United States. By-products from these activities have replaced the supply of products, such as elemental sulfur, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and gypsum, through substitution of by-product for primary mining of these mineral commodities. The cascading effect of efforts in the United States to mitigate SO2 emissions from multiple sources through the enactment of the Clean Air Act, and its amendments, has resulted in more than improved air quality alone. It has also, through the increasing availability of environmental products of SO2 mitigation, such as by-product H2SO4, elemental sulfur, and by-product synthetic gypsum, reduced the environmental impacts of mining these materials from mineral deposits. © 2016 The Geological Society of America.

Theoretical frameworks and empirical studies of environmental behavior identify a complex web of cognitive, affective, and evaluative factors that motivate stewardship. We explore the relationship between knowledge of, and adaptation to, widespread, climate-induced tree mortality to understand the cognitive (i.e., knowledge and learning), affective (i.e., attitudes and place attachment), and evaluative (i.e., use values) factors that influence how individuals respond to climate-change impacts. From 43 semistructured interviews with forest managers and users in a temperate forest, we identified distinct responses to local, climate-induced environmental changes that we then categorized as either behavioral or psychological adaptations. Interviewees developed a depth of knowledge about the dieback through a combination of direct, place-based experiences and indirect, mediated learning through social interactions. Knowing that the dieback was associated with climate change led to different adaptive responses among the interviewees, although knowledge alone did not explain this variation. Forest users reported psychological adaptations to process negative attitudes; these adaptations were spurred by knowledge of the causes, losses of intangible values, and impacts to a species to which they held attachment. Behavioral adaptations exclusive to a high level of knowledge included actions such as using the forests to educate others or changing transportation behaviors to reduce personal energy consumption. Managers integrated awareness of the dieback and its dynamics across spatial scales into current management objectives. Our findings suggest that adaptive management may occur from the bottom up, as individual managers implement new practices in advance of policies. As knowledge of climate-change impacts in local environments increases, resource users may benefit from programs and educational interventions that facilitate coping strategies. © 2016 by the author(s).","Attitudes; Climate change; Forest management; Individual adaptation; Knowledge; Place attachment; Use values","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; cognition; dieback; forest management; knowledge; Alaska; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976527439

The more and more stringent emission norms for internal combustion engines make it necessary to use modern modelling procedures to develop advanced combustion processes and air path systems. Apart from greenhouse gas emissions the main problem with diesel engines is the reduction of NOx and particulate matter emission at the same time. The difficulty is that the formation of the two pollutants is counterproductive. The pollutants' quantity in the exhaust gas is reducible by cleaner combustion processes or by exhaust gas after-treatment. To achieve cleaner combustion processes precise control strategies are necessary in the air path system. With external exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) the composition of the intake charge and the temperature of the combustion are controllable. By the mass flow rate of the recirculated exhaust gas the fresh air (or the burnt gas) fraction can be controlled in the combustion chamber. Due to the larger heat capacity of the inert burnt gases the temperature of the combustion process becomes lower which achieves lower NOx emission. Exhaust gas recirculation leads to better results in lower load operation points because it decreases the air-fuel ratio. The standard measurement cycles usually do not demand high load operation points. This means that EGR is effective in the most common operation points. The quantity of the recirculated exhaust gas can be controlled by several valves. If the exhaust side pressure is higher than the intake side pressure, then through the EGR valve the exhaust gas can be fed back to the intake side. The mass flow rate of the EGR can be increased with an intake throttle or with an exhaust flap. In this paper a control oriented model of a medium duty diesel engine will be presented. The engine is equipped with a low pressure EGR system. The EGR is supported with an exhaust flap. In the simplified engine model the equations, the state variables, the measured and the estimated parameters and the validation will be presented.","Diesel engine; Dual loop exhaust gas recirculation; Engine model validation; Exhaust brake","Air cleaners; Air engines; Brakes; Combustion chambers; Diesel engines; Equations of state; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mass transfer; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Process control; Specific heat; System theory; Control oriented models; Dual loops; Engine modeling; External exhaust gas recirculation; Modelling and simulations; Modelling and validation; Particulate matter emissions; Standard measurements; Exhaust gas recirculation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045428502

Regardless of 68Ge or respiratory-averaged CT based attenuation correction and good patient cooperation, approximately 21% of perfusion studies exhibit artifacts arising from misalignment that cannot be corrected by manipulating the attenuation acquisition protocol. This misalignment, termed cardiac drift, is caused by slow-moving abdominal cavity contents that reposition the heart in the thorax and appear as myocardial uptake overlying the left CT lung in fused PET/CT images. This study evaluates three postimaging registration techniques to correct PET/CT misalignment by altering the transmission map to match myocardial uptake. Simulated misalignment studies were performed with a cardiac torso phantom filled with [18F]FDG at 10:1 myocardium/background. An air-filled saline bag affixed to the medial left lung surface served as a distensible lung. An initial CT acquisition was followed by successive PET acquisitions consisting of small displacements of the cardiac insert into the left lung. Phantom transmission scans were aligned to the myocardial uptake in the emission scans by applying 1) full rigid-body translations and rotations, 2) rigid-body restricted to medial / lateral and superior / inferior translation, or 3) an emission-driven method that adds myocardial tissue to the transmission scan. These methods were also applied to 10 low-likelihood coronary artery disease (CAD) patients showing signs of cardiac drift. Full rigid-body registration showed significant over-correction (p &lt; 0.004) of activity concentrations in the artifact areas of the phantom data due the relocation of highly attenuating structures (i.e., spine). Inaccurate regional activity distributions were also observed as streaks extending from the spine and these results were replicated in the patient population. There was no significant difference between the true phantom activity concentration after correction with the emission-driven method. Misalignment corrected with the rigid-body registration results in an increase in activity concentration but fails to accurately recover the true concentration. These data suggest that a nonlinear image registration approach such as an emission-driven method results in a more uniform activity distribution throughout the myocardium, and is more appropriate for addressing the cardiac drift misalignment problem. © Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","Artifacts; Attenuation correction; Cardiac imaging; Image registration; PET/CT","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; algorithm; artifact; breathing mechanics; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; heart; human; imaging phantom; movement (physiology); patient positioning; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; procedures; scintiscanning; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Artifacts; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Heart; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Movement; Patient Positioning; Phantoms, Imaging; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Radionuclide Imaging; Respiratory Mechanics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021848673

Addressing this demand includes building more coal power stations, however with attention paid in designing them to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A second response is to deploy more power sources using renewable and nuclear energy. The South African government has plans to add about 9.6 GW of nuclear energy to the electricity grid. Accepting that South Africa will seek an international vendor or vendors to supply nuclear plants, a certain degree of localisation of manufacture and operation should be planned. One localisation task that can be actively pursued is reactor analysis, including criticality, burnup, shielding and accident analysis of the reactor. Such development of expertise will support both economic and safety aspects of building and running a nuclear reactor. With this in mind, neutronic analysis of the VVER 1000 reactor was initiated. The government's intention to build a new fleet of reactors means it is important that the VVER- 1000 reactor be included in studies done by the reactor analysis group at the School of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering at the North-West University. The analysis was performed using MCNP6 for the cold zero power state at the beginning of cycle with the specifications obtained from the open literature. The input file was generated using the in-house code NWURCS. To ensure accuracy and precision of the results produced by the MCNP6 code, convergence studies of the MCNP6 models were carried out. Once a satisfactory model was obtained, the critical reactor state was calculated by adjusting the boron concentration in the water. Furthermore, the control rod worth, reactivity coefficients and βeff were also calculated and are reported in this paper.","Criticality; MCNP6; Neutronics; PWR; Reactivity coefficient; VVER-1000",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026403955

In that case, boundary-forcing techniques can be useful to maintain the large-scale features from the coarse-resolution global models in agreement with the inner modes of the higher-resolution regional models. Although those procedures might improve dynamics, downscaling via regional modeling still aims for better representation of physical processes. With the purpose of improving dynamics and physical processes in regional downscaling of global reanalysis, the Regional Spectral Model—originally developed at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction—employs a newly reformulated scale-selective bias correction, together with the 3-hourly assimilation of the satellite-based precipitation estimates constructed from the Climate Prediction Center morphing technique. The two-scheme technique for the dynamical downscaling of global reanalysis can be applied in analyses of environmental disasters and risk assessment, with hourly outputs, and resolution of about 25 km. Here the satellite-enhanced dynamical downscaling added value is demonstrated in simulations of the first reported hurricane in the western South Atlantic Ocean basin through comparisons with global reanalyses and satellite products available in ocean areas. © 2016.

In addition, instead of having fit-for-purpose water supplies (using different qualities of water for different applications), highly treated drinking water is used for nearly all of Australia's urban water supply needs, including landscape irrigation. The water requirement of urban landscapes, particularly urban parklands, is of growing concern. The estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and subsequently plant water requirements in urban vegetation needs to consider the heterogeneity of plants, soils, water, and climate characteristics. This research contributes to a broader effort to establish sustainable irrigation practices within the Adelaide Parklands in Adelaide, South Australia. In this paper, two practical ET estimation approaches are compared to a detailed Soil Water Balance (SWB) analysis over a one year period. One approach is the Water Use Classification of Landscape Plants (WUCOLS) method, which is based on expert opinion on the water needs of different classes of landscape plants. The other is a remote sensing approach based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra satellite. Both methods require knowledge of reference ET calculated from meteorological data. The SWB determined that plants consumed 1084 mm·yr-1 of water in ET with an additional 16% lost to drainage past the root zone, an amount sufficient to keep salts from accumulating in the root zone. ET by MODIS EVI was 1088 mm·yr-1, very close to the SWB estimate, while WUCOLS estimated the total water requirement at only 802 mm·yr-1, 26% lower than the SWB estimate and 37% lower than the amount actually added including the drainage fraction. Individual monthly ET by MODIS was not accurate, but these errors were cancelled out to give good agreement on an annual time step. We conclude that the MODIS EVI method can provide accurate estimates of urban water requirements in mixed landscapes large enough to be sampled by MODIS imagery with 250-m resolution such as parklands and golf courses.","Drainage; Evapotranspiration; Lysimeter; Neutron Moisture Meter (NMM); Soil water balance; Urban irrigation","Drainage; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Lysimeters; Meteorology; Potable water; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Water supply; Climate characteristics; Enhanced vegetation index; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensors; Neutron moisture; Plant water requirements; Remote sensing approaches; Soil water balance; Urban irrigation; Water treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974808305

National forest impact analyses in Sweden have traditionally focused on supply potential with little reference to international market developments. In this study, we use the global greenhouse gas concentration scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change to estimate global biomass demand and assess potential implications on harvesting and biodiversity in Sweden. The results show that the short-term demand for wood is close to the full harvesting potential in Sweden in all scenarios. Under high bioenergy demand, harvest levels are projected to stay high over a longer time and particularly impact the harvest levels of pulpwood. The area of old forest in the managed landscape may decrease.

The issues are especially felt in areas that record high economic growth and rapid urbanization such as Iskandar Malaysia, a fast evolving economic-growth corridor in Southeast Asia.

Many epidemiological studies have proven that particulate matters in the ambient air are associated with adverse health effects. This will affect the existing and future economy of Iskandar Malaysia, where the exposed population may lose their workdays and face increased medical spending. This study focuses on quantifying health and economic benefits from the reduction of particulate matter with a size of 10 micrometers or less in diameter (PM10) using the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) by US EPA. Health impact functions are used to quantify the relationship between a change in PM10 level and number of related health effects among the exposed population. The samples for this research include a continuous monitoring data on the 2014 monthly average of daily PM10, the 2014 population projection of Malaysian Census Data and the PM10 related health cases for 2014 which are focused in the Iskandar Malaysia region. PM10 data are collected from monitoring stations operated by the Department of Environment (DOE). Respiratory related cases such as Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, which is categorized as J10 in International Classification of Diseases, are collected from selected clinics within the study area. The final outcome of the modeling exercise compares the co-benefits of air pollution reduction between the baseline scenario and the control scenario for PM10 level in Iskandar Malaysia. The results of this study are useful in optimizing and improving the existing policies and strategies for controlling air pollution and PM10 emission in Iskandar Malaysia. © 2016 by MIP.","Air pollution; BenMAP; Health benefits; Particulate matter emission; PM10",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993993813

Anaerobic digestion is available technology for livestock manure treatment with new business opportunities and benefits for the society, such as bioenergy of CH4 and nutrients are extra income, odor and pathogens are reduced and GHG emission are limited. The productions of chicken manure, cattle manure and pig manure were introduced with evaluation of potential energy production. The toxicity of ammonia/ammonium in the anaerobic digestion process was evaluated with microbial community dynamics. Operation conditions effects on methane production were analyzed, such as pH, organic loading rate (OLR) effects and the ammonia stripping pretreatment effects on the CH4 conversion. The dynamic of functional archaeal and bacterial community were also conducted. Methanosaeta dominated in the steady stage of chicken manure thermophilic digestion but Methanothermobacter dominated in the inhibition stage and Methanosarcina thrived in the recovered stage. In contrast, under mesophilic conditions, Methanosarcina dominated in the steady stage while in the inhibition stage Methanosaeta and Methanoculleus thrived and lastly recovered to Methanosaeta. Poultry manure can be easily inhibited by ammonia compared to cattle manure and pig manure digestion since it has a high nitrogen content, which was more suitable for mesophilic digestion with evidence of process resilience in mesophilic digestion.

Currently, climate change in the region is most apparent in the frequency and intensity of climate extremes, specifically in temperature and precipitation. These changes may significantly affect the water sector in Bulgaria by the end of this century. The long-term strategic objective of the water sector in Bulgaria is to ensure sustainable use of water resources and to secure the future needs for water of the population, economy and aquatic ecosystems. The water sector operates in three main business areas: plumbing (supply, drainage and sanitation), irrigation (irrigation, drainage and protection from the harmful effects of water) and hydropower systems and equipment (dams and hydropower facilities). The operation of each one of these systems depends on the availability, quantity, and quality of water. This paper analyzes the impact and sensitivity of the Bulgarian water sector to climate change and assesses the sector’s vulnerability index. The results show that the water sector in Bulgaria is characterised by higher sensitivity and vulnerability toward changes in water quantity and quality and to climate-related extremes such as drought and floods. The Climate Change Vulnerability Index describes the sector as moderately vulnerable to climate change over the 2016–2035 time horizon. Some adaptation measures are proposed in respect of these results. The need of better integration between Water Framework Directive, Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 (SFDRR) and EU Strategy for adaptation to climate change (2013) are discussed. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation policy; Climate change; Vulnerability index; Water",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071374626

In aviation, the implementation of the most promising mitigation strategies, e.g. climate optimized routing, is linked with several technical challenges. An early introduction of interim mitigation strategies, which bridges the time period until most auspicious approaches reach market maturity, may pave the way for a prompt reduction of aviation’s induced global warming. Within this study, climate restricted airspaces (CRA) are defined in analogy to military exclusion zones. Climate cost functions (CCF) characterize the environmental impact caused by an aircraft emission at a certain location and time. To estimate the monthly climate sensitivity of an area, CCFs are derived with the climate-response model AirClim. Within this study, we close regions with climate sensitivities greater than a threshold value for a period of time (e.g. a month) and affected flight trajectories are re-routed cost optimally around them. The evaluation of the climate impact mitigation potential of climate restricted areas is performed based on optimal control techniques. Monetary costs are integrated into the cost functional of the Trajectory Optimization Module (TOM). Further, high penalties are introduced within restricted airspaces in order to ensure the avoidance of CRA. The cost-benefit potential (climate impact mitigation vs. rise in operating costs) for this interim mitigation concept is investigated for varying threshold values for the closure of airspace and compared with climate optimized trajectories (COT) for different routes and seasons of the year. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In this direction, the European Union has set ambitious goals regarding the transition of its Member States to low carbon societies, but the policy strategies to promote this transition must be socially acceptable and supported. So far, climate policies have been evaluated using quantitative methods, including general equilibrium and integrated assessment models but, despite their undoubted contribution to climate modeling, both the quantitative frameworks used for studying climate change and its impacts and those aiming at policy optimization or evaluation feature significant uncertainties and limitations. In order to overcome these issues, a Fuzzy Cognitive Map based approach is proposed, aiming to directly involve stakeholders and assess human knowledge and expertise. The suggested methodological framework can significantly support climate policy making, by supplementing quantitative models and exploring impacts of selected sets of policies, based on qualitative information deriving from a structured stakeholder engagement process.

Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also a main source of pollution and disease. Methods: We conducted a review around the topic urban and transport planning, environmental exposures and health and describe the findings. Results: Within cities there is considerable variation in the levels of environmental exposures such as air pollution, noise, temperature and green space. Emerging evidence suggests that urban and transport planning indicators such as road network, distance to major roads, and traffic density, household density, industry and natural and green space explain a large proportion of the variability. Personal behavior including mobility adds further variability to personal exposures, determines variability in green space and UV exposure, and can provide increased levels of physical activity. Air pollution, noise and temperature have been associated with adverse health effects including increased morbidity and premature mortality, UV and green space with both positive and negative health effects and physical activity with many health benefits. In many cities there is still scope for further improvement in environmental quality through targeted policies. Making cities 'green and healthy' goes far beyond simply reducing CO2 emissions. Environmental factors are highly modifiable, and environmental interventions at the community level, such as urban and transport planning, have been shown to be promising and more cost effective than interventions at the individual level. However, the urban environment is a complex interlinked system. Decision-makers need not only better data on the complexity of factors in environmental and developmental processes affecting human health, but also enhanced understanding of the linkages to be able to know at which level to target their actions. New research tools, methods and paradigms such as geographical information systems, smartphones, and other GPS devices, small sensors to measure environmental exposures, remote sensing and the exposome paradigm together with citizens observatories and science and health impact assessment can now provide this information.Conclusion: While in cities there are often silos of urban planning, mobility and transport, parks and green space,environmental department, (public) health department that do not work together well enough, multi-sectorial approaches are needed to tackle the environmental problems. The city of the future needs to be a green city, a social city, an active city, a healthy city. © 2016 Nieuwenhuijsen.",,"atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; decision making; environmental quality; GIS; GPS; greenspace; health impact; mobile phone; morbidity; mortality; physical activity; pollutant source; pollution exposure; public health; remote sensing; road; urban area; urban planning; urban policy; urban transport; adverse outcome; air pollution; behavior; carbon footprint; city planning; environmental exposure; environmental factor; health care concepts; health care quality; household; human; industry; morbidity; mortality; noise; physical activity; priority journal; radiation exposure; Review; temperature; transport planning; ultraviolet radiation; analysis; environmental health; legislation and jurisprudence; pollution; public health; traffic and transport; City Planning; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Public Health; Transportation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995695122

This adaptation plan is structured in four blocks: (1) stakeholder engagement, (2) information gathering on local climate change impacts, local health inequalities spatial planning and attitudes to more sustainable mode of transport of patients, visitors and staff, (3) decision making and implementation, and (4) monitoring. The estimate temperature change of the summer warmest day is about +3Â Â°C by 2099 and the central estimate of change in the precipitation on the wettest day is about +18.8Â % by 2099 in Manchester. This change in the climate can harshly affect the health of 71Â % of the population in Manchester who lives in deprivation. NHS, as the largest public health organisation in the UK, has the responsibility to reduce health inequalities as well as to enhance resilience in the local community by promoting behavioural change. The travel survey carried out at Manchester Royal infirmary (MRI) from travel activities revealed that the main barriers to switching to a more sustainable mode of transport are poor services, tickets affordability, child-care commitments, convenience and shift patterns. The most popular sustainable travel plan initiative is the interest free public transport season ticket loan, with the bike scheme and car-sharing schemes the second and third most popular respectively. Implementing successful a sustainable travel plan at CMFT is contingent on the successful cross-sectoral work with Greater Manchester Public Transport and Manchester Corridor, and a significant investment in onsite facilities such as showers or safe bike shelters. CMFT has also set progress monitoring tools through carbon footprinting from travel related activities. The carbon footprint exercise shows that MRI travel carbon emissions are 5,783,427Â kg CO2e, which represents 1.7Â % of national NHS travel total. Staff contributes most significantly to the MRI travel carbon footprint, with 51Â % of the total carbon emission, followed by visitors with 26Â %, and patients with 23Â %. Nurses are the largest contributing staff group with 1,384,590Â kg CO2e but medical staffing is the largest contributor per employee with 919Â kg CO2e.

Recent developments in structure from motion and dense matching techniques provide promising tools for such applications. In the following, the feasibility of terrestrial photogrammetry for mapping topographic location properties of sparsely vegetated areas in selected European mountain regions is investigated. Changes in species composition at alpine vegetation locations are indicators of climate change consequences, such as the pronounced rise of average temperatures in mountains compared to the global average. Better understanding of climate change effects on plants demand for investigations on a micro- Topographic scale. We use professional and consumer grade digital single-lens reflex cameras mapping 288 plots each 3 x 3 m on 18 summits in the Alps and Mediterranean Mountains within the GLORIA (GLobal Observation Research Initiative in Alpine environments) network. Image matching tests result in accuracies that are in the order of millimetres in the XY-plane and below 0.5 mm in Z-direction at the second image pyramid level. Reconstructing vegetation proves to be a challenge due to its fine and small structured architecture and its permanent movement by wind during image acquisition, which is omnipresent on mountain summits. The produced 3D point clouds are gridded to 6 mm resolution from which topographic parameters such as slope, aspect and roughness are derived. At a later project stage these parameters will be statistically linked to botanical reference data in order to conclude on relations between specific location properties and species compositions.","Close-range photogrammetry; Dense matching; GLORIA; MicMac; Mountain research; Structure from motion; Vegetation","Cameras; Climate change; Digital cameras; Image acquisition; Landforms; Location; Mapping; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Close range photogrammetry; Dense matching; GLORIA; MicMac; Structure from motion; Image matching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979211060

The fuel burn reduction target was a 50% reduction in block fuel burn (relative to a 2005 best-in-class baseline aircraft), utilizing technologies with an estimated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4-6 by 2020. Progress towards this fuel burn reduction target was measured through the conceptual design and analysis of advanced subsonic commercial transport concepts spanning vehicle size classes from regional jet (98 passengers) to very large twin aisle size (400 passengers). Both conventional tube-and-wing (T+W) concepts and unconventional (over-wing-nacelle (OWN), hybrid wing body (HWB), mid-fuselage nacelle (MFN)) concepts were developed. A set of propulsion and airframe technologies were defined and integrated onto these advanced concepts which were then sized to meet the baseline mission requirements. Block fuel burn performance was then estimated, resulting in reductions relative to the 2005 best-in-class baseline performance ranging from 39% to 49%. The advanced single-aisle and large twin aisle T+W concepts had reductions of 43% and 41%, respectively, relative to the 737-800 and 777-200LR aircraft. The single-aisle OWN concept and the large twin aisle class HWB concept had reductions of 45% and 47%, respectively. In addition to their estimated fuel burn reduction performance, these unconventional concepts have the potential to provide significant noise reductions due, in part, to engine shielding provided by the airframe. Finally, all of the advanced concepts also have the potential for significant NOx emissions reductions due to the use of advanced combustor technology. Noise and NOx emissions reduction estimates were also generated for these concepts as part of the ERA project. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA .

Studies have shown that use of manure increases amount of methane emission from rice. To investigate mechanisms by which manure boosts methane emission, comparative soil metagenomics between inorganically (NPK) and pig manure fertilized paddy soils (PIG) were conducted. Results from taxonomy analysis showed that more abundant methanogens, methanotrophs, methylotrophs, and acetogens were found in PIG than in NPK. In addition, BLAST results indicated more abundant carbohydrate mabolisetm functional genes in PIG. Among the methane metabolism related genes, PIG sample showed higher abundance of methyl-coenzyme M reductase (mcrB/mcrD/mcrG) and trimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase (mttB) genes. In contrast, genes that down regulate methane emission, such as trimethylamine monooxygenase (tmm) and phosphoserine/ homoserine phosphotransferase (thrH), were observed more in NPK sample. In addition, more methanotrophic genes (pmoB /amoB / mxaJ ), were found more abundant in PIG sample. Identifying key genes related to methane emission and methane oxidation may provide fundamental information regarding to mechanisms by which use of manure boosts methane emission from rice. The study presented here characterized molecular variation in rice paddy, introduced by the use of pig manure.","Metagenomics; Methane; Methanogens; Microbial community; Rice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982143986

In this study, four GHG emission scenarios were examined, as well as the baseline scenario, in order to verify the potential of GHG reduction from domestic wastewater with adequate treatment facilities. The ArcGIS and ArcHydro tools were employed to visualize and analyze GHG emissions resulting from discharge of untreated wastewater, in rural areas of Vu Gia Thu Bon river basin, Vietnam. By applying the current IPCC guidelines for GHG emissions, we found that a reduction of GHG emissions can be achieved through treatment of domestic wastewater in the studied area.

These risks require responses from cities to improve their resilience. Several analysis platforms have been developed worldwide to help effectively control and response to these impacts from different angles, including water resources management, energy production and consumption management, air pollution control, or other natural resources management. To contribute to this goal, Griffith University in Australia has developed Autoflow©, a smart application for water demand analysis and carbon emission monitoring and prediction. Various advanced mathematical models have been embedded into this system, from machine learning and pattern recognition techniques for water end use analysis, to Dynamic Harmonic Regression, Kalman Filter and Fixed interval smooth algorithms for water demand forecasting. Once being deployed, Autoflow© will be an effective environmental management tool that can: (i) provide water utilities and water consumers with detailed real-time information on how, when, where water has been consumed (e.g. shower event at 11:23:35 AM or clothes washer at 4:00:15 PM on Monday 11/12/2014),(ii) perform water demand forecasting at end-use level (e.g. expected 1.5 mega litres of shower consumption from 6pm - 7m in suburb A tomorrow), (iii) real-time monitor and predict carbon emission level from water consumption (e.g. Property A: Carbon emission from 6am-6pm tomorrow is 12.4kg), and (iv) suggest options for reducing water consumption and carbon emission. © 2016 Environmental Modelling and Software for Supporting a Sustainable Future, Proceedings - 8th International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software, iEMSs 2016.

Patch-clear cutting is a special case of clear cutting involving the removal of all the trees from strips or patches within a stand, leaving the remainder uncut or clear cutting a series of strips or patches. A forest-level optimisation model was extended to include uncertainty in timber growth, plant diversity, and cutting costs. Using a species-area relationship and economies of cutting scale, the net present value and optimal rotation age under alternative management strategies were calculated. Results suggested that the optimal rotation ages were similar (24 and 25 years) for the two cutting strategies. Patch-clear cutting provided higher biodiversity benefits (i.e., 59 vs. 11 understorey plant species) with an opportunity cost of 27 NZD (18 USD) per extra plant species or 1250 NZD (820 USD) ha-1. However, the true benefits of patch-clear cutting would be even greater if other benefits of stand retention are included.

In this study, we present linear regression models to investigate effects of congestion on traffic emissions along an arterial road and used regression models to derive analytical expressions separating free-flow traffic conditions with congested conditions. The regression models use traffic demands and degree of saturation as explanatory variables. Correlation of emission rates with traffic parameters (cycle length, the degree of saturation, and flows) was investigated at a range of conditions extending from under-saturated to oversaturated traffic flows. Data for calibrating these models are obtained from the application of Sidra Intersection, a micro-analytical software. A comparison of the proposed models to similar information contained in the Highway Capacity Manual marked similarity to the point of saturation and suggested an additional relationship with emission rates. Results confirmed that the relationship between the amount of air pollutant emission and traffic flow as well as the degree of saturation shown a piecewise linear relationship with significant differences in slopes separated by breakpoints. Moreover, regression results suggested that degree of saturation for the point of saturation is proposed for volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio values at 0.99, indicating that for all volumes, the change in emission of CO2 occurs around this value.

Using a consequential life-cycle analysis, we estimated the change in net CO2 emissions thatwould be caused by increased use of SWlumber and structural panels in NR construction. Carbon (C) storage and emissions were projected over 50 years for baseline and increased wood use scenarios using the US Forest ProductsModule operating within the Global Forest Products Model (USFPM/GFPM) and the Southern region timber supply model (SRTS). Increased wood use in NR construction (C content of 428 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent [tCO2e]) could provide an emissions reduction of 870million tCO2e over 50 years or a net emissions reduction of 2.03 tCO2e/tCO2e of extra wood used in NR buildings over 50 years. The CO2 savings varied for products provided in the South, North, and West because of differences in biological timber regrowth; market-induced changes in land use; differences in timber harvests, lumber, and structural panel production; and associated differences in C stored in forests, harvested wood products, logging slash, and manufacturing emissions. The US South provided the largest net change,-2.83 tCO2e/tCO2e of extra wood products, followed by the North andWest with-1.89 and-0.60 tCO2e/tCO2e of extra wood, respectively. These results suggest strategies that result in increased use of wood in place of nonwood products in NR buildings would be effective in mitigating CO2 emissions. © Forest Products Society 2016.",,"Building materials; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Forestry; Land use; Life cycle; Lumber; Softwoods; Structural panels; Timber; Wood products; Carbon mitigation; Emissions reduction; Engineered wood products; Global forest products model; Harvested wood products; Life cycle analysis; Manufacturing emissions; Nonresidential constructions; Wood; Carbon; Construction; Lumber; Panel Boards; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962469649

This was with the aim to study the effects that local and imported materials had on indoor air quality. To achieve this objective, the adaptive model approach has been selected. In accordance with the conditions of this model, all workers were kept in natural ventilation and, in accordance with the general procedure, a questionnaire was distributed to them, while variables, like air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity were sampled. The results showed a clear agreement between expected behaviour, in accordance with the characteristics of building construction, and its real indoor ambience once they were statistically analysed. On the other hand, old buildings showed a higher percentage of relative humidity and a lower degree of indoor air temperature. Despite this, local thermal comfort indices and questionnaires showed adequate indoor ambience in each group of buildings, except when marble was used for external tiling. The effect of marble as an external coating helps to improve indoor ambience during the dry season. This is due to more indoor air and relative humidity being accumulated. At the same time, these ambiences are degraded when relative humidity is higher. Finally, these results should be taken cognisance of by architects and building designers in order to improve indoor environment, and overcome thermal discomfort in the Saharan area. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Humidity; Indoor air; Office buildings; Thermal sensation; Tropical wet and cold","Air quality; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Building materials; Buildings; Cold working; Indoor air pollution; Marble; Office buildings; Sensory perception; Surveys; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Ventilation; Wind; Building construction; Building designers; Indoor air; Indoor air temperature; Natural ventilation; Thermal comfort index; Thermal sensations; Tropical wet and cold; Construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958093319

As a result, the population lives in a situation of threat and instability. The most vulnerable societies in Mozambique are those inhabiting settling areas along coastal or river plains, and those whose economies are strictly related to resources highly sensitive to climate changes. The vulnerability factors of two communities in the lower Limpopo River were analysed using a participative tool, the top mecca. The Zongoene and Mahielene communities in the lower Limpopo River basin lack essential adaptation elements that enable responses to climate change and natural disasters. These elements are required nationwide and include a highly diversified economy and access to new production technologies. In addition and in particular, the Zongoene and Mahielene communities rely directly on the services offered by the coastal ecosystems that have been affected by the impacts of floods, droughts, sea level rise and tropical cyclones.

Next, we quantify carbon reduction capacity of different sizes of trees considering basal area of trees and standing woody biomass. Carbon sequestration has shown to vary significantly with the types of green spaces. More predominant effect was found with local parks. We found that different sizes of trees in optimal multivariant green spaces could sequestrate up to 1,745,848 ton of carbon per year.

It will explain how the Kamaliyya Residence was built in a green and sustainable manner; discussing orientation of structure with respect to passive architectural design, thermal insulation techniques, innovative solutions applied to reduce air infiltration, introduction of solar thermal hollow circular tube technology, photo-voltaic panels for electricity production, grey water management, as well as rainwater harvesting techniques. Furthermore, the authors will offer revised experiential reflections based on on-site monitoring for the residence to compare with the theoretical results in the original assumptions of these strategies. Thereafter, examining the posibility of applying the design criteria learnt from moderate climate conditions of the Eastern Mediterranean to extreme conditions, particularly that of the Gulf Region. This can hopefully be done through passive design, improving thermal conditions, orientation of elevations, flexibility of single façade units and energy management. Finally, a conclusion would attempt discussing the implications of our findings on similar real-life situations as a guideline approach to adopt when designing buildings in such climates. This will further reduce carbon emissions from the electro-mechanical heating and cooling loads, and result in improved energy efficiency, thermal comfort and savings in energy bills and in operation and maintenance. © 2016 Amer.

However, little experimental evidence actually demonstrates a selective basis for metabolic degeneracy. Many methylotrophs—microorganisms that grow on reduced single-carbon compounds—like Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 encode two routes for methylamine oxidation: the periplasmic methylamine dehydrogenase (MaDH) and the cytoplasmic N-methylglutamate (NMG) pathway. In Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, MaDH is essential for methylamine growth, but the NMG pathway has no known physiological role. Here, we use experimental evolution of two isolates lacking (or incapable of using) MaDH to uncover the physiological challenges that need to be overcome in order to use the NMG pathway for growth on methylamine as a carbon and energy source. Physiological characterization of the evolved isolates revealed regulatory rewiring to increase expression of the NMG pathway and novel mechanisms to mitigate cytoplasmic ammonia buildup. These adaptations led us to infer and validate environmental conditions under which the NMG pathway is advantageous compared to MaDH. The highly expressed MaDH enables rapid growth on high concentrations of methylamine as the primary carbon and energy substrate, whereas the energetically expensive NMG pathway plays a pivotal role during growth with methylamine as the sole nitrogen source, which we demonstrate is especially true under limiting concentrations (<1 mM). Tradeoffs between cellular localization and ammonium toxicity lead to selection for this apparent degeneracy as it is beneficial to facultative methylotrophs that have to switch between using methylamine as a carbon and energy source or just a nitrogen source. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","experimental evolution; functional degeneracy; methylamine; Methylobacterium; methylotrophy","amine dehydrogenase; bacterial protein; carbon; methylamine; nitrogen; oxidoreductase; genetic selection; genetics; metabolism; Methylobacterium extorquens; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Methylamines; Methylobacterium extorquens; Nitrogen; Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors; Selection, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975488686

Its manifestations, particularly through rising temperatures, changing rainfall, sea-level rise and increasing droughts and floods have the potential to adversely impact natural ecosystems (such as forests, grasslands, rivers and oceans) and socioeconomic systems (such as food production, fisheries and coastal settlements). This is adding additional stresses to the ecosystem services, which form a substantial source of income to the rural inhabitants. It is most proximate and inextricably linked to well-being, development and economic growth which are part of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which ran from 2000 to 2015. Addressing climate change requires policy formulation, research, technology transfer and diffusion, financing and enhancing adaptive capacity of the poor at national, regional as well as local levels. As identified by the UNFCCC, the people whose lives aremost threatened by climate change are vulnerable groups particularly in developing countries, whose livelihood is traditional crop husbandry or livestock rearing. Therefore, mitigating climate change is an ethical concern. The chapters by Meenakshi Rajeev et al.,Arun B. Chandran and Anushri, Letha Devi et al., Sreenivasaiah, K. (Chaps. 14, 23, 26, 32) addressed this issue through agricultural development. Accordig to the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014), India’s agricultural sector would be one of the worst hit of any country in the world. With an erratic and extreme monsoon, the report states that by 2030 India would face an agricultural loss of over US $7 billion, affecting income of 10% of the people (Neeshad online). But if climate resilience measures in the form adaptive strategies are implemented, 80 % of the losses could be averted, the report adds. In India, several Missions and strategies (Green India Mission, REDD+ etc.) have been implemented at various levels under International initiatives. It is crucial to look at the need of those initiatives and mould responses accordingly to satisfy the requirement for climate change adaptation and sustainable development at local level. UNFCCC has also given strategies on the development of national adaptation and programmes and the support by regional centres; which endows a platform for a bottom-up approach to confer and adapt with climate change impacts at regional level. Pandit chapter (Chap. 10) explores the question how humanity might find the solutions to these global problems. Strengthening livelihoods, developing sustainable land use policy, etc., have been increasingly seen as a critical strategy for supporting adaptation. The chapters by Bill Pritchard,Muhammad Haroon et al., Swamy andNagaraju,Raju et al.,Barun Deb Pal (Chaps. 2, 4, 5, 11, 13) looked at various facets of livelihood sustainability which will help the adaptation of the stakeholders to the possible impacts of climate change. In the recent COP 21 held in Paris, India committed towards creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3.0 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover (an increase of about 680-817 million tonnes of carbon stock) by 2030, for which 5 million hectares will be brought under forest cover. This will enhance carbon sequestration by about 100 million tonnes CO2 equivalent annually (MoEF&CC). However, the Green India Mission is expected to deliver 50-60% of this target, and therefore, there is a need for developing the plans and strategies to achieve the remaining goals along with introducing other instruments in for example creating climate resilient systems, adopting good practices, developing the strategies for emission reductions and financial provision etc. Therefore, there is a need to focus equally on adaptation as well as onmitigation to cope up with the impact of climate change across ecological regions of country. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Agriculture; Aluminum; Carbon dioxide; Conservation; Developing countries; Ecology; Economic analysis; Economics; Ecosystems; Emission control; Forestry; Historic preservation; Land use; Molybdenum compounds; Natural resources; Natural resources management; Planning; Sea level; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural development; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Millennium development goals; Resource conservation; Socio-economic systems; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033451047

However, spatially restricted and more ephemeral carbonate accumulations can be an important but frequently overlooked component of otherwise siliciclastic-dominated or mixed carbonate-siliciclastic systems. Pliocene successions of Tuscany and the Tyrrhenian shelf (Northern Apennines, Italy) record a regional pulse of nontropical carbonate deposition across several restricted basins that has not yet been precisely constrained in its genesis and correlation. This study investigates the stratigraphic expression of these carbonates to extract general aspects applicable to carbonate sedimentation across tectonically structured and physiographically complex shelves. Analyses of the extension, composition, facies, and sequence stratigraphic architecture of the studied Piacenzian carbonate units are complemented by new biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic data, which document the slightly diachronous development of the carbonates within Mediterranean planktonic foraminifera Subzones MPL4b and MPL5a and magnetic polarity Chron C2An. The carbonate units are part of a regionally defined, tectonically controlled sequence, and represent the first transgressive unit overlying the basal sequence boundary, but are also found in the regressive portion of the sequence. Collectively, the units document the establishment of a shallow-marine carbonate factory, dominated by calcareous red algae, the larger benthic foraminifer Amphistegina, and heterozoan skeletal components, along the margins of a complex, archipelago-like coastal domain. A review of the studied successions and other examples from the literature indicates that carbonate accumulations in settings with varied coastal physiography and active partitioning of depocenters are generally characterized by: a) spatial discontinuity; b) an overall skeletal association consistent across separate basins, but with local variability in dominant skeletal components; c) preferential accumulation along basin margins or over isolated structural highs not in direct proximity to a hinterland with major drainage systems; d) predominance of low- to moderate-energy facies; e) preferential onset of deposition during transgression, with possible development of mixed carbonate-siliciclastic facies; and f) differing internal stratigraphic architecture tied to the specific subsidence and uplift history of coeval individual basins. These observations built upon the study of mid-Piacenzian carbonate units from the central Mediterranean contribute to the refinement of carbonate facies models and their application in the fields of sequence stratigraphy and basin analysis. © 2016, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,"Algae; Biostratigraphy; Carbonates; Catchments; Deposition; Magnetic polarity; Petroleum geology; Benthic foraminifera; Carbonate deposition; Carbonate sedimentations; Central Mediterranean; Depositional models; Planktonic foraminifera; Sequence stratigraphy; Stratigraphic architecture; Carbonation; accumulation; basin analysis; biostratigraphy; carbonate; deposition; depositional environment; magnetostratigraphy; Pliocene; sedimentation; sequence stratigraphy; transgression; Apennines; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Tuscany; Tyrrhenian Sea; Foraminifera; Rhodophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002194236

This research work focuses on characterization of ultrafine and nanoparticle emissions from diesel, gasoline and CNG vehicles to investigate for their physical characterization in terms of number, size, surface area and volume. Investigations also carried out for their chemical characterization in terms of chemical speciation like SOF, IOF, PAH, aldehydes-ketones, 1-3 butadiene and benzene content as they found responsible for toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Test methodology used to measure PM and PN is based on GRPE- PMP incorporated in European Regulations No.R83 since Euro V+. Engine exhausts particle sizer (EEPS) having fast response was used to measure particle size between 5.6 and 560 nm. Chemical characterization was carried out subjecting particulate extract to GC-HPLC and HRGC analyzers.

It is unquestionably important to invest in development of knowledge in order to get companies, institutions and even countries more resilient to the upcoming transformations. Just as mitigation is needed, measures of adaptations are vital for electrical systems to maintain their energy production. Brazil's electrical energy matrix is composed by 74.6% of renewable sources, being 87.5% of those represented by hydroelectric sources. These data show that the Brazilian Electrical System is highly dependent on water supply, which means it's also very sensible to climate changes. The company of this paper operates a 100% over hydroelectricity generation, which makes it even more susceptible to the climate changes. Studies shown in this paper demonstrated that climate change is causing different impacts on the rainfall regimes, affluence of the rivers and consequently on the assured energy in different regions of Brazil, decreasing in some areas and increasing in others. The average results for the country show a reduction of the assured energy.

In particular, large cities in East Asia have experienced numerous heavy haze episodes. Atmospheric aerosol distributions in East Asia are complex, being influenced by both natural phenomena and human activity, with urban areas in particular being dominated by fine anthropogenic aerosols released from diesel-powered vehicles and industrial activity. In Japan, air pollution levels have been reduced; nevertheless, in recent years, there is increasing concern regarding air pollution caused by fine particulate matter. The origins of air pollution were examined, focusing on the comparison between aerosol properties observed from satellites and that on the ground. Because of their short life spans, concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols are highest over the source regions, and as a result, the climatic impacts of anthropogenic aerosols are also found to be most pronounced in these regions. In this study, aerosol impacts on climate are assessed by numerical model simulations. The direct effects of aerosols include reduced solar radiation, and hence a decrease in surface temperatures. In addition to these changes in the radiation budget, aerosols have a significant potential to change cloud and precipitation fields. These climatic responses to aerosols can manifest far from their source regions with high industrial activities. © 2016 SPIE.","Aerosols; Asia; PM2.5","Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric temperature; Budget control; Climate change; Climate models; Crashworthiness; Economics; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiation effects; Remote sensing; Urban planning; Anthropogenic aerosols; Asia; Diesel-powered vehicles; Fine particulate matter; Hazardous air pollutants; Numerical model simulations; PM2.5; Regional climate changes; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010869900

Euhedral blade-like shaped or amoeboid shaped graphite crystals occur in the very low-shock ureilites, not associated with diamond. In the low, medium, and high-shock ureilites, diamond occurs together with graphite. X-ray diffraction and Raman analyses reveal that crystallinity of diamond is relatively well in the low-shock ureilites, although it varies in a wide range in the high-shock ureilites. Diamond formation in the low-shock ureilites occurred as a result of solid-state catalytic transformation of graphite at a pressure lower than 10 GPa, with metallic iron as the catalyst, while diamond in the high-shock ureilites formed by spontaneous transformation of graphite together with the catalytic transformation at a pressure higher than 12 GPa. The relative crystal-axes orientations between graphite (Gr) and diamond (Di) determined by EBSD analyses in the low- shock Y-8448 ureilite is the same as that observed for graphite and diamond in a carbon grain from the high- shock Goalpara ureilite. The metallic iron catalyst promoted the sliding and puckering of the hexagonal carbon planes of graphite in the solid-state transformation processes of graphite to diamond after intercalating into its interplanar spaces. It is shown that noble gas systematics in ureilites can be matched with the shock formation origin of diamond in ureilites.","Diamond; Formation mechanism; Graphite; Origin; Tetrahedral amorphous carbon; Ureilite",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990821398

Hence, THC, which is one of regulated emission gases, is likely to increase at cold start. As one of THC emission reduction approaches at cold start, the optimization of fuel injection specifications (including injection position and spray diameter) is expected to reduce THC emission. Setting injection position as downstream position is expected to secure the in-cylinder fuel supply amount at cold start because of small fuel adhesion amount on an intake port wall and a short distance between the injection position and in-cylinder. The position injection contributes to reduction of THC emission due to elimination of misfire. Additionally, fuel atomization is also expected to effective at cold start because mixing promotion caused by fuel atomization is dominant in low engine temperature. On the other hand, the effect of injection specifications under warm-up (in this paper, the engine temperature is relatively lower than hot condition) is also evaluated in this paper. Additionally, the spray behavior in intake port is observed by visualization in intake port. In this paper, fuel atomization method is injection pressure increasing. In comparison with the upstream position injection, downstream position injection improves engine startability and reduces THC emission. Furthermore, the spray diameter at cold start decreases with increases in injection pressure. On the other hand, the fuel adhesion amount on intake valve surface under warm-up becomes less than that at cold start. The THC emission remains approximately the same, regardless of fuel atomization.

In Paraguay and Uruguay H-ID have increased over the last decade associated with yearly rainfall variability. The extreme floods of Paraguay River in Asuncion (Paraguay) in 2014 were the most devastating ever recorded in terms of affected people due to the increase in exposed population and duration of the event. The extreme flood of 2007 in the Beni region, Bolivian Amazonia, is discussed focusing on the nature of the link with ENSO events.

The evolution of Hepatitis A in Uruguay which was endemic and correlated with droughts where a sewage deficit existed is also discussed because mandatory vaccination strongly reduced the number of cases since 2007. Future climate scenarios show increases in average temperature and modified rainfall patterns, with increases in Uruguay and decreases in Bolivia and Paraguay for 2011–2040. There is high uncertainty with regard to river flow, floods and health impacts, and more hydro-climatic extremes are expected.

This will increase on-farm demand for electricity supplied primarily from fossil fuels, which contribute to the emissions of greenhouse gases and accelerate climate change. Hence, there is a need for promoting the use of renewable energy and low carbon technologies for the sustainable development of agriculture and to reduce environmental load. In this light, this study proposes a simple and comprehensive method to assess the feasibility and the impact of replacing the existing conventional systems with renewable energy. First, we estimate the electricity consumption of modern farms in major dairy regions. Then, we identify the optimal system for satisfying farm-related electrical energy needs. The proposed method called for generalizing a successful experience conducted in a typical farm with the same characteristics and meteorological conditions to demonstrate the benefits of renewable energy utilization. The hybrid optimization model for electric renewable (HOMER) software, developed by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, was used to determine the optimal system configuration in terms of net present cost, carbon mitigation, and renewable fraction. Renewable system components characteristics, prices, and electricity tariffs are modeled according to the Algerian market. Detailed sensitivity analyses of solar and wind resources, economic parameters as well as farm load variation on the optimal renewable energy system configuration are performed. In addition to the feasibility study focusing on the production of on-site clean energy to satisfy the load demand, this study investigates the impact of the introduction of grid-connected green energy on the energy balance of agricultural farms and the national power grid. We found that on-farm electricity consumption varies from 330 to 566 kWh/cow/year. The simulation results helped to determine the technical feasibility and economic viability of the proposed systems. We conclude that the proposed systems could improve the reliability of the utility grid during peak load periods by generating 136 GWh/year while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 million tons. This is one of the first studies that provides a clear approach for estimating electricity demand and determining the optimal renewable energy system for Algerian dairy farms.

In order to locate dominant acoustic sources and to reduce the noise emission generated by a shrouded fan configuration, numerical simulations are performed. The working approach considers variously modified fan geometries and their evaluation regarding arising vortex flow phenomena and their effect on a decreased sound pressure level (SPL) in consideration of an improvement or the constancy of aerodynamic fan performance. Particular emphasis lies on the analysis of secondary flows in the blade tip region by postprocessing CFD-results. Due to the large number of geometrical modifications investigated and the importance of highly resolved eddy structures, a hybrid approach is chosen by applying the SAS-SST turbulence model in URANS simulations. The SAS (Scale Adaptive Simulation) delivers LES (Large Eddy Simulation) content in unsteady regions of a RANS-simulation and exhibits not nearly the high computational effort needed to perform a full scale LES. An assessment of the actual propagation of noise emission into the far-field is made by performing experimental investigations on the most promising modifications. The acoustic measurements are carried out in a fan test stand in the anechoic chamber of the University of Applied Sciences Duesseldorf. The aerodynamic performance is measured in a fan test rig with an inlet chamber setup in accordance with ISO 5801. The measured acoustical and aerodynamic performance is validated by the industrial partner. The results of the acoustic measurements are in turn utilized to determine indicators of noise radiation in the numerical simulation. Within this work an approach is presented where the analyses of secondary flows in the blade tip region provide the basis for an innovative noise reduction design in a shrouded fan configuration. The new design exhibits a reduced SPL (A-weighted) of approx. 4 dB over the entire operating range while showing no significant deterioration on the aerodynamic performance. The design was registered for patent approval cooperatively by the industrial partner and the University of Applied Sciences Duesseldorf, while minor design parameters are still subject to further improvements.

In a research study sponsored by FHWA's Long-Term Pavement Performance program, the impacts of climatic regions, drainage, and the thickness of asphalt concrete layers on the functional and structural performance of the flexible pavement test sections of the SPS-1 experiment were analyzed. Functional performance was analyzed on the basis of ride quality [determined by using the international roughness index (IRI) and safety (rut depth)]. Structural performance was analyzed on the basis of alligator, transverse, and longitudinal cracking and rut depth. For each SPS-1 test section, functional performance was represented by the remaining functional period (RFP), and structural performance was represented by the remaining structural period (RSP). Both metrics, the RFP and the RSP, were developed in this study to rate the performance of flexible, rigid, and composite pavement sections. This paper presents and discusses the results of the analyses of the performance of the SPS-1 test sections. It is shown that, as expected, pavement performance is a function of the climatic region. Wet-freeze regions had a significant impact on pavement performance in terms of the IRI, rut depth, and cracking, and drainable bases were found to be more effective in the wet-freeze region than in the wet-no-freeze, dry-freeze, and dry-no-freeze regions. © 2016, National Research Council.

Although many areas have had a long history of this variability and have a strong historic practice of adaptation, increasing variability has had a significant impact on adaptive strategies of agricultural producers over the last several years. Drawing on comparative vulnerability studies of agricultural producers in dryland river basins in Argentina, Canada, and Colombia, this paper presents an analysis of the adaptive strategies employed by agricultural producers in responding to climate change impacts and an analysis of how these adaptive strategies have built resilience and improved producers’ living conditions. Common exposures and sensitivities, linked with increasing variability, isolate important new adaptive strategies. Particular attention to the connection of these strategies to social, economic and institutional capital and the inter-relationship of these provides important insight for future adaptation.

The focus was instruments available in the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012. These instruments represented the 'on the ground' efforts to meet climate change targets and many continue to do so today in the same or slightly altered forms. At international level there is a recognized need to keep global temperatures within the range of 1.5 - 2°C above pre-industrial levels (Carrington, 2016). At European level, the 2020 package contains a series of binding legislation to help the EU meet its more immediate climate and energy targets. 2020 targets include 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emission, 20% of EU energy obtained from renewable sources and 20% improvement in energy efficiency. 2020 targets for the Netherlands are a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 14% increase in energy generation from renewable sources (Vringer et al., 2014). A raft of policies has been produced over the last number of decades from international to local level to orientate action towards targets. At European level the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) drives efforts at reducing energy among one of the biggest players, the building sector. By requiring a mandatory certificate at the point of sale and rent of buildings and making regulatory demands on existing buildings the EPBD upped the ante of what could be expected from the building sector, but especially the existing dwelling stock. National governments have already been tackling existing dwellings for decades propelled by the energy crisis and later by climate change policy. Information campaigns, subsidies, energy taxes, energy loans and tailored advice are among the instruments that have been available to homeowners to carry out works on their dwellings to reduce energy consumption. In recent years, the pace of efforts has increased due to, inter alia, the realization that the revolution in energy use that must occur for climate change targets to be met means major changes in the fabric of the existing dwelling stock, dwellings constructed before building regulations demanded high energy performance standards. It is argued that the building sector, in general, and the existing dwelling stock, in particular, can contribute more cost effectively and more significantly in quality and quantity terms than any other sector (Amstalden et al., 2007; Lomas, 2010; Ürge-Vorsatz, et al., 2007). This has provoked calls for new and improved instruments to meet the energy saving potential of existing dwellings. Despite many of the same instruments being used for decades there is little solid information on many crucial dimensions of how instruments operate and on what impact they have. The few evaluations and reviews that do take place are commonly focused on theoretical energy savings and costs and instrument strengths and weaknesses. Instruments commonly appear and disappear without undergoing improvement or change or contributing to policy learning. Many instruments are laden with assumptions about the target group that are never formally or comprehensively proved or debunked. Little theorizing takes place on the type of instruments most suited to the target group. Fundamentally, there is a serious lack of information surrounding the effectiveness of instruments assumed to be making climate change targets a reality. It is the above mentioned information deficits that influenced the objectives and structure of this thesis. Instruments are examined from different angles and viewpoints, from experts, owner occupiers, official evaluations and front-runner countries. Assessment frameworks were developed to tease out how well instruments truly function. Households in receipt of instruments such as the EPC and energy audit were compared to households not in receipt of instruments. Moreover, the complete range of national instruments available at the time of the survey were studied to present a complete picture.

In view of a holistic approach, and to prospectively meet the requirements of the automotive sector, economic and production-orientated aspects, as well as joining technologies within the scope of multi-material design must also be considered to achieve a great leap towards medium to large-scale production. To accomplish these goals, a comprehensive method for urban vehicle concepts with electric powertrain and their necessary vehicle structures is presented. The dimensions and packaging of the presented vehicle are based on demands of a future urban vehicle with a four-passenger capacity that includes baggage, steerable front system wheels and a rear axle with an electric powertrain. At the beginning of the method, the relevant user requirements, e.g. space for occupants and baggage and range for the urban vehicle, are defined. In addition, input variables are discharged through state-of-the-art electric vehicles. In this step, it is important to consider additional requirements, such as crash requirements or requirements for electrical components in the vehicle design. With the defined requirements, the package of the urban car has to be defined. Two paths are determined to a geometrically and a simulative way. The simulative consideration is limited to the vehicle longitudinal dynamics; thus, a rough dimensioning of the drive components is derived. The outputs of the simulation are the performance measures, which are converted into components for the overall model to dimension, for example, the electric motor or battery. The geometric design phase begins with the positioning of the occupants in the passenger compartment and the ergonomic layout. Based on this conception of the complete vehicle, various FEM optimisations (topology, topography, size) are carried out for the body in white, in order to construct structures for individual (functional) components/modules. This top-down approach gives the opportunity to obtain constructive innovations, which must be integrated within this early concept phase, also to reduce costs when aiming to develop a series product. With this holistic approach, a load-specific optimised structural design is generated virtually and evaluated, and an outlook on dynamic loads (crash behaviour) is also given. The focus here is on the potential for innovations by the definition of novel package alignments in combination with the useful application of multi-material-design methods, resulting in a light modular vehicle structure. © 2016 The Authors.

Part I of this study suggested that a set of daily atmospheric circulation regimes, or weather types, was sensitive to these cross-time scale interferences, conducive to the occurrence of extreme rainfall events in the region, and could be used as a potential predictor. At seasonal scale, a combination of those weather types indeed tends to outperform all the other candidate predictors explored (i.e., sea surface temperature patterns, phases of the Madden-Julian oscillation, and combinations of both). Spatially averaged Kendall's τ improvements of 43% for the potential predictability and 23% for real-time predictions are attained with respect to standard models considering sea surface temperature fields alone. A new subseasonal-to-seasonal predictive methodology for extreme rainfall events is proposed based on probability forecasts of seasonal sequences of these weather types. The cross-validated real-time skill of the new probabilistic approach, as measured by the hit score and the Heidke skill score, is on the order of twice that associated with climatological values. The approach is designed to offer useful subseasonal-to-seasonal climate information to decision-makers interested not only in how many extreme events will happen in the season but also in how, when, and where those events will probably occur. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Decision making; Oceanography; Rain; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Atmospheric circulation; Different time scale; Madden-Julian oscillation; Probabilistic approaches; Probability forecasts; Real-time prediction; Sea surface temperature (SST); Southeastern South America; Time measurement; climate prediction; extreme event; precipitation intensity; probability; summer; temperature anomaly; weather forecasting; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983514810

A comparison was made between a shuttle bus solution and a personal rapid transit (PRT) solution over a 30-year life cycle (PRT Consulting, 2015). The study investigated alternate parking facilities to meet the projected growth and the ability of the different solutions to provide adequate levels of service. It also evaluated the impact of connect times (car to terminal) on parking charges at surrounding airports. PRT connect times were found to vary from five minutes average to seven minutes maximum while the equivalent shuttle bus connect times were 12 and 17 minutes, respectively. This difference indicated a substantially higher parking charge could be justified by the PRT system, but PRT daily rates were conservatively held at only $1.00 higher than shuttle bus rates. With approximately similar life-cycle costs (capital plus operating), the net present value of the PRT solution was found to be higher than the bus solution. In addition to the significantly shorter connect times, the PRT solution provides level boarding, seated rides, reduced emissions, wheelchair accommodations and, significantly, does not add to surface congestion. For these reasons, the Airport Commission decided to pursue the PRT alternative. The initial PRT system serving the existing Economy Lot is expected to cost around $20 M. It will have 21 vehicles and 0.88 track-miles of guideway. It will include three at-grade stations in the parking lot, an elevated station at the terminal and a maintenance/storage facility. An additional station attached to Concourse B could allow deplaning passengers, with no bags to collect, a quick return to their cars - a feature not possible with shuttle buses. © ASCE.",,"Airports; Automation; Buses; Crashworthiness; Light rail transit; Parking; People movers; Transportation; Urban transportation; International airport; Lifecycle costs; Net present value; Parking facilities; Parking lots; Personal rapid transits; PRT systems; Quick-return; Rapid transit",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971384525

The difference lies in the magnitude of the problem in terms of its severity and proportion of the population affected. In developed nations the problem is alleviated by providing targeted food security interventions, including food aid in the form of direct food relief, food stamps, or indirectly through subsidized food production. Similar approaches are employed in developing countries but with less success. The discrepancy in the results may be due to insufficient resource base, shorter duration of intervention, or different systems most of which are inherently heterogeneous among other factors. In this study; results of regression model on production entitlement suggest that climate variability has relatively minor effects on food production. It shows moderate positive relationship but not significant; where temperature has more effects than that of rainfall on production. However the difference is statistically insignificant. The relatively minor impact of weather variations on food production, combined with the analysis of other qualitative analysis such as household survey, observation, discussions, participatory techniques and thematic interviews in Western Bagamoyo district, Coast region in Tanzania reveal how extreme climatic events affect rural food security entitlements of production, labor, exchange and trade. It also reveals households adaptation strategies implemented by the communities during droughts/floods which serve as a foundation for planning responses to future climate variability and change. Results of this study suggest that food security in Tanzania where droughts and floods are expected to become more severe due to climate change could be enhanced by adoption of Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practises to increase productivity, adaptation and mitigation of Green House gases (GHGs). It was revealed that agriculture as their main source of income contributes 69.7 % of income to household’s food security. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Adaptation; Climate smart agriculture; Climate variability; Food security; Mitigation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071390998

Hewitt St., Los Angeles, CA  90013, United States","Combined, the San Pedro Bay Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the tenth largest port in the world. The combined Ports account for about 40 percent of the imports into the United States from Asia, and are a huge economic driver for both California and the nation. Approximately 40% of the Ports' imported goods flow by rail to the interior of the U.S., with the remainder generally moved by truck to and from California's factories and warehouses. Anyone who has driven the highways of Southern California, especially commuting from the Inland Empire towards Los Angeles, will quickly note the two right-hand lanes lined with trucks as far as the eye can see. And in spite of the reductions of truck diesel emissions through the Ports' ""clean truck"" programs, recent evaluations have shown high levels of respiratory impacts along the major freight corridors. Given these circumstances, and the densely built urban landscape that stretches for miles from the Ports, how can they and the nation grow import/export capabilities without compounding the negative impacts of freight movement on the surrounding communities? By automating freight movement underground, with minimal interference of existing transportation modes during construction, using linear electric motors to power the containers to nodes centralized to warehouse districts, and trucks only for last-mile delivery. By combining the freight pipeline with a patented efficient ship berthing system, the entire network can be built as a privately-financed public-private partnership using existing transportation expenditures and no taxes. Governor Jerry Brown's executive order B-32-15 now makes this $18B proposal more ""probable"" than ""possible"". This paper will present the foundational supporting megatrends forcing the project toward reality, the combination of technology that makes it economically possible, the strategy for crossing myriad jurisdictions through four counties, and the accelerating political and private developments toward supporting construction of the nation's first large-scale freight pipeline. © 2016 ASCE.",,"Automobiles; Geographical regions; Pipelines; Trucks; Warehouses; Diesel emission; Freight movement; Freight pipelines; Large diameter; Public private partnerships; Southern California; Transportation mode; Urban landscape; Freight transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983252850

Not only resource extracting and processing industries, but also forestry and agriculture capitalize these resources with implications for local and global processes of nature and society. We analysed the state of land and water resources with regard to the impacts of human activity and climate change. The environmental status of forests, agricultural lands and inland water bodies was evaluated based on our own research and the recent literature. The focus was on agro-ecosystems. Our synthetic review revealed that peatlands and Tundra ecosystems are endangered by resource-extracting industries and industrial air pollution. Mining and industrial activity damage soil and vegetation and accelerate thermokarst processes. Forest ecosystems suffer increasingly from fires, insect outbreaks and improper management. Past and recent mining and industrial activity has polluted soils and water seriously in many regions. Permafrost melting could expose cases of old and inherited pollution. The impact of agriculture on water quality is still low but will increase. Agriculture is in a recession and operates inefficiently, destroying the soil. There is largely a lack of any agri-environmental monitoring in many regions. The rural infrastructure is on the verge of collapse, in the High North and the Far East in particular. State natural reserves (zapovedniks) are endangered by illegal activities and lack integration into scientific monitoring. Overall, monitoring programmes on the status of land and water resources lack consistency and modern technology. Climate change will put a great deal of additional pressure on Siberian landscapes, but hard data are required, and monitoring systems need to be modernized. Siberian landscapes have great potential for the mitigation of climate change through carbon sequestration and for improving people’s livelihoods. Environmentally friendly business activities such as organic food production, environmental tourism and recreational fishing are still underdeveloped. We conclude that the status of food production and the disintegration of rural areas are risks for Russian food security and national security. Modern technologies for monitoring and research ecosystems are needed to generate sustainable developments in managing the land and water resources of Siberia. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Ecosystems; Environment; Land; Monitoring; Quality; Siberia; Water",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119126309

AYF undergoes a cascade of self-immolative reactions in the presence of Hg2+ and unmasks fluorogenic coumarin 1 and releases two latent fluoride ions. These fluorides initiate the removal of silyl protecting trigger group on DPF1 which directs another cascade of self-immolative reactions. The fluoride ions (amplifiers) are continuously activating the cascade reaction, and, as a result, coumarin 1 progressively accumulates in the reaction medium and the whole process accelerates an amplified signal for Hg2+. For detection of Hg2+, the limit of detection of the two-probe coupling assay (AYF and DPF1) is 0.51 ppb which is more than 2000 times lower than that of AYF alone. Besides, 3-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-carbonitrile-7-((4-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)benzyl)oxy)coumarin (DCC), a long-wavelength probe, was coupled with AYF and DPF1 in order to shift the emission to a higher wavelength region.

In this study, soil carbon pool was assessed in a mining land after short-term reclamation. We measured above- and belowground biomass and soil carbon storage of artificial grassland (Astragalus adsurgens and Medicago sativa), which was established in the reclamation of mining land. The results showed that artificial grassland establishment significantly increased above- and belowground biomass after four-year restoration. Artificial grassland establishment increased soil inorganic and organic carbon content and storage. Soil organic and inorganic carbon content showed a positive increasing along the restoration time. Higher SOC and lower soil bulk density and water content all were attributed to the growth of artificial grassland. These results suggest that establishing artificial grassland with legumes is an effective restoration approach for improving soil carbon pool in the reclaimed mine soils. © 2016, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

The questionnaire was based on previous literature and direct reconnaissance interview with farmers, which culminated in 13 strategies used for the study being reported. For each question, respondents were asked to choose their best and worst strategies. Thus, the difference between the best and worst strategies consistent with random utility theory has been used for the modelling. Results show that semi-transhumance, various handicrafts making, rural migration, small-scale vegetable production and small-scale river exploitation were the most important strategies identified, whilst water transport and vending, shifting cultivation, gypsum mining, gathering and trading of wild fruits and edible plants as well as cattle and sheep fattening were the least appreciated strategies identified amongst the farmers facing climate change. These findings are therefore imperative for planning farmers' capacity-building and resilience against climate change projects to ensure sustainability in the study area. © 2016.

The RMN includes 36 coastal measurement stations; real-time series of sea-level and meteorological parameters are collected every minute. Tide gauges mainly collect sea level, air and water temperatures, wind speed and direction and relative humidity. The RON consists of 15 real-time directional buoys uniformly distributed along the Italian coastline. They collect the main physical parameters such as significant and maximum wave height, peak and mean wave period, wave direction, sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity. In this paper attention is focused on statistical analysis in order to describe wave climates, extreme events, tsunami, sea storms and storm surges and related meteorological information. The statistics taken into consideration are mainly the joint frequency distribution of significant wave heights with respect to direction and peak and mean wave periods. Extreme-event analysis is made through the peak over threshold (POT) method and the generalised Pareto distribution (GPD).

Figueroa St., Carson, CA  90745, United States","The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County conducted a full-scale test to determine if a biotrickling filter system could be used to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from digester gas. Testing was done at the Districts largest wastewater treatment plant the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant (JWPCP) which is located in Carson, CA. Most of the digester gas that is generated at the JWPCP is used in a combined cycle energy recovery facility that employs gas and steam turbines to generate approximately 20 megawatts of electricity, which is sufficient to power plant operations. Digester gas that is combusted in the JWPCP’s local South Coast Air Basin is required to have H2S concentrations below 40 parts per million (ppm) to meet air pollution regulations. In order to achieve H2S concentrations below 40 ppm, ferrous chloride (FeCl2) is added to the JWPCP digesters. Addition of FeCl2 is costing the Districts approximately $4 million/year and also adds to solids that require disposal. As an alternative to FeCl2 addition a biotrickling filter technology that was developed by the Districts was tested. A full-scale unit treating gas from one anaerobic digester was evaluated at the JWPCP for 13 months achieving better than 99% removal of H2S after the initial start-up phase. Reduction in the amount of FeCl2 resulted in a savings of $500 per day with a pay-back period of six months. Based upon the test results, the Districts are currently designing a large scale biotrickling filter system to treat 1,500 cubic feet per minute of digester gas. The cost savings from reduced FeCl2 usage at the JWPCP would pay for proposed biotrickling filter system in less than two years.

We also examine the influence of facultative and obligate omnivory on the survival of Z as a generalist predator, as we vary the linear mortality parameter σZ. This leads to bifurcation transition diagrams, which also include steady state stability branches for certain critical points. For specialist grazing (ρ = 0) the bifurcation transition diagram shows steady states, periodic and chaotic dynamics, with very small windows of periodic behaviour, as σZ varies, while for generalist grazing (ρ = 1), we only find periodic or steady state behaviours. The dynamics is interpretable in terms of facultative/obligate omnivory of Z. Results suggest that green ocean plankton code in global climate change modelling might run more stably with generalist grazing terms and careful control of grazer mortality. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052607091

There is clear evidence of changes in plant ecology consistent with increasing temperatures in recent decades. In many temperate regions seasonal events, such as leafing and flowering, are occurring earlier in the spring. Many plants are being recorded at higher latitudes and higher altitudes than their historic distributions. Community composition - the combinations of different species - is also beginning to change as species respond to climate differently and complex interactions occur. Changes in patterns of precipitation are harder to attribute to climate change and harder to project into the future, but could cause major ecological change. In particular, extreme events such as droughts have been shown to have large effects on plant growth and community composition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, alum prices have increased substantially during the past decade. The goal of this research was to develop inexpensive manure amendments that are as effective as alum in reducing NH3 volatilization and P runoff. Sixteen amendments were developed using mixtures of alum mud, bauxite ore, sulfuric acid, liquid alum, and water. Alum mud is the residual left over from alum manufacture when produced by reacting bauxite with sulfuric acid. A laboratory NH3 volatilization study was conducted using 11 treatments: Untreated poultry litter, poultry litter treated with liquid or dry alum, or eight new mixtures. All of the litter amendments tested resulted in significantly lower NH3 volatilization than untreated litter. Dry and liquid alum reduced NH3 losses by 86 and 75%, respectively. The eight new litter amendments reduced NH3 losses from 62 to 73% compared with untreated litter, which was not significantly different from liquid alum; the three most effective mixtures were not significantly different from dry alum. Water-extractable P (WEP) was significantly reduced by all of the amendments, three of which resulted in significantly lower WEP than dry alum. The most promising new amendments were mixtures of alum mud, bauxite, and sulfuric acid. The potential impact of these amendments could be enormous because they could be produced for less than half the price of alum while being as effective in reducing NH3 emissions and P runoff. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

Many of these policies emulate the work from the IPCC report in 2007-Sink, Sequester and Substitute. Embodied impact reduction becomes an increasingly critical factor in material selection since these impacts have both immediate and long-term effects - positive and negative. Building performance improvements further skew the value of recognizing embodied emissions by changing the relative balance between embodied emissions and operational ones. Engineers can expand the use of wood in a variety of building types by understanding the carbon aspirations of jurisdictions and contextualizing the benefits of using wood within these regulations and policies.

Limit values have been surpassed in some air quality monitoring stations and, following the European legislation requirements, an Air Quality Plan was designed and implemented to reduce PM10 levels. In this sense, measures to decrease PM10 emissions have been selected and their impact assessed with a numerical modelling tool (The Air Pollution Model - TAPM). These measures are mainly related to the industrial and residential combustion sectors and also, in minority, to the road traffic sector. The main objective of this study is to investigate the efficiency of these reduction measures, with regards to the improvement of PM10 concentration levels over the Porto region, using the new SHERPA tool. SHERPA was designed, in the scope of the FAIRMODE initiative, to provide potencies for all kind of reduction over Europe, and is particularly useful to identify the feasibility and priority of a given action. The impacts arising from different factors (different precursors) are quantified, together with the magnitude of the locally produced impacts of emission reductions on concentrations with respect to the “external to the domain” contribution. A major contribution of non-controllable sources for PM10 levels was found and the application also allowed identifying PM2.5 as the main precursor. Besides that, emission reduction scenarios should be focused on Porto urban area where potency is higher. © 2018 Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Effects and impacts are analysed and presented for two alternative SLR scenarios. The first one follows the hypotheses made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the second one those made by Rahmstorf, in 2007. The two scenarios consider a SLR of 0.2-0.6 m and 1.00-1.40 m, respectively, by the year 2100. The coastal surface area flooded in the IPCC scenario equates to ca. 876 m2, while the flooding in the Rahmstorf scenario totalled ca. 690,322 m2.

The goals of being sensitive to dust emission on solar system scales and resolving the Hill-sphere around forming giant planets can best be accomplished through sub-milliarcsecond imaging in the thermal infrared. Exploiting the 8-13 micron atmospheric window, a ground-based long-baseline interferometer with approximately 20 apertures including 10km baselines will have the necessary resolution to image structure down 0.1 milliarcseconds (0.014 AU) for T Tauri disks in Taurus. Even with large telescopes, this array will not have the sensitivity to directly track fringes in the mid-infrared for our prime targets and a fringe tracking system will be necessary in the near-infrared. While a heterodyne architecture using modern mid-IR laser comb technology remains a competitive option (especially for the intriguing 24 and 40μm atmospheric windows), the prioritization of 3-5μm observations of CO/H2O vibrotational levels by the PFI-Science Working Group (SWG) pushes the TWG to require vacuum pipe beam transport with potentially cooled optics. We present here a preliminary study of simulated L-and N-band PFI observations of a realistic 4-planet disk simulation, finding 21x2.5m PFI can easily detect the accreting protoplanets in both L and N-band but can see non-Accreting planets only in L band. We also find that even an ambitious PFI will lack sufficient surface brightness sensitivity to image details of the fainter emission from dust structures beyond 5 AU, unless directly illuminated or heated by local energy sources. That said, the utility of PFI at N-band is highly dependent on the stage of planet formation in the disk and we require additional systematic studies in conjunction with the PFI-SWG to better understand the science capabilities of PFI, including the potential to resolve protoplanetary disks in emission lines to measure planet masses using position-velocity diagrams. We advocate for a specific technology road map in order to reduce the current cost driver (telescopes) and to validate high accuracy fringe tracking and high dynamic range imaging at L, M band. In conclusion, no technology show-stoppers have been identified for PFI to date, however there is high potential for breakthroughs in medium-Aperture (4-m class) telescopes architecture that could reduce the cost of PFI by a factor of 2 or more. © 2016 SPIE.","Astronomy; Exoplanets; Facilities; Imaging; Infrared; Interferometry; Mid-Infrared; Planet Formation","Astronomy; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric structure; Cost reduction; Dust; Facilities; Imaging techniques; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Interferometry; Laser windows; Maps; Planets; Telescopes; Exo-planets; Heterodyne architecture; High dynamic range imaging; Long baseline interferometer; Midinfrared; Planet formation; Protoplanetary disks; Technical working groups; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006922997

The reaction between the CO2 and the hydrating cement forms finely distributed calcium carbonate reaction products. The carbon dioxide can be incorporated into conventional ready mixed concrete production through a simple gas system retrofit. A comprehensive durability evaluation of carbon dioxide treated concrete was conducted. The effect of the carbon dioxide in the fresh state was assessed in terms of slump, air content, plastic density, heat of hydration and time of time. Hardened state tests included compressive strength, freeze-thaw durability (ASTM C666), linear shrinkage, rapid chloride permeability (ASTM C1202), and deicer salt scaling. Comparisons were made between a reference concrete batch, a batch that contained a conventional accelerating admixture, and a batch subjected to the carbon dioxide addition. The concrete to carbon dioxide was found to reduce the time to initial and final set by over 20%. The CO2-treated concrete had a 14% higher compressive strength than the control at one day and 10% higher strength at 3 days. Later strengths were equivalent. Durability was general unchanged although salt scaling was reduced. The carbon dioxide could be a viable non-chloride accelerator. © 2016 International Committee of the SCMT conferences.

This paper assesses, for the first time, the energy performances of 34 office buildings in Santiago, Chile, by using data envelopment analysis. Overall energy efficiency is decomposed into two indices: the architectural energy efficiency index, and the management energy efficiency index. This decomposition is an essential step in identifying the main drivers of energy inefficiency and designing measures for improvement. Office buildings examined here have significant room for improving their energy efficiencies, saving operational costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology and results of this study will be of great interest to building managers and policymakers seeking to increase the sustainability of cities.","Chile; Data envelopment analysis; Energy efficiency; Office building",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018756132

While these reductions have resulted in concomitant changes in summertime ambient ozone concentrations, the changes have not been uniform across the region, with trends in long term behavior differing noticeably between the eastern and western portions of the valley. In this work, we draw upon previous modeling, observational and experimental studies to infer how the sensitivity of ground-level ozone to precursor emissions has changed over the last two decades. This work is notable for several reasons. First we establish not only VOC- and NOx-ozone sensitivities during summertime ozone episodes, but across the full range of summertime meteorological conditions. Next, we examine how these sensitivities have changed over the last two decades. We also examine how these sensitivities vary spatially across the LFV and finally we use the above findings to explain observed summertime ozone trends in terms of changing ozone sensitivities and changing emission rates. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Ambient ozone; Emission reduction; Ozone concentration; Ozone trend; Precursor emission",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060493754

The current state of the underground coal mining is characterized by an increase in the depth of developments and by a deterioration of the natural and mining conditions. An increase in the gas content of mine workings is simultaneously observed due to the growth in the natural gas-bearing capacity of coal beds and adjacent strata reaching up to 25–30 m3/t at the depths of 700–1000 m, which hinders the production of coal, increases its cost price, and affects the workplace safety of miners, while bringing of methane to the surface leads to the negative environmental impacts. This methane is recovered to the surface both from a ventilation stream and through various methods of degasification; only a small part of it is utilized. There is a need to develop a new technology and equipment for the recovery of the highly concentrated methane from the ventilation and degasification methane emissions from coal mines, which significantly reduce the harmful methane and dust emissions into the atmosphere, for the possibility of its further application, for example, in the internal combustion engines. The coal mine methane recovery has been earlier suggested through a number of ways:-The adsorption and absorption methods using liquid hydrocarbon components.-Obtaining the methane gas hydrates from the gas-air mixture with a lower content of methane therein.-Separation through membranes and by other methods. Despite the variety of methods for recovering the highly concentrated methane from the coal mine emissions, the energy vortex gas separation and the gas treatment of the methane-dust-air mixture are the most efficient according to the preliminary assessment and comparison of the specific energy consumption and capital investments. The simulation of the process of recovering the low concentrated methane and fine dust from the methane-air mixture, carried out in the Omsk State Technical University using the ANSYS software system, confirmed the possibility of separating the gas mixtures containing less than 0.5% of methane from the low concentrated methane and dust emissions from coal mines, and of recovering the methane in concentration of up to 80% with the fine coal dust treatment on the generated experimental samples of the energy vortex gas separation equipment. The basic parameters and geometric characteristics of the gradient separators and dynamic filters were determined using the computational models, which allowed for the development of technological and design-layout solutions for technology modules comprising the generated experimental samples of the gas separation and gas treatment equipment for recovering the highly concentrated methane and mechanical impurities from the methane-dust-air mixtures. © Research India Publications.","Coal mine methane; Degasification methane; Gradient separatpr; Methane content; Recovery of the highly concentrated methane; Ventilation methane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961187068

One of these that stand forward is biogas produced from anaerobic fermentation process. This type of energy diminishes the impact on the environment by reducing greenhouse gases and is useful for producing electrical and thermal energy. Anaerobe fermentation process is regarded as a good solution because of two aspects: producing energy and giving a solution to rising quantities of junk. Biomass used in order to obtain biogas can be formed from urban solid and liquid garbage, animal and vegetal mass dejections. In the case of animal dejections they are being mixed with energetic plants or agricultural residue. The processing is realized by anaerobic fermentation process. The mix used for producing biogas was formed from animal dejections (bovine and pork) with energetic plant grind (Miscanthus giganteus) with different dimensions. Production of biomass expressed after 22 days of anaerobic fermentation showed the influence of energetic plants on the process of anaerobic fermentation.

Renewable and low carbon sources can cover only a limited share of the total energy need. Fossil fuels, particularly coal, stand in for more than 60% of the global power generation. The efficiency of a thermal power plant is represented by the ratio between the net produced electrical energy and the thermal energy intrinsically delivered by the combustion of fossil fuel. This ratio can be improved by increasing steam temperature and pressure. State-of-the-art power generation technology succeeded in lifting the efficiency to nearly 50% while older equipment operates below 35% efficiency. Higher operating temperatures in the hot steam circuit, however, can be sustained only by using advanced steel alloys that have a sufficiently high resistance against creep and high temperature corrosion.Renewable primary energy sources such as wind and hydroelectric power have an inherently low total life cycle of CO2 emission per kWh of electrical energy produced. Yet even for these technologies, improvements in life-cycle efficiency and cost of ownership, along with the associated reduction in CO2 emissions, are possible. These improvements are inherently connected to the material performance of key components, usually made from iron and steel alloys. Performance criteria include strength, toughness, fatigue, and wear resistance as well as weldability. Often, dedicated alloying concepts, combined with appropriate thermomechanical processing, provide superior material performance. We demonstrate this using several examples of how advanced alloying concepts are helping to achieve more sustainable solutions in the area of power generation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Reduction in local fossil fuel reserves has led to an increase in their prices, thereby increasing the cost of electricity. Since the tariff remains the same, Pakistan is over-burdened with circular debts and observes a daily power shortfall of about 12-14 h. Being an Agra-economic country, many major and minor crops are produced and exported in large quantities. This results in a bulk of the agricultural waste which are not utilized. The waste can be utilized to meet the country’s energy demand while mitigating climate change and its impact. The study examines the electricity production potential and social benefits of rice husk in Pakistan. It is estimated in this study that if 70% of rice husk residues are utilized, there will be annual electricity production of 1,328 GWh and the cost of per unit electricity by rice husk is found at 47.36 cents/kWh as compared to 55.22 cents/kWh of electricity generated by coal. Importantly, the study will increase the awareness of the benefits of utilizing agricultural waste for useful products such as silica, with several social and environmental benefits such as a reduction of 36,042 tCO2e/yr of methane, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, improving the air quality, and providing 4.5 k new jobs.

The algebraic method based on Problem Table Algorithm (PTA) for Total Site CO2 Integration (TSCI) provides the designer with integrated CO2 capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) for the optimal CO2 emission reduction. In TSCI, CO2 is captured with certain quality from various plants and supply into system header pipeline. The CO2 header could satisfy various CO2 demands for various industry located in the header, and only surplus CO2 is to be sent to storage. The extended methodology with consideration of purification and pressure drop in TSCI planning is proposed. The CO2 supply from the header could satisfy the purity demand through a process of purification. Purification is a process to upgrade the purity level have not been considered in the previously used in TSCI method. In addition, pressure drop during CO2 transportation in the pipeline system has been included to identify the implication of pressure drop in TSCI design and has resulted about 29.01 MPa of the total pressure drop (ΔPd). Therefore, 68.2 t/h of flow rate (FT) of 81 % purity level header is supplied and purified to satisfy the 50 t/h of demand, at 99 % purity level.

The Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) framework described in this paper integrates catchment data and pressure information from point discharges and diffuse sources to enable characterisation of source-pathway-receptor relationships. Hydrogeological controls have a strong impact on nutrient fluxes, particularly in agricultural catchments, and have been incorporated into the diffuse agricultural model (the CCT). Results for the Suir catchment matched the measured loads of nitrogen and phosphorus well, and showed that pasture is the dominant source of nitrogen. The main sources of phosphorus in sub-catchments varied between diffuse agriculture, wastewater and industrial discharges. A relatively small proportion (13%) of the Suir catchment area requires a reduction in phosphorus emissions to achieve Good status. In these areas, model results can be used in conjunction with local knowledge gathered through the WFD characterisation process to identify significant pressures that contribute excessive nutrient loads. An example of assessing load reduction scenarios is presented to illustrate how modelling can support catchment scientists in identifying appropriate measures. © Royal Irish Academy.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010400027

The application of these procedures to hazards related to CCS and EOR infrastructures poses many problems strictly related to the peculiar thermodynamic behaviour of the CO2 (Koorneef et al, 2009). Difficulties in the prediction of the discharge behaviour of the CO2 during rapid depressurizations can influence calculations concerning the atmospheric dispersion and the eventuality of a dry ice bank formation (Mocellin et al., 2015). In order to fill some gaps concerning especially compressible CO2 discharges, starting from self - collected laboratory scale experimental data, a semi - predictive model is proposed with the aim of describing a sudden release from a pressurized vessel. The model is based both on conservation equations as well as suitable correlations to give a description of heat - transfer mechanisms. In addition, the Peng - Robinson equation of state is employed in order to predict the CO2 thermodynamic behaviour and to correctly manage both the gaseous and the dense phase if necessary. The application of the model shows good agreement with the experimental data series, especially in terms of pressure profiles and discharge time. In addition, the vessel thermal dynamics is adequately predicted both for the releases at higher pressure investigated especially when related to an internal surface temperature experimentally derived. © Copyright 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Equations of state; Forecasting; Hazards; Heat transfer; Atmospheric dispersion; Conservation equations; Experimental trials; Heat transfer mechanism; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Predictive modeling; Pressurized vessels; Thermodynamic behaviour; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988692286

One particular application is the strategic loading, where the ESD is charged and discharged cyclically, altering the instantaneous fuel consumption, thus aiming to reduce the average fuel consumption. Due to the ESD switching behavior, a hybrid simulation framework is an appropriate dynamic modeling tool. The hybrid simulation model is important in proper design and verification of control strategies for hybrid power plants. A hybrid model was derived, modeling transients as continuous-time events and modeling instantaneous behavior changes as discrete events. Due to the complexity of the system and its hybrid nature (continuous and discrete times), it is important to validate the derived model, such that are known its accuracy and limitations. The developed hybrid model was validated using experiments at the Hybrid Machinery Laboratory, Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The analyzed effects are the steady state, transient behavior, and losses. The transient behaviors include Generator-set (genset) dynamics and load ramps. The losses include the production losses, transmission losses, and ESD losses. The non-modeled effects include the load fluctuation, genset speed variation about the given set-point, and thermal effects on the genset and on the ESD. The results show good correlation between the hybrid model and the experiments. The fuel consumption estimation error stayed below 3% for all 15 analyzed cases, as well as having less than 9% deviation for the NOx gas emissions estimation. The model is considered as a good approximation for the real operation, enabling its use for design and research purposes. © 2013 IEEE.","Analytic approximations; energy storage; engine management systems; hybrid model; hybrid vehicles; marine systems","Continuous time systems; Electrostatic discharge; Energy storage; Fuels; Gas emissions; Hybrid vehicles; Machinery; Analytic approximation; Dynamic modeling tools; Engine management systems; Experimental validations; Hybrid model; Marine systems; Rules and regulations; Science and Technology; Electrostatic devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009143720

A one-week summer institute on Bioenergy and Bioproducts for educators from middle and high schools, and university faculty across STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Agriculture, and Mathematics) disciplines was hosted by the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES). This program is geared towards helping reform educational infrastructure by promoting multidisciplinary activities and content in the areas of sustainability, bioenergy, and bioproducts. The objectives of the Bioenergy Academy are: (1) to provide a systems-perspective in sustainability, bioenergy, and bioproducts education to STEAM educators and researchers; and (2) to develop and provide curricular materials and a set of teaching tools to educators for enhancing instruction in the areas of sustainable bioenergy and bioproducts. The Academy focuses on lessons and activities pertaining to sustainability, systems thinking, renewable energy with particular emphasis on bioenergy, bioproducts, and environment and policies related to energy issues. The participants got the opportunity to acquire concrete experiences involving teamwork, time management, and project execution skills; reflected on their learning experiences through presentations at the end of the institute; developed concepts related to organic chemistry, physics, engineering design, instrumentation, mathematics, biological, and environmental sciences; and actively experimented with feedstocks to generate biodiesel and environmentally-friendly soaps using the glycerin produced from the biodiesel. The BITES (Buildings, Industry, Transportation, Electricity, Scenarios) simulation tool developed by National Renewable Laboratory (NREL) of the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and made freely available over the internet allowed participants to play out scenarios to reduce carbon foot print based on those situations that can be realized through policy decisions leading to building improvements, reduction of industrial pollution, use of alternative fuels, electric cars, and other design modifications in the transportation sector, and cleaner and more efficient conversion technologies for electricity generation and conservation.

The Hooghly estuary in the western sector is relatively low saline compared to the Matla estuary in the central sector on account of receiving the fresh water discharge from the Farakka barrage. The central sector is hyper saline due to siltation of the Bidyadhari River since the late fifteenth century. The present study evaluates the condition factor of fourteen commercially important fin fish species (that constitute ~75 % of the fishes in the catch basket) collected from the Hooghly and Matla estuaries in the western and central sectors of the lower Gangetic delta, respectively. Relatively higher values of condition factor of all the species collected from the Hooghly estuary (compared to those collected from the Matla estuary) confirm the adverse effect of hyper salinity on the growth and condition factor of the species. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Climate change; Condition index; Fin fish; Salinity","Aquaculture; Atmospheric pressure; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Estuaries; Fins (heat exchange); Fish; Fisheries; Historic preservation; Natural resources; Saline water; Water recycling; Condition index; Geographic diversity; High-latitude regions; Net primary production; Salinity; Southern oscillation; Spatial variations; Strong interaction; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033492994

The assessment methods used in SANA 2010 were updated, replicated and used in this SABNA. with a focus on air pollution, occupational safety and health, and climate change. Objectives: The purpose of the review was to examine national policies and identify gaps in regulations and organizational arrangements that determine Ethiopia's ability to mitigate and eventually prevent the health impacts of air pollution, occupational hazards, and climate change. Methods: The national policy and regulatory documents were reviewed. Literature was identified through electronic searches. Hard copies of past reports and policies were reviewed whenever necessary. A semi-structured guideline was used to conduct in-depth interviews aimed at identifying gaps and needs. Results: The Constitution of Ethiopia has policy provisions related to air pollution, occupational safety and health (OSH), and climate change and health. Proclamation No. 300/2002 on Environmental Pollution Control specifies ambient air quality standards and allowable emissions. However, there were no documents that outlined the national or regional strategies that the ministries and agencies could adopt to translate existing policies, legal provisions, or guidelines for air pollution into practical programs. In the same way, a national OSH policy was lacking at the time this review was made on how occupational safety and health should be handled nationally or at lower governing levels as required by the International Occupation Safety and Health and Working Environment Convention No. 155/1981. Ethiopia is a signatory of this Convention. Conclusions and Recommendations: The results of the situational analysis indicate that there are cross-cutting gaps in the various sectors. Among these, addressing the critical shortage of skilled personnel is an urgent priority. Most stakeholders face acute shortages of professionals and poor retention mechanisms. It is therefore important to a) design interventions that focus on capacity building in, for example, aligning curricula with specific needs of ministries, and b) equip professionals with the necessary technical skills. In addition, the results indicate that policies and regulations exist in theory, but in practice, there are inadequate implementation strategies to encourage adherence and enforcement of the regulations and policies.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009517863

We incubated biochar in a temperate forest soil and characterised the soil organic matter composition using molecular-level biomarker and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Biochar amendment altered the native soil organic matter composition and decreased the concentration of easily degradable soil organic matter components. AbstractBiochar amendment in soil can sequester carbon and improve soil water and nutrient retention, fertility and plant productivity. However, biochar may stimulate microbial activity, leading to priming or accelerated soil organic matter (OM) degradation, which could alter the native soil OM molecular composition. To investigate this, we amended sugar maple wood biochar (pyrolysed at 500°C) at four concentrations (0, 5, 10 and 20 metric tons per hectare) in a temperate forest soil for 32 weeks. Solvent extraction and CuO oxidation were used to characterise free compounds and lignin-derived phenols respectively at 8 week intervals, while base hydrolysis was used to examine plant wax, cutin and suberin components at the end of the incubation. Stimulated soil microbial activity following an adaptation period (16 weeks) resulted in increased inputs of microbial- and plant-derived soil OM components including solvent-extractable short-chain n-alkanols and n-alkanoic acids, long-chain n-alkanes and n-alkanols, and sugars. Degradation parameters for base-hydrolysable cutin- and suberin-derived compounds did not show any significant degradation of these plant biopolymers. Analysis of lignin-derived phenols revealed lower concentrations of extractable phenols and progressive oxidation of syringyl and vanillyl phenols at higher biochar application rates over time. Solution-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of base-extractable soil OM after 32 weeks showed a decrease in the proportion of labile OM components such as carbohydrates and peptides and a relative increase in more recalcitrant polymethylene OM constituents in the amended soils. The biochar-mediated shifts in soil OM composition and reduction in labile carbon may reduce soil fertility in biochar-amended systems with long-term amendment. © CSIRO 2016.","biomarker; cutin; lignin; nuclear magnetic resonance; suberin.","biodegradation; biomarker; carbon sequestration; charcoal; forest soil; hydrolysis; lignin; microbial activity; nuclear magnetic resonance; polymer; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; temperate forest; wax; Acer saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987927060

The aim of this paper is to present the thermal bioclimate conditions and the influence of weather and climate on tourist issues in the KLAPS project domain, considering various types of recreation for both current and future periods. The base for the analysis was climatic data from the 1971-2010 period from German (DWD) and Polish (IMGW-PIB) meteorological stations, concerning both daily and 12 UTC data. The climate projections were carried out under various emission scenarios (SRES A1B, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) within MPI-ESM-LR and ECHAM5 GCMs. Future conditions were analyzed for two periods: 2021-2050 (near future) and 2071-2100 (far future) and compared with the reference period 1971-2000. The thermal bioclimate was assessed with the use of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). The Weather Suitability Index (WSI) and Climate- Tourism/Transfer-Information-Scheme (CTIS) were used for tourism-climate approaches. In the lowlands of the study area, the most convenient weather conditions for tourism and recreation are observed during the spring and autumn seasons (except intensive recreational activities). In the highest mountains, they are noticed in summer and from March to April due to the useful conditions for skiing. On the basis of CTIS, weather limitations for tourism are related mostly to sunshine and snow conditions for skiing in the mountain forelands. In the highest parts of the mountains, the most significant limitations are related to cold stress, precipitation, wind and sunshine conditions. Under A1B and RCP8.5 scenarios, an increase in the usefulness of weather conditions for most tourist activities in the cold season (November-April) are projected for the lower located areas, while a distinct decrease is simulated in summer due to a higher heat stress frequency. In the highest parts of the mountains, an improvement of climate conditions for tourism in the warm season is expected. In the case of winter, worse conditions might be noticed due to an increase in air temperature resulting in a shorter period of snow cover. © 2016 The authors.","Climate change; CTIS; Tourism-climate; UTCI; WSI","border region; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; mountain; tourism development; tourist destination; Germany; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988896832

So far, only a few suitable tools and methods have been available to farmers, regional planners and other stakeholders to support decision-making processes in this direction. The model-based interactive spatial information and decision support system, LandCaRe-DSS, closes this methodical gap. This system does not only support interactive scenario simulations and multi-ensemble and multi-model simulations at the regional level by providing information about the complex long-term impacts of climate change. It also helps different stakeholders to find suitable, sustainable agricultural adaptation strategies to climate change (crop rotation, soil tillage, fertilisation, irrigation, price and cost changes etc.) at the local or farm level. LandCaRe-DSS uses different ecological impact models, including for crop yield, erosion risk, regional evapotranspiration, total water flow-out and irrigation water demand. At the local level, a farm economy model is directly coupled with both the biophysical-based agro-ecosystem model MONICA and the statistical-based crop yield model YIELDSTAT to simulate the economic consequences of regional climate change and of proposed agricultural adaptation strategies. Due to the modular architecture and innovative design of LandCaRe-DSS, alternative or new impact models can easily be incorporated into the system. Scenario simulation runs can be realised in a reasonable amount of time. The interactive LandCaRe-DSS prototype offers a variety of data analysis and visualisation tools and an information system for climate adaptation in agriculture. This article describes the conceptual framework, the structure, the methodology and basic principles of operating LandCaRe-DSS. A number of selected examples demonstrate the versatility of LandCaRe-DSS applications. Using different scales and regions as examples, the impact of climate change is shown on: the ontogenesis of winter wheat for Müncheberg, Germany; the start, end and duration of the vegetation period in two German regions Uckermark (dry lowlands, 2600 km2) and Weisseritz (humid mountain area, 400 km2); irrigation water demand in Thuringia, Germany and the winter wheat yield in the Prenzlau region, Germany. Using LandCaRe-DSS up to 2075 for the Uckermark und Weisseritz regions, the effects and impacts of different agricultural adaption strategies were analysed taking into account irrigation, the absence of soil tillage and two different cropping ratios (actual cropping ratio vs. cropping ratio enriched with energy maize). Thanks to the modular structure of LandCaRe-DSS, little effort is required to adapt the whole system to geo-data valid for other regions or countries; incorporate other static or dynamic impact models; switch to other climate scenarios and implement other interface communication languages. The LandCaRe-DSS is constantly being developed, updated and adapted in different research projects such as the REGKLAM project for agricultural regions of Saxony, Germany, and the CARBIOCIAL project for regions within the Mato Grosso and Pará states of Brazil. It has already been used in a number of climate scenario studies for the Federal States of Thuringia, Brandenburg and Saxony. In the years ahead, international cooperative activities will be initiated with institutions from St. Petersburg, Russia, and Puławy, Poland, in order to use, adapt and advance this system. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Agricultural adaptation strategies; Climate change; Decision support system; Productivity of arable land; Regional impact assessment; Simulation models",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119139747

The multicycle capture performance of the sorbent has been investigated by varying the precalcination time, carbonation/calcination residence times and with the introduction of a recarbonation stage. Results show that the sorbent can be regenerated in very short residence times at 900 °C under high CO2 partial pressure, thus reducing the calciner temperature by about 30-50 °C when compared to limestone. Although the introduction of a recarbonation stage to reactivate the sorbent, as suggested in previous studies for limestone, results in a slightly enhanced capture capacity, the sorbent performance can be significantly improved if the main role of the solid-state diffusion-controlled carbonation is not dismissed. Thus, a notable enhancement of the capture capacity is achieved when the carbonation residence time is prolonged beyond just a few minutes, which suggests a critical effect of solids residence time in the carbonator on the CO2 capture efficiency of the CaL process when integrated into a power plant. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Calcination; Calcium; Carbonation; Diffusion in solids; Limestone; Slags; Sorbents; Sorption; Calcium looping; Capture efficiency; Carbonation and calcinations; Critical effects; Fast transition; Pre-calcination; Residence time; Solid-state diffusion; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966429133

This work focuses on the definition and assessment of emission abatement measures and their associated costs, air quality and health impacts and benefits by means of air quality modelling and cost-benefit analysis tools. The MAPLIA modelling system was applied to the Grande Porto urban area, addressing (particulate matter) PM10 and (nitrogen oxides) NOx, which are the most pertinent pollutants in the region. Four different measures to reduce PM10 and NOx emissions were defined and characterized in terms of emissions and implementation costs, and combined into 15 emission scenarios simulated by an air quality model (TAPM). Air quality concentration fields were then used to estimate health benefits in terms of avoided costs (external costs), using dose-response health impact functions per pollutant for different health indicators (morbidity and mortality). Results revealed that the resulting scenario including all 4 measures lead to a total benefit of 0.3 M€/yr. Among the 15 scenarios analysed, the largest benefit is obtained for the scenario considering the conversion of 50% of open wood stoves into heat recovery wood stoves. Although the implementation costs of this measure are high, the benefits outweigh the costs. The most cost-efficient scenario is the one that combines the heat recovery wood stove measure and the replacement of 10% of passenger cars below EURO3 by hybrid vehicles. © 2018 Hungarian Meteorological Service.

However, in the 1970’s and 90’s, this process was implemented in some of the largest plants. As a result, the HPO AS process treats more than 50% of wastewater generated in the United States. The injection of high purity oxygen in an enclosed reactor results in higher gas transfer capacity and higher treatment rates due to higher bacterial activity. This reduces the required tank footprint by approximately 75%. The covered system also reduces volatile organic carbon and odor emissions and it is more resistant to shock load (Stenstrom, et al. 1989; Tzeng, et al, 2003; Jiang et al, 2010). However, the system is more complex to operate since the generation and supply of pure oxygen is energy intensive and the original oxygen feed control system often does not allow efficient control of the dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) in the mixed liquor, resulting in high variation of the DO within and across the different stages. A well-controlled process achieves 70-80% oxygen utilization by the bacteria, which means that 20-30% of the oxygen generated at a high cost does not contribute to organic matter oxidation. Oxygen is wasted through the treated water and the reactor off-gas because of oxygen feed control system limitations. Union Carbide’s estimates of optimal performance claims 90% utilization, but it is rarely achieved. A more efficient control strategy capable of achieving up to 100% utilization of the oxygen supplied to the process was developed at the San Francisco Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant (OSP). With the novel method, up to 10% in mass of the oxygen fed to the system originates from ambient air that is allowed to be vacuumed into the process. The system also promotes higher utilization by maintaining low O2 concentration in the vent and effluent. The novel control method can result in 10-30% decrease in the aeration process oxygen requirements depending on the original control strategy. The new system also allows for control of the DO concentration within ± 1.5 mg/L. The control method has the potential to significantly reduce aeration process operating costs. This paper reviews the original and new control system and the methodology used to evaluate performance. It discusses the implementation of tools that allow real time monitoring of the process O2 Mass Balance and %O2 Utilization. Those tools are essential to properly monitor and fine-tune the system for optimal performance.

Especially EU6C regulation is not fixed yet, but we expect that especially it’s too difficult to be satisfied with NOx emission regulation using current after-treatment system (NSC and DPF). Recent results from other researchers need to apply additional after-treatment system such as Selective Catalyst Reduction or SDPF. In this study, we investigate additional NOx conversion without SCR catalyst. When LNT+DPF+SCR combined after system apply, it should need additional hardware and software such as urea dosing injector, supply pump, dosing control unit and DCU mapping. But when LNT+DPF apply, it does not need additional hardware and software. So we reduce development cost and time. So we focus on developing high performance LNT catalyst. In this study used bench aged catalyst which were equivalent to 160k full useful life. In chassis dynamometer, we perform NEDC test cycle at first for screening test of EU6 regulation and perform WLTC version 5. test cycle for finding out optimized and high performance NOx conversion LNT. In engine dynamometer, we perform NOx storage test for checking absorption performance of low temperature. So we can develop LNT+DPF after-treatment system without SCR for EU6C regulation. © 2016, FISITA.

It is often considered to be superior to the production of electricity and district heat with internal combustion engines mainly because of better energy utilisation, higher flexibility and beneficial economic prospects. Biogas upgrading is commonly accepted as state-of-the-art and a considerable number of small and industrial scale plants have been commissioned to date representing the portfolio of currently available upgrading technologies. Nevertheless, academic research clearly demonstrates that still a huge potential for optimisation and development is existing in this field. The current work contributes to the field of biogas upgrading by suggesting innovative and powerful approaches along the whole process chain. The importance of trace component separation is exemplary depicted by introducing a novel desulphurization technology based on chemical-oxidative scrubbing applying an innovative short-contact-time apparatus. Thus, separation efficiency for hydrogen sulphide is maximized while the simultaneous separation of carbon dioxide is minimized to assure minimum chemicals consumption. As an example for the major biogas upgrading step of carbon dioxide removal, the process of membranebased gas permeation is suggested. This technique stands out for its excellent adaptability regarding biomethane quality and methane recovery already during the design phase, simple and robust plant operation, low specific energy demand as well as reasonable upgrading costs. Finally, a combination of biogas upgrading with the Power-to-Gas approach is presented. This process provides the possibility of storing renewable electrical excess energy in form of biomethane in the high-capacity natural gas grid, an overall increase of biomethane output of a given biogas plant by maximizing carbon utilization and a reduction of the specific carbon footprint of a biomethane site. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Energy utilization; Heat engines; Industrial plants; Internal combustion engines; Natural gas; Separation; Carbon dioxide removal; Carbon utilization; Low specific energy; Oxidative scrubbing; Separation efficiency; Simultaneous separation; Upgrading technologies; Whole process chains; Biogas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009727775

It is well know that the single heaviest component of a passenger vehicle is the body structure, thus has the greatest potential for significantly reducing the vehicles mass. Therefore, transitioning from steelbased bodies to ones composed of lightweight materials, such as: aluminum, magnesium and advanced high strength steels are of great interest. However, with the introduction of these new materials comes with a new means of joining, where conventional methods do not work. Therefore, this work examines a novel joining technique, flow drill screwdriving which is a thermo-mechanical process for joining aluminum and dissimilar materials. The focus of this work is to examine the residual stress distribution in a joint, because mechanical behavior and joint quality are greatly affected by the residual stress. Neutron diffraction was used for the determination of the residual stress in two samples processed with low and high fastener force. The high penetration depth of neutron radiation allows for the determination of triaxial residual stress states inside the material without destruction of the sample. It was found that the stress field around the joint location is primarily in tension, which is problematic if external forces are applied near the joint. Therefore, additional stress measurements were conducted under applied load through a lap shear test. Two load levels were applied to determine the effects on stress concentrations around the proximity of the joint.

Building on recent critical research on REDD+, we look at how global policy is interpreted locally by actors who are likely to be involved in REDD+ implementation. We do this by examining local stakeholder perceptions of REDD+ and forest management in two contrasting provinces of Indonesia, Riau and Papua, where deforestation rates are high and low, respectively. Using data collected from stakeholder workshops, we conduct a discourse analysis that reveals how subnational actors perceive and position themselves around REDD+ and forest governance. The results reveal six discourses common to both case-study provinces, which variously conflict and converge as they are employed by different actors. Seen together, these discourses provide critical insights into the subnational policy environment, which is largely a product of Indonesia’s underlying land and forest politics, and they indicate in turn how REDD+ in practice is likely to be interpreted and reconstituted at the local level. A key finding is that local discourses can be grouped around two divergent positions on REDD+: one that supports forest exploitation and sees limited prospects in forest carbon, and one that embraces sustainable forest management and expresses conditional support for REDD+ subject to benefit-sharing and property arrangements. REDD+ practitioners will therefore need to craft policies and project processes that account for these discursive dynamics. © 2016 by the author(s).","Deforestation; Discourse; Environmental politics; Indonesia; REDD+","deforestation; emission control; environmental policy; environmental politics; forest management; global climate; stakeholder; Indonesia; Papua [(PRV) Indonesia]; Riau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976582269

Since most of this energy is derived from fossil fuels, buildings are responsible for a significant share of the world’s CO2 emissions. Shallow geothermal energy is a promising sustainable source of energy which can potentially satisfy the thermal requirements of buildings not only economically but also with reduced carbon emissions. For high density urban areas, buildings can be connected to district Hybrid Ground Source Heat Pump (HGSHP) systems for heating and cooling purposes. This study discusses the benefits of district over individual HGSHP systems. A methodology for the optimisation of district HGSHP systems is proposed which considers building thermal demand regimes. Such optimisation can reduce the total lifetime costs of heating and cooling, capital investments and payback periods of HGSHP systems. The importance of considering the demand regimes in the optimisation is demonstrated through a case study. The case study shows that an optimised district HGSHP system can have significant financial benefits over individual HGSHP systems and therefore make district systems more attractive to investors. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Buildings; Cooling; Cooling systems; Fossil fuels; Geothermal energy; Investments; Capital investment; Carbon emissions; Financial benefits; Heating and cooling; Payback periods; Shallow geothermal energies; Source of energy; Thermal requirements; Geothermal heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002306697

Agricultural soils contribute 55% of national N2O emissions, and therefore mitigation of these emissions is important. In the present study, we explored N2O emissions, yield and emissions intensity in a range of management practices in grain crops across eastern Australia with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). The model was initially evaluated against experiments conducted at six field sites across major grain-growing regions in eastern Australia. Measured yields for all crops used in the experiments (wheat, barley, sorghum, maize, cotton, canola and chickpea) and seasonal N2O emissions were satisfactorily predicted with R2≤0.93 and R2≤0.91 respectively. As expected, N2O emissions and emissions intensity increased with increasing nitrogen (N) fertiliser input, whereas crop yields increased until a yield plateau was reached at a site- and crop-specific N rate. The mitigation potential of splitting N fertiliser application depended on the climate conditions and was found to be relevant only in the southern grain-growing region, where most rainfall occurs during the cropping season.

Building CO2 emissions allocation mechanism has significant practical implications. Based on radial zero sum gains data envelopment (ZSG-DEA) allocation model, this paper uses a non-radial ZSG-DEA model to allocate CO2 emissions between different Chinese provinces. Unlike previous studies treating CO2 as the input variable, we treat CO2 as the undesirable output variable. The modified model can better reflect macro-production process while earlier relevant models treated CO2 emissions as inputs. This paper contributes to the existing resource allocation method and allocates China's provincial CO2 emissions from the view of technical efficiency. The results of our paper reveal that (1) between 2006 and 2010 the cumulative optimal amounts of CO2 emissions were higher than the actual amounts in 12 provinces, and lower in other 18 provinces. (2) Several energy-abundant provinces such as Shanxi and Inter Mongolia need to take more responsibilities in CO2 emissions reduction. (3) After the ZSG-DEA allocation, all provinces' CO2 emissions are on ZSG-DEA frontier, which reflects the overall ""Pareto Optimality"". © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In Indonesia, large areas of forest were lost and extensive oil palm plantations were established over the last decades. We conducted a combined social and environmental study in a region of recent land-use change, the Jambi Province on Sumatra. The objective was to derive complementary lines of arguments to provide balanced insights into environmental perceptions and eco-hydrological processes accompanying land-use change. Interviews with villagers highlighted concerns regarding decreasing water levels in wells during dry periods and increasing fluctuations in stream flow between rainy and dry periods. Periodic water scarcity was found to severely impact livelihoods, which increased social polarization. Sap flux measurements on forest trees and oil palms indicate that oil palm plantations use as much water as forests for transpiration. Eddy covariance analyses of evapotranspiration over oil palm point to substantial additional sources of evaporation in oil palm plantations such as the soil and epiphytes. Stream base flow from a catchment dominated by oil palms was lower than from a catchment dominated by rubber plantations; both showed high peaks after rainfall. An estimate of erosion indicated approximately 30 cm of topsoil loss after forest conversion to both oil palm and rubber plantations. Analyses of climatic variables over the last 20 years and of a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index for the last century suggested that droughts are recurrent in the area, but have not increased in frequency or intensity. Consequently, we assume that conversions of rain forest ecosystems to oil palm plantations lead to a redistribution of precipitated water by runoff, which leads to the reported periodic water scarcity. Our combined social and environmental approach points to significant and thus far neglected eco-hydrological consequences of oil palm expansion. © 2016 by the author(s).","Eco-hydrology; Environmental perception; Erosion; Evapotranspiration; Forest; Land-use change; Runoff; Rural water supply; Streamflow; Transpiration","ecohydrology; evapotranspiration; forest ecosystem; land use change; perception; plantation; runoff; soil erosion; streamflow; transpiration; water supply; Indonesia; Jambi [Indonesia]; North Sumatra; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976586872

The latest results of research work targeted the exploration and exploitation of resources of yet another type of fuel - shale gas. According to estimates, Poland alone may have reserves of 5.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas, accumulated in non-conventional sources. This potential can be used in many sectors of the economy, including in transport. Thus, it became reasonable to consider the use of natural gas as an alternative power source for vehicles. The article presents the results of emissions from public buses powered by diesel fuel and compressed natural gas. The study was conducted in real traffic conditions on a regular bus line in Poznan. The measurement of toxic exhaust elements was conducted with the use of a mobile measuring system of exhaust gas analyzers PEMS (Portable Emissions Measurement System). The data obtained were used to determine the average emissions of individual components. Based on the obtained values it can be concluded that the use of different types of fuels to drive public transport vehicles leads to a reduction of air pollutants and thus to improvement in the quality of life in the city. © 2016 The Authors.

Major motivations for adopting LNG as a marine fuel are the recent international and regional regulations on ship emissions, increased awareness on improving air quality in strategic sea routes, demarcation of Emission Controlled Areas (ECAs) and the need for preserving marine environment including Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSAs) such as Great Barrier Reef, Coral Sea and Torres Strait in Australia. In recent years, European Union and few other individual countries such as Norway have been in the forefront in adopting LNG as a marine fuel and have invested heavily on research and development as well as in infrastructure development for LNG bunkering. The U.S. and Asian countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan have also followed the suit with similar interests in LNG adoption. Nevertheless, the lack of adequate LNG bunkering infrastructure along major sea routes and the early stages of the current developments found to be the main deterrent among several barriers for the adoption of LNG as a marine fuel. Australia is well placed to become the leading LNG producer in the world by 2018 [1]. It is expected that Australia, as the world's leading LNG supplier, could gain enormous economic benefits and preserve its invaluable ecosystems by actively adopting LNG as a marine fuel. Nevertheless, compared to the aforementioned leading countries, Australia has not taken strong initiatives so far to promote LNG as a marine fuel, build up necessary bunkering infrastructure and conduct relevant research and development work. Besides, a comprehensive scientific research to predict the future LNG demand in Australia has not been conducted so far. This leads to guessing rather than accurate prediction in taking important decisions related to the LNG future in Australia. In order to fill this knowledge gap, authors are developing an LNG bunker demand prediction method for Australia. This paper presents the conceptual framework of the prediction method. The projection could be used as a strategic decision support tool for Australian Government/authorities for development of LNG bunkering infrastructure in Australia, especially to identify the most important regions for bunkering. © 2016 The Vietnam Maritime University.","Emission control areas; Emission regulations; Liquefied natural gas; LNG bunkering; Marine environment and prediction tool","Air quality; Alternative fuels; Decision support systems; Emission control; Forecasting; Fuels; Gas fuel purification; Natural gas; Quality control; Conceptual frameworks; Emission regulation; Infrastructure development; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Prediction tools; Research and development; Scientific researches; Strategic decisions; Liquefied natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009096683

This paper focuses on airborne pollen monitoring of Betulaceae and Poaceae, two of the main plant groups with anemophilous pollen and allergenic proprieties in Northern Italy. The aim is to investigate plant responses to temperature variations by considering long-term pollen series. The 15-year aerobiological analysis is reported from the monitoring station of Vignola (located near Modena, in the Emilia-Romagna region) that had operated in the years 1990–2004 with a Hirst spore trap. The Yearly Pollen Index calculated for these two botanical families has shown contrasting trends in pollen production and release. These trends were well identifiable but fairly variable, depending on both meteorological variables and anthropogenic causes. Based on recent reference literature, we considered that some oscillations in pollen concentration could have been a main effect of temperature variability reflecting global warming. The duration of pollen seasons of Betulaceae and Poaceae, depending on the different species included in each family, has not unequivocally been determined. Phenological responses were particularly evident in Alnus and especially in Corylus as a general moving up of the end of pollination. The study shows that these trees can be affected by global warming more than other, more tolerant, plants. The research can be a contribution to the understanding of phenological plant responses to climate change and suggests that alder and hazelnut trees have to be taken into high consideration as sensible markers of plant responses to climate change. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002821206

This study aims at assessing the significance of long-term rainfall trends and temporal variability at Sharjah City, UAE. Annual rainfall and seasonal rainfall extending over a period of 81 years (1934-2014) recorded at Sharjah International Airport have been analyzed. To this end, several parametric and nonparametric statistical measures have been applied following systematic data quality assessment. The analyses revealed that the annual rainfall trend decreased from -3 mm to -9.4 mm per decade over the study periods. The decreasing annual rainfall trend is mainly driven by the significant drop in winter rainfall, particularly during the period from 1977 to 2014. The results also indicate that high probability extreme events have shifted toward low frequency (12.7 years) with significant variations in monthly rainfall patterns and periodicity.

During operations, CO2 flows through storage tank, booster pump, blender, fracturing pump, and eventually into wellbore and production zone, generating a changing temperature and pressure distribution. CO2's phase state, density and viscosity properties change consequently, which influence significantly the reliability and stimulation effect. In a liquid CO2 fracturing field test for tight oil, temperature and pressure sensors are positioned at 12 critical nodes (including booster pump, blender, fracturing pump, wellhead and bottom hole) to monitor CO2 fluid. To ensure the reliability, CO2 is required to maintain in liquid state both on the surface and subsurface. Inlet, inside and outlet pressure of the blender should be concerned, because the blender utilizes non-mechanical pump, which requires sufficient motive flow to draw proppants into the main pipe, while the pressure difference directly impacts the flow rate of motive flow. The field test is successfully implemented with satisfactory result, 21 m3 proppants are added into the formation. The main conclusions are as follow. (1) In low-pressure fluid feeding stage, partial CO2 is gasified, which influences the stability of fluid feeding; In future a buffer vessel will be placed between storage tanks and booster pumps, which will provide adjustment for phase control; And a heat exchanger may help by further reduce the temperature of CO2.(2) Pressure difference among inlet, inside and outlet pressure of blender fluctuates during the whole process, with the probable reason of two additional static mixers, which create system pressure drop. (3) The temperature of CO2 is very low in low-pressure stage, and the pipes are frosted; When pumping pressure reaches 38MPa, the temperature gradually exceeds 0°C, and the pipes are defrosted. Phase evolution during liquid CO2 fracturing has been identified, and phase control method has been determined. This helps improvethe stability of fluid feeding and sand adding, and enhances the success ratio and stimulation result of fracturing.

Due to the heavy pollution from cars, public transport, including electric bicycles, has been regaining its proper position. A multimodal traffic equilibrium model with emission effects (MTEEE) is presented that considers energy use per person and pollutant emissions. MTEEE is based on a general traffic equilibrium model which jointly reduces congestion and emissions in a multimodal transportation network.

Ambient conditions often change rapidly during operation, making it imperative that the efficiency of the plant cycle be optimized to obtain the maximum power production when sunlight is available. Past analyses have shown that operating the cycle at the critical point provides the optimum efficiency for dry operation. However, operation at this point is challenging due to the dramatic changes in thermophysical properties of CO2 near the critical point and the risk of the fluid having a two-phase, gas-liquid state. As a result, there is a high likelihood that liquid can form upstream of the primary compressor in the sCO2 power cycle. This paper explores the potential for liquid formation when operating near the critical point and looks at the influence of liquid on the compressor performance. The performance impact is based on industry experience with wet gas compression in power generation and oil and gas applications. Options for mitigating liquid effects are also investigated, such as upstream heating, separation, or compressor internal controls (blade surface gas ejection). The conclusions of the paper focus on the risk, estimated impact on performance, and summary of mitigation techniques for liquid CO2 entering a sCO2 compressor.

Although anecdotal evidence suggests that araCParaBAD is leaky in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, neither a thorough analysis of this inducible promoter system in P. aeruginosa nor a concerted effort to identify alternatives with improved functionality has been reported. Here, we evaluated the functionality of the araC-ParaBAD system in P. aeruginosa. Using transcriptional fusions to a lacZ reporter gene, we determined that the noninduced expression from araC-ParaBAD is high and cannot be reduced by carbon catabolite repression as it can in E. coli. Modulating translational initiation by altering ribosome-binding site strength reduced the noninduced activity but also decreased the maximal induced activity and narrowed the induction range. Integrating the inducible promoter system into the posttranscriptional regulatory network that controls catabolite repression in P. aeruginosa significantly decreased the noninduced activity and increased the induction range. In addition to these improvements in the functionality of the araC-ParaBAD system, we found that the lacIq-Ptac and rhaSR-PrhaBAD inducible promoter systems had significantly lower noninduced expression and were inducible over a broader range than araC-ParaBAD. We demonstrated that noninduced expression from the araC-ParaBAD system supported the function of genes involved in antibiotic resistance and tryptophan biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa, problems that were avoided with rhaSR-PrhaBAD. rhaSR-PrhaBAD is tightly controlled, allows gene expression over a wide range, and represents a significant improvement over araC-ParaBAD in P. aeruginosa. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Matrix stimulation and hydraulic fracturing (HF) are two common methods for reservoir stimulation, intended to improve the flow connection of the wellbore with the reservoir and therefore aid flow rate and usually enhance the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery factor - RF. HF is usually the most effective approach to accelerate hydrocarbon production and improve RF in many reservoirs as it can access larger reservoir volumes than other methods, particularly in the case of horizontal wells and multistage HF. HF treatment of horizontal drains is a complex engineering process with large capital investment needs; a 16-well shale gas pad in the United States or Canada can cost $USD 100,000,000 or more. Hence, to mitigate risks of inadequate HF treatment by reducing uncertainty in the design phase, HF design parameters may be better defined through laboratory tests. This study was performed on a series of specimens prepared from specimens of core from an Iranian carbonate gas reservoir. The 400 meters cored interval was first categorized into five geomechanical units (GMU) based on rock texture and fabric. Then, six intact specimens from each GMU were selected, and laboratory hydraulic fracturing tests were performed on three specimens of each GMU at three different confining pressures (5, 10 and 15 MPa). The HF test conditions (confining stress, fluid properties, injection rate and etc.) were identical in order to evaluate the lithology variation impacts, and were not intended to assess differences in viscosity, rate, or other related effects. Brazilian tensile strength tests were conducted on three samples of each GMU. By establishing the relationship between breakdown pressures and confining pressures, the HF tensile strength of each GMU was calculated. Results illustrate that there are meaningful differences between tensile strengths inferred from Brazilian tests and those back-calculated from laboratory HF tests. These differences are larger as a function of the porosity: generally, in high porosity specimens, tensile strength values derived from the HF tests are about 4-5 times higher than from the Brazilian test. Issues of defect size and poroelastic effects are invoked to explain the large differences, although proving this quantitatively remains an elusive goal. It is not apparent what mathematical modeling approach might be used to more rigorously assess the differences quantitatively, but a micromechanics fracture modeling approach based on statistical inference using micro- to core-scale tomographic input or digital micro- to macrofabric maps may allow better incorporation of the fabric elements at various scales.

These sites are popular for visitors, but face many management challenges, including how to adapt to climate change. Often established for biodiversity conservation, scenic beauty, or tourism objectives, protected areas should become a major part of national strategies to address climate change and the disasters that may come in the form of extreme climatic events. Protected areas often contain the ecosystems that are the most effective in storing carbon and make major contributions to adapting to climate change. But these sites need to be managed more effectively, and linking them to the growing public concern about climate change could be one means of doing so. Management approaches that should be supported include establishing protected area complexes that expand their influence to a landscape scale, incorporating climate change issues into protected management at both site and system scales, identify the multiple ecosystem services that protected areas provide as a means of building broader support for them, and many others. Protected areas can also contribute to recovery from extreme hazard events, for example by working with local communities to restore natural vegetation. To date, protected areas have been largely ignored by the Clean Development Mechanism established by the Climate Change Convention. This should change, and protected areas should be recognized for the many contributions they make to climate change mitigation and adaptation, thereby contributing to reducing disaster risks. A relatively simple step would be to incorporate protected area agencies more actively in the preparation of the national reports called for by the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Such digital action invites further examination of supporters’ motivations. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the reported intentions and interests of the Climate Council’s supporters to gain a better understanding of mainstream climate change action in digital spaces. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on a survey that was undertaken by the Climate Council with their Founding Friends that sought to understand their motivations for supporting the institution. The survey received over 10,000 responses. From four selected questions, the paper considers all of the quantitative responses while a random sample of 100 responses was taken from the qualitative data. Findings: The data show that most Climate Council supporters were motivated to maintain an institution that communicates the impacts of climate change while a minority desired more political engagement by the institution. The results capture an example of action with limited conscious activism. Originality/value: Digital spaces fundamentally need the interconnections between people in order to function, in a similar way to physical spaces. Nonetheless, the power of online action, in all its contradictory forms, should not be overlooked in considering the range of possibilities available to those interested in effecting meaningful social change. Even mainstream interventions, as presented in this paper, that seem to disavow climate change activism on the whole, can nevertheless produce institutional changes that defy national governance shifts. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Activism; Climate change; Digital spaces; Social change; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991707545

The current most acute need is the reduction of the noise produced during take-off on aircraft carriers. The on-demand fluidic insert noise reduction method, pioneered at Penn State University, has the potential to be applied on next generation low bypass ratio turbofan aircraft engines. This method introduces fluidic inserts installed in the divergent wall of a CD nozzle that can be used on demand. By altering the configuration and operating conditions of the fluidic inserts, active noise reduction for both mixing and shock noise has been obtained. Substantial noise reductions have been achieved for mixing noise in the maximum noise emission direction and in the forward arc for broadband shock associated noise. A key step in the development of the methodology to ultimately use on aircraft is its extension to industry laboratory size such as that used in the GE Aviation Cell 41 Jet Noise Facility. This report describes the activities of the past year and a half to alter the original “small scale design” for successful application to industry-scale model experiments. Experiments were successfully conducted in the GE Laboratory and noise reductions were achieved that were very comparable to those previously obtained at Penn State.

Although it is recognized that urban carbon governance occurs through diverse programs and projects–involving multiple actors and working through multiple sites, mechanisms, objects, and subjects–surprisingly little attention has been paid to the actual processes through which these diverse elements are drawn together and held together in the exercise of governing. These processes–termed configuration–remain underspecified. This article explores urban carbon governance interventions as relational configurations, excavating how their diverse elements–human, institutional, representational, and material–are assembled, drawn into relation, and held together in the exercise of governing. Through an analysis of two contrasting case studies of urban carbon governance interventions in Sydney, Australia, we draw out common processes of configuring and specific sets of devices and techniques that gather, align, and maintain the relations between actors and elements that constitute intervention projects. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of conceiving of governing projects as relational configurations for how we understand the nature and practice of urban carbon governance, especially by revealing the diverse modes of power at work within processes of configuring. © 2016 by American Association of Geographers.","Devices and techniques; Geographies of urban carbon governance; Governance projects; Relational configurations; Sydney","carbon emission; emission control; governance approach; urban area; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945205720

Areas or zones of higher clay content (such as swelling clays), variable lithology, total organic content variations, and changes in porosity and permeability, all can affect hydrocarbon recovery. These low porosity and permeability reservoirs are now significant hydrocarbon producers so it is crucial to understand their architectural elements and reservoir properties in order to maximize hydrocarbon production. Phase one of this study included 6 wells with whole core across the Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford Shale in South and East Texas (from Karnes to Maverick County). These cores were analyzed and interpreted to determine lithology, sedimentary structures, and parasequences. Eight separate facies along with their depositional environment were interpreted to have been deposited above storm wave base along the inner and outer shelf in a moderate energy environment episodically interrupted by higher energy events, as opposed to a deeper-water setting. Identification of gently inclined lamina and ripple cross laminations provide evidence of significant bedload transport in the form of floccule ripple migration, indicating a depositional environment above storm wave base. Bioturbated marl and laminated marl facies were used to identify flooding surfaces. These flooding surfaces separate upward-coarsening facies from bioturbated and laminated marl facies leading to the identification of parasequences. From this, we built a detailed sequence stratigraphic framework of the Eagle Ford Shale using the identification and correlation of parasequences and parasequences sets. From this work, a basin wide cross-section correlating these 8 facies was constructed using private and public data. This new model is being used to target and geo-steer our wells into the best quality rock, thereby reducing drill time, increasing completions effectiveness, and maximizing production.

It draws on written sources and interviews to analyze the ways in which broad international norms articulated through the REDD+ safeguards, including support for human rights and sustainable livelihoods for local communities, are translated at national, regional, and local levels. Our findings indicate a wide range of perspectives on what constitutes sustainability, from strict conservation to more forest use-oriented strategies, such as community forestry and traditional Mayan shifting cultivation. These visions, in turn, shape what types of REDD+ interventions are considered a good “environmental fit,” i.e., that fit the environmental problems they aim to address. Fits and misfits also occur between institutions, and play a core role in determining whose visions of sustainability prevail. We found a good fit in the case study ejido between REDD+ and the Payment for Ecosystem service (PES) scheme, which sets the parameters for what counts as “sustainable livelihoods” within a strict conservation paradigm. We likewise found a good fit between REDD+ safeguards and institutions supporting local community rights to reject REDD+ projects. However, despite the strength of procedural safeguards, the parameters of the PES scheme constrained the choice of REDD+ activities available, including the possibilities of local people to work on the farm and in the forest, and hence the scope of its distributive benefits. This highlights the important, but also problematic, roles of institutional and environmental “fit” in determining whose rights are safeguarded and what is recognized as a sustainable livelihood strategy. It also calls for more proactive efforts to expand the range of REDD+ activities in ways that safeguard livelihood diversity. © 2016 by the author(s).","Community forest; Free, prior and informed consent (FPIC); Governance; REDD+; Safeguard","community forestry; ecosystem service; forest management; governance approach; nature conservation; sustainability; sustainable development; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Mexico [North America]; Yucatan Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962642623

Recent UN Sustainability Goals and Global Climate Talks to reduce the anthropomorphic Carbon-Dioxide atmospheric concentrations signal a renewed interest and need for nuclear power. The objective of this paper is to present an improved approach to the evaluation of ""Hybrid Nuclear Energy Systems"". A hybrid energy system is defined as an energy system that utilizes two or more sources of energy to be used in single or multiple applications. Traditional single sourced energy or power systems require the amount of energy creation and the production of usable power to be carefully balanced. With the introduction of multiple energy sources, loads, and energy capacitors, the design, simulation, and operation of such hybrid systems requires a new approach to analysis and control. This paper introduces three examples of ""Hybrid Nuclear Energy Systems"", for large scale power, industrial heat, and electricity generation. The system component independence, reliability, availability, and dynamic control aspects, coupled with component operational decisions presents a new way to optimize energy production and availability. Additional novel hybrid hydro-nuclear systems, concentrated solar-nuclear power desalination systems, and nuclear-insitu petroleum extraction systems are compared. The design aspects of such hybrid systems suitable for process heat, electricity generation, and/or desalination applications are discussed. After a multiple-year research study of past hybrid reactor designs and recent system proposals, the following design evaluation approach is the result of analysis of the best concepts discovered. This review of existing literature has summerized that postulated benefits of Hybrid Nuclear Sytems are; reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased energy conversion efficiency, high reliability of electricity supply and consistent power quality, reduced fossil fuel dependence, less fresh water consumption, conversion of local coal or shale into higher value fuels, while lowering the risks and costs. As these proposed hybrid systems are interdisciplinary in nature, they will require a new multidisciplinary approach to systems evaluation. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.","Hybrid reactor design evaluation methodology intrinsic safety simple systems energy capacitor","Availability; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Chemical analysis; Conversion efficiency; Desalination; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy conversion; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen storage; Intelligent buildings; Nuclear energy; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Small nuclear reactors; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Structural design; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Wind power; Atmospheric concentration; Electricity generation; Fresh water consumption; Intrinsic safety; Multi-disciplinary approach; Multiple applications; Nuclear energy systems; Small modular reactors; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002145893

However, both application and removal of these coatings can result in worker and to a lesser extent, general population exposure to toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). As a result, chromium contaminates and emissions are regulated by organizations like OSHA, NIOSH, and the EPA in the United States. Increasing pressure to comply with regulations has led industries that use Cr(VI) to seek more environmentally friendly alternatives. In this work, the feasibility of an environmentally benign electrolytic stripping process for removal of the chrome plate from 4340 steel was demonstrated. The process shows promise for chrome plate removal without formation of Cr(VI) while maintaining the functionality of the steel. Different organic acids were evaluated as candidate electrolytes for the stripping process. The stripping process was demonstrated in a simple oxalic acid electrolyte using samples ranging from 3 cm2 to 100 cm2 at applied potentials of 4 - 6 V. After completely stripping the chrome plate from the steel surface, spectrophotometric analysis of the electrolyte did not detect Cr(VI) in solution. Upon visual inspection, the steel surface after stripping appeared ""smooth and free from pits, nodules, and any other indications of harmful defects"" in accordance with MIL-STD-871B.

This study advocates the contrasting concept of “territory” as essential to spatial justice in community-held forest lands and for effectivity in REDD+ projects. Whereas landscape in REDD+ discourse is a basic unit of resolution for biophysical, especially conservationist, analysis; territory refers to spatial units embedded in tenurial entitlements, and thus in governance and the execution of management. The study critically considers case studies and conceptual approaches in REDD+ and Climate Smart Landscapes projects and their commitment to landscape, or territory, as the spatial governance unit. The review highlights some promising partial steps toward “territorialization” as a good practice, but finds that most do not follow up the implications for governance. The paper asserts that “landscape” as an analytical understanding of forest peoples’ space contains serious defects—it does not set up the essential architecture and mechanisms for social owning and holistic management of designated (forest) space as territory, it does not address the contestations around “whose territory?”, and a “landscape” discourse can obfuscate the actual practice of REDD+ programs. “Territorialization” would involve situating legitimate land users’ rights at the core of REDD+ spatial planning and implementation. “Forest landscapes as territories” would legitimize the entitlements of forest peoples to govern their own lands, with the responsibilities and rewards of their experience of effective management. The community and its social territorial space would become the definitive spatial unit for operationalizing REDD+, rather than the ecological unit or watershed, by prioritizing upwardly institutionalized territory over bio-physical spatializations of landscape. A territorial perspective should shift some power away from global and national policy-setters to local actors (not only registered landowners), as central in REDD+ governance. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","forest governance; indigenous local communities; landscape; Latin America; REDD+; territorialization","community resource management; conceptual framework; deforestation; emission control; environmental degradation; forest management; governance approach; holistic approach; indigenous population; policy implementation; spatial planning; territoriality; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973636317

Coast-down tests were conducted with a modern aerodynamic tractor matched to a conventional 16.2 m (53 ft) dry-van trailer, and outfitted with two drag reduction technologies. Enhanced wind-measurement instrumentation was introduced, consisting of a vehicle-mounted fast-response pressure probe and track-side sonic anemometers that, when used in combination, provided improved reliability for the measurements of wind conditions experienced by the vehicle. Results from the coast-down tests compare well when analyzed using two different techniques: a conventional regression method, and the recently-proposed high-low iteration method. Drag-area results from the the coast-down tests for two vehicle configurations, analyzed with the EPA-proposed high/low iteration method, differ by no more than 3% from the EPA-derived values for a low-yaw range of ±3°yaw. Several modelling assumptions were included in the analysis to account for environmental factors and vehicle-component performance, such as the mechanical drive-line losses, the rolling-resistance speed dependence, and the winds experienced by the vehicle. These models are shown to improve the fidelity of the coast-down analysis, but require further validation for their real-world applicability. Additional considerations for the placement of on-board wind anemometry for improved accuracy of results are discussed.

Such systems are thus inefficient in reducing noise generated by machines, which is a common problem in industrial environment, but also for home/office appliances. Then, the noise source is usually passively isolated by applying a casing with a sound absorbing material. Such passive isolation is, however, inconvenient for low frequencies, for which the walls should be too thick and heavy to be effective. Such walls may also reduce thermal dissipation factor of the casing. The authors have been developing the idea of improving noise isolation of device casings by applying active control of vibrations of the casing walls. For the purpose of control the emission of noise to the environment must be measured, for instance by microphones located around the casing, or some signal highly correlated to the emitted noise must be acquired. Performed research demonstrates that structural sensors measuring vibrations can be used, although, unfortunately, reduction of walls vibrations does not result in sufficient reduction of the noise emission. However, in this paper it is shown that those signals can be used in a Virtual-Microphone Control scheme to estimate acoustic signals at desired locations around the casing, which in turn are considered as the error signals for the active control algorithm. The control system is experimentally verified for a light-weight casing, and obtained results proving its efficiency are reported.",,"Acoustic wave absorption; Active noise control; Microphones; Acoustic signals; Destructive interference; Highly-correlated; Industrial environments; Passive isolation; Sound absorbing materials; Thermal dissipation; Virtual microphone; Acoustic noise",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987862444

Background Social prescribing services for mental healthcare create links with support in the community for people using primary care. Social prescribing services may reduce future healthcare use, and therefore reduce the financial and environmental costs of healthcare, by providing structured psychosocial support. The National Health Service (NHS) is required to reduce its carbon footprint by 80% by 2050 according to the Climate Change Act (2008). This study is the first of its kind to analyse both the financial and environmental impacts associated with healthcare use following social prescribing. The value of this observational study lies in its novel methodology of analysing the carbon footprint of a service at the primary-care level. Method An observational study was carried out to assess the impact of the service on the financial and environmental impacts of healthcare use. GP appointments, psychotropic medications and secondary-care referrals were measured. Findings Results demonstrate no statistical difference in the financial and carbon costs of healthcare use between groups. Social prescribing showed a trend towards reduced healthcare use, mainly due to a reduction in secondary-care referrals compared with controls. The associations found did not achieve significance due to the small sample size leading to a large degree of uncertainty regarding differences. This study demonstrates that these services are potentially able to pay for themselves through reducing future healthcare costs and are effective, low-carbon interventions, when compared with cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants. This is an important finding in light of Government targets for the NHS to reduce its carbon footprint by 80% by 2050. Larger studies are required to investigate the potentials of social prescribing services further. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.","carbon footprint; cost-benefit analysis; environment; mental health; primary healthcare; social prescribing","psychotropic agent; carbon footprint; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; economics; human; mental health service; national health service; organization and management; patient referral; primary health care; United Kingdom; utilization; Carbon Footprint; Community Mental Health Services; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Primary Health Care; Psychotropic Drugs; Referral and Consultation; State Medicine; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014444114

Our hypothesis is that 3 years following entry to a TC service, patients have reduced subsequent health care use and associated reductions in financial costs and carbon footprint. Methods: A retrospective 4-year cohort study examined changes in health care use following entry to the Oxfordshire TC service. Comparative analysis was undertaken on a treated (n = 40) and a control group (referred but who declined treatment; n = 45). Financial costs and carbon footprint of health care use were calculated using national tariffs and standard carbon conversion factors. Mean changes in these outcomes were compared over 1, 2 and 3 years and adjusted for costs and carbon footprints in the year prior to joining the TC service. Results: Compared to baseline, the group receiving TC care had greater reductions in financial costs and carbon footprint associated with A&E attendances (p = 0.04) and crisis mental health appointments (p = 0.04) than the control group. There were significantly greater reductions in carbon footprint for all secondary health care use, both physical and mental health care, after 3 years (p = 0.04) in the TC group. Conclusions: TC services may have the potential to reduce the financial cost and carbon footprint of health care. © 2016 The Author(s).","Carbon footprint; Economic evaluation; Personality disorders; Sustainability","Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; community care; controlled study; cost control; female; health care cost; health care utilization; human; male; mental health; personality disorder; program sustainability; retrospective study; adult; economics; health care cost; Mental Disorders; middle aged; outcome assessment; therapeutic community; Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Retrospective Studies; Therapeutic Community",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991746832

A total of thirty-five lithofacies types were identified, described and interpreted in terms of depositional settings. These different lithofacies represent various shallow-marine environments along the platform transect, from peritidal to offshore areas. The vertical and lateral organization of the lithofacies delineated was caused by the interplay of platform morphology, third-order eustasy and the long-term tectonic evolution of the area. Accordingly, the carbonate system studied is a good example of the influence of large-scale processes on the facies architecture of carbonate platforms. In general, all of the four Transgressive Systems Tracts are characterized by similarity in lithofacies composition and vertical succession and by minor lateral change, indicating only limited influence of the three large-scale factors mentioned on lithofacies development and distribution during transgressions. In contrast, each of the four associated Highstand Systems Tracts comprises an individual (unique) lithofacies assemblage displaying substantial regional and local variation, which indicates that the filling of accommodation space during highstands strongly depended on the extrinsic processes. © 2016, Geological Society of Poland.

One such key global environmental benefit is the anticipated reduction in CO2 emissions and its associated effects on climate change. In recognition, many islands are already pursuing ambitious goals for renewable energy sources integration. The resulting effects of policy on the long-term investment decisions however, need to be better understood. This paper presents a system dynamics simulation model which evaluates the adoption and diffusion of renewable generation sources within an existing island electricity system. In particular, renewable sources within the Azorean island of São Miguel are considered, with findings revealing that the requisite long-term investments are framed by the local experience of the renewable technologies and the pursuit of further renewable integration policy targets. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Island electricity systems; Renewable integration; System dynamics","Climate change; Fossil fuels; Integration; Investments; Large scale systems; System theory; Systems analysis; Adoption and diffusion; Economic and environmental benefits; Environmental benefits; Island electricity systems; Renewable energy source; Renewable integration; System Dynamics; System dynamics simulation; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958074507

Among these factors, nevertheless, ensuring safe operation is a priority: undesired phenomena, such as thermoacoustic instabilities, can have detrimental effects on jet engines, gas turbines and combustors, in general, due to excessive vibrations. It is for this reason that monitoring and design schemes should be able to identify the potential of occurrence of such events. This is a difficult task due to the complexity of the nature of these events. This paper is a preliminary investigation into the performance and characterization of various fuel blends and the examination of the vibration levels expected for different combustion states of a gas turbine engine. We tackle the issue from the perspective of modifying the input to the system (i.e. The fuel composition) in order to investigate nonlinear behavior of the gas turbine engine through the development of a multi-class classification algorithm. Features from a vibration channel for each of the fuel blends were extracted for both classification modelling and cluster analysis.","Cluster analysis; Engine vibration; Feature extraction; Gas turbine engines.; Machine learning and pattern recognition; Support vector machine; Thermoacoustic instability","Aircraft propulsion; Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Combustors; Condition monitoring; Cost engineering; Engines; Feature extraction; Fighter aircraft; Fuels; Gas turbines; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Structural health monitoring; Support vector machines; Thermoacoustic engines; Thermoacoustics; Vibration analysis; Combustion state; Engine vibration; Engineering applications; Fuel compositions; Fuel performance; Multi-class classification; Nonlinear behavior; Thermoacoustic instability; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994708613

Nowadays, renewable energy is the key consideration in the discussion of the sustainable worldwide energy system that reduces global climate change, human health problems, and environmental degradation. Sustainable development requires the sustainable supply of clean and affordable renewable energy. The renewable energy source such as bioenergy, solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, geothermal is usually viewed as sustainable energy sources that drive economic development. Wastes are convertible to useful energy through waste to energy (WtE) technologies. In this study, renewable energy technologies from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and their relation to sustainable development are discussed. Via the application of the simple multi-attribute rating (SMART) technique of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) as a decision support tool, the most preferred model option for WtE technology was selected from a list of potential alternatives available in the market base on environmental, sociocultural, technical and economical consideration.

A population of 380,581 (Census, 2011) living in these group of islands get their electricity demand catered through Diesel Generator Sets from 34 power houses with an aggregate capacity of 67.8 MW. Unavailability of any form of conventional fossil fuel reserves in the islands makes the diesel supplied in barges from southeastern coast of India as a sole lifeline for its power generation. Hence there is an urgent need for the development of a self sustainable model from non conventional energy resources to not only cater for the power demands but also to reduce the GHG emissions related with diesel powered generator sets. This paper discusses a self sustainable model for Andaman and Nicobar Islands that would cater the electrical demand through hydrogen produced from waste biomass resource which has a potential of replacing 86.65% of the diesel utilized in the diesel generator sets. The reduction in both the GHG emission and the cost of power generation would be evaluated to understand the impact of the self sustainable model on the environment and the livelihood of the local population of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. © Applied Science Innovations Pvt.

This objective is transferred to municipalities through the Covenant of Mayors initiative which was established by the European Commission in 2008. In line with this, this paper presents an integration of Sustainable Energy Action Plans on the Croatian island of Korcula. This was developed through a methodology that uses factors, derived from the statistic, that have an influence on the energy consumption. Energy consumption and the Baseline CO2 emissions inventory for municipalities on Korcula in the public sector, households, tertiary sector and road transport are calculated. Total CO2 emissions for listed sectors in baseline 2012 are 42,923 tCO2, and with recommended actions and measures this can be reduced by approx. 22% till 2020. There are planned joint actions, so all municipalities on the island can cooperate together to maximise their limited financial and human capacities. There has been suggested the establishment of action group for actions implementation which will include representatives from municipalities and other stakeholders. Investments for measures in household sector in joint and individual approach was compared and it was concluded that achieving economy of scale with an integrated approach would accelerate their implementation. The integrated approach enables small neighbouring municipalities to develop one strategy and act together towards achieving goals taken by submitting to the Covenant of Mayors.","CO2 emissions inventory; Comparison; Covenant of Mayors; Individual approach; Integrated approach; Island of Korcula",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991694282

However, most of these measures will be fruitful if ship investors (e.g., ship owners and operators) would fully employ the GHG emission reduction strategies. Due to the scarcity of the statistical data in this respect, this study therefore presents a rough set synthetic assessment (RSSA) model to GHG emission abatement strategies in the Tanzanian shipping sector.

But the most important results were obtained for the amount of aluminum used in cans and for CO2 emissions (about -40%). These successes are probably attributable to the awareness and the marketing strategies of brewing companies of larger size (mainly for the ever-increasing use of kegs, which accounts for more environmentally friendly distribution system) while significant margins of improvement remain for microbreweries that represent the real entrepreneurial phenomenon in the beer sector, in both numbers of plants in the area and growth rates. Therefore, in this study we analyze the case of a micro-brewery of Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) Region to understand what may be, for a small private organization, the strengths and weaknesses in the management of the greenhouse gasses emissions. A Life Cycle case study was performed to detect and quantify the organization's carbon footprint deriving from the overall activities of the brewery. Direct and indirect GHGs emissions from 3 high fermentation and 3 low fermentation beers production processes and packaging systems (0.33cL and 0.75cL glass bottles) were considered as well as the emissions related to plant management such as lighting, electric energy, workers mobility and waste treatment. Primary data were collected from a small brewer located in FVG region, secondary data were sourced from literature and databases included in the LCA SimaPro software used to calculate the CF applying the IPCC 2007 GWP 100a method. The organization is the reference unit for the analysis and the basis for defining the system boundaries, within these a carbon footprint of 58.2 t CO2eq was obtained mainly due to direct emissions, i.e. Scope 1, that contribute for 57% to the total GHG emissions of the organization.","Beer; Carbon footprint; LCA; Microbrewery",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028725372

We use complementary simulations to further our understanding of the marine cycle of DMS in subtropical waters, and show that a lack of phosphorus may exert a more important control on surface DMS concentrations than an excess of light. Abstract The occurrence of a summer DMS paradox in the vast subtropical gyres is a strong matter of debate because approaches using discrete measurements, climatological data and model simulations yielded contradictory results. The major conclusion of the first appraisal of prognostic ocean DMS models was that such models need to give more weight to the direct effect of environmental forcings (e.g. irradiance) on DMS dynamics to decouple them from ecological processes. Here, the relative role of light and phosphorus on summer DMS dynamics in subtropical waters is assessed using the ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model NEMO-PISCES in which macronutrient concentrations were restored to monthly climatological data values to improve the representation of phosphate concentrations. Results show that the vertical and temporal decoupling between chlorophyll and DMS concentrations observed in the Sargasso Sea during the summer months is captured by the model. Additional sensitivity tests show that the simulated control of phosphorus on surface DMS concentrations in the Sargasso Sea is much more important than that of light. By extending the analysis to the whole North Atlantic Ocean, we show that the longitudinal distribution of DMS during summer is asymmetrical and that a correlation between the solar radiation dose and DMS concentrations only occurs in the Sargasso Sea. The lack of a widespread summer DMS paradox in our model simulation as well as in the comparison of discrete and climatological data could be due to the limited occurrence of phosphorus limitation in the global ocean. © CSIRO 2016.","global modelling; Sargasso Sea; solar radiation dose.","biogeochemical cycle; chlorophyll; concentration (composition); dimethylsulfide; dose-response relationship; emission; environmental modeling; global ocean; gyre; light effect; phosphorus; solar radiation; stratification; subtropical region; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Sargasso Sea",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961680181

In this line, the technology of geopolymers was born, in which, binders based on alkali-activation can be produced entirely or almost entirely from waste materials. In alkali-activation a source of aluminosilicate is dissolved by a highly alkaline solution previous to precipitation reactions that form a gel binder. The use of alumino-silicate minerals such as metakaolin, blast furnace slag and fly ash to produce alkali-activated cements has been extensively studied and it's increasing the interest in investigating the suitability of using other materials. Different wastes containing silica and alumina, such as hydrated-carbonated cement, glass, fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residues (FCC) have been activated. The aim of this study is to verify if the use of geopolymers is compatible with the manufacturing technology of typical building elements, in this case roof tiles. Mechanical properties of mortars and roof tiles using as source of aluminosilicates FCC have been studied, with different mixtures and variating the proportions of NaOH and waterglass. Compressive strength development was evaluated in mortars cured at 20C for 7 and 28 days and flexural strength, impermeability and impact resistance were evaluated in roof tiles. The results obtained demonstrated the feasibility on the use of geopolymers in the design of new products with less CO2 emissions and then the contribution to the sustainability in the construction sector. © (2016) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Alkali activation; Fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FCC); Roof tiles; Waste","Activated alumina; Aluminosilicates; Aluminum oxide; Binders; Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Cements; Chemical activation; Compressive strength; Construction industry; Cracks; Fly ash; Geopolymers; Inorganic polymers; Mortar; Product design; Roofs; Silica; Silicate minerals; Slags; Sodium hydroxide; Sustainable development; Wastes; Alkali activated cements; Alkali activation; Construction sectors; Fluid catalytic cracking catalyst; Manufacturing technologies; Precipitation reaction; Roof tiles; Scientific community; Fluid catalytic cracking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954151537

Traditionally, cities have focused on cars and other fuel-based vehicles as transport means. However, several problems are directly linked to massive car use, particularly in terms of air pollution and traffic congestion. Several works reckon that vehicle emissions produce over 90% of air pollution. One way to reduce the use of fuel-based vehicles (and thus the emission of pollutants) is to create efficient, easily accessible and secure bike lane networks which, as many studies show, promote cycling as a major mean of conveyance. In this regard, this paper presents an approach to design and calculate bike lane networks based on the use of open data about the historical use of a urban bike rental services. Concretely, we model this task as a network design problem (NDP) and we study four different optimisation strategies to solve it. We test these methods using data of the city of Valencia (Spain). Our experiments conclude that an optimisation approach based on genetic programming obtains the best performance. The proposed method can be easily used to improve or extend bike lane networks based on historic bike use data in other cities. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

Compared with terrestrial ecosystems, coastal vegetation shows higher rates of atmospheric CO2 uptake and a more efficient retention of carbon (C) in sediments. Salt marshes present the highest values as C binders, although a global estimation of these values is still pending due to regional gaps in the records predominantly from the southern hemisphere. There are no clear patterns or dominant processes with enough evidence to account for the observed variability, suggesting that context dependent processes are likely greatest influencers on C storage. Salt marshes in the South West Atlantic (SWA) coast are densely populated by the intertidal burrowing and herbivore crab Neohelice (= Chasmagnathus) granulata. Many ecological processes related to C transformation occurring in these salt marshes are influenced by crab activities, either through bioturbation or via herbivory. We hypothesize that N. granulata could have a significant role in the capacity of SWA salt marshes to bind C. Reduction of plant biomass, increased aerobic decomposition in the sediment and facilitation of erosion are some of the multiple effects exerted by N. granulata that can directly and indirectly modify the capacity of salt marshes to bind C. Here, we compiled information available regarding C sequestration and accumulation in SWA coastal salt marshes and propose a hypothetical model including the mechanisms mediated by N. granulata that interfere the transformation paths of C in salt marshes. The data suggest that mechanisms that are top-down regulated, negatively affect C accumulation in the form of aboveground biomass especially in salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora. While, mechanisms mediated by bioturbation can negatively (increasing oxygenation and thus facilitating aerobic degradation) affect as well as positively (increasing retention of macrodetritus) affect the accumulation of C, the latter being of greater magnitude in Spartina densiflora salt marshes. © 2016 Martinetto, Montemayor, Alberti, Costa and Iribarne.","Bioturbation; Blue C; Coastal vegetation; Herbivory; Salt marshes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008616018

Reducing engine weight is supporting this targe and one option to reduce weight is to reduce the overall engin length (shorter shafts, nacelle). However, to achieve a reductio in engine length, the spacing between stator and rotor can b minimised, thus changing the rotor blade excitation. Related t the axial spacing, a number of excitation mechanisms wit respect to the rotor blading must already be considered durin the design process. Based on these facts several setups hav been investigated at different engine relevant operating point and axial spacing between the stator and rotor in the subsoni test turbine facility (STTF-AAAI) at the Institute for Therma Turbomachinery and Machine Dynamics at Graz University o Technology. In order to avoid upstream effects of supportin struts, these struts are located far downstream of the stag which is under investigation. For rotor blade vibratio measurements, a novel telemetry system in combination wit strain gauges is applied. To the best of the author's knowledge the present paper is the first report of blade vibratio measurements within a rotating system in the area of lo pressure turbines under engine relevant operating conditions. I addition, aerodynamic measurements including unsteady flo measurements have been conducted, but will not be presente in this paper. By analysing the flow field, aerodynami excitation mechanisms can be identified and assigned to th blade vibration. However, this is not presented in this paper Within this paper, the flow fields are analysed in both upstrea and downstream of the turbine stage, visualised for two axia gaps and then compared to the forced response of the blading Detailed structural dynamic investigations show critical mode during the operation which are identified by the telemetr measurements as well. Finally the influence of the axial spacin regarding the rotor blade excitation and vibration can b elaborated and is prepared to get a better understanding of basi mechanisms.

The prepared Co2Mo3O8/rGO composite was characterized using a multitude of characterization techniques, which confirmed the formation of the composite. Electron micrographs clearly showed that the composite consisted of submicron sized (lateral) and 50 nm thick hierarchical hexagonal nanoplatelets of Co2Mo3O8 attached to thin graphene layers of rGO. Raman scattering analysis not only confirmed the presence of Co2Mo3O8 and rGO in the composite but also revealed that the defects present in rGO are more than that in GO. Through thermogravimetric analysis, the amount of rGO present in the composite was found to be ∼22% by weight. Co 2p, Mo 3d, C 1s and O 1s X-ray photoelectron energy peaks were clearly identified. The analysis of these peaks confirmed the oxidation states of the respective elements in stoichiometric Co2Mo3O8. The as-synthesized Co2Mo3O8/rGO composite was tested as an anode material in half-cell configured lithium ion batteries. When cycled at 60 mA g-1 current density and in the 0.005-3.0 V range, the Co2Mo3O8/rGO composite delivered an excellent reversible specific capacity of ∼954 mA h g-1 that corresponds to 82% capacity retention at the end of the 60th cycle, which is higher than the theoretical capacity of both Co2Mo3O8 and graphene. Moreover, the Co2Mo3O8/rGO composite exhibited excellent rate capability. A reversible specific capacity of 471 mA h g-1 (at a current density of 1000 mA g-1) was delivered at the end of the 31st cycle. The value increased to 1006 mA h g-1 when the current density was switched to 100 mA g-1 at the end of the 36th cycle. Redox peaks in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves revealed that electrochemical conversion and electrochemical adsorption and desorption type reaction mechanism are the primary reasons for lithium ion storage. A constant area under the CV curves throughout the tests was noticed, which is an indication of the stable capacity while the CV results are in line with the galvanostatic cycling (GC) results. From the CV and GC results, it is concluded that the higher specific capacity, longer cycle life, and better rate capability are due to the excellent synergy between Co2Mo3O8 and rGO in the composite. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Current density; Cyclic voltammetry; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Graphene; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Molybdenum oxide; Secondary batteries; Thermogravimetric analysis; Characterization techniques; Electrochemical adsorption; Electrochemical conversion; Galvanostatic cycling; Reversible specific capacity; Solid state reduction; Theoretical capacity; X-ray photoelectrons; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974588497

In contrast to its phylogenetically close relatives, which are dissimilatory sulfate-reducers, T. dismutans is unable to grow by sulfate respiration. The features of this organism and its 2,1 Mb draft genome sequence are described in this report. Genome analysis revealed that the T. dismutans genome contains the set of genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction including ATP sulfurylase, the AprA and B subunits of adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase, and dissimilatory sulfite reductase. The oxidation of elemental sulfur to sulfite could be enabled by APS reductase-associated electron transfer complex QmoABC and heterodisulfide reductase. The genome also contains several membrane-linked molybdopterin oxidoreductases that are thought to be involved in sulfur metabolism as subunits of thiosulfate, polysulfide, or tetrathionate reductases. Nitrate could be used as an electron acceptor and reduced to ammonium, as indicated by the presence of periplasmic nitrate and nitrite reductases. Autotrophic carbon fixation is enabled by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, and the complete set of genes that is required for nitrogen fixation is also present in T. dismutans. Overall, our results provide genomic insights into energy and carbon metabolism of chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-disproportionating bacterium that could be important primary producer in microbial communities of deep-sea hydrothermal vents. © 2016 Mardanov, Beletsky, Kadnikov, Slobodkin and Ravin.","Genome sequence; Sulfur disproportionation; Thermodesulfobacteria; Thermophile; Thiosulfate","Article; controlled study; genetic heterogeneity; genome analysis; microbial community; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; organisms by electron donor; pH; phylogeny; sequence analysis; signal transduction; sulfur bacterium; temperature; thermophilic bacterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980017948

The apartments' owners are both IPES, the local Institute for Social housing of South Tyrol, and some cooperatives. The approach adopted during the district's design phase included the urban planning concept, the energy concept and the architectural competitions for individual lots. The urban planning concept was developed by an interdisciplinary team coordinated by Frits van Dongen from Amsterdam. The team planned the construction of the eight ""castles"", namely a built-up area consisting of three or four buildings placed around a shared green space. The energy concept includes three main objectives: (1) reducing the energy needs for heating, (2) rationalizing the use of traditional energy sources and (3) using renewable energy sources. In order to achieve such objectives, the concept was based on two levels. The first level was focused on the connection of the buildings to a district heating system with heat recovery from an incinerator. The second level defined guidelines on energy requirements for each lots. The CasaNova district was also included within the campaign ""Sustainable Energy Europe (SEE)"" promoted in Italy by the Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea. The City, the Province and the district itself were considered as good examples of implementation of energy efficiency and use of renewable sources to reduce CO2 emissions, at national level. As a concrete action within the partnership with the Italian Ministry of Environment, The European Academy of Bozen/Bolzano (EURAC) monitored the actual energy performance of the district, in the context of the implementation of the SEE campaign. The whole monitoring campaign was aimed to assess both the actual energy performance of buildings, comparing them with the design values (potential), and the level of indoor comfort in some sample apartments analyzed using different parameters such as the air quality, temperature and humidity. Monitoring results showed that the buildings have total primary energy consumptions very different from each other (ranging from 79 kWh/m2y to 172 kWh/m2y), and with a meaningful gap compared with the predicted ones, as calculated in the design phase, reaching in some cases values more than double (+167%). According to EURAC evaluation, the main cause of this issue has been identified in tenants' behavior, especially on their non-optimal use and maintenance of the building and facilities. The paper shows how the buildings with simpler constructive solutions consume less energy than the complex ones. This difference, is mainly due to the difficulties encountered by the tenants on managing complex technologies in their flat, especially on mechanical ventilation. Indeed, the implementation of these technologies requires behavioral changes on those lodgers accustomed to live in the ""classic"" Italian house.","Monitoring results; nZEB; Occupant behavior effects","Air quality; Apartment houses; Architectural design; Buildings; Construction; District heating; Energy utilization; Heating; Renewable energy resources; Structural design; Urban planning; Ventilation; Waste heat; Zoning; Architectural competition; Energy performance of buildings; Ministry of environments; Monitoring results; nZEB; Occupant behavior; Renewable energy source; Temperature and humidities; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006375436

The growing request for greenhouse gas emission reduction imposes to consider the use of alternative fuels with the aim of both partially replacing the diesel fuel and reducing the fossil fuel consumption. To this purpose, the use of ABE (Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol) fermentation could represent an effective solution. Even if the different properties of alcohols compared to Diesel fuel limit the maximum blend concentration, low blend volume fractions can be used for improving combustion efficiency and exhaust emissions. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the different fuel properties on the combustion evolution within the combustion chamber of a prototype optically accessible compression ignition engine. N-butanol was investigated as the predominant product of ABE fermentation (60%) and for its properties closer to diesel if compared with acetone and ethanol. Ethanol was examined for its highest oxygen content (34.8 % wt) that may contribute to the post-oxidation with the potential to make local leaner mixtures because of the longer ignition delay. 2D chemiluminescent emission measurements during the whole combustion process were carried out using an Intensified Charge-Coupled Device (ICCD) camera coupled with two different bandpass filters: the first one centered at 310 nm, corresponding to the (0,0) transition of OH, the latter centered at 690 nm, representative of soot emission. Tests were carried out comparing combustion and emissions of the reference commercial diesel fuel to a blend of 60%v diesel and 40%v n-butanol (BU40) and 60%v diesel, 20%v n-butanol and 20%v ethanol (BU20E20). A single injection strategy was set, with a sweep on the start of injection (SOI). For the diesel case, the whole amount of injected fuel and injection pressure were set at 22 mg/str and 80 MPa, respectively, corresponding to a medium load regime for an automotive light duty diesel engine. For any investigated blend and operating point, engine tests were carried out changing the injection interval to achieve the same chemical energy as the reference diesel (935 J/str). Both investigated alcohol blends provided a significant increase in induction time, enhancing the air/fuel mixing with a simultaneous reduction of both Particulate Matter (PM) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx). The UV-visible digital imaging and 2D chemiluminescence highlighted a change in combustion mechanism as pointed out by integral OH signal evolution: two OH peaks are more evident when switching from diesel to alcohol blends suggesting a double stage combustion process with a wide premixed combustion before the diffusion controlled stage. The simultaneous use of ethanol and n-butanol further prolonged the ignition delay with a slight decrease in energy content compared to n-butanol diesel blend. Moreover the higher oxygen content of BU20E20 improved the soot post-oxidation with a consequent benefit on PM-NOx trade off. © 2016 SAE International.",,"Acetone; Alternative fuels; Bandpass filters; Blending; Charge coupled devices; Chemiluminescence; Combustion chambers; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Engine cylinders; Ethanol; Fermentation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Soot; Acetone butanol ethanols; Chemiluminescent emissions; Combustion efficiencies; Compression ignition engine; Experimental investigations; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Intensified charge coupled devices; Light-duty diesel engines; Ignition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072367288

The spatial distribution of the tree in the administrative Region (Abruzzo) was used to define the ecological traits while three modelling techniques (GLM, GAM, Random Forest) were used to build a Species distribution model according to two climatic scenarios. Main results: The marginal population’s range was predicted to shift at higher elevations as consequence of climatic adaptation. Many zones, represented by the higher part of the mountains surrounding the study area (currently bare and inhospitable for trees), were identified as suitable in future for the species. However, in the case of a rapid climate change, this marginal population may not be able to move as fast as necessary. An in-situ adaptive management integrated with an assisted migration protocol might be considered to favour natural regeneration and improve the richness and variability of the genetic pool.

Scale up modeling results suggest annual CH4 emissions of 1697 Gg from ≈ 4600 gathering facilities and 506 Gg of CH4 emissions from ≈ 600 Subpart KKK processing plants. The total rate of CH4 loss from gathering and processing is 0.47% when normalized by 2012 annual production. CH4 loss during gathering and process is equivalent to the annual natural gas consumption from 3.2 million US homes and has a value of $390 million. Estimated CH4 loss from processing plants is less than EPA GHGI (891 Gg) but higher than EPA GHGRP (179 Gg). Observations from field campaign suggest that emissions can be reduced from gathering by incorporating systems and/or practices to quickly identify and repair high emitting facilities.

However, the smallest electrode projection area Ap for using the strategy is limited to 0.1 mm2 and maximum pulse current 3A, possibly due to the pulse re-opening phenomenon. In this work, using a novel generator circuit, pulse re-openings have been restricted up to pulse durations 100 μs and a current of 1A. Hence, the performance of conventional electrode materials is evaluated in order to push the limits of the low wear strategy. However, when using graphite and copper infiltrated graphite microelectrodes, bending of the electrodes is observed, especially in the tip region. The simulation of temperature in the microelectrodes suggests abnormal carbonaceous build up process. This explanation is also concurrent to the observation of a process instability resulting in irreproducible electrode wear behaviour. For copper microelectrodes, another phenomenon is observed where overcuts are produced in the eroded cavities. These overcuts are produced by sparks with high discharge voltage. Sliding of the plasma channel from the electrode corners to the side surfaces is proposed to cause such discharges and overcuts. Thus, underlying mechanisms limiting the low wear strategy in micro-EDM are identified. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this research, the effect of multiple injection and air injection on combustion and emission parameters has been studied by AVL fire computational fluid dynamic software. Six states of base and modified combustion chamber have been studied in two different injection patterns including 90 (25) 10 and 75 (25) 25 mods. Results show that concurrent applying of both multiple injection and air injection methods has resulted in simultaneous reduction of oxide nitrogen and soot pollutants and a negligible loss is seen in the operational parameters of engine. Compression between six studied cases show that the 90 (25) 10 mode of injection with modified combustion chamber is the optimum mode by decreasing of soot and oxides of nitrogen emissions about 29% and 20% respectively and 6% indicated power loss in compression to the base combustion chamber and single injection mode.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the safety climate measures that have been evaluated for their psychometric properties in a German-speaking country and to make recommendations on how to use them in quality and patient safety improvement. Methods A systematic search strategy was implemented to obtain relevant articles. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched, and 128 abstracts were identified. After application of limits, 33 full texts were retrieved for subsequent evaluation. Studies were included on the basis of predetermined inclusion criteria and independent assessment by two reviewers. Publications were reviewed concerning healthcare setting, target group, safety culture dimensions covered and results of their psychometric evaluation. Results This review identified 11 instruments for safety climate assessment in different healthcare settings (i. e. hospitals, nursing homes, primary care, dental care and community pharmacy) for which acceptable to good internal consistency was reported. We observed wide variability concerning the number of dimensions (1 to 14; in some cases including outcome dimensions) and items (9 to 128) that the instruments were comprised of. Nevertheless, consistency with regard to the thematic areas covered was rather high. Discussion and conclusion While there is clear evidence that we can assess safety climate in healthcare, the application of safety climate measures by quality and patient safety practitioners has so far been rather limited. This review bridges this gap between research and improvement practice by highlighting the central role of safety climate assessment in a mixed methods approach to inform safety culture development. © 2016","instrument; Measurement; patient safety; psychometric evaluation; safety climate; safety culture","climate; clinical study; dental procedure; doctor patient relation; human; internal consistency; Medline; nursing home; patient safety; pharmacy; plant development; primary medical care; publication; speech; Web of Science; Germany; organizational culture; psychometry; questionnaire; safety; Germany; Humans; Organizational Culture; Psychometrics; Safety Management; Surveys and Questionnaires",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995584203

To thoroughly understand sea surface salinity's connection to processes that define the hydrological cycle, such as surface forcing and ocean mixing, there is need for proper validation of remotely sensed salinity products with independent measurements, beyond central tendencies, across the entire distribution of salinity. Because of its fine spatial and temporal coverage, Aquarius presents an ideal measurement system for fully characterizing the distribution and properties of sea surface salinity. Using the first 33 months of Aquarius, version 3.0, level 2 sea surface salinity data, both central tendencies and distributional quantile characteristics across time and space are investigated, and a statistical validation of Aquariusmeasurements with Argo in situ observations is conducted. Several aspects are considered, including regional characteristics and temporal agreement, as well as seasonal differences by ocean basin and hemisphere. Regional studies examine the time and space scales of variability through time series comparisons and an analysis of quantile properties. Results indicate that there are significant differences between the tails of their respective distributions, especially the lower tail. The Aquarius data show longer, fatter lower tails, indicating higher probability to sample low-salinity events. There is also evidence of differences in measurement variation between Aquarius and Argo.

Of course, this has not always been the case. Here, we analyse for the first time the key developments in network coordination and standardisation over the last 150 years that underpin the current implementations of city-scale to global monitoring networks for atmospheric composition. Examples include improvements in respect of site type and site representativeness, measurement methods, quality assurance, and data archiving. From the 1950s, these developments have progressed through two distinct types of network: those designed for the protection of human health, and those designed to increase scientific understanding of atmospheric composition and its interaction with the terrestrial environment. The step changes in network coordination and standardisation have increased confidence in the comparability of measurements made at different sites. Acknowledged limitations in the current state of monitoring networks include a sole focus on compliance monitoring. In the context of the unprecedented volumes of atmospheric composition data now being collected, we suggest the next developments in network standardisation should include more integrated analyses of monitor and other relevant data within ""chemical climatology"" frameworks that seek to more directly link the impacts, state and drivers of atmospheric composition. These approaches would also enhance the role of monitoring networks in the development and evaluation of air pollution mitigation strategies. © 2016 by the authors.","Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Chemical climatology; Chronology; Data interpretation; Historical development; Monitoring networks","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Chemical analysis; Climatology; Quality assurance; Standardization; Air quality monitoring; Chronology; Data interpretation; Ground-based monitoring; Historical development; Monitoring network; Terrestrial environments; United Nations Environment Programme; Monitoring; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; chronology; climatology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007394310

This work evaluates the net positive effect of valorizing residual biomass in the context of a rural area of Portugal, Estremoz. It focuses on the combined assessment of biomass availability, techno-economic feasibility and environmental aspects of utilizing forest and agricultural residues to produce bioheat. At first, the energy potential of the residual biomass available in the municipality is evaluated using a geographical information system database. The assessment with RETScreen of the techno-economic feasibility of replacing electricity by biomass for heating local public schools follows. The results show that around 27 314 t of residues, corresponding to about 267 680 GJ, are produced each year in Estremoz, more than half in montado areas. The use of this biomass for the replacement of the existing electric heating systems of nine local schools by biomass-based ones offers good project profitability. As far as the environment is concerned, the energetic valorization of the residual biomass in Estremoz has multiple benefits. It contributes to climate change mitigation by saving greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the preservation of the traditional extensive uses of the ecosystems. Moreover, a correct vegetation management decreases the fire risk, potentiates the increase in biodiversity, offers better conditions for native species and allows to maintain the ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The technology is seen by many as the next step in the development of fossil fuel heating systems. It can considerably increase the energy efficiency and usage of renewable energy sources while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with current state-of-the-art. With expected net decarbonisation of gas grid by increasing biogas production and development of power-to-gas concepts, the FSHP, especially gas-fired heat pumps, may further gain in importance. Presently, vapour compression heat pumps are dominating the heat pump market. However, in gas and/or oil dominating heating markets, FSHP can rapidly improve the carbon footprint of heating systems, especially in the retrofit segment which makes around three quarters of the overall heating market. A number of products are offered by different manufacturers with more expected to enter the market in the short to mid-term period. Still, there are several challenges the technology is currently facing, both technical and non-technical. The paper provides results of a comprehensive simulation study of the future German energy system with emphasis on the role of gas-fired heat pumps (GHP) as part of the solution to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It gives an overview of current market products and on-going development work.

The current research objective was to determine the gompertz kinetics of SMB in response of predictive variables; 5, 10, 15 and 20% lignin, used to reinforce the urea-crosslinked starch (UcS) films in aerobic soil. Through gompertz kinetics, the specific growth rate (μmax), lag phase (λ), asymptote (A) and inflection (ti) of growth curve were determined for SMB. The results of the study showed that gompertz kinetic predicted reasonably a good agreement between the experimental and predicted soil microbial biomass (R2 &gt; 0.942; Error Mean Square, 0.010-0.089) for all lignin reinforced UcS films in aerobic soil. The value of A was 13.39% higher in soil added with lignin reinforced UcS films than the control film. The average μmax of lignin reinforced UcS films was achieved 3.59 day-1 which was approximately 9.10% less than μmax observed in control film. The average λ was delayed 76.69% more in lignin reinforced UcS films possible due to the lignin's recalcitrant nature to biodegradation by microorganisms. The ti was found 39.53% higher for the lignin reinforced UcS films. The higher oxidation state and higher standard enthalpy of combustion of the UcS increase by addition of the lignin which could cause the higher carbon to microbial biomass conversion. These results predicted by gompertz kinetics have demonstrated the implication of lignin to use in biopolymer films of low enthalpy of combustion (starch) in order to increase the carbon conversion into the microbial biomass rather than rapid conversion into the CO2. © 2016 The Authors.","Aerobic microcosm; Biodegradability; Gompertz kinetics; Soil microbial biomass; Urea-crosslinked starch","Bioconversion; Biodegradability; Biodegradation; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Carbon films; Combustion; Crosslinking; Ecology; Enthalpy; Growth kinetics; Kinetics; Metabolism; Process engineering; Reinforcement; Soils; Starch; Urea; Aerobic microcosm; Carbon conversions; Cross-linked starch; Environmental conditions; Predictive variables; Research objectives; Soil microbial biomass; Specific growth rate; Lignin; Biodegradability; Soil; Starch; Urea",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013975244

Policy efforts in the past decades have resulted in technical improvements of the dwelling stock, but despite that, the energy consumption in the residential sector has not yet experienced a dramatic reduction necessary to achieve the set targets. In order to reduce the consumption of the dwelling stock, the European Commission implemented The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), which requires the member states to establish certification schemes for existing buildings. The Netherlands implemented energy labelling in 2008 and based the calculation of dwellings theoretical energy performance on a steady state method. Besides the indication of the label category (A++ to G), the certificate consists of the floor area, the type of dwelling and building related energy use (excluding the appliances), expressed in gas, electricity, heat and the total primary energy consumption. Since the theoretical gas and electricity consumption is portrayed on the front page of the Dutch energy label certificate as 'standard energy use of the dwelling' it became widely used as an indication of consumption and even included in policy goals. Since the dwelling quality has been steadily improving, the primary reason for the reduction failure is the increasing demand from the side of the occupants. In response to that, the thesis stresses the occupant behaviour factor as crucial in actual energy consumption, accounting for as much as 50% of the variance in heating consumption. In order to improve existing policies and achieve real reduction, the occupant behaviour and its impacts on actual energy consumption needs to be understood better. This thesis attempts to shine a light onto how well the theoretical consumption predicts the actual energy use and what the causes of discrepancies are, especially with regard to occupant behaviour. Namely, whether the mentioned reduction potential is realized, strongly depends on the actual energy use of the dwellings. Furthermore, the thesis explores what reductions can realistically be achieved by improving the thermal performance of the dwelling stock and whether or not these match the expectations of policy makers. The research used several large datasets, about dwellings theoretical energy performance, most of which were related to energy label certificates. All the datasets containing theoretical performance were merged with actual energy data. In addition to that, some were also enriched with socioeconomic and behaviour related data from Statistics Netherlands (CBS) or from surveys which were designed for the purpose of this research. Simple descriptive statistics were used to compare average theoretical and actual consumptions. Advanced statistical tests were used for detecting correlations, followed by several regression analyses. In a separate scenario study, the resulting averages of both theoretical and actual consumptions were extrapolated nation-wide in order to be compared with the existing policy targets. Due to low predictive power of the variables in regression analyses, a sensitivity analysis of the theoretical gas use was performed on six assumptions made in the theoretical calculation to show how an increment in one of the assumptions affects the final theoretical gas consumption and whether this can explain the performance gap. Last but not least, longitudinal data of the social housing dwelling stock between 2010 and 2013 was analysed, focusing on dwellings that had undergone renovation. The goal was to find out whether the theoretical reduction of consumption materialised and to what extent. A comparison of the actual reduction of different renovation measures was made in order to show what renovation practices lower the consumptions most effectively.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988963343

Several sensitivity studies are completed to quantify the percentage contributions of local emissions versus regional emissions to the PM2.5 concentrations under different weather conditions. The results indicate that the contributions from local emission is higher than those of the emissions from regional transport when there is no intrusion of cold front (i.e., 58% contribution from local emission versus 42% contribution from the regional transport). The contribution of regional transport is increased to 76% when a strong cold front appears.

In line with GASCO emissions reduction strategy, LEC/DLN conversion study of a Habshan power generation berth 80G-105 Frame-6B Gas Turbine was launched as a Pilot. Accordingly, a detailed scope of work was prepared to initiate the retrofit on a turnkey basis. The thorough design review, HAZOP and SIL studies have produced a robust system which includes: LEC Combustion Components, New Fuel Gas Heater and Filter Skids, New Inlet Bleed Heat System, New Fuel Gas Splitter Valve Skid, Flame Detectors and Igniters Replacement and Modifications of the Control System. With successful implementation of LEC conversion, first retrofit within ADNOC OPCOs, NOx has been reduced from 161 ppmvd to 9 ppmvd (94% Reduction, 575 Tons/Year) whereas CO from 127 ppmvd to 05 ppmvd (96% reduction, 283 Tons/Year). Above reduced emission levels are well below the boundary set by Abu Dhabi Environment Agency for NOx & CO upto 35 & 400 ppmvd respectively. In addition to the remarkable reduction in NOx/CO emissions, the new installed LEC combustion components are of extended life, therefore eliminating the existing combustion inspection every 12,000 Hours saving 10 days shutdowns every one life cycle (48,000-60,000 Hours). The LEC conversion project presents a unique example of encompassing an innovative approach to achieve tangible environment protection through using improved technology. Further to the implementation of the project, the rewards thus achieved with clean environment are perpetual.

Out of a total of 574 radio-selected AGN, 40% are found to have a counterpart in Herschel maps. The percentage is maximum in the GOODS-North (72%) and minimum (36%) in COSMOS, where FIR observations are shallower. Our study shows that in all cases FIR emission is associated to star-forming activity within the host galaxy. Such an activity can even be extremely intense, with star-forming rates as high as 103104 MΘyr-1. AGN activity does not inhibit star formation in the host galaxy, just as on-site star-formation does not seem to affect AGN properties, at least those detected at radio wavelengths and for z &gt; 1. Given the very high rate of FIR detections, we stress that this refers to the majority of the sample: most radio-Active AGN are associated with intense episodes of star-formation. However, the two processes proceed independently within the same galaxy, at all redshifts but in the local universe, where powerful enough radio activity reaches the necessary strength to switch off the on-site star formation. Our data also show that for z&gt; 1 the hosts of radio-selected star-forming galaxies and AGN are indistinguishable from each other both in terms of mass and IR luminosity distributions. The two populations only differentiate in the very local universe, whereby the few AGN which are still FIR-Active are found in galaxies with much higher masses and luminosities.",,"FIR filters; Galaxies; Luminance; Surveys; Forming rate; High rate; Host galaxies; Luminosity distributions; Radio wavelengths; Red shift; Star formations; Star forming galaxy; Stars",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988805155

The girth and height of plants ⩾5 cm dbh were measured to estimate biomass carbon stocks of each individual tree. GPS coordinates of each individual tree were taken for spatial mapping. Urban green spaces were extracted from Satellite view of Google Earth for a decade using screen digitizing techniques. A total of 722 individuals, comprising 95 plant species belonging to 75 genera and 33 families, were recorded. Of the total species 45% were native species. The above-ground and below-ground biomass were estimated to be 50 (t C/ha) and 10 (t C/ha) respectively. These results are comparable with above-ground biomass and below-ground biomass in the dry zone forest (60 and 17 (t C/ha) respectively).

This raises the possibility of non-linear response of particle-phase OA mass to the emissions of precursor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to this partitioning mass. Implications for air quality management are evident: a strong non-linear dependence would suggest that reductions in VOC emission would have a more-than-proportionate benefit in lowering ambient OA concentrations. Chamber measurements on simple VOC mixtures generally confirm the non-linear scaling between OA and VOCs, usually stated as a mass-dependence of the measured OA yields. However, for realistic ambient conditions including urban settings, no single component dominates the composition of the organic particles, and deviations from linearity are presumed to be small. Here we re-examine the linearity question using volatility spectra from several sources: (1) chamber studies of selected aerosols, (2) volatility inferred for aerosols sampled in two megacities, Mexico City and Paris, and (3) an explicit chemistry model (GECKO-A). These few available volatility distributions suggest that urban OA may be only slightly super-linear, with most values of the normalized sensitivity exponent in the range 1.1-1.3, also substantially lower than seen in chambers for some specific aerosols. The rather low exponents suggest that OA concentrations in megacities are not an inevitable convergence of non-linear effects, but can be addressed (much like in smaller urban areas) by proportionate reductions in emissions. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978945250

To quantify the thermal performance and energy efficiency of green roofs an experimental investigation was done in residential buildings of Madurai, Tamilnadu, India. This paper refers to the analysis of the thermal properties and indoor thermal performance study of the green roof.

Results showed vegetative roofs reduced heat gain compared to the white reflective roofs and conventional reinforced cement concrete due to the thermal mass, extra insulation, and evapo-transpiration associated with the vegetative roofing systems.

Climatic and topographic models predict that the Atlantic Forest regions of southern Brazil are favorable for the establishment of invasive bullfrog populations. The predicted increase of temperature and concentration of gases associated with the greenhouse effect will augment the vulnerability of protected areas of the Atlantic forest to bullfrog invasions in the coming years. In this study we investigated to what extent protected areas of the Atlantic Forest surrounded by anthropogenic landscapes are vulnerable to bullfrog invasions. We conducted surveys in 36 waterbodies located either in a protected area or in anthropogenically modified adjacent locations on a forest-edgeagriculture gradient. We collected data on abundance and breeding to identify the main descriptors (local and landscape variables) that explain the distribution of bullfrogs along this gradient. The variance partitioning analysis showed a strongest association of bullfrog abundance with local waterbody descriptors (area-depth-hydroperiod) and secondarily with a forest-edge-agriculture gradient, i.e., the landscape. The observed distribution pattern suggests that protected areas are likely to be invaded by bullfrogs. Therefore, management strategies should focus on both scales: landscape and waterbody. Supervising the construction of large (permanent or deep) waterbodies in edge habitats of the park and adjacent areas can be effective and agriculture and forest management could importantly complement the prevention of invasions. © 2016, Academia Sinica.

The hybrid fibers possess very high surface area (254.6 m2 g-1) and a hierarchically porous nanostructure. A flexible solid-state SC was assembled using the hybrid fiber, which exhibited high capacitance (97.5 F cm-3), excellent cycling stability (95.9% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles), superior energy density (2.8 mW h cm-3) and ultrahigh power density (1200 mW cm-3). Its physical shape and electrochemical performance is also very well maintained under long-time periodic mechanical deformation that is particularly promising for wearable electronic devices. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Capacitance; Capacitors; Carbon black; Fibers; Flexible electronics; Graphene; Porous materials; Wearable technology; Capacitance retention; Electrochemical performance; Hierarchically porous; Hierarchically porous carbons; High surface area; Mechanical and electrical properties; Mechanical deformation; Wet-spinning method; Spinning (fibers)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973570733

The investigation shows that a kind of novel BLin-CO2 (n = 2-6) complex (In) with bidentate double oxygen M(η2-O2C) coordination is obtained through the bimetal 2Li of BLin clusters binding to the two O atoms of CO2, and the structural integrities of BLin clusters are not destroyed. We find that the partial negative charge transfer from BLin to the π∗ orbital of CO2 leads to weakening of the CO bonds of CO2 and an active CO2 moiety, except for when n = 2. Further, we perform reactions between In (n = 3-6) and benzene to elucidate a novel alternative approach to direct carboxylation by inserting CO2 into C-H bonds. We find that the carboxylation of the C-H bond of benzene can be achieved through the transition states (TS) of C-C bond formation and H-atom-transfer from C to O via two H2O molecules acting as a H-transfer tunnel. Comparing the transition states of H-direct transfer and one H2O molecule assisting H transfer, two H2O molecules assisting H-transfer as a tunnel is shown to lower the barrier, due to this long H-bond bridge effectively easing the rotation of the dihedral angle between the C6H6 and CO2 moiety planes. Considering the whole free energy profile, BLi5 and BLi6 clusters are more feasible for the carboxylation of C-H bonds. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Benzene; Carboxylation; Charge transfer; Chemical activation; Coordination reactions; Dihedral angle; Free energy; Molecules; C-C bond formation; Direct transfer; Energy profile; H-atom transfer; Lithium clusters; Negative charge; Theoretical investigations; Transition state; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986578222

We also argue that the substantial heterogeneity in abatement cost estimates could be related to an economic interpretation that radial measures reflect the short-run MACs while non-radial measures reflect the longrun MACs.

This research documents the performance and projections for the northeast United States from a suite of 16 climate models in the archive of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Analysis is performed for the late twentieth-century monthly mean annual cycle and changes in the late twenty-first century.A weak seasonality in temperature and a strong seasonality in precipitation changes are found. The seasonality of changes is distinct from the mean annual cycles, such that temperature increases are largest in midwinter (December-February) and late summer [July-September (JAS)]. Precipitation increases peak in late winter- early spring (February-April), associated with increased moisture convergence and a more active storm track, and exhibit greatest model disagreement in late summer (JAS) when the models suggest weak divergence and a westward extension of the Atlantic subtropical anticyclone. The late summer-early fall maximum in temperature and late winter-early spring maximum in precipitation changes have not been seen previously in annual or seasonal mean analyses. Yet there is model agreement in these results, indicating that there is important information in the annual cycle for understanding the changes in the physical climate system and for evaluating impacts and adaptation strategies.

Calls for conceptual and practical approaches on how to address climate change have been taken up in the literature. The resilience concept as a comprehensive theory-driven approach to address climate change has only recently increased in importance. Limited research has been undertaken concerning tourism and resilience from a network governance point of view. We analyze tourism supply chain networks with regard to resilience to climate change at the municipal governance scale of three Alpine villages. We compare these with a planned destination management organization (DMO) as a governance entity of the same three municipalities on the regional scale. Network measures are analyzed via a quantitative social network analysis (SNA) focusing on resilience from a tourism governance point of view. Results indicate higher resilience of the regional DMO because of a more flexible and diverse governance structure, more centralized steering of fast collective action, and improved innovative capacity, because of higher modularity and better core-periphery integration. Interpretations of quantitative results have been qualitatively validated by interviews and a workshop. We conclude that adaptation of tourism-dependent municipalities to gradual climate change should be dealt with at a regional governance scale and adaptation to sudden changes at a municipal scale. Overall, DMO building at a regional scale may enhance the resilience of tourism destinations, if the municipalities are well integrated. © 2016 by the author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Core-periphery integration; Social network analysis; Stakeholder perceptions; Tourism destination; Transformation","adaptive management; climate change; collective action; core-periphery relations; ecosystem resilience; governance approach; network analysis; perception; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; stakeholder; tourism management; tourist destination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962655010

In such reservoir, a relatively thick TZ is expected to contain 30% of the oil in place that would not be commercially feasible to target by water flood. Therefore, the development of this area by Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods offers a valuable source of oil production. CO2 injection into oil reservoirs is well known as an efficient EOR process as well as one of the promising technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This study was conducted with the objective to enhance oil recovery in the TZ and also to utilize anthropogenic CO2 as an effective substitute for hydrocarbon (HC) gas injection. In order to define the optimum production strategy to maximize oil recovery, compositional reservoir simulation models were developed and utilized. The effects of several flood design parameters on the efficiency of the process were evaluated, such as: the number of wells and well patterns, well designs, injection schemes, injection and production rates, etc. This paper describes primarily the modeling and flow simulation process developed and utilized for the design of the first commercial CO2 EOR project in the Middle East region to become operational in 2016. The modeling workflow incorporates several important steps from 1-D simulation model to large scale complex compositional simulation models with geological high-resolution grids. The simulation work is supported by a comprehensive and reliable experimental data such as PVT, swelling tests, slim tube and core flood displacement experiments. Important operational experience, understanding of CO2 migration within multiple sub-zone and lessons learned from the CO2-EOR pilot previously conducted in the same field2 are used to reduce technical and commercial risks. An extensive reservoir monitoring plan has been developed to further improve the understanding of reservoir performance, calibrate the models and optimize the CO2 flood. This paper concludes with an assessment of the potential benefits of CO2 injection in the TZ that opens additional development opportunities in other fields.

However, the reliability of individual models needs to be assessed before using their output for impact assessment. In this study, we evaluate the performance of RCMs from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment program (CORDEX) to simulate minimum air temperature (TN), maximum air temperature (TX) and rainfall over Tanzania. Output from four RCMs driven by boundary conditions from three General Circulation Models (GCMs) and ERA-Interim data are evaluated against observed data from 22 weather stations. The evaluation is based on determining how well the RCMs reproduce climatological trends, interannual, and annual cycles of TN, TX and rainfall. Statistical measures of model performance that include the bias, root mean square error, correlation and trend analysis are used. It is found that RCMs capture the annual cycle of TN, TX and rainfall well, however underestimate and overestimate the amount of rainfall in March-April-May (MAM) and October-November-December (OND) seasons respectively. Most RCMs reproduce interannual variations of TN, TX and rainfall. The source of uncertainties can be analysed when the same RCM is driven by different GCMs and different RCMs driven by same GCM simulate TN, TX and rainfall differently. It is found that the biases and errors from the RCMs and driving GCMs contribute roughly equally. Overall, the evaluation finds reasonable (although variable) model skill in representing mean climate, interannual variability and temperature trends, suggesting the potential use of CORDEX RCMs in simulating TN, TX and rainfall over Tanzania.

Within this study, optimal control techniques are applied in order to determine 2D (lateral) and 3D (lateral and vertical) cost-optimized flight trajectories while mitigating their climate impact by minimizing emissions and flight time in highly climate sensitive regions. Therefore, monetary and 4D-climate cost functions, describing the climate sensitivity in dependency of the emission location, altitude, time and weather situation, are integrated into the optimization algorithm. For both, 2D- and 3D-optimization, the cost-benefit potential (climate impact mitigation vs. rise in operating costs) is investigated for nine fictitious North Atlantic routes for eastbound and westbound directions in the presence of winds. The conducted study shows large potential for both measures as the reduction of climate sensitivities along the trajectory often predominates the additional emissions caused by headwinds, additional climb-and descent phases, additional flight distance, and off-design altitudes. Flight trajectories optimized within the horizontal plane can reduce the average temperature response (ATR) by approximately 15 % for a two percent increase in cash operating costs (COC). This mitigation potential is significantly improved by superposition of lateral and vertical optimization. 3D-optimized trajectories which are comparable in cost increase achieve a 20-35 % higher ATR reduction than their 2D-optimized counterparts. Further, they reduce global warming more efficiently (higher ATR reduction per unit cost increment) and to a higher extent. However, achieving maximum climate impact mitigation is linked with an disproportional rise of cash operating costs in both cases. Therefore, a careful consideration of the required climate impact savings as well as the accepted surcharges is necessary. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

These regulatory proceedings could provide additional income streams for geothermal projects or demonstrate the value of geothermal resources in an increasingly decarbonized electric grid. With high penetrations of variable energy resources (VERs) including wind and solar, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) became concerned about essential reliability services. These services include frequency response, voltage support and flexible ramping. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) responded to NERC's initial work on essential reliability services by adopting new frequency response reliability standards for balancing areas. FERC also initiated further evaluation of frequency response and voltage support at the generator level to recognize the benefits provided by and potentially, compensate generators capable of providing these services. In response to FERC's adoption of a new reliability standard, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), is taking steps to procure frequency response services. In addition to frequency control and voltage support, many countries and sub-nationals are working to create low carbon electric grids that can provide low carbon energy when VERs are not operating. Renewable geothermal energy resources can provide energy during non-solar peak hours and can become key resources for reducing the carbon content of electric grids. Recent modeling in California is showing geothermal energy can provide needed grid balancing services when 50% of the energy serving load must come from qualified renewable energy sources (in California renewable resources exclude hydroelectric resources over 30 MW in size). Recent modeling also shows the addition of geothermal resources provides a significant marginal value for ratepayers of 75/MWh.","California Independent System Operator; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; Flexible generation; Frequency control; Greenhouse gas reduction policy; Inertia; Low carbon grid; Regulatory; Renewable portfolio standard","Earnings; Electric frequency control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Frequency response; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric generators; Reliability; Federal energy regulatory commissions; Flexible generation; Greenhouse gas reductions; Independent system operators; Inertia; Low carbon; Regulatory; Renewable portfolio standard; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018543166

Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) spectroscopy combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis was used to characterize the transformation of the effluent dissolved organic matter (DOM) during the operation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) were used to assess the effects of a CO2-stripping unit on the microstructure of the granules. The introduction of the CO2-stripping system reduced the calcium concentration while upgrading methane evolution. The methane yield reached 0.33 L CH4 per g CODremoved in the bioreactor with the CO2-stripping unit compared with 0.31 L CH4 per g CODremoved without the unit as the control. The combined system produced 80% and 50-60% chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) removal under steady-state conditions, which were 6.3% and 41.0% higher than those of the control, respectively. With 3D-EEM-PARAFAC analysis, three fluorescence components, associated as tryptophan protein-like (component 1, Ex/Em = 275-280/355-365 nm) and humic-like substances (component 2, Ex/Em = 240(295, 340)/450 nm and component 3, Ex/Em = 320/320 nm), were identified from the effluent samples. The componential characterizations confirmed the favorable influence of the CO2-stripping unit on the transformation of DOM. Further analysis through XRD, FT-IR and SEM demonstrated that the use of the unit alleviated inactivation of the granules through removing calcium, which might be the core reason for the enhancement of the EGSB performance. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Amino acids; Bioconversion; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Bioreactors; Calcium; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Chemical oxygen demand; Effluents; Granulation; Linear transformations; Methane; Nitrogen removal; Organic compounds; X ray diffraction; Calcium concentration; Dissolved organic matters; Excitation emission matrices; Fluorescence components; Fourier transform infrared; Organic matter removal; Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM); Steady-state condition; Stripping (removal)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961386050

In Iran such an Air Quality Forecast System (AQFoS) has been implemented for the entire country and in a higher resolution for the city of Tehran. The requirements for the implemented models comply with different scales and their vertical and horizontal resolutions, the possibilities of the model to describe emissions sources in different detail levels and furthermore interface methods between the models. In Iran the AQFoS has been implemented with special emphasis on dust generation and large range transport using the EURAD Air Quality Prediction System which was developed by the Rhenish Institute for Environmental Research at the University of Cologne (RIU) in a modified version. EURAD consists of three major components: The PennState/NCAR mesoscale model WRF, which predicts the needed meteorological variables, the EURAD Emission Module (EURAD-EEM), which calculates the temporal and spatial distribution of the emissions of the major pollutants and the EURAD Chemistry Transport Model (EURAD-CTM) which predicts the concentrations and deposition of the main atmospheric pollutants. The global emission data base EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) is used as input. Furthermore a dust activation parameterization was implemented within the EURAD system in order to simulate dust emission from arid land areas. The area of Tehran is focused in a higher spatial resolution. For the Tehran area, AQFoS combines the models PROWIMO and LASAT with WRF/EURAD. The AQFoS runs on servers of the Iran National Meteorological Organization (IRIMO) and predicts concentrations of dust, NO2, SO2, PM10, NMVOC, CO and Ozone for 84 hours. © 2018 Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Species-level responses of plant traits to elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2), especially those that affect interactions with pollinators, could potentially have flow-on effects to both ecological communities and horticultural industries. The impacts of eCO2 on flowering traits in pepper (Capsicum annuum - Giant Bell), tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum- var. Tomato Roma) and zucchini (Cucurbita pepo - Zucchini Blackjack), all economically important horticultural species, were investigated. Twenty plants of each species were grown under two treatments: 1) two glasshouses with ambient CO2 (400 ppm), and 2) two with eCO2 (555 ppm). For both treatments, we measured the number of flowers, flower longevity and dry biomass for all species; pollen diameter and number of pollen grains for tomato and zucchini and the sucrose concentration and nectar production in zucchini. Elevated CO2 had few significant effects on the measured traits, the main exceptions being in zucchini, which produced more male flowers, fewer pollen grains per plant and fewer female flowers under this treatment. Pepper also produced fewer flowers at eCO2 while tomato was the least sensitive species. Future studies could be aimed at testing sensitivity of different varieties of these important commercial species to eCO2.","Elevated CO2; Flower longevity; Pepper (Capsicum annuum); Pollen; Tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum); Vegetable crops; Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009435773

The successful amelioration of air pollution requires strategic investments in the commercialization and adoption of ""clean energy technologies"" by both private and public entities, the conversion of contemporary houses to ""smart houses"", the diffusion of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) including photovoltaic systems (PV), wind farms, and different forms of bioenergy, and the integration of electric-powered vehicles. In concert with these ideas, this paper aims to discuss the possibility of undertaking a feasibility study in two countries Canada and Italy concerning the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and electric motorcycles (EMs). The proposed feasibility study would seek to assess the prospect of replacing the current vehicle fleets in these two countries with EVs in a manner that utilizes renewable energy sources and, thus, does not generate new toxic emissions. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a pronounced introduction and distribution of RES, EVs, and EMs can operate as a great opportunity for both the environment and the capacities and needs of energy production. Today, the EV is not widespread. With this contribution, it is shown how EVs can be well integrated with renewable energy. Therefore, it is the duty of governments to implement policy strategies, in order to spread them across more territory. © 2016 by the authors.","Electric vehicles (EV); Emissions; Environmental; Renewable energy resources (RES); Vehicle fleet","air quality; bioenergy; electric vehicle; energy resource; photovoltaic system; policy implementation; policy strategy; pollution control; remediation; renewable resource; resource allocation; toxic material; traffic emission; Canada; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956696026

Second, regional organizing provides environmental justice movements with new opportunities to address regional economic patterns and to negotiate with regional planning agencies, both of which influence local manifestations of environmental injustice. Third, regional strategies raise significant dilemmas for these movements as they try to sustain engagement across extensive spatial territories and engage with a broad set of policy and economic protagonists.

This is especially applicable to natural gas plant aimed for CO2 gas removal in offshore platform that is often accompanied with a number of unit operations, complicated configurations, non-standard operating conditions and high impurities content. In addition, it is highly desirable to link the natural gas purification unit with other pretreatment, dehydration and auxiliary equipments already implemented in the process simulators to constitute the entire process plant. Although research work has arisen in this area, the incorporation is particularly challenging for iCON® process simulator since it does not inherit the intrinsic capability to incorporate standalone models of additional unit operations. Nonetheless, the incorporation is of exceptional importance since the intrinsic physical property and thermodynamic databases of iCON® process simulator can be employed conveniently to determine heating value of the product streams. Therefore, in current research work, a mathematical model has been developed to describe the countercurrent hollow fiber membrane module, which has been integrated as an extension in iCON® through utilization of the export/import functions embedded within the Excel unit operation of the process simulator. Validity of the simulation model has been demonstrated through good accordance with published literature.

Recognising and understanding the many human-tree interactions that urban forests provide may be more complex but probably just as important to our urbanised society. This paper introduces four themes that link the studies from across the globe presented in this Special Issue: (1) human-tree interactions; (2) urban tree inequity; (3) carbon sequestration in our own neighbourhoods; and (4) biodiversity of urban forests themselves and the fauna they support. Urban forests can help tackle many of the ""wicked problems"" that confront our towns and cities and the people that live in them. For urban forests to be accepted as an effective element of any urban adaptation strategy, we need to improve the communication of these ecosystem services and disservices and provide evidence of the benefits provided to urban society and individuals, as well as the biodiversity with which we share our town and cities. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Tree canopy cover; Urban ecology; Urban landscape; Urban planning",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007323433

Several are also gaps in the latest IPCC WG2 report. These omissions reflect major gaps in the underlying research base from which these assessments draw. These include the challenge of estimating the costs and benefits of climate change impacts and responses to climate change and the need for research on climate impacts on important sectors such as manufacturing and services. Climate impacts also need to be assessed within an international context in an increasingly connected and globalized world. Climate change is being experienced not only through changes within a locality but also through the impacts of climate change in other regions connected through trade, prices, and commodity chains, migratory species, human mobility and networked communications. Also under-researched are the connections and tradeoffs between responses to climate change at or across different scales, especially between adaptation and mitigation or between climate responses and other environmental and social policies. This paper discusses some of these research priorities, illustrating their significance through analysis of economic and international connections and case studies of responses to climate change.

Wind power, as the most technical mature future energy, has been developed and applied rapidly in the world. In the last 10 years, wind power develops rapidly in China, with the most installed capacity all over the world. At present, accommodation capability of wind power in Northwest, Northeast and North China tends to be saturated. With the coming integration of large scale of photovoltaic (PV) power, it is urgently to transmit redundant renewable power to electrical power needed regions. The main problem about wind power operation is analyzed in this paper. The feasibility of transmitting large-scale renewable power located in Northeast and Northwest to North, East and Central China grid through UHVDC project is systematically researched. Practical calculation method for matched conventional power capacity and scheduling production are presented, which are based on transmission capacity, typical wind output curve and P-V curve. Security and stability calculating process is concluded. This method is proved to be effective by simulating SGCC practical project case. The study result shows that curtailment capacity of wind and PV power will be minimized by optimizing the proportion of wind, PV and thermal power on the basis of power system security and stability. And renewable energy will be developed effectively. There is obvious significance for optimizing structure of power source, improving air quality and achieving the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction. © 2016 CIGRE.

The objectives of this article are to summarize the baseline data on CO2 production from various animal species and determine uncertainties of the CO2 balance approach for estimating VR of animal houses by evaluating the model performance in these studies. In the poultry (broiler, laying hen, and Turkey) and dairy studies, the CO2 production rates per heat production of animals or respiratory quotient (RQ) showed a decreasing trend with increasing animal age or days in milk (DIM). Higher variation in CO2 production rates per heat production of animals were observed in young broiler chicken (&lt;3 weeks) and Turkeys (&lt;10 weeks) and in the dairy cow studies. The modeled and measured CO2 production rates were generally comparable with each other for each species, and the standard deviation of model residuals was about 20% to 30% of the average measured CO2 production rate for each species except dairy cows. By only including data in which the differences between exhaust and inlet CO2 concentrations were larger than 50 ppm, the standard deviations of model residuals were less than 32% of the average measured VR in the broiler, laying hen, swine, and steer studies. Based on the results, when using the CO2 balance approach to estimate VR for broiler, laying hen, swine, and steer operations, a minimum of ten replicate measurements is required to achieve a margin of error less than 20% in modeled VR with 95% confidence. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Emission; Heat production; Metabolic rate; Respiratory quotient; Ventilation rate","Animals; Dairies; Heating; Neutron emission; Statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Heat production; Metabolic rates; Michigan State University; Model performance; Replicate measurements; Respiratory quotients; Standard deviation; Ventilation rate; Carbon dioxide; building; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; diet; ecological modeling; emission; heat production; livestock; livestock farming; metabolism; respiration; ventilation; Michigan; United States; Animalia; Suidae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960902691

GHPs have been proven capable of producing large reductions in primary energy use and associated carbon emissions for satisfying the thermal demands of buildings, such as space conditioning and water heating. However, the current adoption rate of GHPs in the United States is low and GHPs receive little attention by either the general public or policy-makers. The U.S. Department of Energy, Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) is developing a Geothermal Vision Study (Vision Study) in order to articulate GTO's investment strategies, discuss geothermal growth scenarios for 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, and to address all market segments of the geothermal industry. The Vision Study Thermal Task Force is developing tools and data that include GHPs for non-electric-power-generation geothermal applications. Work described in this paper is being conducted to provide a credible analysis of potential GHP growth scenarios. This paper gives an overview of the current status of GHP applications, including system configurations, cost and performance, market penetration, and the barriers preventing wider adoption. This paper also introduces the methodology, supporting data, and preliminary results of an assessment for the technical potential of applying GHP systems in businesses and homes of the United States. The assessed technical potential includes energy savings, carbon emissions reductions, reduced summer electrical peak demands, and consumer energy cost savings. Preliminary results from this assessment indicate that GHPs have potential, in each year, to save 6.4 Quads of primary energy, avoid 412.7 Million tons of CO2 emissions, and cut 77.3 Billion energy costs. In addition, GHPs can also significantly reduce peak demand on the electric grid.","Buildings; Commercial; Geothermal heat pumps; Renewable thermal; Residential; Space cooling; Space heating; Technical potential; Vision study; Water heating","Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric tools; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Geothermal heating; Heat pump systems; Investments; Pumps; Space heating; Commercial; Renewable thermal; Residential; Space cooling; Technical potential; Water heating; Geothermal heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018617264

The widely used method is to employ a one-dimensional discharge model describing the conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The fluid is usually considered to remain at thermal and mechanical equilibrium during the depressurisation process, while the non-equilibrium liquid/vapour transition phenomena are ignored. Although efforts have been made to model nonequilibrium, two-phase CO2depressurisation in recent years, possible improvement can be made by using a more precise Equation of State (EOS) and more detailed models. In this paper, a multi-phase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is presented to simulate CO2 releases from highpressure pipelines. A real gas EOS (GERG-2008) was incorporated into the CFD code. This enabled accurate modelling of the thermodynamic properties to achieve a more precise source strength estimate. The non-equilibrium liquid/vapour transition was modelled by introducing source terms for mass and latent heat. A 'time relaxation factor' was used to control the inter-phase mass transfer rate. The CFD model was validated against experimental results from the British Petroleum (BP) CO2 release trials. The optimum relaxation time (for the CO2 depressurisation cases tested) was obtained through simulations by varying the time relaxation factors and comparison with experimental data. In addition, the effect of the relaxation time on the source strength prediction is discussed. © Copyright 2016 by ASME.",,"Computational fluid dynamics; Equations of state; High pressure pipelines; Mass transfer; One dimensional; Pipelines; Project management; Relaxation time; Risk assessment; Two phase flow; Accurate prediction; British petroleums; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Conservation of mass; Discharge modeling; Inter-phase mass transfer; Mechanical equilibrium; Transition phenomenon; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997047756

Such 'climate resilient development' (CRD) must identify and implement adaptation strategies for improving livelihoods while also being cost-effective. While the idea that climate resilience and development goals should be compatible is often discussed, empirical evaluations of the economic impacts of actual CRD investments are practically non-existent. This paper outlines a framework to evaluate economic returns to CRD and applies it in two adaptation strategies trialed in Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, eastern Indonesia. The evaluation framework is composed of three models: a household benefit cost model, a diffusion model, and a regional benefit cost model. The models draw upon the impact evaluation, technology diffusion, and risk assessment literatures, respectively. The analyzes are based on expert opinion and locally-derived information, and hence can be applied in data-poor situations typical of developing countries. Our results explore economic costs and benefits at the household and regional scale, and we identify key input variables that greatly influence the economic returns of the strategies. These variables should therefore be a focus of ongoing investment. We also discuss how the framework is more generally applicable, its limitations including challenges in accounting for less tangible social and ecosystem service benefits, potentially leading to the underestimation of impacts, and how the approach should be complemented by qualitative methods. © 2015 The Authors.","Adaptation strategies; Benefit cost analysis; Impact evaluation; Monte Carlo analysis; Risk assessment; Simulation modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951032106

On the other hand, CO2 is considered as an abundant carbon source. Therefore, transformation of CO2 into target chemicals nowadays is of great interest. Recently, a concept of so-called ""frustrated Lewis pairs"" (FLPs) has been proposed. Such FLPs show unusual reactivity, such as hydrogen activation and the reduction of CO2. In this study, by means of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations, we conduct a kinetic survey on the reduction of CO2 by a series of FLPs. We investigate the relationship between the electronic structures and kinetic properties. The kinetic properties include: (1) reaction energy barriers, (2) the structural properties of the associated transition states (TSs), and (3) the natural charge population in these TSs.

Subsurface application of poultry litter has environmental benefits. Redistribution plus subsurface application benefits both farmers and the environment. Sustainable nutrient management requires redistribution of livestock manure from nutrient-excess areas to nutrient-deficit areas. Field experiments were conducted to assess agronomic (i.e., corn yield) and environmental (i.e., ammonia volatilization and surface nutrient loss) effects of different poultry litter application methods (surface vs. subsurface) and timings (fall vs. spring) in a potential manure-importing region in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed in the United States. All four litter treatments (205 kg nitrogen ha−1) produced grain yields (10.9–12.8 Mg ha−1) nearly equivalent to or higher than the 11.5 Mg ha−1 yield expected from the same mineral nitrogen rate. Compared with surface application, subsurface application significantly reduced ammonia emission (p &lt; 0.0001), runoff volume (fall: p = 0.02; spring: p = 0.004), and loads of nitrate nitrogen (p &lt; 0.0001; p = 0.003) and dissolved phosphorus (p &lt; 0.0001; p = 0.004) soon after application. Integrating subsurface manure application technologies into the manure redistribution programs would help ensure that the surplus nutrients being relocated provide a maximum agronomic impact and minimum environmental impact to the importing region.

To fully utilize the resources and reduce environmental pollutions, Chinese steel plants are using rotary hearth furnace (RHF) process to recycle solid dust. A consequential life-cycle inventory was carried out to assess the impact of dust recovery on greenhouse gas emissions based on the local production status. In the study system, the selected steel plant named a which have 10.5 million tons of Crude steel productivity and 0.48 million tons solid dust come out meanwhile. To research, a RHF production line of 0.3 million tons directly reduced iron (DRI) a year was established to recycle the solid dust. The DRI will be obtained from RHF and sent to the blast furnace as raw materials to reduce the demand for iron ore and coke in steelmaking processes. By researching on the life-cycle inventory in the system, the steelmaking process with RHF was 2299.3kgCO2/ton steel. It's a little higher while compared with the process without RHF, which data is 2297.0 kgCO2/ton steel. The small production of DRI make a small difference to reduce the carbon footprint of steelmaking process, the added carbon footprint of RHF process is more than BF and other steelmaking processes reduced. It is concluded that dust recovery has no contribution to the greenhouse gas emission reductions in the technic condition of Chinese steel plants currently.","Carbon footprint; Life Cycle Assessment; Rotary hearth furnace process; Solid dust","Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Dust; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Iron ores; Iron research; Open hearth furnaces; Recycling; Steelmaking; Steelmaking furnaces; Directly reduced irons; Environmental pollutions; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Rotary hearth furnaces; Steelmaking process; Technic condition; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976385376

The results show that the EGR ratio could be reduced combined with WEF to meet the Tier III emission regulation. The penalty on fuel consumption with EGR and WEF could be offset by Miller cycle and high geometric compression ratio.

Existing climate regionalization schemes are not well suited for these tasks as they rarely take population density into account. In this work, we are extending our recently developed method for automated climate regionalization (LKN-method) to incorporate the spatial features of target population. The LKN method consists of the data limiting step (L-step) to reduce dimensionality by applying principal component analysis, a classification step (K-step) to produce hierarchical candidate regions using k-means unsupervised classification algorithm, and a nomination step (N-step) to determine the number of candidate climate regions using cluster validity indexes. LKN method uses a comprehensive set of multiple satellite data streams, arranged as time series, and allows us to define homogeneous climate regions. The proposed approach extends the LKN method to include regularization terms reflecting the spatial distribution of target population. Such tailoring allows us to determine the optimal number and spatial distribution of climate regions and thus, to ensure more uniform population coverage across selected climate categories. We demonstrate how the extended LKN method produces climate regionalization can be better tailored to epidemiological research in the context of decision support framework.","Climate classification; Environmental health; Geographic information systems; Geospatial statistics; Remote sensing","Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision support systems; Epidemiology; Geographic information systems; Population distribution; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Decision support framework; Environmental health; Geo-spatial; Multiple satellites; Population densities; Regularization terms; Spatial regularizations; Unsupervised classification; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979619689

Over the past 60 years, important advance in carbon dynamics and ecosystem energy flow have been made mainly through the Budget and Metabolism approaches. However, much less focus has been given to the quantification of longitudinal movement of organic matter. The concept “Organic Carbon Spiraling” (SOC) was formulated in the early 80s, and represented a substantial advance in the understanding of the longitudinal flow of elements in lotic systems. Methods: In this review, we summarize the history behind the SOC concept, cover the major advances at the time of its creation, describe the operational variables and the equation for SOC calculation, and discuss future directions and current applications of this approach. Results/Conclusions: We emphasize the need for integrating the C spiraling approach in other regions of the globe, given that measurements are almost exclusive of North America. Such comparative studies can elucidate important drivers of C export, storage and oxidation. Advance in dissolved organic carbon characterization, and improvements in heterotrophic respiration measurements are required to improve SOC accuracy, as well as realistic estimates of benthic stock. With the current interest in examining how lotic systems contribute to regional and global C budgets, we argue that SOC is an effective way to achieve this goal and answer classical questions in stream ecology. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Limnologia.

However, carbon-based materials, chemicals, and transportation fuels are predominantly made from fossil sources and currently there is no alternative source available to adequately displace them. Gas-fermenting microorganisms that fix carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) can break this dependence as they are capable of converting gaseous carbon to fuels and chemicals. As such, the technology can utilize a wide range of feedstocks including gasified organic matter of any sort (e.g., municipal solid waste, industrial waste, biomass, and agricultural waste residues) or industrial off-gases (e.g., from steel mills or processing plants). Gas fermentation has matured to the point that large-scale production of ethanol from gas has been demonstrated by two companies. This review gives an overview of the gas fermentation process, focusing specifically on anaerobic acetogens. Applications of synthetic biology and coupling gas fermentation to additional processes are discussed in detail. Both of these strategies, demonstrated at bench-scale, have abundant potential to rapidly expand the commercial product spectrum of gas fermentation and further improve efficiencies and yields. © 2016 Liew, Martin, Tappel, Heijstra, Mihalcea and Köpke.","Acetogens; Carbon capture and utilization; Clostridium; Coupled processes; Gas fermentation; Low-carbon fuels; Syngas; Synthetic biology","carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; caspase 9; complementary RNA; CRISPR associated protein; fossil fuel; fuel; hydrogen; low carbon fuel; nitrogen; organic matter; unclassified drug; agricultural waste; biomass production; biotechnological production; carbon dioxide fixation; DNA transfer; fermentation technique; Fischer Tropsch synthesis; gene inactivation; homologous recombination; industrial waste; metabolic engineering; municipal solid waste; mutagenesis; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; Review; synthetic biology; transposon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973449735

The effective and efficient use of scarce resources is therefore of the utmost importance to provide a high standard public safety service. Optimization models specifically tailored to the necessity of police agencies can help to ameliorate their use. The Multicriteria Police Districting Problem (MC-PDP) on a graph concerns the definition of sound patrolling sectors in a police district. The objective of this problem is to partition a graph into convex and continuous subsets, while ensuring efficiency and workload balance among the subsets. The model was originally formulated in collaboration with the Spanish National Police Corps. We propose for its solution three local search algorithms: A Simple Hill Climbing, a Steepest Descent Hill Climbing, and a Tabu Search. To improve their diversification capabilities, all the algorithms implement a multistart procedure, initialized by randomized greedy solutions. The algorithms are empirically tested on a case study on the Central District of Madrid. Our experiments show that the solutions identified by the novel Tabu Search outperform the other algorithms. Finally, research guidelines for future developments on the MC-PDP are given. © 2016 F. Liberatore and M.

The application of data mining algorithms on global climate data can result in a better understanding of the climate system. Of which, change detection has proven to be a very useful approach when mining climate data. Understanding spatio-temporal change can give insight to interesting patterns that can be used to predict climate events. This paper proposes a method to generate spatial homogeneous regions that uses a novel indexing structure for the analysis of spatial change including homogeneous change and heterogeneous change. The resulting regions are then used to analyze persistent and dynamic regions at longer time scales. The efficacy of the approach was demonstrated on a real-world climate dataset and the results suggest interesting patterns that are explained by known climate phenomena. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Algorithms; Data mining; Earth (planet); Change detection; Data mining algorithm; Global climates; Homogeneous regions; Indexing structures; Potential impacts; Spatial changes; Spatio-temporal changes; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962686845

This study considered a hybrid capture system that combined both the capture and the compression units. In doing so, the conventional multi-stage CO2 compression unit was replaced with a low-temperature carbon capture separation and pressurising step. The advantages of replacing the compression unit are two-folds: firstly, the low-temperature separation unit can further purify the CO2 stream and secondly, it produces liquid CO2 that can be pumped to the supercritical state required for transportation and sequestration. In order to take advantage of the extra CO2 purification of the low-temperature separation unit, a vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) was used as the initial CO2 recovery stage. A hybrid process has a higher degree of freedom available and therefore a Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) technique in combination with heat integration was used to optimise the total shaft work and the overall CO2 recovery rate of the capture process. The MOO provided a range of optimal solutions where the total shaft work increased with the total CO2 being recovered by the hybrid process. However, a minimum optimum was determined for the total specific shaft work required at an overall recovery rate of 88.9%, which required 1.40 GJ/(t CO2 captured).

Uptake of electric vehicles in different markets is different. There are many factors which can influence deployment of electric vehicles. Government policies are the key to deployment of electric vehicles. Particularly, electric vehicles require specific charge infrastructure to support their operation. China has considered deployment of electric vehicles as a key instrument to solve air pollution issues in urban areas. The Chinese national government and local authorities apply a number of policies and deploy various infrastructures to enable operation of electric vehicles. However, there is a different attitude toward to electric vehicles from the Brazilian public authorities. Lack of support of government policies and infrastructure has resulted in slow deployment in Brazil. This paper studies some best practices of deployment of infrastructure for electric vehicles and analyses the social and economic context of such policies, their impacts on the market penetration of electric vehicles as well as their short and long term benefits.

The distribution of n-alkanes varies steadily through the profile, with long-chain n-alkanes dominating in the lower and upper sections, and medium chain-length n-alkanes dominating in the middle section of the profile. The δ13C values of n-alkanes, hopanes and steranes show similar upward positive trends through the profile, suggesting that these compounds originated from the same source material and also reflect consistent changes in the environment of the sedimentary basin. The C24 17,21-secohopane was only detected in the lower and middle sections of the profile and has a more positive carbon isotopic composition by about 3.7–6.7‰ than that of associated n-alkanes, hopanes, steranes and C30 8,14-secohopane. This implies that the C24 17,21-secohopane had a different origin, possibly connected with the volcanic ash deposits and massive vertebrate remains. Reconstruction of the δ13C composition of atmospheric CO2 based on plant-derived C29 and C31 n-alkanes shows a change from −10‰ to −3‰ from the bottom to the middle of the profile.

In this study, the latest version of theCrop Environment Resource Synthesis- Rice(CERES-Rice)modelwas applied to assess the impacts of climate change and carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization on rice yield, as well as the effectiveness of two popularly adopted adaptive measures in Hunan Province, the main rice-production location in China. The simulation spanned 30 years of baseline (1981-2010) as well as three future periods (2011-40, 2041-70, and 2071-99) with climate data generated by five general circulation models under the newly developed representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The simulation results showed that, in comparisonwith average rice yield during the baseline (1981-2010), the ensemble-average yield of all cultivars during the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s would decrease under both RCPs without CO2 fertilization effects. The ensembleaverage yield reduction during the 2080s was alleviated under both RCPs if CO2 fertilization effects were accounted for. Adaptation simulations indicated that two adaptive measures (switching cultivars and changing planting dates) couldmitigate the adverse effect to different extents.The intermodel variability under bothRCPswas generally small. These findings may provide useful insight into the potential impacts of climate change on rice yield and effective adaptive measures to mitigate the adverse effect of future climate change in Hunan Province. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Applications; Climate change; Crop growth; Ecological models; Forecasting; Forecasting; Model evaluation/performance; Models and modeling; Multidecadal variability; Physical meteorology and climatology; Variability","Agriculture; Applications; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Cultivation; Forecasting; Plants (botany); Crop growth; Ecological models; Model evaluation/performance; Multidecadal variability; Variability; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; cultivation; ecological modeling; forecasting method; meteorology; performance assessment; rice; China; Hunan; Ceres",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975455533

We adopted the market value method, carbon tax method, afforestation cost method, shadow engineering method and contingent value method (CVM) using questionnaire survey data during the study period. The results show that the total value of the ecosystem services of Lakeside Wetland Park was 144 million CNY in 2015. Among these services, the value of society service is the maximum at 91.73 million CNY, followed by ecological service and material production service (42.23 million CNY and 10.43 billion CNY in 2015 respectively). When considering wetland ecosystems for economic development, other services must be considered in addition to material production to obtain a longer-term economic value.

The process combines advantageous features of both absorption and membrane processes to cost-effectively separate and capture CO2 from emission sources. In this process, CO2-containing flue gas passes through one side of the hollow fiber membrane contactor (HFMC), while a CO2 selective solvent flows on the other side. CO2 permeates through the hollow fiber membrane pores and is chemically absorbed into the solvent. The CO2 rich solvent is regenerated and sent back to the membrane absorber. The key component of the HFMC process is the super-hydrophobic porous hollow fiber, which is made from poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK). PEEK is an engineered polymer with thermo-mechanical properties and chemical resistance superior to most commercial plastics including typical polymers used in membrane fabrication. The unique characteristics of PEEK allow the HFMC device to be utilized successfully in challenging and aggressive chemical environments. Compared to conventional absorption/desorption technologies, the critical advantage of the HFMC process is the high contact surface area provided by the hollow fibers that enable an increased volumetric mass-transfer rate. In the PEEK HFMC process, the specific surface area has been increased by an order of magnitude over structurally packed or trayed columns, resulting in compact systems with small footprints. The bench-scale field testing conducted at a coal-fired power plant showed greater than 90% CO2 removal with 97% CO2 product purity with activated methyldiethanolamine (aMDEA) solvent. The mass transfer coefficient in the absorption step was 1.2 (sec)1, which is over an order of magnitude greater than that of conventional column contactors. The objectives of our pilot-scale development program (supported by the US Department of Energy) were to build a 0.5 MWe equivalent pilot-scale CO2 capture HFMC system, conduct tests on flue gas at the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) and demonstrate a continuous, steady-state operation for a minimum of two months. Under this program, the PEEK HFMC technology was scaled from the bench scale to a pilot scale utilizing larger size HFMC modules. The modules measured 8-inches in diameter by 5 feet long with a membrane surface area of about 40 m2 per module. These modules have shown exceptionally high CO2 capture rates due to the high membrane intrinsic CO2 permeance as well as the structured PEEK hollow fiber module configuration. In our study, CO2 gas permeance of 2,150 GPU [1 GPU = 10-6 cm3(STP)/(cm2.scmHg)] was attained by optimizing the membrane preparation procedures. By using aMDEA solvent and a simulated flue gas, the HFMC showed greater than 90% CO2 removal with 98% CO2 product purity. The mass transfer coefficient was 2.0 (sec)1. Preliminary design of the 0.5 MWe equivalent CO2 capture system was completed. A HAZOP review meeting held at the NCCC facility (Wilsonville, Alabama) indicated that no ""show-stopper"" or ""major"" modifications were identified. We are currently performing detailed engineering of the 0.5 MWe system. It is anticipated that the construction will be completed by September 2016, the system will be installed in NCCC in December 2016 for testing, and the project will be completed by June 2018. After the current project, we plan to complete a 25 MWe equivalent CO2 capture system demonstration (500 Tonne/day) by 2021. Currently, we are also developing a transformational hybrid process combining a gas separation membrane configuration unit and PEEK HFMC unit that can further reduce the CO2 capture cost.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Ethers; Fibers; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuel power plants; Gases; Hydrophobicity; Ketones; Mass transfer; Membrane technology; Membranes; Polymers; Software testing; Solvents; Coal-fired power plant; Conventional absorption; Gas separation membrane; Hollow fiber membrane contactors; Hollow fiber membranes; Steady-state operation; Thermomechanical properties; US Department of Energy; Gas permeable membranes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040309363

However, biochar effect on N2O emissions from manure composting is rarely evaluated, especially by linking it to abundance of denitrifying bacteria community. Results of this study indicated that biochar amendment significantly reduced N2O emissions from manure composting, primarily due to suppression of the nirK gene abundance of denitrifying bacteria. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between nirK abundance and N2O fluxes, while a negative correlation between nosZ density and N2O fluxes. Simultaneously, a linear correlation between nirK gene abundance minus nosZ gene abundance with N2O fluxes was also observed. In addition, a statistical model for estimating N2O emissions based on the bacterial denitrifying functional genes was developed and verified to adequately fit the observed emissions. Our results highlighted that biochar amendment would be an alternative strategy for mitigating N2O emissions during manure composting, and the information of related functional bacterial communities could be helpful for understanding the mechanism of N2O emissions. © 2016 The Author(s).","Biochar; Denitrifying genes abundance; Manure composting; Modeling; Nitrous oxide","biochar; charcoal; nitrite reductase; nitrous oxide reductase; unclassified drug; Article; denitrifying bacterium; DNA extraction; greenhouse effect; manure; microbial community; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; physical chemistry; polymerase chain reaction; ultraviolet spectrophotometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007072135

We conducted in situ experiments with three CO2 concentrations (270, 380 and 750ppm) over four seasons during 2012 and 2013. Our results showed that phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria were dominant in winter and that photosynthetic picoeukaryotes were prevalent during the other three seasons. CO2 elevation could significantly increase the abundance of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes in all seasons except winter, but did not have any influence on picocyanobacterial abundance. CO2 enrichment caused an increase in the primary production of the picoplankton community in most seasons, and significant differences were observed among the treatments in summer and winter. In addition, the contribution of picoplankton to total primary production significantly increased under higher CO2 concentrations in winter. The increase in the abundance of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes and the primary production of picoplankton under high CO2 concentrations may reduce the transfer of matter and energy to higher trophic levels and increase the importance of the microbial food web.

To our knowledge, explicit spatial maps and accurate area data on swidden agriculture remain surprisingly lacking. However, this traditional farming practice has been transforming into other profit-driven land use, like tree plantations and permanent cash agriculture. Swidden agriculture is characterized by a rotational and dynamic nature of agroforestry, with land cover changing from natural forests, newly-cleared swiddens to different-aged fallows. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the Landsat-8 satellite has visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands, which are sensitive to the changes in vegetation cover, land surface moisture content and soil exposure, and therefore, four vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). In this study, we developed a multi-step threshold approach that uses a combination of thresholds of four VIs and local elevation range (LER) and applied it to detect and map newly-opened swiddens and different-aged fallows using OLI imagery acquired between 2013 and 2015. The resultant Landsat-derived swidden agriculture maps have high accuracy with an overall accuracy of 86.9% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.864. The results of this study indicated that the Landsat-based multi-step threshold algorithms could potentially be applied to monitor the long-term change pattern of swidden agriculture in montane mainland Southeast Asia since the late 1980s and also in other tropical regions, like insular Southeast Asia, South Asia, Latin America and Central Africa, where swidden agriculture is still common. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Fallow; Landsat; Montane mainland Southeast Asia; Multi-step threshold; Swidden agriculture; Vegetation indices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957872786

Thus, it is imperative to adjust the energy structure and explore effective ways for energy conservation and carbon emission reduction in Shanxi Province. Based on the energy consumption and carbon emission of different types of energy source, this paper analyzed the carbon emission of each industrial sector in Shanxi from 2003 to 2012, discussed the transfer of carbon emission responsibility caused by inter-provincial energy import and export, and introduced an energy consumption structure index to evaluate the structural characteristics of energy consumption for specific sectors. The results revealed that, during 2003 to 2012, the carbon emission in Shanxi Province increased significantly, which was mainly contributed by the consumption of coal and coke; while the carbon emission of briquette and natural gas grew fastest. From the sectoral perspective, industry and thermal power sectors contributed most to the total carbon emission of this province. About 20%-30% of the electricity produced by the thermal power sector was used for the external supply, so from the perspective of regional fair, the regions who receive the energy should take some responsibility for the corresponding carbon emission. The overall energy structure of Shanxi Province improved gradually. Except for the continuous low emission efficiency of thermal power and heating sectors, most of other sectors showed the energy structure trend towards higher emission efficiency, which represented a lower carbon-intensive development. Based on the energy structure characteristics, recommendations covering both energy conservation and emission reduction were provided to support the low-carbon economy development in Shanxi Province. Three major measures included the industrial restructuring, energy structure adjustment, and emission reduction on transportation. © 2016 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

The influence of synthesis conditions such as NaOH/SiO2 ratio on the final products was investigated. The mesopore distribution can be facilely controlled by adjusting the size of primary particles via modulating the alkalinity of the synthesis gel. The ZSM-5 aggregates obtained by varying Na2O/SiO2 molar ratios from 0.05 to 0.13 are denoted as NA-X (X = 1-4). The NA-X samples are characterized by techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption-desorption, NH3-TPD and Py-IR. SEM revealed that the obtained NA-X were ellipsoidal spheres that consisted of nano-sized crystallites with 20-70 nm. It is found that NA-2 exhibits a mesopore distribution around 12 nm and possesses the largest amount of external acid sites, which lead to the remarkably improved catalytic performance in methanol to propylene (MTP) reaction. A possible growth mechanism of self-assembled NA-X zeolites directed by tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) is proposed. The crystallization process indicated that the size of raw materials gradually decreased, formed nano-sized particles and the stacking of the resulting small zeolite crystals will form NA-X zeolites with prolonged time. Compared with the conventional hydrothermal route, the solid-like state and steam-assisted conversion not only significantly shortened the crystallization time, but also greatly reduced the emissions of waste liquids. In addition, for the MTP reaction, the NA-X zeolites obtained by this method showed much better catalytic performance, propylene selectivity and longer lifetime to endure coke deposition than the sample obtained by the hydrothermal route. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Particle size; Propylene; Silica; Zeolites; Adsorption desorption; Catalytic performance; Crystallization process; Methanol to propylene (MTP); Nano-sized crystallites; Propylene selectivity; Steam assisted conversions; Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992388909

We presented a systematic study of the adsorption behaviors of gas molecules, CO2, N2, H2O, CO, NH3, NO, O2, H2 and NO2, on monolayer MoS2 with single SV by first-principles calculations. It was found that CO2, N2 and H2O molecules physisorbed at the proximity of single SV. Our adsorption energy calculations and charge transfer analysis showed that the interactions between CO2, N2 and H2O molecules and defective MoS2 are stronger than the cases of CO2, N2 and H2O molecules adsorbed on pristine MoS2, respectively. The defective MoS2 based gas sensors may be more sensitive to CO2, N2 and H2O molecules than pristine MoS2 based ones. CO, NO, O2 and NH3 molecules were found to chemisorb at the S vacancy site and thus modify the electronic properties of defective monolayer MoS2. Magnetism was induced upon adsorption of NO molecules and the defective states induced by S vacancy can be completely removed upon adsorption of O2 molecules, which may provide some helpful information for designing new MoS2 based nanoelectronic devices in future. The H2 and NO2 molecules were found to dissociate at S vacancy. The dissociation of NO2 molecules resulted in O atoms located at the S vacancy site and NO molecules physisorbed on O-doped MoS2. The calculated results showed that NO2 molecules can help heal the S vacancy of the MoS2 monolayer. © 2016 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973620903

A 4-year rotational experiment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-canola (Brassica napus L.)-grain legumes-wheat in sequence was established at Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia, in a semiarid Mediterranean-type environment where long-term average annual rainfall is 541mm and the incidence of summer rainfall is episodic and unreliable. The objectives of the experiment were to investigate whether (i) tillage increases N2O emissions and (ii) nitrogen (N) application can improve productivity without increasing N2O emissions. The base experimental design for each crop phase was a split-plot design with tillage treatment (tilled versus no-till) as the whole plot, and N fertiliser rate (0, 25, 50 and 100kgN/ha) as the subplot, replicated three times. This paper reports high resolution N2O emission data under a canola crop. The daily N2O emission rate averaged 0.55g N2O-N/ha.day, ranging between -0.81 and 6.71g N2O-N/ha.day. The annual cumulative N2O-N emitted was 175.6 and 224.3g N2O-N/ha under 0 and 100kgN/ha treatments respectively. There was no evidence to support the first hypothesis that tillage increases N2O emissions, a result which may give farmers more confidence to use tillage strategically to manage weeds and diseases where necessary. However, increasing N fertiliser rate tended to increase N2O emissions, but did not increase crop production at this site. © CSIRO 2016.","conservation tillage; greenhouse gases; nitrogen fertiliser; trace gas emission","Agricultural machinery; Crops; Cultivation; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Plants (botany); Productivity; Rain; Soil conservation; Conservation tillage; Nitrous oxide emissions; Semi-arid environments; South-eastern Australia; Split plot designs; Tillage treatment; Trace gas emissions; Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Agriculture; agricultural emission; canola; conservation tillage; crop production; crop rotation; dryland farming; emission; experimental design; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; legume; Mediterranean environment; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; semiarid region; trace gas; wheat; Australia; New South Wales; Wagga Wagga; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981501539

This IO dipole (IOD)-like warming pattern, regarded as robust based on consistency among models by the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, results in a large increase in the frequency of extreme positive IOD (pIOD) events, elevating the risk of climate and weather disasters in the future over IO rim countries. These projections, however, do not consider large model biases in both the mean state and interannual IOD variance. In particular, a ""present-future relationship"" is identified between the historical simulations and representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 experiments from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble: models with an excessive IOD amplitude bias tend to project a strong IOD-like warming pattern in the mean and a large increase in extreme pIOD occurrences under increased GHG forcing. This relationship links the present simulation errors to future climate projections, and is also consistent with our understanding of Bjerknes ocean-atmosphere feedback. This study calibrates regional climate projections by using this present-future relationship and observed IOD amplitude. The results show that the projected IOD-like pattern of mean changes and frequency increase of extreme pIOD events are largely artifacts of model errors and unlikely to emerge in the future. These results illustrate that a robust projection may still be biased and it is important to consider the model bias effect. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Circulation/Dynamics; Climate change; Climate models; Geographic location/entity; Indian Ocean; Model evaluation/performance; Models and modeling; Physical Meteorology and Climatology","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Eastern equatorial Indian ocean; Geographic location; Indian ocean; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Model evaluation/performance; Regional climate projections; Climate change; air-sea interaction; atmospheric circulation; circulation; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; disaster management; extreme event; warming; weather forecasting; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017156021

Environmental benefits, however, have not been quantified previously. The objective of this study was to estimate the environmental impact of sensor-based N fertilization of corn using model-based environmental Life Cycle Assessment. Nitrogen rate and corn grain yield were measured during a sensor-based, variable N-rate experiment in Lincoln County, MO. Spatially explicit soil properties were derived using a predictive modeling technique based on in-field soil sampling. Soil N2O emissions, volatilized NH3 loss, and soil NO3 - leaching were predicted at 60 discrete field locations using the DeNitrification- DeComposition (DNDC) model. Life cycle cumulative energy consumption, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, and eutrophication potential were estimated using model predictions, experimental data, and life cycle data. In this experiment, variable-rate N management reduced total N fertilizer use by 11% without decreasing grain yield. Precision application of N is predicted to have reduced soil N2O emissions by 10%, volatilized NH3 loss by 23%, and NO3 - leaching by 16%, which in turn reduced life cycle nonrenewable energy consumption, GWP, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential by 7, 10, 22, and 16%, respectively. Although mean N losses were reduced, the variations in N losses were increased compared with conventional, uniform N application. Crop canopy sensor-based, variable-rate N fertilization was predicted to increase corn grain N use efficiency while simultaneously reducing total life-cycle energy use, GWP, acidification, and eutrophication. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"Acidification; Crops; Energy utilization; Eutrophication; Global warming; Grain (agricultural product); Leaching; Life cycle; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soils; Crop canopy reflectance; Cumulative energy consumption; Denitrification decompositions (DNDC); Environmental benefits; Environmental life cycle assessment; Eutrophication potentials; Global warming potential; Precision applications; Environmental impact; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; fertilizer; nitrogen; accuracy; acidification; agricultural management; Article; canopy; case study; crop; decomposition; denitrification; energy consumption; environmental impact; eutrophication; fertilization; grain yield; greenhouse effect; leaching; life cycle assessment; maize; prediction; sampling; sensor; soil property; volatilization; agriculture; Colorado; maize; soil; Agriculture; Colorado; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960459013
