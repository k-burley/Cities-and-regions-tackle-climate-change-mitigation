However, the degree to which important maize processes such as biomass growth rate, growing season length (GSL) and grain formation are impacted by an increase in temperature is uncertain. Such knowledge is necessary to understand yield responses and develop crop adaptation strategies under warmer climate. Here crop models, satellite observations, survey, and field data were integrated to investigate how high temperature stress influences maize yield in the U.S. Midwest. We showed that both observational evidence and crop model ensemble mean (MEM) suggests the nonlinear sensitivity in yield was driven by the intensified sensitivity of harvest index (HI), but MEM underestimated the warming effects through HI and overstated the effects through GSL. Further analysis showed that the intensified sensitivity in HI mainly results from a greater sensitivity of yield to high temperature stress during the grain filling period, which explained more than half of the yield reduction. When warming effects were decomposed into direct heat stress and indirect water stress (WS), observational data suggest that yield is more reduced by direct heat stress (−4.6 ± 1.0%/°C) than by WS (−1.7 ± 0.65%/°C), whereas MEM gives opposite results. This discrepancy implies that yield reduction by heat stress is underestimated, whereas the yield benefit of increasing atmospheric CO2might be overestimated in crop models, because elevated CO2 brings yield benefit through water conservation effect but produces limited benefit over heat stress. Our analysis through integrating data and crop models suggests that future adaptation strategies should be targeted at the heat stress during grain formation and changes in agricultural management need to be better accounted for to adequately estimate the effects of heat stress. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","crop model; crop phenological stages; harvest index; high temperature stress; satellite observations; water stress","agricultural management; carbon dioxide enrichment; crop yield; harvesting; high temperature; maize; nonlinearity; phenology; satellite data; temperature effect; Midwest; United States; Zea mays; agriculture; food grain; heat; maize; temperature; Agriculture; Edible Grain; Hot Temperature; Temperature; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065420855

An assessment of irrigation performance, water productivity, and irrigation schedules is critical to water conservation in dry climates. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to compare soil water balance in a flood-irrigated wheat-maize rotation system during the growing season of 2015–2016. We then modeled the soil water balance and improved irrigation strategies by coupling Hydrus-1D with the CROPWAT model, and using evapotranspiration calculated from climatic data. The calibrated Hydrus-1D model was used to simulate the temporal and spatial variation of evapotranspiration and deep percolation based on measured soil water distribution of soil profiles in the unsaturated zone. Results showed that using soil hydraulic parameters from inversion modeling can simulate soil water flow in multi-layer soil during a crop growing season. Simulation results indicated that about 36.6 and 40.6% (478.6 and 680.1 mm)of total water input in 2015 and 2016, respectively, was consumed by evapotranspiration. Furthermore, simulated deep percolation amounted for approximately 32.3 and 42.9% (403.9 and 696.6 mm)of the total amount of irrigation water in 2015 and 2016, respectively. These results indicated that only a small proportion of irrigation water was used by crops for transpiration. In addition, irrigation performance indicators such as relative water supply, relative irrigation supply, depleted fraction, and overall consumed ratio values indicated poor performance of irrigation practices in the study area. Particularly, crop yields did not increase with increases in irrigation water in flood-irrigated fields during the last ten years. Results of the CROPWAT model indicated that combinations of a fixed irrigation depth and timing, of 40 mm every 10 days, and 50 mm every 10 days were reasonable for wheat and maize, respectively, given the sandy soil in the study area. The improved irrigation strategies will limit water irrigation loss to 20% without significant effects on crop yields. This study provides an alternative approach for estimating deep percolation and crop water requirements supporting management efforts in water conservation in dry climates. © 2019","CROPWAT model; Deep percolation; Hydrus-1D model; Irrigation schedules; Soil water dynamic","Crops; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Floods; Flow of water; Irrigation; Soil moisture; Solvents; Water conservation; Water supply; Water supply systems; Cropwat models; Deep percolation; HYDRUS-1D; Irrigation schedule; Soil water dynamics; Soil surveys; arid region; crop production; crop rotation; crop yield; dry season; evapotranspiration; flood; growing season; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; maize; model; one-dimensional modeling; percolation; sandy soil; soil water; water budget; wheat; China; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065513597

While existing literature has identified links between carbon dioxide emissions and urbanization, the impacts of various mechanisms in various urbanization subsystems (economic, demographic, spatial, and social urbanization) on carbon dioxide emissions remain largely unexplored. This study conducts a comprehensive assessment of the multiple effects of urbanization on carbon dioxide emissions in the Yangtze River Delta, based on city panel remote sensing and statistical data covering the years 1992 to 2013. A stepwise panel data model was applied in combination with environmental Kuznets curve theory, so as to address four aspects of urbanization. The results show that carbon dioxide emissions increased notably in the Yangtze River Delta from 141.01 million tons in 1992 to 1448.28 million tons in 2013, and Shanghai and Suzhou were the largest two emitters in region. The impacts of urbanization on carbon dioxide emissions varied with different subsystems of urbanization. Economic urbanization exerted a positive impact in relation to carbon dioxide emissions with the relation between carbon dioxide emissions and gross domestic product per capita showing a Kuznets curve association. Population urbanization has exerted two opposing effects on carbon dioxide emissions, and population density and the proportion of urban population play a negative and positive role respectively. Spatial urbanization was here positively associated with carbon dioxide emissions, a result of the effects of the construction of new infrastructures and the conversion of existing land uses. Social urbanization demonstrated negative correlations in relation to emissions, mainly by improving low-carbon awareness in the general public. The effects of social consumption were insignificant. In addition, a number of control variables were also estimated to have varied effects on carbon dioxide emissions. The different influences of urbanization must, our findings indicate be considered in the task of formulating emission reduction measures for the Yangtze River Delta. Our analysis casts new light on the importance of exploring the multiple effects of urbanization in relation to emissions, knowledge which is vital to building low-carbon cities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Kuznets curve; Panel data model; Urbanization; Yangtze River Delta","Economic and social effects; Emission control; Global warming; Land use; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Rivers; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Kuznets curve; Panel data models; Urbanization; Yangtze river delta; Carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; delta; emission inventory; Kuznets curve; panel data; urbanization; Article; awareness; carbon footprint; China; correlational study; energy conservation; land use; population density; priority journal; remote sensing; river ecosystem; social aspect; urbanization; China; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066055831

Here we studied the physiological performance and non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) dynamics of a small xeric tree species, Haloxylon ammodendron (C.A.Mey.) of different tree size with varying rooting depth, during summer drought. We measured predawn (ψpd) and midday (ψm) leaf water potential, osmotic potential at saturated turgor (π100), and turgor lost point (ψtlp), stomatal conductance (gs) at noon, maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) in the morning, and NSCs concentration, from June-September. Our results demonstrated that the summer drought reduces the overall performance of physiological traits of the small young trees more than the larger adult trees. ψpd, gs and Fv/Fm dropped larger in the small-diameter groups than the larger diameter groups. Substantial osmotic adjustments were observed in small size individuals (with lower π 100 and ψtlp) to cope with summer drought. Furthermore, mean concentration of NSCs for the leaf and shoot were higher in September than in July in every basal stem diameter classes suggested the leaf and shoot acted as reserve for NSC. However the root NSCs concentrations within each basal stem diameter class exhibited less increase in September than in the July. At the same time, the small young tress had lower root NSCs concentrations than the larger adult tree in both July and September. The contrasting root NSC concentrations across the basal stem diameter classes indicated that the roots of smaller trees may be more vulnerable to carbon starvation under non-lethal summer drought. The significant positive relationship between rooting depth and physiological traits &amp; root NSCs concentration emphasize the importance of rooting depth in determining the seasonal variation of water status, gas exchange and NSCs. © 2019 by the author.","Drought; Leaf water potential; Non-structural carbohydrates; Root depth; Tree size","Carbohydrates; Carbon; Drought; Osmosis; Physiology; Plants (botany); Haloxylon ammodendron; Leaf water potential; Non-structural carbohydrates; Photochemical efficiency; Physiological trait; Root depth; Stomatal conductance; Tree size; Forestry; angiosperm; carbohydrate; carbon; climate effect; concentration (composition); drought; drought resistance; growth response; mortality; nutrient availability; plant water relations; rooting; size effect; summer; tree; Carbohydrates; Carbon; Drought; Forestry; Osmosis; Physiology; Haloxylon ammodendron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073888328

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) observations have previously been used to estimate individual power plant emissions with a Gaussian plume model assuming constant wind fields. The present work assesses the feasibility of estimating power plant CO2 emission using high resolution chemistry transport model simulations with OCO-2 observation data. In the new framework, 1.33 km Weather Research and Forecasting-Chem (WRF)-Chem simulation results are used to calculate the Jacobian matrix, which is then used with the OCO-2 XCO2 data to obtain power plant daily mean emission rates, through a maximum likelihood estimation. We applied the framework to the seven OCO-2 observations of near mid-to-large coal burning power plants identified in Nassar et al (2017 Geophys. Res. Lett. 44, 10045-53). Our estimation results closely match the reported emission rates at the Westar power plant (Kansas, USA), with a reported value of 26.67 ktCO2/day, and our estimated value at 25.82-26.47 ktCO2/day using OCO-2 v8 data, and 22.09-22.80 ktCO2/day using v9 data. At Ghent, KY, USA, our estimations using three versions (v7, v8, and v9) range from 9.84-20.40 ktCO2/day, which are substantially lower than the reported value (29.17 ktCO2/day). We attribute this difference to diminished WRF-Chem wind field simulation accuracy. The results from the seven cases indicate that accurate estimation requires accurate meteorological simulations and high quality XCO2 data. In addition, the strength and orientation (relative to the OCO-2 ground track) of the XCO2 enhancement are important for accurate and reliable estimation. Compared with the Gaussian plume model based approach, the high resolution WRF-Chem simulation based approach provides a framework for addressing varying wind fields, and possible expansion to city level emission estimation. © Her Majesty, the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of the Environment, 2019.","CO2; power plant carbon dioxide emission; WRF-Chem simulations","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Industrial poisons; Jacobian matrices; Maximum likelihood estimation; Potassium alloys; Weather forecasting; Yttrium alloys; Carbon dioxide emissions; Chemistry transport model; Coal-burning power plants; Fossil fuel combustion; Meteorological simulations; Simulation based approaches; Weather research and forecasting; WRF-Chem simulations; Fossil fuel power plants; accuracy assessment; burning; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; chemical composition; coal combustion; maximum likelihood analysis; pollutant transport; power plant; simulation; Kansas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072690987

Analyses of several indicators, including changes in NDVI in different slopes and land use changes and the relationships between climatic factors and NDVI change, were presented to quantitatively evaluate the effects of agriculture, climate, and policy on NDVI change. The NDVI in the Zuli River Basin increased during the study period, and the main contributors to this change were forest in 1999–2011, cropland, abandoned farmland, and grassland in 2009–2016, and land with slopes ≤ 15°. Land with slope > 15°, where the “Project” was implemented, slightly contributed to the increase in regional NDVI. In 1999–2011, the project (−98.16%) combined with climate change (−68.18%) showed negative effects on the increase in NDVI in the Zuli River Basin, but agriculture (22.28%) played a positive role in increasing this index. In 2009–2016 and 1999–2016, the project (38.45% and 35.25%, respectively), the project combined with climate change (49.83% and 46.30%, respectively), agriculture (18.61% and 23.30%, respectively), promoted increases in NDVI in the basin. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agriculture; climatic factors; Grain for Green Project; land-use change; vegetation index","environmental factor; land use; land use change; NDVI; river basin; satellite data; semiarid region; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Gansu; Loess Plateau; Zuli River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060217669

This paper investigates the effect of several determinants on carbon emissions per capita in Chinese cities. Non-normally distributed and heterogeneous features of carbon emissions per capita in Chinese cities are considerably important. The empirical results demonstrate that GDP per capita has an increasingly positive impact on carbon emissions per capita due to the growth in household consumption. Urbanization has a slightly decreasing positive effect on carbon emissions per capita with a quantile increase resulting from continuous highway construction. Industrialization has a decreasing positive effect with carbon emission per capita quantile increases because of increasing energy efficiency and lower costs related to carbon reductions. The population has a decreasing negative effect on carbon emissions because of people’s increasing demand for environmental safety. The distributions of emissions per capita conditional on the 10th and 90th quantiles of independent variables also vary considerably. Specific policy implications are provided based on these results. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon emissions accounting; Chinese cities; panel quantile regression; STIRPAT model","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; Gross Domestic Product; panel data; regression analysis; urban area; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065436428

How leaf surface characteristics affect the resuspension of settled APM on the leaf surface has been rarely studied. Therefore, the resuspension of APM after settling on plant leaves was analyzed using four common urban greening species, including Prunus triloba, Platanus acerifolia, Lonicera maackii, and Cercis chinensis. The results show that the leaf hair density has a significantly positive correlation with the maximum particulate matter (PM) retention and natural PM retention (p &lt; 0.05). Under the same wind speed, the proportions of the resuspended PM that settled on the leaf surfaces of the four plant species increase with the wind blowing time. During the same wind blowing time, the resuspension rate of the settled PM on leaf surfaces of P. triloba, P. acerifolia, and L. maackii increase with the wind speed. The leaf hair and stomatal density is negatively correlated to the resuspension rate of PM under the wind speed of 1 m s−1 (p &lt; 0.05), and the stomatal density is also negatively correlated to the resuspension rate of PM under the wind speed of 5 m s−1 for 10 min or 20 min (p &lt; 0.05). However, as the wind speed further increase, the leaf characteristics are no longer correlated to the resuspension rate of PM (p &gt; 0.05). These results indicate that when the wind force (wind speed + wind blowing time) is small, the stomatal density and leaf hair density have a significant effect on APM resuspension. When the wind force is large, the influence of leaf surface structure on APM resuspension becomes less profound. APM resuspension is comprehensively affected by the external wind and the leaf surface characteristics, and these two factors jointly determine the fate of the PM after it settles on leaves. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Leaf hair; PM retention capacity; Resuspension; Stomata","atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; dicotyledon; greenspace; leaf; meteorology; particulate matter; stomata; wind velocity; Cercis chinensis; Lonicera maackii; Platanus x acerifolia; Prunus triloba; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; plant leaf; procedures; surface property; wind; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Surface Properties; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065641318

This article fills the gaps by exploring how courts in China, an authoritarian country with a civil law tradition, react to government climate policies and how this judicial response might affect relevant legal rules and eventually contribute to climate regulation. An empirical analysis of 177 Chinese judicial cases reveals that CCL in China consists mostly of contract-based civil actions steered by the government's low-carbon policies. Moreover, although the prospects of CCL against public authorities in China remain very bleak, there is scope for the emergence of tort-based CCL, backed by government policies. In this respect, recent tort-based public interest litigation on air pollution in China may serve as a substitute or, more promisingly, a gateway to the emergence of a tort-based branch of Chinese CCL. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","Air pollution; China; Climate change litigation; Climate law; Public interest litigation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066425513

Thus, it is of great significance to study the responses of crops to climate change, especially for the winter wheat in the North China Plain (NCP), which accounts for about 75% of wheat production in China and is vulnerable to climate change. Knowledge of current changes and responses of crops to climate changes are critical for developing strategies to address climate change challenges. In this paper, the long-term Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) was used to study wheat coverage changes and its responses to heatwave events in the NCP. The results indicate that the NDVI show significant increasing trends for most of the wheat planting areas during 1983-2014. In addition, as indicated by the SHI heatwave index, the heatwave days of almost all the study region show significant increasing trends. The increase of the heatwave days during wheat growing season would strikingly decrease the annual NDVI at a rate of -0.33% when heatwave days increase one day per year. © 2019 IEEE.","climate change; heatwave; NCP; NDVI; wheat","Agricultural robots; Crops; Food supply; Geology; Remote sensing; Agricultural practices; Developing strategy; Global food security; Global inventories; heatwave; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; wheat; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077684266

However, epidemiological evidence from children and adolescents is limited. We investigated the associations between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM)air pollution and blood pressure in a large population of children and adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed in a nationally representative sample consisting of 43,745 children and adolescents aged 7 to 18 years in seven provinces in China. Exposure to ambient fine particles (PM2.5)and thoracic particles (PM10)was estimated using spatiotemporal models based on satellite remote sensing, meteorological data and land use information. Mixed-effects (two-level)linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between PM exposure and systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)and hypertension. Results: After adjustment for a wide range of covariates, every 10 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration was associated with 1.46 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05, 2.88]and 1.36 (95% CI: 0.34, 2.39)mmHg increases in SBP, respectively. PM10 was also associated with higher prevalence of hypertension [odds ratio per 10 μg/m3 increment: 1.45 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.95)]. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to ambient PM air pollution was associated with increased blood pressure and higher prevalence of hypertension in children and adolescents. Our findings support air pollution reduction strategies as a prevention measure of childhood hypertension, a well-recognized risk factor of future cardiovascular health. © 2019 The Authors","Adolescents; Air pollution; Blood pressure; Children; Hypertension; Particulate matter","Air pollution; Blood; Blood pressure; Health risks; Land use; Logistic regression; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Adolescents; Ambient particulate Matter; Children; Hypertension; Logistic regression models; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations; Systolic blood pressure(SBP); Particles (particulate matter); ambient air; atmospheric pollution; child health; hypertension; particulate matter; pollution exposure; young population; adolescent; adult; air pollution; air pollution control; ambient air; Article; child; China; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; environmental exposure; female; geographic distribution; human; hypertension; land use; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; population research; prevalence; priority journal; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; systolic blood pressure; blood pressure; hypertension; odds ratio; particulate matter; risk factor; toxicity; China; Adolescent; Blood Pressure; Child; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Hypertension; Odds Ratio; Particulate Matter; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064597237

This study first analyzes the main influencing factors of Baoding's emissions, and then predicts its CO2 emissions peak and its time under different scenarios. Results show that (1) CO2 emissions from industrial production account for more than 80% of the total emissions, and those from six energy-consuming industries account for more than 40% of the total emissions in the city. (2) Economic growth has significantly contributed to the growth of CO2 emissions, whereas industrial structure and population growth have little contributions; energy intensity is the main negative factor for emissions growth, whereas the inhibiting effect of energy structure is not evident. (3)Based on the back propagation (BP) model, the city's CO2 emissions peak will be 59.74 million tons in 2024 under the low-speed and low-carbon scenario; under the moderate-speed and benchmark scenario, it will continue to grow and reach 63.06 million tons in 2040; under high-speed and high-carbon scenario, the city's CO2 emissions will reach 80.18 million tons in 2040.

However, the paucity of dust deposition data precludes our ability to adequately verify estimations of dust deposition. Based on the environmental monitoring records in Xinjiang Province, northwest China, we conducted a numerical simulation of dust deposition using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and compared observed and modelled deposition during the spring dust season (March–May). The performance of WRF-Chem on modelling dust deposition was tested and evaluated with adoption of Georgia Tech/Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) and Shao et al. (2011a) dust emission schemes. Our results indicate that the dry deposition schemes have the capability to predict size-resolved dust deposition. However, modelled and measured dust deposition differed by more than one order of magnitude. The modelled dust dry deposition does not satisfactorily agree well with field measurements. This study suggests significant distinctions exist among these two dust emission schemes when simulating mineral dust dry deposition in northwest China. Uncertainties in estimating the dry dust deposition are in a range of 77–96%. These uncertainties imply that parameterization in the current dust deposition schemes need to be further improved. We found that the estimation of dust deposition is highly underestimated by the Global Climate Model and Regional Climate Model (GCM/RCM).

Consumption of energy derived from coal, oil, and natural gas forms the main source of China's major air pollutants, SO2 and NOX, as well as the major greenhouse gas CO2. The energy structure adjustment approach provides a sensible way, not only to achieve climate change mitigation and air pollutant reduction, but also to reduce abatement costs. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization method was adopted in order to analyze the collaborative optimization of emissions and abatement costs for both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. As a typical industrial city and economic center with fossil fuels as its main energy source, Tianjin of China is used as the research sample to prove that this method can mitigate air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions and reduce abatement costs. Through demonstration, the results show that the optimization method proposed can reduce SO2, NOX, and CO2 emissions by 27,000 tons, 33,000 tons, and 29,000 tons, respectively, and the abatement costs will be reduced by 620 million yuan by adjusting the energy structure of Tianjin. The proposed method also suggests that China can achieve reductions of abatement cost and greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions under the proposed energy structure. The results indicate that collaborative optimization would help China and other countries cope with climate change while improving domestic air quality. © 2019 by the authors.","Abatement cost; Collaborative optimization; Emission reduction; Energy structure; Multi-objective optimization","abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; optimization; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073907705

Expansion of the large-scale multiple cropping system as a consequence of climate warming could be a major driving force of this increase. In this study, life cycle assessment was employed to identify agricultural GHG emissions due to the expansion of the multiple cropping system in the North China Plain and neighboring regions. We found that agricultural greenhouse gas emissions have increased from41.34 to 120.87 TgCO2-eq/yr over the past 30 years, and the expansion of the multiple cropping system has contributed to 13.89% of this increment. Furthermore, the increases in straw handling and agricultural inputs which are related to multiple cropping systems have also played an important role. Results of our study demonstrate that the expansion of the multiple cropping system contributes considerably to increases in agricultural GHG emissions in the North China Plain and neighboring regions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sustained northward expansion of the multiple cropping system will further elevate agricultural GHG emissions in China, and this should be considered while formulating policies to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture. © 2019 by the authors.","China; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Multiple cropping system","agricultural emission; cropping practice; greenhouse gas; international agreement; life cycle analysis; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072612108

The wide range of interactions including van der Waals interaction and chemical bonding in α-MoO3 as well as between methane and the catalyst surface makes the accurate description of the methane chemistry a challenge. Herein, we performed a strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN)-functional based density functional theory study of the surface chemistry and reactivity of α-MoO3 toward C-H bond activation of methane. With this meta-generalized-gradient approximation functional, we can predict the bulk structure of α-MoO3 more accurately while reproducing the thermal chemistry of MoO3. The results indicate that surface reduction of α-MoO3 (010) occurs preferably through releasing the terminal oxygen atoms, generating oxygen vacancies while exposing reduced Mo centers. These oxygen vacancies tend to be separated from each other at a higher density due to repulsive interactions. Furthermore, the reduced α-MoO3 (010) promotes methane activation kinetically by reducing the activation barrier for the break of the first C-H bond and thermodynamically by stabilizing the product state as compared with those on the stoichiometric surface. There is a synergy between the reduced Mo active site and surface lattice oxygen for C-H bond cleavage. Our results also show that the reactivity based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional is qualitatively consistent with that from the SCAN functional. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Catalysts; Chemical activation; Chemical bonds; Methane; Molybdenum oxide; Oxygen vacancies; Surface chemistry; Van der Waals forces; Activation barriers; Density functional theory studies; Meta generalized gradient approximations; Molybdenum trioxide; Perdew-burke-ernzerhof; Repulsive interactions; Stoichiometric surfaces; Van Der Waals interactions; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070097185

Precipitation washing PM off from plants is regarded as filter cleaning, which is a key factor for recovering the function of foliar PM filtering. However, it is uncertain on how much PM can be total filtered by urban trees due to lack of understanding about how PM deposition, removal, resuspension and redeposition interact with species and rainfall variability. For this reason, we developed a study to determine foliar PM removal amount and rate of different sizes for five plant species commonly used for urban greening by simulated different rainfall regimes. Our specific objectives were to: (1) explore the difference in PM removal between different plant species and different rainfall patterns; (2) understand the response of foliar PM removal as a function of rainfall characteristics; and (3) quantify the relationship between foliar PM removal rate and leaf coarseness. Results showed that significant differences (P < 0.05) in PM removal amount and rate were found not only between different species within the same rainfall pattern, but also between different rainfall patterns for the same species. PM removal rates from the leaf surface were significantly correlated with rainfall intensity (P < 0.01). Different size PM cumulative removal rate exhibited an exponential loss with rainfall duration (P < 0.01). For smooth leaf surfaces, long duration-low intensity rainfall could increase PM removal rate while for rough leaf surfaces, short duration-high intensity rainfall could achieve a larger removal rate using the same amount of total rainfall. Additionally, more PM was removed by rainfall than that by water washing. The findings from this study have implications for better estimating long-term air purification potential of urban plants, and for air phytoremediation planning in urban areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air purification ability; Leaf coarseness; Particulate matter; PM deposition; PM removal rate; Rainfall variability","Air cleaners; Bioremediation; Deposition; Forestry; Particles (particulate matter); Soil pollution control; Urban planning; Washing; Leaf coarseness; Particulate Matter; PM removal; Purification ability; Rainfall variability; Rain; rain; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; bioaccumulation; biofiltration; leaf; particulate matter; pollutant removal; purification; rainfall; urban ecosystem; Article; atmosphere; Euonymus; Euonymus japonicus; leaf surface; nonhuman; particulate matter; phytoremediation; Pinus tabulaeformis; Platanus acerifolia; Populus; Populus tomentosa; priority journal; Sophora japonica; tree; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064154853

However, these models are often unreliable and have poor performance at large scales and in complicated catchments. This study tried to improve stormwater quality models by adopting the genetic programming (GP) approach to generate new build-up algorithms for three different pollutants (total suspend solids – TSS, total phosphorus – TP and total nitrogen – TN). This was followed by testing of the new models (also traditional build-up and wash-off models as benchmark) using data collected from different catchments in Australia and the USA. The GP approach informed new sets of build-up algorithms with the inclusion of not just the typical antecedent dry weather period (ADWP), but also other less ‘traditional’ variables - previous rainfall depth for TSS and maximum air temperatures for TP and TN simulation. The traditional models had relatively poor performance (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, E < 0.0), except for TP at Gilby Road (GR) (E = 0.21 in calibration and 0.43 in validation). Improved performance was observed using the models with new build-up algorithms informed by GP. Taking TP at GR for example, the best performing model had E of 0.46 in calibration and 0.54 in validation. The best performing models for TSS, TP, and TN are often different, suggesting that specific models shall be used for different pollutants. Insights into further improvements possible for stormwater quality models were given. It is recommended that in addition to the typical build-up and wash-off process, new generations of stormwater quality models should be able to account for the non-conventional pollutant sources (e.g. cross-connections, septic tank leakage, illegal discharges) through stochastic approaches. Emission inventories with information like intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) of pollutant loads from each type of non-conventional source are suggested to be built for stochastic modelling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Non-conventional sources; Pollution emission; Stochastic modelling; Stormwater quality model; Temperature","storm water; rain; air temperature; algorithm; catchment; emission; modeling; stochasticity; stormwater; testing method; water quality; air temperature; algorithm; Article; build up algorithm; catchment; environmental monitoring; flow measurement; genetic programming approach; machine learning; natural selection; runoff; stormwater pollution; water pollution; algorithm; Australia; water flow; water pollutant; Australia; Algorithms; Australia; Environmental Monitoring; Rain; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064206400

By applying the latest 2012 Chinese multi-regional input–output table, this study evaluated the impacts of carbon tax on tax burdens and sectoral competitiveness in Chinese provinces when considering either production-based or consumption-based emissions. Our results indicated that, in the scenario of cutting production tax for carbon tax, the developed provinces, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, who are much bigger payers of production tax, are net beneficiaries of carbon tax. In contrast, recycling the tax revenues to low-income households makes the less-developed provinces in the central and western China become net revenue receivers. Furthermore, for competitiveness effects, the emission intensive sectors, such as Electricity and hot water production and supply, Petroleum and gas, and Metal products, are impacted vitally under both accounting principles in all provinces. Nevertheless, compared with the production-based principle, a consumption-based carbon tax could reduce the unfavorable competitiveness effects of most affected sectors in the less-developed provinces, while slightly increasing those effects in the developed provinces. Our results provide new information on the regional impacts of carbon tax based two different accounting principles with different tax revenue recycling scenarios. © 2019 The Society for Policy Modeling","Accounting principles; Carbon emissions; China; Multi-regional input–output analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063236863

However, wind tower infrastructure is susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as tropical cyclones and thunderstorms. Under the context of global climate changes and intense weather events, it is imperative to assess the impacts of extreme conditions on the susceptibility of the global wind power with important implications on energy security and power system resilience. In this paper, we discuss the necessity and rationality of wind power deployment considering extreme weather perspectives on enhancing the global sustainability, security, economics, and resilience. We assess the vulnerability of wind power to extreme weather events under climate change and present the correlation of wind power proliferation, extreme weather events, and climate change issues. Our results indicate that, if extreme wind speed increases by 20% considering a 50-year return wind speed and load safety factor is changed from 1.35 to 1.7, the initial capital cost of wind unit installation by the end of this century could increase by about 12% because of the higher strength in tropical cyclones. In this period, upward lightning strike will be intensified due to the use of taller wind turbines and higher angular speed of blades. Also, additional storm surges and sea ices will potentially cause higher risks to inland and offshore wind tower structures and foundations because of the continuously rising sea levels. It is confirmed in our discussion that the proliferation of wind power generation would be beneficial despite its vulnerabilities by curbing the use of fossil-based power generation units, mitigating severe carbon emission, and reducing climatic changes and extreme weather events, which could also cause significant structural damages to wind turbines installations globally. The article concludes that it is vital in the scientific community to further analyze the relationship among global wind energy integration, extreme weather events, and climate changes, and for politicians to formulate a comprehensive energy policy strategy, as engineers continue to investigate the means of deploying additional inland and offshore wind farms and consider other types of renewable energy resources with a direct link with weather conditions, for a sustainable, economic, secure, and resilient energy production. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Extreme weather; Sustainability; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066128414

In this paper, the Tapio decoupling model is used to study the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth in six different scale cities, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Xianyang, Qinhuangdao, Shizuishan and Jinchang. The conclusions are as follows: the greater the scale of the city, the stronger ability of decoupling; compared with the population, the per capita GDP, the industrial structure has the most positive effect on the decoupling; only the energy intensity has a negative effect, but the effect is greater. Therefore, we should focus on industrial structure optimization and energy intensity reduction. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Compared to conventional taxis, e-taxis require frequent recharging and each charge takes half an hour to several hours, which may result in unpredictable number of working taxis on the street. In current systems, E-taxi drivers usually charge their vehicles when the battery level is below a certain threshold, and then make a full charge. Although this charging strategy directly decreases the number of charges and the time to visit charging stations, our study reveals that it also significantly reduces the availability of number of taxis during busy hours with our data driven analysis. To meet dynamic passenger demand, we propose a new charging strategy: proactive partial charging (p^2 Charging), which allows an e-taxi to get partially charged before its remaining battery level is running too low. Based on this strategy, we propose a charging scheduling framework for e-taxis to meet dynamic passenger demand in spatial-temporal dimensions as much as possible while minimizing idle time to travel to charging stations and waiting time at charging stations. This work implements and evaluate our solution with large datasets that consist of (i) 7,228 regular internal combustion engine taxis and 726 e-taxis, (ii) an automatic taxi payment transaction collection system with total 62,100 records per day, (iii) charging station system, including 37 working charging stations over the city. The evaluation results show that p^2 Charging improves the ratio of unserved passengers by up to 83.2% on average and increases e-taxi utilization by up to 34.6% compared with ground truth and existing charging strategies. © 2019 IEEE.","Charging demand and supply; Electric taxis; Passenger demand and taxi supply; Proactive and partial charging","Distributed computer systems; Large dataset; Secondary batteries; Taxicabs; Charging demands; Charging strategies; Data-driven analysis; Evaluation results; Metropolitan cities; Passenger demands; Payment transactions; Scheduling frameworks; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074831869

Synthetic microbial communities provide reduced-complexity models that allow an examination of ecological theories under defined and controlled conditions. In this study, we applied a multiphasic approach to study synthetic methane-oxidizing communities and species interactions as proxies to the natural communities. Our results confirm that, under selective pressures, natural-sediment communities of high complexity simplify rapidly, selecting for several major functional guilds, the major partners in methane oxidation being the Methylococcaceae methanotrophs and the Methylophilaceae methylotrophs, along with minor but persistent partners, members of Burkholderiales and Flavobacteriales. As a proof of concept, we established minimalist synthetic communities that were representative of the four functional guilds to demonstrate the dependency of the non-methane-utilizing species on the methanotrophs as the primary carbon-providing species. We observed that in communities consisting of multiple representatives of the key guilds, members of the same guild appeared to compete for resources. For example, when two methanotrophs of the same family were present, the two expressed similar key methanotrophy pathways and responded similarly to changing environmental conditions, suggesting that they perform a similar keystone function in situ. Similar observations were made for the Methylophilaceae. However, differences were noted in the expression of auxiliary and unique genes among strains of the same functional guild, reflecting differential adaptation and suggesting mechanisms for competition. At the same time, differences were also noted in the performances of partners with specific metabolic schemes. For example, a mutant of Methylotenera mobilis impaired in nitrate utilization behaved as a more efficient cooperator in methane consumption, suggesting that the loss of function may lead to changes in communal behavior. Overall, we demonstrate the robust nature of synthetic communities built of native lake sediment strains and their utility in addressing important ecological questions while using a simplified model. © 2019 Yu et al.","Methane oxidation; Methanotrophs; Species interactions; Synthetic community","methane; carbon; methane; nitrogen; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; Burkholderiales; controlled study; down regulation; Flavobacteriales; flow cytometry; gene expression; lake sediment; metagenomics; methanotroph; Methylococcaceae; Methylophilaceae; methylotroph; microbial community; nonhuman; organismal interaction; oxidation; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; synthesis; transcriptomics; carbon cycle; Flavobacteriaceae; genetics; lake; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; organismal interaction; oxidation reduction reaction; sediment; Burkholderiales; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Flavobacteriaceae; Geologic Sediments; Lakes; Methane; Methylococcaceae; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070452024

It is important to ascertain the impacts of the anthropogenic precursors and the effectiveness of air quality management in the region based on long-term air quality trends independent of meteorological influences. In this study, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filtering, a technique used to separate different scales of motion in a time series, was applied to analyze the time series of the maximum daily 8-h running average for O3 (MDA8) from 16 cities in the YRD during 2013–2017, and its trends and driving factors were discussed. Results of the KZ filtering revealed that the short-term, seasonal and long-term components of O3 account for 54.2%, 43.4%, and 2.3% of the total variance, respectively. Long-term component of MDA8 in the YRD is comparable to that of Los Angeles in the 1990s and the most recent 4 years, and is much higher than those of Berlin, Paris and London. The long-term trend in the YRD indicates that MDA8 underwent a large increase during 2013–2017, at average rates of 1.35–8.14 μg m−3/yr for specific cities. Only Taizhou in Zhejiang Province had a decreasing trend of −0.69 μg m−3/yr. This pattern could be attributed to emission changes of O3 precursors (76.7%), particularly a reduction in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and an increase in the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Large decreases in particulate matter were estimated to be responsible for O3 increases of 22% on average for cities in the YRD, impling that further decreases in NOx and VOCs emissions are necessary in order to overcome the effect of decreasing PM2.5 causing an increase in ozone. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Aerosols; KZ filter; Meteorological conditions; Surface ozone; Trend",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067882030

Therefore, accurately assessing the effect of this policy has become extremely important for low-carbon development. This article analyses the impact of implementing LCPI on regional carbon emissions by using Guangdong Province as the study area, which has the largest economic scale, population size and carbon emissions amongst China's low-carbon pilot provinces. The results suggest that for the entire 2010-2015 period, Guangdong's carbon emissions were reduced by about 10% due to the implementation of LCPI. This policy produced a significant impact on the carbon emissions from manufacturing industries but showed minimal impact on the carbon emissions from energy production. Unlike previous researchers who relied on estimations, the authors of this work obtained unified carbon emissions data for 1997-2015 from the China Emission Accounts and Datasets and then constructed comparison groups by using the synthetic control method instead of performing a subjective selection. The authors also examined the impact of LCPI on carbon emissions from different sources. This article proposes that policy support and low-carbon action are necessary for reducing regional carbon emissions and that the policies must be constantly adjusted during their implementation. The successful experiences in low-carbon pilots are also worth exploring and promoting in other regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Low-carbon pilot initiative; Policy effect evaluation; Synthetic control method","carbon emission; climate change; emission control; energy efficiency; global climate; manufacturing; population size; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073904993

This study also quantitatively analyzes the contribution rate of each driving factor by using logarithmic mean Divisia index. Results show that per capita GDP and energy consumption per unit of GDP are the key factors that lead to changes in carbon emissions. Then, the input-oriented BCC model in data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to evaluate the efficiency of the primary carbon emission allowance allocation scheme in the “13th Five-Year Plan”. The results show that the average score of technical efficiencies is only 0.7409. Finally, the zero-sum-gains DEA model is used to adjust and optimize the scheme under the premise of constant total carbon emissions.

Few randomized controlled interventions of cookstoves (biomass or otherwise) have quantitatively characterized changes in exposure and indicators of cardiometabolic health, a growing and understudied burden in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Ideally, the solution is to transition households to clean cooking, such as with electric or liquefied petroleum gas stoves; however, those unable to afford or to access these options will continue to burn biomass for the foreseeable future. Wood-burning cookstove designs such as the Justa (incorporating an engineered combustion zone and chimney) have the potential to substantially reduce air pollution exposures. Previous cookstove intervention studies have been limited by stove types that did not substantially reduce exposures and/or by low cookstove adoption and sustained use, and few studies have incorporated community-engaged approaches to enhance the intervention. Methods/design: We conducted an individual-level, stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial with the Justa cookstove intervention in rural Honduras. We enrolled 230 female primary cooks who were not pregnant, non-smoking, aged 24-59 years old, and used traditional wood-burning cookstoves at baseline. A community advisory board guided survey development and communication with participants, including recruitment and retention strategies. Over a 3-year study period, participants completed 6 study visits approximately 6 months apart. Half of the women received the Justa after visit 2 and half after visit 4. At each visit, we measured 24-h gravimetric personal and kitchen fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, qualitative and quantitative cookstove use and adoption metrics, and indicators of cardiometabolic health. The primary health endpoints were blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and glycated hemoglobin. Overall study goals are to explore barriers and enablers of new cookstove adoption and sustained use, compare health endpoints by assigned cookstove type, and explore the exposure-response associations between PM2.5 and indicators of cardiometabolic health. Discussion: This trial, utilizing an economically feasible, community-vetted cookstove and evaluating endpoints relevant for the major causes of morbidity and mortality in LMICs, will provide critical information for household air pollution stakeholders globally.

However, the expanding number of landfills that are at the end of their lifespans and the increasing amount of waste disposed of to landfills have presented a growing need for a shift in this paradigm, which can be achieved by the active promotion of landfill mining and resource recovery. In this study, we analyze the landfill resource recovery potentials to understand the effects on landfill lifespan extension, reduction in landfill disposal rate, energy saving, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Simulations based on material flow analysis were conducted on existing landfills, which were categorized into four different types based on their remaining capacities and availability of nearby incineration or SRF facilities. The resource recovery potentials, GHG reduction effect, and energy saving effect were higher for Type 2-1 and Type 2-2 landfills with higher ratios of combustible waste. The landfill lifespan extension effect was the highest for Type 2-2 landfill which receives a relatively smaller amount of waste than the other landfills. The reduction in landfill disposal rate was highest for Type 3, which does not have an incinerator or SRF facilities nearby. On the other hand, the overall effects, including the effect on reducing the landfill disposal rate, are the lowest for Type 1 because the chosen landfill only covers a significantly small proportion of the total waste generated in the city compared to the other landfills. The findings of this study suggest that appropriate landfill mining and reclamation operations are integral to prolonging the lifespans of existing landfills and present insights for building future landfill management strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Landfill lifespan extension; Landfill mining and reclamation; LFMR; Reduction in GHG emissions; Reduction in landfill disposal rate","emission control; greenhouse gas; land reclamation; landfill; landfill liner; material flow analysis; recovery; simulation; waste disposal; waste management; article; carbon footprint; energy conservation; flow measurement; incineration; landfill; life extension; mining; recycling; simulation; South Korea; mining; South Korea; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; waste management; South Korea; Mining; Refuse Disposal; Republic of Korea; Waste Disposal Facilities; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064698332

In this study, we present isotopic, infrared, and Raman data on three distinct pieces of the SC meteorite. Our oxygen isotopic measurements show that Δ17O values of the pieces are close to each other, and are in good agreement with other howardites, eucrites, and diogenites. The carbon isotopic measurements, which were conducted by combusting terrestrial contamination selectively at temperatures lower than 500–600 °C, show the presence of indigenous carbon in the SC specimens. The matrix of these specimens, investigated via infrared microspectroscopy, appears to be dominated by clinopyroxene/orthopyroxene, forsterite, and fayalite, with minor contributions from ilmenite, plagioclase, and enstatite. Carbon-rich regions were mapped and studied via Raman imaging microspectroscopy, which reveals that both amorphous and graphitic carbon exist in these samples. Synchrotron-based infrared microspectroscopy data show the presence of very little aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The SC meteorite is suggested to be originating from the Antonia impact crater in the Rheasilvia impact basin on 4 Vesta (Unsalan et al. 2019).

In the UK, the Climate Change Act (2008) set a target for the reduction of 80% of carbon emissions by 2050. The biggest renewable energy sources in the UK are bioenergy, wind, solar and hydro. The UK is located in a windy area and is one of the top locations in the world for wind power, often considered to be the best in Europe. Since the 1980’s, the number of wind farms has increased greatly. Wind turbines extract wind energy from 100 metres above the ground. Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) systems enable the extraction of more energy from the wind at elevated altitudes beyond 150 meters using a technique termed pumping cycle kite power system. Scotland is the most suitable location for the implementation of AWE systems in the UK. In this work, the annual energy production of such a pumping cycle kite power system in Scotland was analysed using Luchsinger’s analytical models. The annual energy production was found to be over 3.4MWh/m2 in all five locations in Scotland. © 2019, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

Ignoring precipitation's effects leads to misguided policy recommendations that either deplete or underuse basin water resources. Therefore, this paper highlights the concept of uneven precipitation and uncertain stream inflow based on scenario analysis. Within a river basin, the regional authority and subarea managers both have water allocation and reallocation privileges. Motivated by sustainable development of water resource management systems, we argue that regional authorities should focus on alleviating the contradiction between supply and demand, and then seeking an optimum allocation strategy to ensure societal and economic benefits for its subareas, from which the subareas can provide reasonable reaction strategies. Authorities dominate water transactions between subareas involved in water rights distribution. This paper proposes a multi-objective multi-stage Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot (m2SNC) game model to cope with conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers concerning multiple activities. An interactive-dynamic-programming-based genetic algorithm (IDP-GA) is designed to simulate the policies needed for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios. The significant stress caused by unsustainable water resource allocation has been a perplexing problem for Sancha Lake, an important area in the southeast basin of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in China. To identify the tradeoffs among stakeholders, we apply the proposed model to this basin. To gain further insight into climate change and water usage sustainability, we simulate the varying spatial and seasonal distribution of stream inflow based on historical climate data and propose different water management strategies for normal, slight drought, moderate drought, and serious drought conditions. This creates an emergency response cooperative mechanism based on different climate scenarios for developing countries that need to cope with water deficiency and uncertain situations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bi-level multi-stage water allocation process; Scenario analysis; Sustainable development; Water deficiency","Climate change; Developing countries; Drought; Dynamic programming; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental protection; Genetic algorithms; Managers; Planning; Resource allocation; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Cooperative mechanisms; Multi stage; Policy recommendations; Scenario analysis; Seasonal distributions; Sustainable development of water resources; Water deficiency; Water management strategies; Rivers; climate change; drought; lake water; resource allocation; resource management; scenario analysis; strategic approach; sustainable development; trade-off; water demand; water management; water resource; water supply; China; Dujiangyan; India; Pakistan; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065105509

The time of flight of vortex rings emitted from a generator to a detector exhibits a single exponential distribution, suggesting that vortex detection is a Poisson process. This means that the detector observes vortex rings at irregular intervals with a mean interval time. Therefore, the single exponential distribution suggests a constant emission rate of vortex rings during turbulence generation, which is proportional to the mean detection rate. By setting a limit on the diameter of detected vortex rings, we find that the emission rate exhibits a power law relationship with the ring diameter. Since the diameter of a vortex ring is related to the vortex line spacing within turbulence when reconnection occurs, the distribution of vortex line spacings is considered to be reflected in the size distribution of the emission rate. Therefore, the power law dependence of the emission rate suggests that the vortex lines within turbulence have a self-similar fractal structure. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Quantum turbulence; Superfluid 4He; Vortex ring","Fighter aircraft; Poisson distribution; Quantum theory; Turbulence; Exponential distributions; Power law relationship; Power-law dependences; Quantum turbulence; Self-similar fractals; Superfluid^4He; Turbulence generation; Vortex rings; Vortex flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060253079

Emerging nations are generally just starting along this journey. However, among the few nation states that have pledged to achieve carbon neutrality, is Bhutan, a least developed country. Carbon neutrality is an ambitious climate policy that is increasingly being recognized as necessary in order to stabilize global temperature rise at 1.5°C. However, Bhutan is likely to face significant challenges in maintaining this status as the country balances its desire to grow in economic opportunities (GDP) and in human happiness (GNH). Little research has been conducted inside the policy processes to better understand how Bhutan will maintain carbon neutrality. Through open-ended, semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, this study provides an inside view on the current situation and future challenges that Bhutan may face, along with the complexities associated with implementing and maintaining an ambitious carbon neutral policy.

The betweenness-based method is to analyze the transmission effect of each urban sector regarding one single environmental pressure, and PCA is applied to discuss the energy-water-carbon nexus pressure transmitted by each urban sector. The consumption-based results are also calculated for comparison. The findings show that critical energy-water-carbon nexus transmission sectors included sector 20 (manufacture of communication equipment, computer, and other electronic equipment), sector 12 (manufacture of chemicals and chemical products), sector 14 (manufacture of processing metals), sector 35 (renting and leasing, business services), and sector 30 (transport, storage, and post). The consumption-based results showed that sector 20 and sector 12 generate remarkable energy-water-carbon nexus pressures. The results highlight the sectors that exert a significant amount of environmental pressures and suggest that policymakers should pay attention to the role that transmission sectors play in urban resource conservation and emission reduction.

This study took sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions as an example and employed modified input-output (MIO) model and traditional input-output (IO) model to quantify emissions under no-trade and trade conditions, and further investigated environmental efficiency and equality of inter-regional trade in China in 2010. The results show that inter-regional trade had increased emissions by 28% compared to no-trade emissions, which confirms the environmental inefficiency of inter-regional trade in China. This was largely because regions with better technology and low emission intensities tended to outsource the production of pollution-intensive but low value-added goods to regions with high emission intensities through inter-regional trade. The exchanges of pollution-intensive products in inter-regional trade have led to notable environmental inequities. Eastern regions usually gained the greatest environmental benefits from trade, while central regions (especially Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei) suffered the largest environmental loss induced by trade. Specifically, Guangdong plundered other regions the most (796 G gram (Gg)), while Shanxi was plundered the most by other regions (790 Gg). Polices to differentiate reduction criteria for emission intensity in different regions and adjust trade patterns within China could be recommended in order to achieve trade-related environmental efficiency as well as environmental equality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; Environmental efficiency; Environmental equality; Input-output model; No-trade emissions","Efficiency; Pollution; Sulfur dioxide; China; Embodied emissions; Emission intensity; Environmental benefits; Environmental efficiency; Environmental equality; High emission intensity; Input output model; Commerce; sulfur dioxide; emissions trading; environmental economics; input-output analysis; pollutant; regional trade; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; air pollution; Article; China; commercial phenomena; consumption based environmental efficiency index; controlled study; electricity; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental efficiency; environmental equality; environmental parameters; financial management; heat; inter regional trade; model; modified input output model; priority journal; production based environmental efficiency index; quality of life; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063762308

In this work, adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of CH4, N2 and O2, as typical components in CMM, on three carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) and the corresponding separation performances were studied. The equilibrium and kinetic selectivity were obtained from adsorption isotherms fitted with the Langmuir model and uptake curves fitted with the micropore-diffusion model, respectively. O2 with the highest diffusion time constant among three gases suggests the advantage of CMS-based kinetic separation in deoxygenation of CMM and the critical role that N2/CH4 kinetic separation plays in CH4 enrichment. CMS-1 with the highest microporosity has the largest adsorption capacities, and CMS-3 with a proper average pore size has the greatest N2/CH4 kinetic selectivity. The actual separation performances shown by CH4/N2/O2 breakthrough curves according to the principle for practical CMM upgrading processes exhibit the order of CMS-1 &gt; CMS-3 &gt; CMS-2 which is inconsistent with that of the conventional N2/CH4 selectivity highly due to the underestimation of effects of N2 equilibrium adsorption relative to N2 kinetic selection without covering specific adsorption range corresponding to practical working capacity region. A modified selectivity with consideration of actual N2 amount adsorbed was therefore developed, showing the correct performance order and the potential to be used as a practical adsorbent selection parameter. An advanced CMS materials design with proper existence of microporosity would benefit practical CMM upgrading in terms of reaching an optimal balance between adsorption equilibrium and kinetics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon molecular sieve (CMS); coal mine methane (CMM); Kinetic separation; Methane upgrading; Pressure swing adsorption (PSA)","Adsorption; Adsorption isotherms; Carbon; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal mines; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Kinetics; Microporosity; Molecular sieves; Pore size; Separation; Sieves; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption equilibria; Carbon molecular sieve; Equilibrium adsorption; Kinetic separation; Pressure swing adsorption; Selection parameters; Separation performance; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062058948

Based on them, the efficiency is planning to be steadily improved after allocating carbon emission year by year rather than achieve the maximized target (efficient) in a single step or maintain the original efficiency without any improvement. Meanwhile, the total carbon emission is also planning to be reduced by a certain percent according to the promise by China in Copenhagen climate conference.

Beyond traditional channels, the rise of social media has led to greater online haze-related information sharing. Formative research suggests that Weibo is playing a larger role in the process of information seeking than traditional media. Given the severity of haze and the influential role of Weibo, a textual analysis was conducted based on Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) to provide health decision-makers and media consumers knowledge on how environmental health issues such as haze are framed in Chinese social media. Framing theory served to explain the differences across various outlets: People’s Daily, China Daily, and the Chinese version of the Wall Street Journal. By analyzing 407 Weibo posts, five major frames emerged: (1) governmental concern, (2) public opinion and issue management, (3) contributing factors and effects, (4) socializing haze-related news, and (5) external haze-related news. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, a spatially heterogeneous AH emission data and updated urban land use data are integrated into the Weather Research and Forecasting model to simulate the physical processes of urban warming during summer. Simulations conducted in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) of east China suggest that the mean urban heat island intensity reaches 1.49 °C in urbanized areas during summer, with AH emission making a considerable contribution. The warming effect due to urban land use is intensified during extremely hot days, but in contrast, the AH effects are slightly reduced. Urban development increases the total thermal discomfort hours by 27% in the urban areas of YRD, with AH and urban land use contributing nearly equal amount. By limiting the daytime latent heat release, urban land use reduces the daily maximum heat stress particularly during extremely hot days; however, such alleviations can be offset by the AH emission. Strategies for mitigation of urban heat island effect and heat stress in cities should therefore include measures to reduce AH emission. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Biodiversity conservation within plantations is becoming an important issue and developing indicators of conservation values is valuable. Although plantations support less biodiversity than natural forests, older plantations can provide habitat for some native trees and associated biota. The amount (basal area)of native trees can be a simple indicator of conservation value of plantations. Various factors are likely to affect rates of increase in native trees in plantations with stand age. We developed an empirical model to predict the amount of broad-leaved trees as an indicator of conservation value of conifer plantations. We quantified relationships between rates of increase in the amount of broad-leaved trees and plantation tree species, density of planted trees, climate, topography and landscape cover. We used a hierarchical modeling framework based on extensive snapshot plot data (n = 3265 plots)from the national forest inventory in Japan. Our results showed that plantation tree species had the largest effect on the rate of increase in broad-leaved trees. Japanese cedar Cryptomeria japonica and hinoki cypress Chamaecyparis obtuse, which are two primary plantation species in Japan (both from the cypress family), had low rates of increase. In plantations of other species (red pine, larch, fir and spruce from the pine family), broad-leaved trees started to increase in amount after 20 years. We found that 50-year-old plantations of the pine family supported 10–20% of the amount of broad-leaved trees typically found in old-growth natural forests. Planted tree density also had important, but nonlinear relationships with the rate of increase in broad-leaved trees. Stands with fewer planted trees had higher rates of increase in broad-leaved trees. Rates of increase also were associated with snow depth, temperature, slope angle and the amount of natural forest in the surroundings. Our results suggest that management practices related to stand age, selection of plantation species and the density of planted trees can contribute to the conservation value of plantations. As our model is based on broadly available covariates and accommodates stand age, it may be applicable to other regions under different management regimes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Indicator; Mapping; Native broad-leaved tree; Naturalness index; Plantation species; Planted tree density","Biodiversity; Conservation; Indicators (instruments); Mapping; Plants (botany); Topography; Biodiversity conservation; Broadleaved trees; Management practices; National forest inventories; Naturalness index; Non-linear relationships; Plantation species; Planted trees; Forestry; basal area; biodiversity; bioindicator; broad-leaved forest; coniferous forest; conservation management; conservation status; empirical analysis; environmental assessment; forest inventory; forestry modeling; index method; landscape ecology; naturalness; plantation forestry; tree planting; vegetation mapping; Biodiversity; Conservation; Forestry; Increments; Mapping; Plantations; Topography; Trees; Japan; Abies; Chamaecyparis obtusa; Coniferophyta; Cryptomeria japonica; Cupressaceae; Cupressus; Larix; Picea; Pinaceae; Pinus resinosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065140631

Evergreen broad-leaved woody plants (EBWPs) are important components of numerous biomes and are the main contributors to the flora south of 35°N in China. We calculated the grid cell values of species richness (SR) for a total of 6265 EBWP species in China, including its four growth-forms (i.e., tree, shrub, vine, and bamboo), and estimated their phylogenetic structure using the standardized phylogenetic diversity (SPD) and net relatedness index (NRI). Then we linked the three biogeographical patterns that were observed with each single environmental variable representing the current climate, the last glacial maximum (LGM)—present climate variability, and habitat heterogeneity, using ordinary least squares regression with a modified t-test to account for spatial autocorrelation. The partial regression method based on a general linear model was used to decompose the contributions of current and historical environmental factors to the bio-geographical patterns observed. The results showed that most regions with high numbers of EBWP species and phylogenetic diversity were distributed in tropical and subtropical mountains with evergreen shrubs extending to Northeast China. Current mean annual precipitation was the best single predictor. Topographic variation and its effect on temperature variation was the best single predictor for SPD and NRI. Partial regression indicated that the current climate dominated the SR patterns of Chinese EBWPs. The effect of paleo-climate variation on SR patterns mostly overlapped with that of the current climate. In contrast, the phylogenetic structure represented by SPD and NRI was constrained by paleo-climate to much larger extents than diversity, which was reflected by the LGM—present climate variation and topography-derived habitat heterogeneity in China. Our study highlights the importance of embedding multiple dimensions of biodiversity into a temporally hierarchical framework for understanding the biogeographical patterns, and provides important baseline information for predicting shifts in plant diversity under climate change. © 2019, Science in China Press.","evergreen broad-leaved woody plants; habitat heterogeneity; net relatedness index; present climate; Quaternary climate variability; species richness; standardized phylogenetic diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068081693

However, existing inventories of CH 4 emissions from the livestock sector involve significant uncertainty, and the reduction potentials and spatially varying efficiencies of different technical options (adding lipid to diets, acidification, composting, anaerobic digestion, and the combination of composting and anaerobic digestion) have not been systematically assessed at the provincial level. Here, we used a bottom-up approach to compile an up-to-date high-resolution CH 4 emission inventory for the livestock sector in China using provincial condition-specific emission factors by considering the gross energy intake and the ambient temperature at the provincial level. A 1-km × 1-km gridded map was produced for 2014, and the temporal trends of the CH 4 emissions from 1978 to 2013 were re-visited. The effects of the technical mitigation options that could have been used on CH 4 emissions were further evaluated in five different scenarios. Livestock sector CH 4 emissions decreased by 1.2 Tg CH 4 per year from the period of 1999–2006 to the period of 2007–2014, and this rate was approximately 17–28% lower than previous estimates. During the period of 1978–2014, spatial-temporal emission trends indicated a possible relationship between the Chinese government policies and emissions to some extent and a northward shift of emission hotspots induced by economic and policy incentives. Hotspots with high mitigation potential and efficiency (the achieved reduction under a specific mitigation scenario divided by the baseline emissions from the species affected by the respective technical option) were also identified. The combination of composting and anaerobic digestion is a recommended policy, which can simultaneously address slurry and solid manure and significantly mitigated of CH 4 emissions. Overall, this study provides insights into the region-dependent implementation of technical options used to reduce CH 4 emissions from the livestock sector in China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Driving factors; Historical hotspots shifting; Livestock; Methane emission; Mitigation options effects","anaerobic digestion; bottom-up approach; composting; emission; emission inventory; environmental assessment; historical perspective; livestock; methane; policy implementation; pollution policy; temperature effect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063618320

Source contribution analysis of Hg deposition is essential to formulating emission control strategies to alleviate the adverse impact of Hg release from anthropogenic sources. In this study, a Hg version of California Puff Dispersion Modeling (denoted as CALPUFF-Hg)system with added Hg environmental processes was implemented to simulate the Hg concentration and deposition in the central region of the Pearl River Delta (cPRD)at 1 km × 1 km resolution. The contributions of eight source sectors to Hg deposition were evaluated. Model results indicated that the emission from cement production was the largest contributor to Hg deposition, accounting for 13.0%, followed by coal-fired power plants (6.5%), non-ferrous metal smelting (5.4%), iron and steel production (3.5%), and municipal solid waste incineration (3.4%). The point sources that released a higher fraction of gaseous oxidized mercury, such as cement production and municipal solid waste incineration, were the most significant contributors to local deposition.

In this study, the influencing mechanism of traffic density on smog pollution in cities is described from the perspectives of direct emissions, spatial agglomeration, and technology spillover effects. Based on an improved STIRPAT model, we examine a panel of 283 prefecture-level cities in China from 2003 to 2015 and find an inverted U-shaped relationship between traffic density and urban smog pollution in large and medium cities and no significant relationship in small cities. Furthermore, the traffic densities in large and medium cities are on the left side of the curve, so direct emissions remain important. The reduction in smog pollution caused by spatial agglomeration and technology spillovers is not sufficient to offset the increase caused by direct emissions. In advancing urbanization, the government should relax its household registration policy that restricts migration to large cities and should avoid any bias in its construction land distribution toward the mainland and small towns. By doing so, the government will further enhance the economic density and scale, shifting the traffic density to the right side of the inverted U-shaped curve so that spatial agglomeration and technology spillover effects can mitigate smog pollution. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","PM2.5; STIRPAT model; Traffic density; Urban smog pollution","Agglomeration; Air pollution; Economic and social effects; Motor transportation; Smoke; Urban growth; Economic densities; Influencing mechanisms; PM2.5; Stirpat models; Technology spillover effect; Technology spillovers; Traffic densities; Urban traffic congestion; Traffic congestion; atmospheric pollution; modeling; particulate matter; smog; spillover effect; traffic congestion; urban area; urban pollution; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046759707

We used an integral fractional statistical model (FISM) to quantify climate memories in different variables over China. Their contributions to climate prediction were estimated using explained variances. We found different climate memory effects for different variables in different regions. The contribution of climate memory to climate variability is stronger in temperature than in precipitation records. For temperatures (including both air temperature and land temperature), the average variance explained by climate memory is around 3∼4%. For precipitation, the average explained variance was 0.6%. The low values for explained variances indicate that, on average, the contributions of climate memory to temperature and precipitation predictions are small. But in specific regions, higher climate memory effects may occur. For precipitation, climate memory can contribute 3% of the variance in southeast China. For temperature, climate memory can explain ≥ 10% of the variance in northeast and southwest China, which is not low and should be considered in prediction. Therefore, for more accurate climate prediction, we suggest first determining the contribution of climate memory. For variables or regions with strong climate memory effects, a scheme considering climate memory effects may help improve future climate predictions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Climate memory effects; Climate prediction; Integral fractional statistical model; Long-term memory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053267637

Here, we present a divalent Cu codoping strategy to achieve a simultaneous improvement of light yield, energy resolution, scintillation decay, and afterglow in LSO:Ce single crystals without destabilizing the solid-liquid interface or promoting acentric growth. High-quality 32-mm-diameter and 110-mm-long LSO:Ce single crystals codoped with 0.1 and 0.3 atom % Cu2+ ions in the melt were successfully grown using the Czochralski method. While the surface tension of the LSO melt does decrease with Cu2+ codoping, analogous to the effect of Ca2+ codoping, it is not reduced enough to affect the crystal growth stability or diameter control. With 0.1 atom % Cu2+ codoping, the scintillation light yield of LSO:Ce can be significantly enhanced from 32â»000 to 39â»000 photons/MeV with an improved enegy resolution of 9% at 662 keV, and a reduced afterglow at room temperature. A continuous shortening of scintillation decay time with Cu2+ codoping is ascribed to the combined effect of enhanced thermal ionization from the Ce3+ 5d1 state and a reduction of the emission contribution from Ce2 centers, i.e., in the site neighboring six oxygens. Thermoluminescence and afterglow measurements are utilized to study the defect structure and explain the variation in scintillation yield. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Light; Medical imaging; Phase interfaces; Scintillation; Surface tension; Nuclear medical imaging; Scintillation decay; Scintillation decay time; Scintillation light yield; Scintillation performance; Scintillation yields; Solid-liquid interfaces; Thermal ionization; Single crystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067052594

Accordingly, scientists have focused on addressing climate change. IAMs (Integrated Assessment Models) have been widely used to assess the effect of global climate governance. Since the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement and the UK broke away from the European Union, global economic development takes on an uncertain path. The worldwide trade war triggered by the US has shown that international trade may be weakened in the future. The deglobalization in global economic progress forces individual innovation within countries. Therefore, we constructed a new IAM under autonomous economies—EMRICES-E (Expanded Multi-Regional Integrated model of Climate and Economy System-Equilibrium), which contains a layered structure of national computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to describe an individual country's development and analyzes the effects of global reductions in cooperation based on the new global situation. Considering that technical progress is a significant factor in carbon reduction, we introduced endogenous technical progress in CGE. Simulation results show that developing countries/regions have large carbon emissions under the baseline scenario with their economic status increasing at the same time, climate change would lead to economic recession if there are no carbon reductions for countries/regions and the industrial structure of developing countries changes noticeably compared with developed countries. © 2019","Autonomous economies; Carbon reduction; CGE model; IAMs","Carbon; Climate models; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Industrial emissions; International trade; Autonomous economies; Carbon reduction; CGE model; Computable general equilibrium model; Environmental issues; IAMs; Industrial structures; Integrated assessment models; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063981020

Methods and Results: Ferric citrate (50 mg l−1), Quillaja saponin (0·6 g l−1) and sodium nitrate (5 mmol l−1) were used in in vitro ruminal fermentation. Ferric citrate alone, its combination with saponin and/or nitrate lowered the aqueous sulphide concentration and total sulphide production. Methane production was suppressed by nitrate alone (by up to 32·92%), its combination with saponin (25·04%) and with both saponins with nitrate (25·92%). None of the treatments adversely affected feed digestion or rumen fermentation. The population of sulphate-reducing bacteria was increased by nitrate and saponin individually, while that of total Archaea was decreased by nitrate alone and the combination of the three inhibitors. Conclusions: Nitrate and its combination with saponin or both ferric citrate and saponin substantially decreased methane production. Most importantly, the decreased methane production was not at the expense of feed digestion or fermentation. Sulphidogenesis from the sulphate present in the high-sulphur diets can be suppressed competitively by ferric citrate, although it was elevated by saponin and nitrate. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results of this study demonstrated that combinations of certain methane inhibitors, which have different mechanisms of antimethanogenic actions or inhibit different guilds of microbes involved in methane production and sulphate reduction, can be more effective and practical than individual inhibitors, not only in mitigating enteric methane emission but also in lowering the risk of sulphur-associated polioencephalomalacia in feedlot cattle fed high sulphur diets. © 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology","in vitro ruminal fermentation; methane; methanogens; sulphate-reducing bacteria; sulphide","ferric citrate; methane; Quillaja saponin; RNA 16S; sodium nitrate; sulfate; sulfur; ferric citrate; ferric ion; methane; nitric acid derivative; saponin; sodium nitrate; sulfide; abundance; chemical compound; fermentation; inhibitor; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; salt; apsa gene; Article; comparative study; controlled study; Desulfovibrio; fermentation; gas chromatography; gene; in vitro study; methanogenesis; microbial population dynamics; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; rumen microorganism; analysis; animal; animal food; antagonists and inhibitors; bovine; fermentation; metabolism; microbial consortium; microbiology; rumen; Bos; Quillaja; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Cattle; Fermentation; Ferric Compounds; Methane; Microbial Consortia; Nitrates; Rumen; Saponins; Sulfides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066141124

The proposed indicator is important for less-developed countries and regions in which economic growth is heavily reliant on energy and in which significant potential exists for improvement of energy efficiency. The indicator is applied to evaluate the CO2 emission reduction performance in China’s 12th Five-Year Plan period, and the result is not encouraging, especially when the likely gap between the energy conservation goals and temperature goals is further examined. Mitigation goals should be set by considering not only the performance in the final year, but also the reduction in cumulative emissions over the evaluation period. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; evaluation indicator; Procrastination","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; CO2 emission reduction; Cumulative emissions; Economic growth rate; Emerging economies; Evaluation indicators; Gross domestic products; Less developed countries; Procrastination; Growth rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068189730

Understanding the effects of invasive alien species on both the taxonomic and functional diversities of plant communities in different climate zones enables insight into the mechanisms underlying successful invasions. This study investigated the effects of Erigeron canadensis at different degrees of invasion on both the plant taxonomic and functional diversities in the Chinese zones of Jinan (warm temperate climate) and Zhenjiang (north subtropical climate). A high degree of E. canadensis invasion resulted in a stronger decrease of plant diversity compared to a light degree of E. canadensis invasion. This may be because E. canadensis invasion can lead to a decrease in the number of native species via competition and subsequent local extinction. A high degree of E. canadensis invasion increased the Rao's quadratic entropy of plant height and ground cover. This may be because both the plant height and ground cover of E. canadensis and natives increased with increasing degree of E. canadensis invasion. The number of plant species in plant communities was lower in Jinan than in Zhenjiang. This is presumably because E. canadensis grows better in Jinan than in Zhenjiang and therefore, rare species are more likely to go extinct there. A small number of functional diversity indices of Jinan plant communities were higher than those of Zhenjiang. This may be due to the higher value of functional traits of E. canadensis in Jinan. © 2019 The Ecological Society of Japan","competitive advantage; Erigeron; functional convergence; functional divergence; habitat filtering; invasive species; local extinction; niche differences; selection pressure","annual plant; biological invasion; ground cover; introduced species; invasive species; local extinction; native species; plant community; rare species; species diversity; taxonomy; China; Jiangsu; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong; Zhenjiang; Conyza canadensis canadensis; Erigeron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068472684

This pilot project aims to bring energy savings and education to a uniquely targeted portion of Salt Lake City, UT, through the exchange of light-emitting diode bulbs and examines its feasibility in addressing energy insecurity at larger scales. Through the 8-month project duration, 1432 bulbs were exchanged at 23 events reaching 181 households in low-income areas that, through a year of use, were estimated to save residents approximately $18,219 in electricity bills, reducing CO2 emissions from power plants by 122 metric tons. Since this pilot reached less than 1% of households, we extrapolated a reach of 2%, 5%, and 7.5%, and found substantial potential decreases in power plant emissions and financial savings. Ongoing expansion efforts include more direct engagement with trusted members of the targeted communities and stronger attempts to engage participants in energy efficiency education as our project encountered some difficulties in reaching the intended population. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 emissions; Community programs; Electricity consumption; Energy efficiency; LED lighting; Social cost of carbon","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; community development; electronic equipment; energy efficiency; energy planning; household energy; neighborhood; power plant; residential energy; state role; Salt Lake City; United States; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073913116

However, the more widespread application of composites is currently restricted by complex fracture mechanisms, which are not well understood. One approach to overcome this challenge is structural health monitoring systems which provide a lot of information on the current system state as well as state of health in real time. In this context, reliability assessment of structural health monitoring systems is currently an open issue. The reliability of conventional non-destructive testing systems is evaluated, measured, and partly standardized using widely accepted methods such as the probability of detection rate. Frequently, the a90|95 value, which is determined from the probability of detection curves, is used as a performance measure indicating the minimum damage size that is detected with a probability of 90% and 95% confidence. In contrast to non-destructive testing, structural health monitoring involves additional data analysis steps, that is, statistical pattern recognition, where the classification results are also subject to uncertainty. Because similar methods are not available, the reliability of structural health monitoring systems is usually not quantified. To investigate the influences on the classification performance, experiments were conducted. In particular, the effect of variable loading conditions and the evolution of damage over time are considered. To this end, acoustic emission measurements were performed, while the specimens of the composite material were subjected to different cyclic loading patterns. Here, acoustic emission refers to elastic stress waves in the ultrasound regime, which emerge from the structure on damage initiation and propagation. Furthermore, a frequency-based damage classification scheme for acoustic emission measurements is proposed. Time–frequency domain features are extracted from the measurement signals using short-time Fourier transform. Classification is performed using support vector machine. Both choices serve as typical examples to discuss the effects which apply equally to other approaches. Experimental results presented in this article regarding fault diagnosis and discrimination of delamination, matrix crack, debonding, and fiber breakage in carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer material show that good performance applying support vector machine could be achieved using 10-fold cross validation. However, during model deployment, strong dependency of the classification reliability on loading conditions can be clearly stated, which could not be seen from the previous evaluation. Concluding from these results, it can be stated that the application of classifier-based structural health monitoring is more complex than generally assumed. The relations between the classification approaches, testing conditions, measurement devices, and filters have to be discussed with respect to the ability to provide reliable statements about the actual damage state. © The Author(s) 2018.","Acoustic emission (AE); classification; composite material; non-destructive testing (NDT); probability of detection (POD); reliability; support vector machine (SVM)","Ability testing; Acoustic wave propagation; Bridge decks; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Classification (of information); Composite materials; Damage detection; Fault detection; Fiber reinforced plastics; Frequency domain analysis; Patient monitoring; Pattern recognition; Real time systems; Reliability; Structural health monitoring; Support vector machines; Ultrasonic applications; Uncertainty analysis; Acoustic emission measurement; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Non destructive testing; Probability of detection; Short time Fourier transforms; Statistical pattern recognition; Structural health monitoring systems; Variable loading conditions; Acoustic emission testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052578292

With changing climate and socioeconomics there is a need to assess how the Mekong catchment will be affected in terms of the delivery of water and nutrients into the delta system. Here we apply the Integrated Catchment model (INCA) to the whole Mekong River Basin to simulate flow and water quality, including nitrate, ammonia, total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus. The impacts of climate change on all these variables have been assessed across 24 river reaches ranging from the Himalayas down to the delta in Vietnam. We used the UK Met Office PRECIS regionally coupled climate model to downscale precipitation and temperature to the Mekong catchment. This was accomplished using the Global Circulation Model GFDL-CM to provide the boundary conditions under two carbon control strategies, namely representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and a RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 4.5 scenario represents the carbon strategy required to meet the Paris Accord, which aims to limit peak global temperatures to below a 2 °C rise whilst seeking to pursue options that limit temperature rise to 1.5 °C. The RCP 8.5 scenario is associated with a larger 3–4 °C rise. In addition, we also constructed a range of socio-economic scenarios to investigate the potential impacts of changing population, atmospheric pollution, economic growth and land use change up to the 2050s. Results of INCA simulations indicate increases in mean flows of up to 24%, with flood flows in the monsoon period increasing by up to 27%, but with increasing periods of drought up to 2050. A shift in the timing of the monsoon is also simulated, with a 4 week advance in the onset of monsoon flows on average. Decreases in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations occur primarily due to flow dilution, but fluxes of these nutrients also increase by 5%, which reflects the changing flow, land use change and population changes. © 2019","Climate change; Land use change; Mekong River; Modelling; Nutrients; Socioeconomic change; Vietnam Delta","Ammonia; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon; Catchments; Climate models; Economics; Land use; Models; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Population statistics; River pollution; Rivers; Runoff; Sea level; Water quality; Watersheds; Global circulation model; Integrated catchment model; Land-use change; Mekong River; Socio-economic change; Soluble reactive phosphorus; Viet Nam; Water quality modelling; Climate change; ammonia; carbon; nitrate; phosphorus; climate change; hydrological modeling; land use change; nutrient cycling; population dynamics; socioeconomic impact; water quality; Article; catchment; climate change; concentration (parameter); dilution; environmental temperature; irrigation (agriculture); land use; nutrient; precipitation; priority journal; river basin; simulation; socioeconomics; Viet Nam; water quality; water supply; Mekong Basin; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064234127

We explore the impact of two disparate 2050 emissions scenarios relative to 2015 in the context of a changing climate with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model version 3 (GFDL-AM3) chemistry-climate model. We impose the same near-term climate change for both emission scenarios by setting global sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice cover (SIC) to the average over 2010-2019 and 2046-2055, respectively, from a three-member ensemble of GFDL coupled climate model simulations under the RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenario. By the 2050s, annual mean surface ozone increases throughout China by up to 8 ppbv from climate change alone (estimated by holding air pollutants at 2015 levels while setting SIC and SST to 2050 conditions in the model) and by 8-12 ppbv in a scenario in which emissions of ozone precursors nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase by ∼10%. In a scenario in which NO x and anthropogenic VOC emissions decline by 60%, annual mean surface ozone over China decreases by 16-20 ppbv in the 2050s relative to the 2010s. The ozone increase from climate change alone results in an additional 62 000 premature deaths in China as compared to 330 000 fewer premature deaths by the 2050s under a strong emissions mitigation scenario. In springtime over Southwestern China in the 2050s, the model projects 9-12 ppbv enhancements to surface ozone from the stratosphere (diagnosed with a model tracer) and from international anthropogenic emissions (diagnosed by differencing AM3 simulations with the same emissions within China but higher versus lower emissions in the rest of the world). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of emissions controls in reducing the health burden in China due to air pollution, and also the potential for climate change and rising global emissions to offset, at least partially, some of the ozone decreases attained with regional emission reductions in China. © 2019 The Author(s).

Performance data were collected for both industrial- and laboratory-scale digesters and response in microbial community structure was evaluated by Illumina sequencing. Implementation of THP at the industrial-scale plant increased methane yield by 15% and enhanced substrate degradability. Possibility to extend the sludge retention time due to a higher solid content of the substrate, sanitisation of the digestate and improved fertiliser quality of the digestate were other industrial-scale benefits of THP installation. Continuously-fed laboratory-scale digesters were fed THP-treated or untreated substrate at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 5 g volatile solid (VS)/L/day, a feeding rate necessary at the corresponding industrial-scale plant to meet the estimated population increase within the municipality. The results indicated that the plant could have increased the capacity with unimpaired stability independently of THP installation, even though the retention time was significantly shortened during operation with untreated substrate. Microbial community analyses revealed increased contribution of the Clostridia class after THP installation in industrial-scale digesters and positive correlation between Firmicutes:Bacteriodetes and methane yield in all digesters. Differentiated profiles in laboratory-scale digesters indicated that a temperature increase from 37 to 42 °C in association with THP installation and altered substrate composition were strong determining factors shaping the microbial community.

One of the most effective ways to adapt on farm is to switch crop varieties. This technological change depends on the policies and institutions involved in governing the seed systems on which farmers rely for access to suitable seeds. Whilst the need for seed systems to adapt and become more resilient is indisputable, the question of how this is best achieved is debated. The dominant seed system development pathway promoted by international development actors is characterized by formalization and commercialization of the seed sector. In order to assess political and social outcomes of this development agenda, we compare maize seed system development in Ethiopia, Malawi and Tanzania, combining policy analysis with quantitative analysis of farmers' seed use. We show that while the development policies promoted by international donors have similar objectives in the three countries, national policies and the seed systems farmers use differ substantially. National policies are shaped by political and historical factors and established in an interplay between state institutions, international donors and private input suppliers. Drawing on a new livelihood dataset, we show that in all three countries the formalization agenda is most visible in maize seed systems, with 25, 61, and 58% of the maize farmers planting improved maize varieties in the study sites in Ethiopia, Malawi and Tanzania, respectively. The inroads of improved maize, and particularly hybrid maize, in farmers' seed systems reflects these seeds high profitability for private seed companies. The tenuous use of improved varieties in crops such as sorghum reflects the limitation of the private sector-based seed system development approach in other crops and illustrates the need for public research and governance. Comparison of households cultivating improved maize with households cultivating local maize reveals that the first group is significantly wealthier and more food secure than the latter. This suggests that better-off households are likely to benefit first from the commercial formalization agenda. We argue that climate-smart seed policies and seed system development strategies must be sensitive to differences between farming systems and different groups of farmers if they are to deliver socially fair outcomes. © Copyright © 2019 Westengen, Haug, Guthiga and Macharia.","adaptation; climate-smart agriculture; crop varieties; seed law; seed policy; seed systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077640164

Multiple forms of carbon compounds, such as CO 2 , CH 4 , CO, VOCs, and other organic matter can contribute to a series of transboundary environmental problems. However, current strategies targeting pollution reduction in single medium may cause pollution transfer to other environmental media, leading to comparatively large difficulty in assessing the related environmental impact on integrated ecosystems. This paper develops an analysis framework of carbon cross-media metabolism in municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment systems that include landfilling, composting, incineration, and anaerobic digestion. Life cycle impact analysis and sensitivity analysis methods are used to recognize the essential technologies in promoting the carbon cross-media migration and decreasing the integrated environmental impacts. The framework is implemented in a case study of the MSW treatment systems of 2013 in China. Results show that 86%–98% of carbon pollutants generated through landfilling, composting, and incineration ended up in the natural environment, while anaerobic digestion achieved an 87% pollution removal rate. Co-generation technology applied in incineration flue gas treatment, biochemical + membrane treatment technology in wastewater treatment, and co-processing of sludge in cement kilns were identified as the essential technologies affecting carbon migration across the gas-liquid, liquid-solid, and solid-gas interface, respectively. The relatively high environmental impacts of landfilling and incineration can be decreased by optimizing their technological compositions and applications. This study can provide support to replace the traditional environmental practice aiming at pollution control in single environmental medium independently by a systematic management approach that considers carbon cross-media metabolism and integrated environmental impact. © 2019","Carbon metabolism; Cross-media migration; Integrated environmental impact; Waste management","Air pollution; Anaerobic digestion; Brickmaking; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Membrane technology; Metabolism; Phase interfaces; Pollution control; Sensitivity analysis; Waste incineration; Waste management; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Carbon metabolism; Cross-media; Environmental medium; Environmental practices; Environmental problems; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Natural environments; Systematic management; Municipal solid waste; carbon; cement; carbon; environmental impact; metabolism; municipal solid waste; pollutant transport; pollution control; waste management; waste treatment; anaerobic digestion; Article; biochemical analysis; carbon metabolism; chemical composition; China; composting; environmental impact; gas; incineration; landfill; life cycle; liquid; municipal solid waste; pollutant; pollution control; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; sludge treatment; solid; solid waste management; total quality management; waste gas management; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064456269

In order to address this, a range of interventions and policies are being implemented across major European cities and studies in sustainable urban transport have proliferated. One such mitigation strategy involves redesigning urban form through 'hard' traffic policies, with a view of decreasing emission levels and therefore mitigating the effects of air pollution and climate change. However, efforts to assess public response to such interventions and the effectiveness of policy instruments in promoting sustainable travel in cities remain sparse. The city of Potsdam, Germany implemented a trial traffic measure aimed at reducing motorized traffic and promoting the use of bicycles and public transport systems. This study analysed data from 3553 survey participants who responded to a survey conducted prior to the implementation of the traffic measure. We aimed to identify mobility behaviours and underlying attitudes within the context of a 'hard' policy instrument, in order to obtain insight into the opportunities to more effectively define policy priorities that improve air quality and upscale climate mitigation. An exploratory cluster analysis identified four groups, characterised by mobility habits, their attitudes towards the measure, and general level of environmental concern. By identifying and understanding the differing attitudes and perceptions across population groups we are able to highlight group-specific barriers and opportunities, as well as potential transition pathways to encourage more sustainable transportation use. This study exemplifies how context can help to further shape mobility group typologies, identify policy-related priorities useful for decision-makers and assess the feasibility of policy instruments to facilitate a transformation towards more sustainable cities. © 2019 The Author(s).

Fuel recycling and impurity behaviors in the divertor region were investigated by employing a newly built ultraviolet-visible-near infrared overview spectroscopy system. The characteristic spectral lines of the working gases (hydrogen and helium), intrinsic impurities (carbon, oxygen and iron), and seeded impurities (neon and nitrogen) were identified and analyzed. The divertor electron temperature and density were measured using He I (667.8, 706.5, and 728.1 nm) line intensity ratios. The Hα (656.3 nm), He I (587.6 nm), C II (514.5 nm), and O I (777.2 nm) emissions were investigated over a wide range of operating conditions. The results showed that fuel and impurity emissions in the divertor region exhibit a strong dependence on magnetic topology and plasma conditions. The levels of Hα, He I, C II, and O I emissions are all reduced moving from the standard configuration to the high mirror configuration, and even further reduced for the high iota configuration, which is associated with decreasing connection length in these island divertor configurations. The H/He influx ratio shows that the plasma is a mixture of helium and hydrogen. The neutral and impurity influxes from the divertor target tend to increase with increasing divertor electron temperature. © 2019 Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and IOP Publishing.","fuel recycling; impurity; spectroscopy diagnostic","Electron temperature; Fuels; Hydrogen; Impurities; Infrared devices; Recycling; Spectroscopic analysis; Characteristic spectral lines; Fuel recycling; Line intensity ratio; Magnetic topologies; Mirror configurations; Operating condition; Spectroscopic studies; Visible near-infrared; Fusion reactor divertors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072762911

Pulsating thermal X-ray emission from millisecond pulsars can be used to obtain constraints on the neutron star equation of state, but to date only five such sources have been identified. Of these five millisecond pulsars, only two have well-constrained neutron star masses, which improve the determination of the radius via modelling of the X-ray waveform. Aims. We aim to find other millisecond pulsars that already have well-constrained mass and distance measurements that show pulsed thermal X-ray emission in order to obtain tight constraints on the neutron star equation of state. Methods. The millisecond pulsar PSR J1909-3744 has an accurately determined mass, M = 1:54 ± 0:03 M⊙ (1σ error) and distance, D = 1:07 ± 0:04 kpc. We analysed XMM-Newton data of this 2.95 ms pulsar to identify the nature of the X-ray emission. Results. We show that the X-ray emission from PSR J1909-3744 appears to be dominated by thermal emission from the polar cap. Only a single component model is required to fit the data. The black-body temperature of this emission is kT = 0:260:03 0:02 keV and we find a 0.2-10 keV un-absorbed flux of 1:1 ± 10-14 erg cm-2 s1 or an un-absorbed luminosity of 1.5 ×1030 erg s-1. Conclusion. Thanks to the previously determined mass and distance constraints of the neutron star PSR J1909-3744, and its predominantly thermal emission, deep observations of this object with future X-ray facilities should provide useful constraints on the neutron star equation of state. © N.

Infrastructure development for fuel charging stations for BEVs, FCVs and NGVs and the carbon tax are evaluated as policy measures to promote these vehicle fleets as well as the reduction in the life cycle GHG emissions. Our analysis uses the newly developed Japanese multi-regional partial equilibrium system dynamics model UniSyD_JP. The energy supply sector consists of fossil fuels, nuclear energy, renewable energy and hydrogen and the nation's energy demand is projected by the expected population growth and the GDP outlook. The energy demand for the transport sector is endogenously determined by a consumer's vehicle choice characterized by the multinomial logit model. We examine five scenarios for different mixes of infrastructure development, carbon tax and projected oil price. The transition paths to a low carbon vehicle fleet are explored for the period of 2016–2060. We found that infrastructure development increases the penetration of FCVs and NGVs, but it will not reduce the life cycle GHG emissions.

Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to study the affecting mechanism of oil price distortion on CO2 emission mitigation. Firstly, the level of oil price distortion is evaluated and a dynamic trans-log cost function model is built to analyze the substitution relationship among energy products. Secondly, the own price elasticity and cross price elasticity for fuel demand are calculated based on provincial panel data of China's transport sector over 2004–2016. Finally, CO2 mitigation potentials are estimated by removing the impact of oil price distortion. Results show that: 1) there is positive oil price distortion over 2004–2016; 2) substitute relationship is observed between oil and coal, oil and electricity, and the substitution relationship is affected by factor substitution; 3) removing oil price distortion will reduce CO2 emissions of China's transport sector by 599 million tons in the studying period. Policies should focus removing the impact of oil price distortion, promoting electricity/oil substitution and promoting capital/energy substitution to mitigate CO2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China's transport sector; CO2 mitigation potential; Oil price distortion; Substitution elasticity","Carbon dioxide; Cost functions; Costs; Elasticity; CO2 mitigation; Cross-price elasticity; Factor substitutions; Oil consumption; Oil Prices; Own-price elasticities; Pricing mechanism; Transport sectors; Petroleum transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; elasticity; emission control; oil supply; price dynamics; transportation system; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064511545

The purpose of this paper was to investigate the dependence of China's economy on CO2 emissions: (i) the Tapio decoupling model was applied to quantify the decoupling elasticity between China's economy and CO2 emissions; (ii) the structure decomposition technique was utilized to quantity the contribution of China's economic structure to the decoupling elasticity; (iii) the combined decomposition model which combined Cobb–Douglas (C-D) production function with Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) technique and was solved the residual problem was employed to identify more driving factors (labor input, investment, carbon coefficient, energy structure, energy intensity, economic structure, and technology state) affecting the decoupling elasticity. The main results were as follows: (i) The decoupling elasticity showed a downward trend during the whole period, and the decoupling state was characterized by two types: expansive negative decoupling (2002–2005) and weak decoupling (2000–2002 and 2005–2014). (ii) The industry sector played the most negative effect on the decoupling process expect 2013–2014. From the cumulative effect, the contribution of six sectors to promote decoupling effect was ranked as follows: Construction &gt; Agriculture &gt; Trade &gt; Other &gt; Transport &gt; Industry. (iii) The most critical factor driving the increased CO2 emissions was the investment effect, accounting for 145.34% of the cumulative total CO2 emissions, while the energy intensity effect contributed to a cumulative reduction in CO2 emissions of 1443.72 Mt. Finally, some policy recommendations were offered to achieve the decoupling of China's economic growth and carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Decomposition; Decoupling; Investment effects; Labor effects; Sector's contribution","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Developing countries; Elasticity; Investments; Renewable energy resources; China; Decomposition model; Decoupling; Economic structure; Policy recommendations; Production function; Sector's contribution; Structure decomposition; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064516610

However, this approach requires a rapid and inexpensive measurement technique that can be used to quantify CH4 emission for a large number of individual dairy cows. Milk infrared (IR) spectroscopy has been proposed as a predictor for CH4 emission. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of milk IR spectra to predict breath sensor–measured CH4 of 801 dairy cows on 10 commercial farms. To evaluate the prediction equation, we used random and block cross validation. Using random cross validation, we found a validation coefficient of determination (R2val) of 0.49, which suggests that milk IR spectra are informative in predicting CH4 emission. However, based on block cross validation, with farms as blocks, a negligible R2val of 0.01 was obtained, indicating that milk IR spectra cannot be used to predict CH4 emission. Random cross validation thus results in an overoptimistic view of the ability of milk IR spectra to predict CH4 emission of dairy cows. The difference between the validation strategies could be due to the confounding of farm and date of milk IR analysis, which introduces a correlation between batch effects on the IR analyses and farm-average CH4. Breath sensor–measured CH4 is strongly influenced by farm-specific conditions, which magnifies the problem. Milk IR wavenumbers from water absorption regions, which are generally considered uninformative, showed moderate accuracy (R2val = 0.25) when based on random cross validation, but not when based on block cross validation (R2val = 0.03). These results indicate, therefore, that in the current study, random cross validation results in an overoptimistic view on the ability of milk IR spectra to predict CH4 emission. We suggest prediction based on wavenumbers from water absorption regions as a negative control to identify potential dependence structures in the data. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association","CH4 emission; milk infrared spectroscopy; prediction; validation strategy","methane; animal; bovine; chemistry; female; infrared spectrophotometry; lactation; metabolism; milk; procedures; selective breeding; validation study; veterinary medicine; Animals; Cattle; Female; Lactation; Methane; Milk; Selective Breeding; Spectrophotometry, Infrared",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065025119

However, species that remain in situ and experience climate change will interact with species tracking climate change, which could also affect patterns of biodiversity. The relative contribution of species gains and losses to net changes in species richness is still unclear. We use transplanted plant communities to test the hypothesis that both the change in climate and ecological communities tracking climate change will influence how species richness responds to climate change. Three intact alpine plant communities were reciprocally transplanted to create scenarios in which species experienced warmer and wetter conditions (transferred to lower elevations) and cooler and drier conditions (transferred to higher elevations) over 10 years on the Tibetan Plateau. Communities transplanted into the same elevation as controls represent species tracking climate change. Transferring to lower elevations generally caused a net increase in richness and a higher rate of gains relative to the control plots; the magnitude of this effect depended on the specific elevation. Transferring to higher elevations lead to either net increases or decreases in richness and gains, depending on elevation. Species gains predicted much more variation in changes in species richness (50%) than did species loss (9%). Species richness at the receptor site and the donor site were both important predictors of variation in species richness, and the abiotic environment did not explain additional variation. Changes in cover of dominant plant species in response to transfers did not predict changes in species richness, species gain or species loss. Our results suggest that species gains from species tracking climate change at the receptor sites, rather than species loss from the donor sites, predicted changes in species richness. Synthesis. Warming experiments with physical barriers to dispersal may overestimate the negative effect of warming on plant diversity by not accounting for species gains. Our study highlights the importance of biotic factors in addition to the abiotic environment, when considering how climate change will affect plant diversity. © 2019 The Authors.

Occasionally, the particle number concentration increases sharply in a short time period, which is defined as a “particulate matter explosive increase”. Heavy particulate matter pollution not only reduces visibility but also has an adverse effect on human health. Hence, there is an urgent need to discover the causes of particulate matter explosive increase. During this campaign, the particle number concentration and free radicals were measured at a tall building on the campus of Lanzhou University of Technology. Additionally, we examined a series of chemicals to reproduce the observed particulate matter explosive increase in a smog chamber to determine its potential factors. Then, we analyzed the mechanism of particulate matter explosive increase in the presence of free radicals. We found that, among the potential inorganic and organic sources analyzed, a mixture of organic and SO 2 in the research region had a major effect on particulate matter explosive increase. Moreover, free radical oxidation has a large effect, especially in the formation of organic particulates. © 2019","Explosive increase; Free radical oxidation; Particle number concentration; Particulate matter pollution","Explosives; Free radicals; Oxidation; Pollution; Tall buildings; Atmospheric particulate; Free radical oxidation; Lanzhou University of Technology; Organic particulates; Organic sources; Particle number concentration; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter pollution; Particles (particulate matter); atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); free radical; oxidation; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; China; free radical; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; chemical model; chemistry; China; dust; particle size; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Dust; Free Radicals; Models, Chemical; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062004380

A key question is how closely Hg concentrations in the human food chain, especially in fish and other aquatic wildlife, will track the changes in atmospheric Hg that are expected to occur following anthropogenic emission reductions. We investigated this question by evaluating several regional groups of case studies where Hg concentrations in aquatic biota have been monitored continuously or intermittently for several decades. Our analysis shows that in most cases Hg time trends in biota did not agree with concurrent Hg trends in atmospheric deposition or concentrations, and the divergence between the two trends has become more apparent over the past two decades. An over-arching general explanation for these results is that the impact of changing atmospheric inputs on biotic Hg is masked by two factors: 1) The aquatic environment contains a large inventory of legacy emitted Hg that remains available for bio-uptake leading to a substantial lag in biotic response time to a change in external inputs; and 2) Biotic Hg trends reflect the dominant effects of changes in multi-causal, local and regional processes (e.g., aquatic or terrestrial biogeochemical processes, feeding ecology, climate) that control the speciation, bioavailability, and bio-uptake of both present-day and legacy emitted Hg. Globally, climate change has become the most prevalent contributor to the divergence. A wide range of biotic Hg outcomes can thus be expected as anthropogenic atmospheric Hg emissions decline, depending on how these processes operate on specific regions and specific organisms. Therefore, evaluating the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention will require biomonitoring of multiple species that represent different trophic and ecological niches in multiple regions of the world. © 2019","Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric emissions; Climate change; Fish; Mercury; Minamata Convention","Air pollution; Animals; Aquatic ecosystems; Biochemistry; Emission control; Fish; Mercury (metal); Meteorological problems; Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic mercury; Aquatic environments; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric emission; Atmospheric inputs; Biogeochemical process; Minamata Convention; Climate change; mercury; methylmercury; mercury; aquatic ecosystem; atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission; fish; mercury (element); wildlife management; aquatic environment; aquatic species; atmospheric deposition; bioavailability; biological monitoring; climate change; coastal waters; environmental monitoring; feeding ecology; fish; food chain; freshwater fish; human; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; species differentiation; trend study; wet deposition; wildlife; air pollutant; analysis; animal; ecosystem; environmental policy; metabolism; Air Pollutants; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Mercury",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064320190

Here, we highlight a design strategy for constructing a novel robust three-dimensional (3D) flexible electrode with a unique sandwichlike N-doped carbon sponge/TiO2-Î/reduced graphene oxide (NCS/TiO2-Î/RGO) configuration. In this electrode architecture, ultrafine defect-rich TiO2-Î nanocrystals are spatially sandwiched by a 3D conformal carbon hybrid matrix, where the 3D porous NCS provides an interconnected open diffusion channel for efficient ionic accessibility while the conformal RGO coating layer serves as an additional upper current collector, resulting in a double continuous conductive network for fast electronic transport and guaranteeing excellent electrochemical reaction kinetics. Hence, the as-built NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO flexible electrodes exhibit high-rate capabilities and long-cycling life in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and they also exhibit outstanding thermal stability under cycling at 55 °C. More remarkably, a flexible soft-package full battery based on a NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO anode and a LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (for LIBs) or Na0.67Fe0.3Mn0.3Co0.4O2 (for SIBs) cathode shows stable electrochemical characteristics under bending and folding, holding great potential for flexible energy storage devices. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067934859

These documents, and our own modeling exercise, indicate that the WHO model omits important determinations of TB incidence: war, civil conflict, and major upheaval such as rural and urban mass evictions; gross imbalance of power; accumulation of wealth into the hands of a tiny part of the global population; unequal female/male literacy and general low literacy level. Simple models should not be used for public policy, especially not-yet-validated models.

Acute and chronic disturbances impact cellular energy metabolism, endocrine signaling, ion channel activity, neuronal activity, and cardiovascular functions such as cardiac contractility and vascular blood flow. Maintenance and adaptation of acid-base homeostasis are mostly controlled by respiration and kidney. The kidney contributes to acid-base balance by reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate, regenerating bicarbonate through ammoniagenesis and generation of protons, and by excreting acid. This review focuses on acid-base disorders caused by renal processes, both inherited and acquired. Distinct rare inherited monogenic diseases affecting acid-base handling in the proximal tubule and collecting duct have been identified. In the proximal tubule, mutations of solute carrier 4A4 (SLC4A4) (electrogenic Na+/HCO3 --cotransporter Na+/bicarbonate cotransporter e1 [NBCe1]) and other genes such as CLCN5 (Cl-/H+-antiporter), SLC2A2 (GLUT2 glucose transporter), or EHHADH (enoyl-CoA, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase) causing more generalized proximal tubule dysfunction can cause proximal renal tubular acidosis resulting from bicarbonate wasting and reduced ammoniagenesis. Mutations in adenosine triphosphate ATP6V1 (B1 H+-ATPase subunit), ATPV0A4 (a4 H+-ATPase subunit), SLC4A1 (anion exchanger 1), and FOXI1 (forkhead transcription factor) cause distal renal tubular acidosis type I. Carbonic anhydrase II mutations affect several nephron segments and give rise to a mixed proximal and distal phenotype. Finally, mutations in genes affecting aldosterone synthesis, signaling, or downstream targets can lead to hyperkalemic variants of renal tubular acidosis (type IV). More common forms of renal acidosis are found in patients with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease and are owing, at least in part, to a reduced capacity for ammoniagenesis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Acidosis; alkalosis; ammoniagenesis; inherited; proton secretion","aldosterone; forkhead transcription factor; glucose transporter 2; transcription factor Nrf2; ammonia; bicarbonate; alkalosis; ammonia formation; ATP6V0A4 gene; ATP6V1B1 gene; chronic kidney failure; CLCN5 gene; Fanconi renotubular syndrome; FOXI1 gene; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; gene targeting; homeostasis; hormone synthesis; human; hyperkalemia; kidney proximal tubule; kidney tubule acidosis; molecular pathology; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; Review; signal transduction; Sjoegren syndrome; SLC2A2 gene; SLC4A1 gene; SLC4A4 gene; steady state; urine pH; WDR72 gene; acid base balance; animal; complication; genetics; kidney; kidney tubule acidosis; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Acidosis, Renal Tubular; Ammonia; Animals; Bicarbonates; Homeostasis; Humans; Kidney",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068530682

To tackle these problems often local infrastructural adaptation measures are proposed. In this study a chain of state-of-the-art models is presented that can be used to evaluate the benefits of such measures. Also, a method is presented to calculate the costs of not responding to a changing environment that is slowly aggravating floods. These methods are applied to a case study in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka. Colombo faces problems with floods that are expected to get worse by further wetland reduction and climate change. Several local measures (infrastructural interventions) are proposed to tackle that problem. This paper shows a method to quantify the expected reduction in future flood damages resulting from the proposed measures, and compares the risk reduction to the proposed measure costs. This is done by creating probabilistic inundation depth maps using a 1D2D hydrodynamic model. A detailed flood damage model and socio-economic development scenarios are then applied to estimate damage with and without the measures. An economic analysis is done to demonstrate the benefits of the measures, which can be used by decision makers. Additionally, calculations are carried out of future flood risk increases when wetland reduction in Colombo continues. In this case, the effect of stopping wetland encroachment is found to be larger than the effect of the structural adaptation measures. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptation measures; Colombo; Damage-curves; Flood risk; Wetlands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065625393

Urban greening helps reduce level of air pollution and improve microclimate. Selection sensitive plant species (indicators of pollution), and the resistant species (decrease the level pollution) is acute in many countries. The aim of the present work was to establish concentrations of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, Co and Cd) in the Siberian larch needles grown in various urban land-use (functional) zones of Ulan-Ude (Russia), as well as to determinate and compare the levels of some biochemical compounds. Based on index of soil contamination, the highest heavy metal pollution was found in the highway and industrial zones. The index of biogeochemical transformation of the needle elements composition ranged from 5.1 (minimal level) to 32.2 (strong level). The most polluted sites were along highways, where Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Cd concentration in the needles were up to 2.5–7.7 times than background values. An important role in the protective system of larch is played by pigments, especially Chl b and carotenoids. Their content in the needles is increased by 1.3–2.2 times. Ratio Chl a/b and ∑Chl/carotenoids decrease as compared to background level; in the first case—due to increase of Chl b content, in the second case—increase of carotenoids level. Highest concentrations of proline, condensed tannins and peroxidase activity were found in needles from urban zones connected with high traffic and industrial emission.

As they are believed to pinpoint sites of magnetic reconnection in reconfiguring fields, understanding their occurrence and detailed evolution may provide useful insight into the overall evolution of active regions. Here we present results from inversions of SST/CRISP and CHROMIS, as well as IRIS data of such transient events. Combining information from the Mg » II h &amp; k, Si » IV, and Ca » II 8542 Å and Ca » II H &amp; K lines, we aim to characterise their temperature and velocity stratification, as well as their magnetic field configuration. We find average temperature enhancements of a few thousand kelvin, close to the classical temperature minimum and similar to previous studies, but localised peak temperatures of up to 10 000-15 000 K from Ca » II inversions. Including Mg » II appears to generally dampen these temperature enhancements to below 8000 K, while Si » IV requires temperatures in excess of 10 000 K at low heights, but may also be reproduced with secondary temperature enhancements of 35 000-60 000 K higher up. However, reproducing Si » IV comes at the expense of overestimating the Mg » II emission. The line-of-sight velocity maps show clear bi-directional jet signatures for some events and strong correlation with substructure in the intensity images in general. Absolute line-of-sight velocities range between 5 and 20 km s-1 on average, with slightly larger velocities towards, rather than away from, the observer. The inverted magnetic field parameters show an enhancement of the horizontal field co-located with the brightenings at heights similar to that of the temperature increase. We are thus able to largely reproduce the observational properties of Ellerman bombs with the UV burst signature (e.g. intensities, profile asymmetries, morphology, and bi-directional jet signatures), with temperature stratifications peaking close to the classical temperature minimum. Correctly modelling the Si » IV emission in agreement with all other diagnostics is however an outstanding issue and remains paramount in explaining its apparent coincidence with Hα emission. Fine-tuning the approach (accounting for resolution differences, fitting localised temperature enhancements, and/or performing spatially coupled inversions) is likely necessary in order to obtain better agreement between all considered diagnostics. © ESO 2019.","Radiative transfer; Sun: activity; Sun: atmosphere; Sun: magnetic fields","Bombs (ordnance); Calcium; Magnesium; Magnetic fields; Oceanography; Radiative transfer; Velocity; Emerging flux regions; Magnetic field configurations; Magnetic field parameter; Magnetic reconnections; Sun: activity; Sun: atmosphere; Sun: magnetic field; Temperature stratification; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069796942

Here we show that controls on the composition of organic C, the particulate, humus and resistant fractions, and the potential vulnerability of C to decomposition across Australia are distinct, scale-dependent and variable. We used machine-learning with 5,721 topsoil measurements to show that, continentally, the climate, soil properties (for example, total nitrogen and pH) and elevation are dominant controls. However, we found that such general assessments disregard underlying region-specific controls that affect the distribution of the organic C fractions and vulnerability. This can lead to misinterpretations that prejudice our understanding of soil C processes and dynamics. Regionally, climate is mediated through interactions with soil properties, mineralogy and topography. In some regions, climate is uninfluential. These results highlight the need for regional assessments of soil C dynamics and more local parameterization of biogeochemical and Earth system models. Our analysis propounds the development of region-specific strategies for effective C management and climate change mitigation. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"biogeochemistry; humus; parameterization; soil carbon; soil organic matter; topography; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067043905

It is known that toxic responses elicited by PM2.5 particles depend on its physical and chemical characteristics that are greatly influenced by the source. Dietary polyphenolic compounds that possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties could be used for therapeutic or preventive approaches against air pollution related health hazards. This study evaluates characteristics and toxicity of PM2.5 collected from rural, urban, industrial, and traffic regions in and around Coimbatore City, Tamilnadu, India. Traffic PM2.5 particles contained higher amounts of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). It also possessed higher levels of oxidative potential, induced more intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caused more levels of cell death and DNA damage in human respiratory cells. Its exposure up regulated DNA damage response related miR222, miR210, miR101, miR34a, and miR93 and MycN and suppressed Rad52. Pre-treatment with morin significantly decreased the PM2.5 induced toxicity and conferred protection against PM2.5 induced altered miRNA expression. Results of this study showed that cytoprotective effect of morin is due to its antioxidative and free radical scavenging activity. © 2019 by the authors.

Following the 1998 El Niño there has been an overall reduction in precipitation levels – associated with sea-surface temperature changes in the Indian and Pacific Oceans – resulting in an increase in the number and severity of droughts. Given that the probable cause of this shift is anthropogenic forcing, it provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of climate change on society compared to statistical inference based on weather variation. Focusing on communal conflict in Ethiopia and Kenya between 1999 and 2014, exploiting cross-sectional variation across districts, the regression analysis links the precipitation decline to an additional 1.3 conflict events per district. The main estimates show that there is a negative correlation between precipitation and communal conflict with a probability of 0.90. Changing model specification to consider plausible alternative models and accommodate other identifying assumptions produces broadly similar results. The generaliziability of the link between precipitation decline and conflict breaks down when using out-of-sample cross-validation to test the external validity. A leave-one-out cross-validation exercise shows that accounting for climate contributes relatively little to improving the predictive performance of the model. This suggests that there are other more salient factors underlying communal violence in Ethiopia and Kenya. As such, in this case the link between climate and conflict should not be overstated. © The Author(s) 2019.","climate change; communal conflict; cross-validation; Ethiopia; Kenya; precipitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064539095

The wide green dike was actively promoted by a local water board, with involvement of scientists and nature conservation organizations. A stepwise participatory process resulted in national-level recognition of the potential of the wide green dike, particularly due to its “green” and “adaptability” characteristics.

The ability of lianas to grow relative to trees during the dry season suggests that liana-tree competition is also strongest in the dry season. If correct, the predicted intensification of the drying trend over large areas of the tropics in the future may therefore intensify liana-tree competition resulting in a reduced carbon sink function of tropical forests. However, no study has established whether the liana effect on tree carbon accumulation is indeed stronger in the dry than in the wet season. Using 6 years of data from a large-scale liana removal experiment in Panama, we provide the first experimental test of whether liana effects on tree carbon accumulation differ between seasons. We monitored tree and liana diameter increments at the beginning of the dry and wet season each year to assess seasonal differences in forest-level carbon accumulation between removal and control plots. We found that median liana carbon accumulation was consistently higher in the dry (0.52 Mg C ha−1 year−1) than the wet season (0.36 Mg C ha−1 year−1) and significantly so in three of the years. Lianas reduced forest-level median tree carbon accumulation more severely in the wet (1.45 Mg C ha−1 year−1) than the dry (1.05 Mg C ha−1 year−1) season in all years. However, the relative effect of lianas was similar between the seasons, with lianas reducing forest-level tree carbon accumulation by 46.9% in the dry and 48.5% in the wet season. Synthesis. Our results provide the first experimental demonstration that lianas do not have a stronger competitive effect on tree carbon accumulation during the dry season. Instead, lianas compete significantly with trees during both seasons, indicating a large negative effect of lianas on forest-level tree biomass increment regardless of seasonal water stress. Longer dry seasons are unlikely to impact liana-tree competition directly; however, the greater liana biomass increment during dry seasons may lead to further proliferation of liana biomass in tropical forests, with consequences for their ability to store and sequester carbon. © 2019 The Authors.

Responsiveness for affordable electricity access to its residents induced implementation of off-grid and consumer driven energy models like Community Energy (CE), playing significant role in meeting national energy demand in developed countries. It is evident from energy secured nations that centralized planning and electrification is not alone sufficient for meeting energy security. Renewable CE model is predicted to emerge as an effective system of clean energy access to off-grid communities while reducing emissions vividly. In past few years, cases of renewable CE system have been reported in India as well. Hence, it becomes pertinent to assess the extent of CE projects in Indian context, however a comprehensive landscape of such projects is currently lacking. This paper attempts to profile the status of CE projects with their scope and relevance to ensure national energy security. Six diversified case studies of CE projects are analysed by applying actor network theory. Role of community participation in implementation of these projects and its socio-economic impact on localized growth is represented by reviewing detailed case-studies. Qualitative analysis reveals parameters across diversified CE projects in India leading to an assessment framework for sustainable replication in other regions.

Although this ranking varies over the years because of the periodicity feature of the olive, Turkey is an important olive producer country in Mediterranean. The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) is a member of the maquis community that is involved in the natural vegetation of the Mediterranean climate. It is accepted as a bioindicator that characterizes this zone because of its good adaptation to the Mediterranean climate. According to the report of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the year 2016 was determined as the year with the highest global average temperatures (1880-2018). It is considered that the variability in climatic conditions and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events (extreme precipitaion, floods, extreme temperatures, heat waves, hail, etc.) that have been occurring frequently in recent years are associated with the changes in the large-scale pressure and wind circulation and atmospheric oscillations (with direct and indirect effects, e.g. NAO-North Atlantic Oscillation, AO-Arctic Oscillation and ENSO-El Nino Southern Oscillation, etc.). In this study, the effects of Southern Oscillation (El Nino/ La Nina) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the olive yield in Turkey will be examined. The objective of this study is to a.) determining the statistical relationship between climatic conditions and atmospheric index values during the phenological periods of olives, b) determining the effects of oscillations on yield by examining the years of strong atmospheric oscillation indexes and yield values on the line graph. To do this, the phenological periods of the olive were determined. Daily average temperature data of 48 years covering the years 1970-2017 for Adana, Osmaniye, Kahramanmaraş, Antalya, Mersin and Iskenderun meteorological stations, and daily average total rainfall data were used as the climatic data. Nino 3, Nino 3.4, Nino 4 and ONI indexes representing the El Nino activities and effective during the 1970-2017 period and the NAOI index representing the North Atlantic Oscillation were used. The relationship between the monthly average temperatures which were effective in the phenological period of olive and the atmospheric index values was statistically analyzed according to Pearson correlation coefficient method. As a result of the analyses, statistically significant relationships varying between 40-64% were found between average temperatures during the flowering and first initiation of fruit period among the phenological periods of the olive and Nino 3.4 and Nino 3 indexes. Statistically significant relationships varying between 38-60% were found between total rainfall and Nino indexes. In addition, no statistically significant relationship was found between North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) and climatic conditions. In order to determine the effect of the oscillations on yield by determining the yield values on the line graph with the years with strong atmospheric oscillation indexes, yield values of the olive covering the years between 1991-2017 were used. According to this, the yield of olive was below the average in the strong El Nino years, which were determined as 1991, 1997, 2009, 2015 and 2016.

First, the La2O3 is deposited on a n-type GaN surface by e-beam technique and analysed for its structural and chemical properties with x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) approaches. XRD and XPS results confirmed the growth of La2O3 on the n-GaN surface. Then, the Au/La2O3/n-GaN metal/insulator/semiconductor (MIS) junction is fabricated and analysed for its electrical properties and compared with the SJ electrical results. The MIS junction exhibits a good rectifying nature with a low leakage current compared to the SJ. Experimental findings reveal a higher barrier height obtained for the MIS junction than the SJ, suggesting that the barrier height is altered by the La2O3 insulating layer. Also, the barrier heights are estimated by Cheung’s, Norde functions and ΨS–V plot, and the values are nearly matched with each other, indicating the techniques used here are valid. The extracted interface state density (NSS) of MIS junction is lower than the SJ, implying the La2O3 insulating layer plays a vital role in the decreased NSS. Experimental findings confirmed that the Schottky emission governs the reverse current in SJ. However, for the MIS junction, the Poole–Frenkel and Schottky emissions are the dominant current conduction mechanisms in the lower and higher bias regions. © 2019, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","carrier transport mechanism; electrical properties; High-k lanthanum oxide; MIS junction; n-type GaN; structural and chemical properties","Chemical properties; Electric properties; Gallium nitride; III-V semiconductors; Insulating materials; Insulation; Interface states; Leakage currents; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carrier transport mechanisms; Current conduction mechanisms; Electrical performance; High- k; Interface state density; Low-leakage current; n-Type GaN; Schottky junctions; Lanthanum oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064280175

In the urban context, further concern arises from the concerted action of cities' materials, fabric, layout, density and activities, which are responsible of heat and pollutants entrapment, of wind force breaking and sweltering microclimates. Ready-to-use, high-impact, smart, cost and energy-effective countermeasures are the only ones having chances to be widely implemented in the short haul. Against this backdrop, this work presents the results obtained from an experimental campaign conducted on a single mitigation technology, meant to reach high local temperature reductions and empowered with climate-adaptive features to be applicable close to any vulnerable target (e.g. schools, hospitals, hospices..): a web of smartly controlled mist sprayers. A prototype was designed and its impacts on the local microclimate were thoroughly characterized. Notably, the nozzle density was investigated to delineate the tradeoffs between evaporative cooling global magnitude and spatial dilution: in fact, by rarefying water emission, a larger air volume can partake to the cooling as it gets harder to reach saturation; conversely the point spatial temperature drop might weaken and become negligible, jeopardizing the whole mitigation strategy. This paper discloses such a controversial point and provides guidelines for the correct design of mist cooling systems for Urban Heat Island counteraction. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The comparison between online and offline techniques revealed better correlation coefficients for SO 4 2− and NH 4 + (r &gt; 0.90) than that of NO 3 − (0.63). Mean concentrations of water-soluble species were found in decreasing order SO 4 2− (2814 ng m −3 ) &gt; NH 4 + (1371 ng m −3 ) &gt; NO 3 − (495 ng m −3 ). NH 3 (3390 ng m −3 ) concentration was more than enough to neutralize SO 2 (879 ng m −3 ) and HNO 3 (346 ng m −3 ).

SO 4 2− , NO 3 − , NH 4 + , HNO 3 , SO 2 exhibited remarkable decrease (leastways 40%) in the atmosphere over the Eastern Mediterranean throughout fifteen years. In winter, day time NH 3 concentrations illustrated significant relationship with temperature (positive) and humidity (negative), implying evaporation of dew or emission from plant stoma.

On the basis of obtained data, a forecast was made which foresees the most likely outlook of the electric car market in the coming years. The forecast was made using the creeping trend method, and extended up to 2030. As part of the analysis of the effect of the impact of electromobility, an original method was proposed for calculating the primary energy factor (PEF) primary energy ratio in the European Union and in its individual countries, which illustrates the conversion efficiency of primary energy into electricity and the overall efficiency of the power system. The original method was also verified, referring to the methods proposed by the Fraunhofer-Institut. On the basis of all previous actions and analyses, an assessment was made of the impact of the development of the electromobility sector on air quality in the countries studied. Carbon dioxide tank-to-wheels emission reductions which result from the conversion of the car fleet from conventional vehicles to electric motors were then calculated. In addition to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, other pollutant emissions were also calculated, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). The increase in the demand for electricity resulting from the needs of electric vehicles was also estimated. On this basis, and also on the basis of previously calculated primary energy coefficients, the emission reduction values have been adjusted for additional emissions resulting from the generation of electricity in power plants. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 reduction; Electromobility; EU","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Europium; Fleet operations; Global warming; Nitrogen oxides; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 reduction; Economic situation; Electromobility; Emission reduction; Overall efficiency; Pollutant emission; Primary energy ratios; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070227168

Therefore, climate anomalies might provide opportunities to identify the relationship of past climate in deriving the distribution of invasive species and to detect their probable future distribution. In this work, we studied the correlation of climate anomaly i.e. temperature and precipitation with an indicative map of plant invasive species (1° grid) of India. The indicative map was generated through the plant data available from the project ‘Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level’. Climate anomaly was calculated and represented by average temperature and precipitation using ‘Climate Research Unit’ data for the period of 1901 to 2000. A comparison of local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and a global ordinary least square regression (OLS) model was carried out for statistical analysis to depict the correlation at 1° spatial grids. Overall, 20,501 records with a total of 9112 unique plots and 161 unique invasive species were recorded in the database that shows a maximum of 15 invasive species in a 0.04 ha nested quadrat. Cumulative analysis showed a maximum of 53 invasive species at 1° grid. Individually, GWR could reveal a significant correlation with invasive species distribution for temperature anomaly (r2= 0.73, AIC= 2206) and precipitation anomaly (r2= 0.74, AIC= 2221), while OLS model did not offer a good correlation (r2 &lt; 0.001, AIC &gt; 2400) compared to GWR. Combination of temperature and precipitation anomaly (shared model) showed an improved spatial correlation (r2&gt; 0.75) using GWR. Variation partitioning revealed the dominant influence (&gt; 0.40 of variation) of temperature anomaly over Deccan Peninsula, Himalaya and North East zone. Influence of precipitation anomaly was more prominent over arid and semi-arid zone explaining &gt; 0.35 of variation. Results revealed the strength of GWR to see the interaction of invasive plant species w.r.t. climate anomalies that explain the influence of spatial variation due to heterogeneity at varying neighbour distances. The significant correlation of invasive species with both the anomalies revealed the affinity of invasive species towards warmer, drier and wet places. This gives an indication that the distribution of invasive species could be triggered by climate anomaly. The use of other predictor variables (i.e. edaphic and anthropogenic) could be an inclusive input in a future perspective. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Anomaly; Climate change; GWR; India; Invasive species; OLS","anthropogenic effect; climate change; correlation; disturbance; invasive species; precipitation (climatology); semiarid region; spatial variation; temperature anomaly; temperature effect; Himalayas; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061330771

Under these conditions, there are indications that surface area requirements can decrease, whilst still keeping a satisfactory performance. However, variations in the operational mode and the role of the surface organic deposit layer under warm climatic conditions have not been fully investigated. The goal of this work was to evaluate the performance of a system comprised of only the first stage of the French system, with a further reduction of 1/3 of the area (utilization of only two units in parallel, instead of three) in terms of organic matter removal and nitrogen conversion, with one unit with a deposit layer accumulated over 9 years of operation, and the other unit without sludge layer, under Brazilian tropical conditions. The system was originally designed according to Cemagref/Irstea recommendations for the first-stage of the French system for the treatment of raw sewage generated by an equivalent population of 100 inhabitants. However, it was later on changed, and operated with only two units, using only 0.6 m2·pe1. Feeding and resting periods were of 7 days each. In order to evaluate the influence of the sludge layer, the top sludge from one of the units was removed, and the performance of both units was compared by the Mann-Whitney test. The database comprises the wetland performance values in terms of dissolved oxygen (DO), redox potential (Eh), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), NH4 þ-N and NO3 þ-N, covering a monitoring period of 15 months. The effluent DO concentrations were significantly lower in the unit with top sludge, but still sufficiently high in both units. Although there were some variations between both units, effluent concentrations of the major pollutants were not significantly different in the units with and without sludge, and removal efficiencies based on mean values were considered good, given the reduced area of the system: BOD (80% and 79%), TSS (85% and 82%), TKN (60% and 63%) for the units with and without sludge, respectively. Under Brazilian climatic conditions, with the reduced area and employing longer feeding cycles (7 days), the sludge accumulation rate (less than 1 cm·year1) was lower compared to the French mean values. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Organic deposit accumulation; Raw sewage; Sewage treatment; Treatment wetlands","Biochemical oxygen demand; Deposits; Effluents; Forestry; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Redox reactions; Sewage treatment; Tropics; Wetlands; Biochemical oxygen demands (BOD); Effluent concentrations; Feeding and resting periods; Organic deposits; Raw sewage; Total Kjeldahl nitrogens; Treatment wetlands; Vertical flow constructed wetlands; Dissolved oxygen; dissolved oxygen; nitrogen; organic matter; concentration (composition); constructed wetland; pollutant removal; reduction; sewage treatment; tropical region; vertical profile; Article; climate; constructed wetland; sludge; suspended particulate matter; tropics; biochemical oxygen demand; Brazil; sewage; wetland; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Brazil; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072400872

Several conservation planning studies have used threatened freshwater fishes or species that are vulnerable to climate change as conservation targets, but none has included both in priority-setting analysis. The objectives of this study were to identify gaps in the coverage of the existing protected areas in representing the endemic freshwater fishes of the Tropical Andes region, and to identify conservation priority areas that adequately cover threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change. Data on 648 freshwater fishes from the Tropical Andes were used to identify gaps in the protected area coverage, and to identify conservation priority sites under three scenarios: (i) prioritize threatened species; (ii) prioritize species that are vulnerable to climate change; and (iii) prioritize both threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change. A total of 571 species (88% of all species) were not covered by any protected areas; most of them are restricted to ≤10 catchments. To represent both threatened species and species vulnerable to climate change in the third scenario, 635 catchments were identified as priority areas, representing 26.5% of the study area. The number of irreplaceable catchments for this scenario is 475, corresponding to 22.5% of the total area. The results of this study could be crucial for designing strategies for the effective protection of native fish populations in the Tropical Andes, and for planning proactive climate adaptation. It is hoped that the identification of priority areas, particularly irreplaceable catchments, will help to guide conservation and management decisions in the Andean region. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","climate change; fish; gap analysis; protected areas; red list; river","climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; endemic species; fish; freshwater ecosystem; prioritization; protected area; Red List; river; tropical environment; vulnerability; Andes; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058437500

The CSP potential is estimated using a detailed geographical information system (GIS) based land exclusion criteria and land use data to determine land suitability in the ten districts of the country. On the basis of the national solar map of satellite-derived direct normal irradiance (DNI) information and observed DNI data combined with biogeophysical and human-induced land use constraints, it is shown that Botswana has approximately 220,016 km2 of available land to support CSP plants. Assuming that dry-cooled parabolic trough collector (PTC)-type CSP plants are deployed, an estimated nominal capacity of 3189.54 TWhy−1 or 363.86 GW could be accommodated by the available land area. The highest CSP potentials by district are found to be in the Central and Kgalagadi which have more than 90 GW each, collectively representing nearly half of the national potential. The largest proportion of available land relative to the district size was found to be the Southern District where more than two-thirds of the surface area was considered suitable for CSP. Based on the findings of the study, Botswana has a relatively huge CSP potential capable of exceeding the current peak energy demand by an order of a magnitude, subject to a policy framework that supports future investment in solar thermal power for a renewable energy mix as part of a climate change mitigation strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bottom-up approach; Concentrating solar power; Dry-cooled PTC-type CSP technology; Land suitability; Renewable energy mix; Solar energy","Climate change; Cooling systems; Economics; Information use; Investments; Land use; Solar energy; Bottom up approach; Concentrating solar power; CSP technology; Land suitability; Renewable energies; Constraint satisfaction problems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064439793

However, current dispersion models offer limited modelling options to evaluate its impact on ambient pollutant concentrations. The scope of this review revolves around the following question: how can GI be considered in readily available dispersion models to allow evaluation of its impacts on pollutant concentrations and health risk assessment? We examined the published literature on the parameterisation of deposition velocities and datasets for both particulate matter and gaseous pollutants that are required for deposition schemes. We evaluated the limitations of different air pollution dispersion models at two spatial scales – microscale (i.e. 10–500 m) and macroscale (i.e. 5–100 km) - in considering the effects of GI on air pollutant concentrations and exposure alteration. We conclude that the deposition schemes that represent GI impacts in detail are complex, resource-intensive, and involve an abundant volume of input data. An appropriate handling of GI characteristics (such as aerodynamic effect, deposition of air pollutants and surface roughness) in dispersion models is necessary for understanding the mechanism of air pollutant concentrations simulation in presence of GI at different spatial scales. The impacts of GI on air pollutant concentrations and health risk assessment (e.g., mortality, morbidity) are partly explored. The i-Tree tool with the BenMap model has been used to estimate the health outcomes of annually-averaged air pollutant removed by deposition over GI canopies at the macroscale. However, studies relating air pollution health risk assessments due to GI-related changes in short-term exposure, via pollutant concentrations redistribution at the microscale and enhanced atmospheric pollutant dilution by increased surface roughness at the macroscale, along with deposition, are rare. Suitable treatments of all physical and chemical processes in coupled dispersion-deposition models and assessments against real-world scenarios are vital for health risk assessments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution health risk assessment; Deposition velocity; Dispersion-deposition coupled model; Green infrastructure; Macroscale model; Microscale model","Air; Air pollution control; Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Fog; Health; Health risks; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Surface roughness; Coupled modeling; Deposition velocities; Green infrastructure; Macroscale models; Micro scale models; Air pollution; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); greenspace; health risk; particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution control; pollution effect; risk assessment; air pollutant; canopy; chemical reaction; controlled study; dilution; health hazard; human; morbidity; mortality; particulate matter; review; risk assessment; simulation; velocity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063793894

Using 10 × 10 km national grid emission data (circa 2007), we quantified the spatial distribution of total CO2 emissions and emission efficiency of Chinese cities at the prefectural city scale. The emission efficiency was measured according to the emission intensity, CO2 emissions per capita, residential CO2 emissions per capita and industrial CO2 emissions per unit area. We found substantial variability in the total CO2 emissions among cities ranging from &lt;0.1 to 214.3 million tons. High total CO2 emissions were mostly concentrated in northern, eastern and northeastern China. An overall analysis of the total CO2 emissions and emission intensity revealed that 75% of the cities in northern China had higher total emissions and lower efficiencies than the national average, and these cities shall be the main targeted cities for CO2 emissions reduction and emission intensity improvement. Additionally, urban districts had higher total CO2 emissions and emissions per capita than their surrounding regions for the majority of the prefectural cities. Four indicators, including the industrial structure, gross domestic product (GDP), total population, and size of the built-up area, were significantly related to the CO2 emissions and emission efficiency. Industrial structure was the most important driving force. Our results underscore the need to design region- and/or city-specific reduction strategies instead of a one-size-fits-all policy, and provide strategic information to public and private decision makers on controlling total emissions and improving emission efficiency. © 2019","CO2 emissions; Emission efficiency; Socioeconomic factors; Spatial distribution; Urban-rural difference","Decision making; Efficiency; Emission control; Spatial distribution; CO2 emissions; Emission efficiencies; Gross domestic products; Industrial structures; Socio-economic factor; Spatial variability; Surrounding regions; Urban-rural; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decision making; emission inventory; pollution control; pollution policy; rural-urban comparison; socioeconomic conditions; spatial distribution; spatial variation; Article; carbon footprint; China; geographic distribution; gross national product; human; industry; population size; priority journal; residential area; urban area; urban rural difference; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066058063

Effects of geometric parameters are discussed, such as different radii and volume fractions of W nanoparticles, the thickness of Al 2 O 3 -W nanocomposites, and HfO 2 thin film. The proposed thermal absorber and emitter exhibit nearly unity absorptance in both VIS and NIR regions, while the emittance approaches zero in the MIR region. The selective absorption/emission window is tunable by varying geometric parameters.

Considering this background, the use of rainwater appears as an alternative. Common sense is to use rainwater for houses and for crop irrigation but few initiatives focus on using rainwater for industrial proposals. In the present work, the technical feasibility of using rainwater in a large-scale cooling tower was evaluated in a long-term test. The results confirm that the quality of rainwater allows its use in large-scale cooling towers without affecting the process continuity. The use of rainwater resulted in the economy of 12,000 kWh/year as well as the CO 2 emission was reduced by 2 ton/year. It means the impact of the industrial activity on the environment was reduced. The short payback (2 years), the positive results regarding corrosion and fouling, and the environmental impact reduction serve as an example for other industrial initiatives using rainwater.

The data analysis shows that there is room for improvement in China’s energy efficiency, and its regional imbalances have expanded. The Chinese government is urged to pay more attention to the improvement of energy efficiency in the central and western regions, and to provide more policy support. Simultaneously, the paper attemtps to establish measurement indexes to improve the efficiency of emission reduction. As a result, the authors suggest that increasing government expenditure can play a positive role in the overall improvement of emission reduction efficiency. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China’s industry; Energy and emission reduction efficiency improvements; energy consumption; industrial waste gas emission; non-radial directional distance function","Emission control; Energy utilization; Industrial research; Industrial waste treatment; Chinese Government; Directional dispersions; Directional distance function; Emission efficiencies; Emission reduction; Energy and emissions; Government expenditure; Industrial waste gas; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066083160

In practical terms, simultaneous measurements of at least one semivolatile constituent, e.g. NH3 or HNO3, are required to provide a constraint on the calculation of pH. Long-term records of aerosol pH are scarce due to the limited monitoring of NH3 in conjunction with PM2:5. In this study, 10-year (2007-2016) records of pH of PM2:5 at six eastern Canadian sites were calculated using the E-AIM II model with the input of gaseous NH3, gaseous HNO3 and major water-soluble inorganic ions in PM2:5 provided by Canada's National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) Program. Clear seasonal cycles of aerosol pH were found with lower pH (∼ 2) in summer and higher pH (∼ 3) in winter consistently across all six sites, while the day-to-day variations of aerosol pH were higher in winter compared to summer. Tests of the sensitivity of aerosol pH to meteorological parameters demonstrate that the changes in ambient temperature largely drive the seasonal cycle of aerosol pH. The sensitivity of pH to chemical composition shows that pH has different responses to the changes in chemical composition in different seasons. During summertime, aerosol pH was mainly determined by temperature with limited impact from changes in NHx or sulfate concentrations. However, in wintertime, both meteorological parameters and chemical composition contribute to the variations in aerosol pH, resulting in the larger variation during wintertime. This study reveals that the sensitivity of aerosol pH to chemical composition is distinctly different under different meteorological conditions and needs to be carefully examined for any particular region. © 2019 Author(s).",,"acidity; aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; chemical composition; monitoring system; particulate matter; Phaeozem; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069505366

In this study, we bridged Mycobacterium neoaurum with Pichia pastoris to establish a step-wise biotransformation strategy for efficient biosynthesis of boldenone (BD) from phytosterol (PS). Firstly, the producing strains were rationally designed with overexpression of 3-ketosteroid-Δ1-dehydrogenase (KsdD) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) in M. neoaurum and P. pastoris, respectively. Then, to shorten the total biotransformation process and provide reducing power, semi-batch fermentation strategy and glucose supplementation strategy were introduced at side-chain degradation stage and carbonyl reduction stage, respectively. Under the optimal transformation conditions, the productivity of BD was increased from 10% to 76% and the total biotransformation process was shortened by 41.7%, which is the shortest among the ever reported.

Our results show that the optimised agricultural enterprises move towards being cropping-dominated reducing on-farm emission since livestock perform is the major source of emission. Farmers employ less oats-based and rapeseed-based rotations but more dry pea-based rotations in the optimal enterprise mix. A substantial reduction in on-farm greenhouse gas emission can be achieved at low cost with a small increase in carbon incentives.

Normally, DXN emission concentration is detected by using two steps, which are online flue gas acquirement with special instruments in the factory and off-line flue gas analysis with expensive instruments in the laboratory. In this paper, a new DXN emission concentration forecasting approach based on latent feature extraction and selection for the practical MSWI process is proposed. At first, latent features of the high dimensional process variables are extracted based on principal component analysis (PCA). Then, by using mutual information (MI) and pre-set feature selection ratio, these latent features are estimated and selected. At last, these selected latent features are fed into least-square support machine vector (LS-SVM) model with super-parameter adaptive selection strategy. Simulation results based on the practical DXN emission data of an industrial MSWI process of China show effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2019 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Dioxins (DXN); Latent feature selection; Least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM); Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI); Mutual information (MI); Super-parameter adaptive selection",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074443351

With climate change, adverse human health effects caused by heat exposure are of increasing public health concern. Forests provide beneficial ecosystem services for human health, including local cooling. Few studies have assessed the relationship between deforestation and heat-related health effects in tropical, rural populations. We sought to determine whether deforested compared to forested landscapes are associated with increased physiological heat strain in a rural, tropical environment. Methods. We analyzed data from 363 healthy adult participants from ten villages who participated in a two-by-two factorial, randomized study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia from 10/1/17 to 11/6/17. Using simple randomization, field staff allocated participants equally to different conditions to conduct a 90 min outdoor activity, representative of typical work. Core body temperature (CBT) was estimated at each minute during the activity using a validated algorithm from baseline oral temperatures and sequential heart rate data, measured using chest band monitors. We used linear regression models, clustered by village and with a sandwich variance estimator, to assess the association between deforested versus forested conditions and the number of minutes each participant spent above an estimated CBT threshold of 38.5 C. Results. Compared to those in the forested condition (n = 172), participants in the deforested condition (n = 159) spent an average of 3.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57, 5.60) additional minutes with an estimated CBT exceeding 38.5 C, after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and experiment start time, with a larger difference among those who began the experiment after 12 noon (5.17 [95% CI 2.20, 8.15]). Conclusions. In this experimental study in a tropical, rural setting, activity in a deforested versus a forested setting was associated with increased objectively measured heat strain. Longer durations of hyperthermia can increase the risk of serious health outcomes. Land use decisions should consider the implications of deforestation on local heat exposure and health as well as on forest services, including carbon storage functions that impact climate change mitigation. © 2019 The Author(s).

Least-cost emission and technology trajectories are generated using an optimization-based stock-and-flow model of electricity generation to meet the 70% target. The analysis finds that the 30%-44% reduction in emissions projected under a least cost business-as-usual (BAU) scenario dominated by natural gas would fall well short of the 70% reduction target at 2050. Delaying reductions in BAU emissions beyond 2030 would require deployment of DAC to achieve the 70% target. Further delays to reduce BAU emissions until 2035 would require up to 1.4 Gt CO2 of DAC capacity to achieve the 70% target. Delaying reductions in BAU emissions beyond 2035 would require so much DAC deployment as to be implausible, placing the 70% target out of reach for most scenarios. Each year of delay in reducing CO2 emissions beyond BAU after 2020 increases costs to achieve the 70% target. A DAC-based emissions reduction future could cost an additional 580-2015 billion USD through 2050 compared to emissions mitigation starting immediately. This translates to approximately 100-345 million USD per day of delay starting in 2020. These costs arise not just from building DAC plants, but from replacing relatively young fossil fuel plants being built today with renewables as well as for the electric power needed for DAC. These results make clear that minimizing the costs of DAC deployment depend on reducing BAU emissions as early as possible, and if done quickly enough, DAC can be avoided altogether - which reduces costs the most.

We used Tianjin, a typical megacity facing vehicle pollution problems, as the study domain to investigate a comprehensive estimation of vehicle emissions, including carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), inhalable particles (PM10), carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), from 2000 to 2030. The Computer Programme to calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT) model was used to simulate the vehicle emission factors. Historical simulations show that the total emissions of CO, VOCs, NOx, PM10, CO2, and SO2 changed from 545.1 Gg, 70.04 Gg, 60.19 Gg, 6.57 Gg, 6.82 Tg and 12.88 Gg to 259.11 Gg, 34.01 Gg, 55.14 Gg, 3.42 Gg, 25.30 Tg and 0.16 Gg from 2000 to 2016, respectively. Passenger cars (PC) and light-duty vehicles (LDV) were the main contributors to the CO and VOCs emissions. Heavy-duty trucks (HDT) and buses (BUS) were the important contributors to NOx and PM10. PC was the major contributor to CO2 and SO2. With respect to the future, four Single Control Policy Scenarios (SCPS), including Passenger car Population Regulation (PPR), Emission Standard Updating (ESU), Public Transportation Promotion (PTP) and Electric Vehicle Popularity (EVP), and Integrated Scenarios (IS), were assembled to describe the impact of future policies on vehicle pollution from 2017 to 2030. Among all SCPS, the results show that the ESU is the more effective policy to control emissions of CO, NOx and PM10, while PPR is the more effective way to reduce emissions of VOCs, CO2, and SO2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","COPERT; Scenario analysis; Tianjin; Vehicle emissions","Automobiles; Carbon monoxide; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Population statistics; Sulfur dioxide; Urban growth; Volatile organic compounds; COPERT; Estimation of vehicles; Historical simulation; Public transportation; Scenario analysis; Tianjin; Vehicle emission; Vehicle emission factors; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; megacity; pollution control; pollution policy; scenario analysis; traffic emission; trend analysis; urban pollution; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; China; environmental management; environmental policy; exhaust gas; mathematical model; motor vehicle; particulate matter; priority journal; statistical analysis; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064637077

Using global climate and impact models from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, our analysis shows that the frequency and intensity of heat events increase, especially in tropical regions (geographic perspective)and developing countries (national perspective), even with global warming held to the 1.5 °C target. An additional 0.5 °C increase to the 2 °C warming target leads to >15% of global land area becoming exposed to levels of heat stress that affect human health; almost all countries in Europe will be subject to increased fire danger, with the duration of the fire season lasting 3.3 days longer; 106 countries are projected to experience an increase in the wheat production-damage index. Globally, about 38%, 50%, 46%, 36%, and 48% of the increases in exposure to health threats, wildfire, crop heat stress for soybeans, wheat, and maize could be avoided by constraining global warming to 1.5 °C rather than 2 °C. With high emissions, these impacts will continue to intensify over time, extending to almost all countries by the end of the 21st century: >95% of countries will face exposure to health-related heat stress, with India and Brazil ranked highest for integrated heat-stress exposure. The magnitude of the changes in fire season length and wildfire frequency are projected to increase substantially over 74% global land, with particularly strong effects in the United States, Canada, Brazil, China, Australia, and Russia.

In a circular economic system, resource recovery and pollutant treatment are core subsystems. To improve resource utilization efficiencies and reduce pollutant emissions in the circular economic system, this study first proposes a comprehensive model using game theory and a data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. Then, to identify the technology gaps between circular economic systems, the study proposes a game meta-frontier DEA model. The proposed models are then applied to evaluate the circular economic systems in China's different provinces from 2007 to 2016. The results show a continuing conflict between economic growth, environmental protection, and resource recycling in China. In addition, the efficiency of pollution treatment and waste disposal (PTWD) and the production efficiency of the circular economic systems differ when different frontiers are applied. The improvement direction and potential efficiencies also differ. The production technology and PTWD technology in Eastern China are the highest, while the technology levels in Western China are the lowest. Based on management potential and technological potential, the circular economic systems in China are divided into four categories. For each category, this study provides the specific recommendations for improving production/PTWD efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Game theory; Meta-frontier; Pollution treatment and waste disposal","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Game theory; Pollution; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Circular economy; Comprehensive model; Meta-frontier; Pollutant emission; Potential efficiency; Production efficiency; Production technology; Resource utilizations; Economic analysis; data envelopment analysis; economic growth; economic system; environmental protection; game theory; heterogeneity; pollution control; recycling; waste disposal; waste treatment; article; China; economic development; environmental protection; game; human; pollutant; recycling; waste disposal; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063871275

Using a city-level data set for the period 2003–2015, we find that roads help to reduce the intensity of pollution emissions in China and induce greener growth performance. Specifically, we test two possible mechanisms through which roads improve environmental performance, and the results suggest that roads have a more positive and significant impact on air pollution reduction when an eco-industrial park is located in a nearby city. There is also evidence that roads can spur green innovation and hence can contribute to regional green performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Eco-industrial park; Environmental governance; Green innovation; Knowledge spillover; Transportation infrastructure","Environmental management; Eco-industrial park; Environmental governances; Green innovations; Knowledge spillovers; Transportation infrastructures; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064506855

However, the role of Saturn's rings as a dynamic conductive body has been elusive and of great interest to the community. Cassini's Grand Finale orbits afforded a unique opportunity to directly sample magnetic field lines connected to the main rings. Here we provide strong evidence for the persistent and organized presence of auroral hiss demonstrably associated with the main rings. This is in contrast to recent observations suggesting that Saturn's rings may be barriers to field-aligned currents.

Progresses in biology have contributed to better understand the complex and successive mechanisms of development of this pathology, whose diagnosis is based on a lymph node biopsy. However, the prognosis of the patients is heterogeneous and several indexes have been proposed to identify groups of patients with a similar life expectancy, in order to guide the therapeutic choices. The treatment has been modified in the last 20 years by the emergence of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies which constitute, alone or in combination, of the cornerstone of therapeutic management. After staging using, in particular, 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, the therapeutic strategy will be adapted for each patient, ranging from simple watchful waiting to a combination of chemotherapy and anti-CD20 antibodies. Relapses (which often require a new lymph node biopsy to eliminate a possible histological transformation into an aggressive lymphoma with poorer prognosis) remain common but are still accessible to effective therapeutic interventions. Thanks to these advances, the median life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma now exceeds 15 years. © 2019",,"antineoplastic agent; CD20 antibody; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; drug choice; follicular lymphoma; human; life expectancy; lymph node biopsy; monotherapy; pathophysiology; positron emission tomography; practice guideline; Short Survey; biopsy; differential diagnosis; experimental therapy; follicular lymphoma; immunophenotyping; immunotherapy; molecular diagnosis; pathology; personalized medicine; procedures; prognosis; survival rate; tumor recurrence; Biopsy; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Immunophenotyping; Immunotherapy; Life Expectancy; Lymphoma, Follicular; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Precision Medicine; Prognosis; Survival Rate; Therapies, Investigational",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070861127

However, there is limited knowledge about the controls on plant wax integration and transport in large catchments with multiple biomes and climates. To address this lack of understanding, we investigated the vegetation and climatic controls on plant wax integration and transport from the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), the largest river in the U.S., to the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We first estimated the geographic distribution of n-alkane carbon (δ13Calk) and hydrogen (δ2Halk) isotopic compositions (i.e. isoscapes) in the MRB using plant isotope fractionation calibrations from North America and similar climate regions for the pre-industrial. We utilized two different vegetation maps (i.e. biome map and %C4 map) and two plant isotope fractionation estimation approaches, and discussed advantages and disadvantages of each method. Then, we developed mixing models weighting the isotope values by biological and climatic parameters (i.e. vegetation area, n-alkane concentration by chain lengths, net primary productivity (NPP), and runoff) and their combinations to test the sensitivity of basin-integrated plant wax isotopic compositions to these variables. Our approach does not factor in soil stocks of plant wax nor degradation in transit, as future work will need to constrain these factors for the MRB for the period of interest. Vegetation area weighting alone predicted relatively high C4 plant contributions to the pool of waxes exported from the basin. When n-alkane concentration in leaves, NPP, or runoff was considered, the contribution of forest-derived plant waxes increased. Sensitivity of plant wax isotopic compositions to productivity and transport efficiency varied among models and chain lengths. For example, n-C29 alkanes were sensitive to plant wax contribution increases from forests whereas n-C33 alkanes were more sensitive to increases in C4 grassland productivity. The plant wax concentration and NPP were combined as an estimate for total wax productivity, and a combination of this total wax productivity and runoff were used to simulate both production and transport. These multi-parameter models estimated the highest plant wax contribution from C3 forests because these areas were calculated to have the highest productivity and greatest runoff.

Previous studies on soil denitrification have frequently focused on natural factors or nitrogen fertilization, but have ignored the role of pesticides. In this study, the effects of chlorothalonil (CHT, a common pesticide) and its major metabolite 4-hydroxychlorothalonil (4OH-CHT) on soil denitrification were explored. Results showed that soil denitrification rates (15N pairing method) were declined by 27.4%–72.2%, whereas N2O emissions were unexpectedly increased by 83.9%–299.5%. These disturbances were caused by CHT, rather than by its metabolite 4OH-CHT, and noncompetitive inhibition was observed with an inhibition constant of 9.74 mg kg−1. Mechanistic studies further revealed that CHT inhibited soil denitrification process by deteriorating organic matter metabolism (electron production), electron respiration chain (electron transport), and denitrifying enzymes activities (electron utilization), more than by influencing denitrifier communities and denitrifying gene abundances. Furthermore, structural equation modeling suggested that electron respiration chain and N2O reductase activities were the most important drivers in explaining denitrification in CHT-polluted soils. Our results imply that the wide use of pesticides in agricultural production may disturb soil nitrogen cycle and increase the production of potent greenhouse gas N2O. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification; Electron behavior; Enzyme activity; Microbial community; N2O","Agriculture; Denitrification; Deterioration; Electron transport properties; Enzyme activity; Greenhouse gases; Metabolites; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Pesticide effects; Soils; 4-Hydroxychlorothalonil; Agricultural productions; Denitrification process; Electron behavior; Microbial communities; Nitrogen fertilization; Noncompetitive inhibitions; Structural equation modeling; Soil pollution; chlorothalonil; denitrification; electron; enzyme activity; greenhouse gas; inhibition; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063986258

These form the basis for a probabilistic Earth system model in atmosphere-only mode. Stochastic parametrization have become standard in several operational weather-forecasting models, in particular due to their beneficial impact on model spread. In recent years, stochastic schemes in the atmospheric component of a model have been shown to improve aspects important for the models long-term climate, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic weather regimes, and the Indian monsoon. Stochasticity in the land component has been shown to improve the variability of soil processes and improve the representation of heatwaves over Europe. However, the raw impact of such schemes on the model mean is less well studied. It is shown that the inclusion of all three schemes notably changes the model mean state. While many of the impacts are beneficial, some are too large in amplitude, leading to significant changes in the model's energy budget and atmospheric circulation. This implies that in order to maintain the benefits of stochastic physics without shifting the mean state too far from observations, a full re-tuning of the model will typically be required. © Author(s) 2019.",,"climate change; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; energy budget; geophysics; heat wave; monsoon; stochasticity; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069480744

Within plant communities, soil spatial heterogeneity can potentially buffer the effects of plant freezing stress by increasing the availability of soil microsites that function as microrefugia. Moreover, increased species richness resulting from soil heterogeneity can increase the likelihood of stress-tolerant species being present in a community. We used a field experiment to examine interactions between soil heterogeneity and increased freezing intensity (achieved via snow removal) on plant abundance and diversity in a grassland. Patches of topsoil were mixed with either sand or woodchips to create heterogeneous and homogeneous treatments, and plant community responses to snow removal were assessed over three growing seasons. Soil heterogeneity interacted significantly with snow removal, but it either buffered or exacerbated the snow removal response depending on the specific substrate (sand vs. woodchips) and plant functional group. In turn, snow removal influenced plant responses to soil heterogeneity; for example, adventive forb cover responded to increased heterogeneity under ambient snow cover, but this effect diminished with snow removal. Our results reveal that soil heterogeneity can play an important role in determining plant responses to changes in soil freezing stress resulting from global climate change. While the deliberate creation of soil microsites in ecological restoration projects as a land management practice could increase the frequency of microrefugia that mitigate plant community responses to increased freezing stress, the design of these microsites must be optimized, given that soil heterogeneity also has the potential to exacerbate freezing stress responses. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; community; diversity; edaphology; frost stress; niche theory; productivity; spatial environmental heterogeneity; vegetation","climate change; community composition; heterogeneity; niche; oxidative stress; plant community; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; vegetation dynamics; snow; climate change; freezing; grassland; season; soil; Climate Change; Freezing; Grassland; Seasons; Snow; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065047806

When estimating long-term pollutant concentrations via exposure modeling, facility-level annual average emission rates are readily available as model inputs for most air pollutants. In contrast, there are far fewer facility-level hour-by-hour emission rates available for many of these same pollutants. In this report, we first analyze hour-by-hour emission rates for total reduced sulfur (TRS) compounds from eight kraft pulp mill operations. This data set is used to demonstrate discrepancies between estimating exposure based on a single TRS emission rate that has been calculated as the mean of all operating hours of the year, as opposed to reported hourly emission rates. A similar analysis is then performed using reported hourly emission rates for sulfur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from three power generating units from a U.S. power plant. Results demonstrate greater variability at kraft pulp mill operations, with ratios of reported hourly to average hourly TRS emissions ranging from less than 1 to greater than 160 during routine facility operations. Thus, if fluctuations in hourly emission rates are not accounted for, over- or underestimates of hourly exposure, and thus acute health risk, may occur. In addition to this analysis, we also demonstrate an additional challenge when assessing health risk based on hourly exposures: the lack of human health reference values based on 1-hr exposures. Implications: Largely due to the lack of reported hourly emission rate data for many air pollutants, an hourly average emission rate (calculated from an annual emission rate) is often used when modeling the potential for acute health risk. We calculated ratios between reported hourly and hourly average emission rates from pulp and paper mills and a U.S. power plant to demonstrate that if not considered, hourly fluctuations in emissions could result in an over- or underestimation of exposure and risk. We also demonstrate the lack of 1-hr human health reference values meant to be protective of the general population, including children. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

To achieve these, bioenergy plantations with subsequent carbon capture and storage (BECCS) may have to be implemented at a large scale. Irrigation of these plantations might be necessary to increase the yield, which is likely to put further pressure on already stressed freshwater systems. Conversely, the potential of bioenergy plantations (BPs) dedicated to achieving NEs through CO2 assimilation may be limited in regions with low freshwater availability. This paper provides a first-order quantification of the biophysical potentials of BECCS as a negative emission technology contribution to reaching the 1.5 °C warming target, as constrained by associated water availabilities and requirements. Using a global biosphere model, we analyze the availability of freshwater for irrigation of BPs designed to meet the projected NEs to fulfill the 1.5 °C target, spatially explicitly on areas not reserved for ecosystem conservation or agriculture. We take account of the simultaneous water demands for agriculture, industries, and households and also account for environmental flow requirements (EFRs) needed to safeguard aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, we assess to what extent different forms of improved water management on the suggested BPs and on cropland may help to reduce the freshwater abstractions. Results indicate that global water withdrawals for irrigation of BPs range between ∼400 and ∼3000 km3 yr-1, depending on the scenario and the conversion efficiency of the carbon capture and storage process. Consideration of EFRs reduces the NE potential significantly, but can partly be compensated for by improved on-field water management. © 2019 The Author(s).

With its strong reliance on specific climatic conditions, the ski industry is regarded as the tourism market most directly and immediately affected by climate change. A critical review of the 119 publications that have examined the climate change risk of ski tourism in 27 countries is provided. This growing and increasingly diverse literature has projected decreased reliability of slopes dependent on natural snow, increased snowmaking requirements, shortened and more variable ski seasons, a contraction in the number of operating ski areas, altered competitiveness among and within regional ski markets, and attendant implications for ski tourism employment and values of vacation property real estate values. The extent and timing of these consequences depend on the rate of climate change and the types of adaptive responses by skiers as well as ski tourism destinations and their competitors. The need to understanding differential climate risk grows as investors and financial regulators increasingly require climate risk disclosure at the destination and company scale.

This project, built on 84km2 in the desert location of Al-Shagaya, is approximately 100km west of Kuwait City and comprises multiple renewable technologies as well as interconnection and site infrastructure. The Project objective is to enable the implementation of renewable alternatives to the use of fossil fuel resources to generate electricity in an effort to reduce emissions. The project evaluates the requirements of concentrated solar power (CSP), photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy technologies by testing how to address the challenges posed by the harsh Kuwaiti desert environment to these different technologies. WorleyParsons was appointed in 2014 as the Owner's Engineer and Project Management Consultant to support KISR with project implementation and contracting and oversight of the Design Build Operate (DBO) contractors through commissioning and the first 2 years of operation. The project has demonstrated that two of the technologies, PV and Wind, which have now been in operation over a year, have exceeded the generation predictions.

The complex depositional history of the biota within a tectonically active region provides the opportunity to investigate the diverse important factors essential in determining palaeoclimate.

This is not possible for the Conejo Volcanics fauna because most of the shallow-water taxa on which the provinces are based are rare or absent in it, and because the regional palaeogeography that determined the Miocene provinces is not known. Geochemical data are essential to compensate for a lack of information about water depth and geography. A δ18O isotopic palaeotemperature of 15°C for a specimen of Amussiopecten in the Conejo Volcanics suggests a shallow-water setting off north-western Baja California. However at the depth at which the fossils lived, the equivalent present-day location would be farther south, off south-western Baja California. Incorporating the climatic effect of local Miocene geography, the modern equivalent latitudinal position of the Conejo Volcanics would be somewhat north of there, off central Baja California at 25 to 26°N. This location is about 9° south of the present location of the Conejo Volcanics and suggests that the marine climate was warmer in the mid-Miocene by about 5°C. However, because approximately one-half of the latitudinal difference is explained by tectonic translation through micro-plate rotation and San Andreas fault movement, the estimate of climatic change is correspondingly reduced to only a few degrees. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","California; Conejo Volcanics; Miocene; molluscan provinces; Palaeoclimate","aquatic organism; breccia; climate change; fossil record; limestone; marine environment; microplate; Miocene; mollusc; paleoclimate; paleogeography; paleotemperature; shallow water; water depth; Baja California [(STT) Mexico]; California; Coast Ranges; Mexico [North America]; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; San Andreas; Santa Monica Mountains; United States; Alepisaurus altivelis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051949561

The method is based on state-of-the-art plasma transport and neutron spectrum calculations, coupled with a Monte Carlo neutron transport code, bridging the gap between plasma physics and neutronics. In the paper two JET neutronics tokamak models are used to demonstrate the application of the developed plasma neutron sources and validate them. Diagnostic data for the record JET D discharge 92436 are used as input for the TRANSP code, modelling neutron emission in two external plasma heating scenarios, namely using only neutral beam injection and a combination of the latter and ion cyclotron resonance heating. Neutron spectra, based on plasma transport results, are computed using the DRESS code. The developed PLANET code package is employed to generate plasma neutron source descriptions and couple them with the MCNP code. The effects of using the developed sources in neutron transport calculations on the response of JET neutron diagnostic systems is studied and compared to the results obtained with a generic plasma neutron source. It is shown that, although there are significant differences in the emissivity profiles, spectra shape and anisotropy between the neutron sources, the integral response of the time-resolved ex-vessel neutron detectors is largely insensitive to source changes, with major relative deviations of up to several percent. However it is calculated that, due to the broadening of neutron spectra as a consequence of external plasma heating, larger differences may occur in activation of materials which have threshold reactions located at DD neutron peak energies. The PLANET plasma neutron source computational methodology is demonstrated to be suitable for detailed neutron source effect studies on JET during DT experiments and can be applied to ITER analyses. © EURATOM 2019.","DRESS; JET; Monte Carlo method; plasma neutron source; plasma transport; TRANSP","Codes (symbols); Computational methods; Cyclotron resonance; Electric discharges; Jets; Monte Carlo methods; Neutron flux; Neutron sources; Particle beam injection; Plasma heating; Tokamak devices; Transport properties; Computational methodology; DRESS; Ion cyclotron resonance heating; Neutral beam injection; Neutron diagnostic systems; Neutron transport calculations; Plasma transport; TRANSP; Magnetoplasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072072445

Additionally, the impact of thermal annealing on their elastic properties was assessed. Phase separation of SiOC seems to have no significant impact on Young's modulus (high values of β-SiC compensate the low values of the vitreous silica matrix) and hardness. However, it leads to an increase in Poisson's ratio, indicating an increase in the atomic packing density. The phase composition of SiOC significantly influences Young's modulus, hardness, brittleness and strain-rate sensitivity: the amount of both β-SiC and segregated carbon governs Young's modulus and hardness, whereas the fraction of free carbon determines brittleness and strain-rate sensitivity. Thermal annealing of SiOC glass-ceramics leads to an increase in Young's modulus. However, the temperature sensitivity of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio is not affected, indicating the glassy matrix being stable during thermal annealing. A slightly improved ordering of the segregated carbon and the β-SiC nanoparticles upon thermal annealing was observed. It is suggested that this is responsible for the increase in Young's modulus. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Elastic properties; Plastic deformation; Poisson's ratio; Silicon oxycarbide; Thermal annealing","Annealing; Brittleness; Carbon; Elasticity; Fracture mechanics; Glass ceramics; Hardness; Phase separation; Plastic deformation; Plasticity; Poisson ratio; Silica; Silicon carbide; Strain rate; Atomic packing density; Elastic properties; High-temperature annealing; Local deformations; Silicon oxycarbides; Strain rate sensitivity; Temperature sensitivity; Thermal-annealing; Elastic moduli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061449064

In particular, Aedes ægypti is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Brazil (Scavuzzo, 2018). The infection causes flu-like symptoms, and sometimes evolves into a life-threatening condition called severe dengue or hemorrhagic dengue. It is a widespread infection that occurs in all regions of the planet's tropical climate, and now because of the climate change, it may expand to some other regions. In recent years, transmission has increased predominantly in urban areas and has become a major public health problem.Recently, there has been an increasing trend on GeoHealth studies by use of remotely sensed data for mapping health risk and monitoring vector-borne diseases. Thus, the aim of this work is to generate risk maps integrating those environmental and climate indicators with adaptive capacity factors to define regions with high risk of vector-borne diseases in Brazil. Consequently, we present a multi-indicator study, similar to the one already developed in Vietnam by Nguyen and Liou (Nguyen and Liou, 2018) for the Aedes Albopictus, but the present study is in Brazil for the Aedes ægypti and adding the information of the Soil Moisture (SM) from the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). Then, the study combines climatological data (e.g. soil moisture, temperature and precipitation), and demographic and socioeconomic data over the Brazilian territory for the 2013-2018 period.

However, the decrease in supply, increased demand, higher product costs and adverse effects on the environment led to the need to create the ISO 50001: 2011 standard to implement the Energy Management System (EnMS) in order to increase energy efficiency and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). Thus, the objective of this work was to characterize the diffusion process of the ISO 50001 standard around the world and what are the main factors that determine the adoption of EnMS in the different regions of the planet. For this, multiple regression models were used for the data of certification number and environmental, social, economic indicators, climate change and energy mining. Thereby it was observed that Europe has the highest number of ISO 50001 certifications and Asia is the fastest growing region. Among the countries Germany and the United Kingdom are those with the greatest diffusion of ISO 50001, but China has been increasing its diffusion with each year. Thus, the concern with climate change is the main factor that determines the adoption of the EnMS by the companies in the most diverse countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Country certification level; Energy depletion; Energy management system","Climate models; Diffusion; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Greenhouse gases; ISO Standards; Regression analysis; Country certification level; Diffusion process; Economic indicators; Energy depletion; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Multiple regression model; Non-renewable fuels; Source of energy; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064520679

Due to limited conservation resources, management decisions are often based on scarce biological information. This study investigated the current status of populations of the critically endangered oak species Quercus arbutifolia in southern China, including its distribution, threats, population structure, and area of occupancy (AOO). Additionally, by using ensembles of small models (ESMs), the present and future (2050) distributions of climatically suitable habitats were predicted throughout south China and Vietnam. The present distribution of Q. arbutifolia is extremely fragmented, with only eight confirmed populations and a very small number of individuals (ca. 1200 in total). The results presented here show that Q. arbutifolia populations suffer from habitat destruction and fragmentation, small population size, unbalanced population structure, and pressure from strong competitor species, even though all known occurrences of Q. arbutifolia are in already established nature reserves. Based on the utilized models, the current potential distribution is limited to MCFs, and 17 new areas were predicted to have complete habitats suitability for Q. arbutifolia. However, only a small area in Fujian province will remain suitable for Q. arbutifolia in the future. The current AOO of Q. arbutifolia is very small (8.49 km2), with one-third of all populations predicted to be extinct by 2050, even under the minimum emission assumption. Finally, various actions and conservation measures, such as search for new unknown populations as well as ex situ and in situ conservation, are introduced and discussed in this paper. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Conservation management; Ensembles of small models (ESMs); Species distribution models (SDMs); Threatened species assessment","Climate change; Climate models; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Information management; Population statistics; Biological information; Conservation implications; Conservation management; Critically endangered; Ensembles of small models (ESMs); Population structures; Species distribution models; Threatened species; Population distribution; angiosperm; climate change; climate effect; cloud forest; conservation management; ecological modeling; endangered species; environmental assessment; habitat fragmentation; montane forest; nature reserve; prediction; China; Conservation; Distribution; Ecosystems; Forestry; Models; Quercus; Vietnam; China; Fujian; Viet Nam; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064905666

China's provincial regions have distinct levels of agricultural development, and thus, different levels of agricultural bioresources (ABs) potentials. In this study, an integrated assessment model is developed to quantify the 3E benefits from the life cycle perspective, covering the whole process of energy-oriented ABs utilization. Integrating nine types of ABs and four types of energy conversion modes (direct combustion power generation, gasification power generation, briquette fuel and bioethanol), the model is applied to 31 provincial regions in China to uncover regional features of the 3E benefits. The results showcase that total energy benefits in all regions amount to 100.6 million tons of coal-equivalent, with the most for Henan, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Xinjiang and Jilin and the least for Tibet, Beijing, Shanghai, Qinghai and Hainan. The economic and environmental benefits of regions are consistent with the energy benefits, with a total amount of 10.5 billion USD and 229.2, 1.5 and 2.5 million t CO2, SO2 and NOx mitigations. Energy utilization proportion of ABs, allocation proportion, energy conversion coefficients, net profit coefficient and mitigation coefficients for four modes are the key parameters affecting regional 3E benefits. The results have policy implications on facilitating to reasonable and pertinent regional planning of energy-oriented ABs utilization. © 2019 by the authors.","Agricultural bioresources; Bioenergy; Emissions; Energy-economic-environmental (3E) benefits; Life cycle","bioenergy; emission; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; power generation; regional planning; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068663710

Objectives: We reviewed population-based studies on the impact of temperature on mortality and assessed the vulnerability to temperature-mortality associations systematically. Methods: We identified 207 studies published between 1980 and 2017 and summarized findings on effect modification based on individual- and community-level characteristics. Results: In our assessment of vulnerability to temperature-mortality associations, we found strong evidence of effect modification for several individual-level factors such as age and sex. We also found limited or suggestive evidence for other individual-level factors such as education, place of death, occupation, race, marital status, and chronic conditions. Evidence on effect modification by community-level characteristics for temperature-mortality associations is limited. We found weak evidence of effect modification for population density, heating system, healthcare facilities, proximity to water, housing quality, and air pollution level. We found limited or suggestive evidence for community-level socio-economic status, latitude, urban/rural, air conditioning, climatic condition, green space, and previous winter mortality.

However, in response to global climate and energy policies, a major shift towards renewable energy (RE)is presently underway. Apart from ample wind and solar capacities, the country has abundant bioenergy resources, mainly from agriculture and forestry. Particularly in the densely-forested Ukrainian Carpathians, wood is the most prominent bioenergy source used to meet the heat demands of households and public buildings. However, despite increasing forest area and timber volume in this region during the last 50 years, affordable bioenergy from forests remains scarce in many areas. At the same time, local communities suffer from energy scarcity, energy insecurity and high energy costs. In an effort to understand how better use might be made of Ukraine's bioenergy resource, addressing sustainability goals as well as the needs of local communities, this study assesses the significance and future potential of wood energy for regional economies and households from an environmental, economic and social perspective. The study employs a mixed-method approach combining literature review, a Best Practice contest and semi-structured interviews with forestry sector stakeholders in rural areas of Transcarpathia and Lviv. Several reasons were identified for the scarcity of affordable bioenergy, including the export-oriented wood processing industry, the lack of forest road networks and machinery, the short-term character of national forest strategies in relation to bioenergy, and other institutional settings that limit access to forest resources. Illegal logging, corruption, and lacks of transparency in timber markets add further difficulties. To address these problems and to meet the challenges defined by international climate agreements, two key innovative instruments were identified; 1)certification schemes for forest products and; 2)community-driven bioenergy initiatives (e.g. local cooperatives.). These approaches, ideally embedded in a local energy strategy developed by the communities themselves, have the potential to transform energy and benefit communities and the local economy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Crime; Heating; International trade; Machinery; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Timber; Bioenergy initiatives; Forest road networks; Institutional setting; International climate agreements; National forest strategies; Renewable energies; Semi structured interviews; Wood processing industry; Forestry; Foreign Trade; Forestry; Heating; High Energy; Machinery; Resources; Ukrainian; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065215167

This study provides answers to how farmers perceive climate change and what drives their adaptation decisions. To do this, data were collected from a random sample of 200 maize farmers in the municipality of Zè, Benin. Results indicated that almost all the maize farmers perceived change in climate variables. The adaptation strategies used by maize farmers in the municipality of Zè included adjustment in sowing time, use of improved crop varieties, crop and livestock integration and tree planting. Estimates of the multivariate probit model revealed that farmers’ capacity to choose a specific adaptation strategy is affected by age, gender, marital status, education, experience in maize production, credit, distance to market, ownership of TV and agricultural training.

The objectives of this study were to quantify the productivity and biodiversity of coastal lowland forests in the Dwesa Cwebe nature reserve in the Eastern Cape Province and characterize how estimates differed among alternative allometric equations. Using a complete tree census across six plots in the reserve, a total of 1489 trees were inventoried in 2011 and again in 2016. Aboveground tree carbon averaged 99.8 Mg C ha−1 (range 77.2–126.9 Mg C ha−1) using locally derived equations and 214.6 Mg C ha−1 using generalized equations. Tree aboveground net primary productivity averaged 1041.8 g C m−2 y−1. Forty-eight tree species were identified, including many species important to the livelihoods of local communities for medicinal, ceremonial, and other provisioning services. Overall, this study shows that current conservation activities are concomitant with high tree productivity and high levels of C stocks and biodiversity, including species of local and regional significance. Sustaining forest productivity and biodiversity in the future will be critical for maintaining ecosystem services and enhancing stewardship of forest resources in the region. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This article suggests that from the perspective of local distributive justice if taxes are used to guide people to behavioural changes the taxes should be sensitive to people’s ability to pay. This is because flat taxes tend to hit the less well-off harder than the prosperous. Furthermore, according to the “ability to pay” principle when people are bound to contribute to a common project we should not make those who are already worst-off more worse off. Following this, three further arguments are considered for why taxes aimed to diminish personal emissions should be sensitive to people’s ability to pay. First, in the case of flat carbon taxes, the burdens are not distributed equally because the relevant burden in question is not the price paid but the act or effort of changing behaviour. Second, a carbon tax that directs all to emission reductions is more effective in achieving these reductions precisely because it directs all and not just certain income groups to mitigate personal emissions. Finally, it is argued that reflecting external costs and discouraging consumption are different things. Further on, because of the nature of climate change, a carbon tax should be designed to discourage consumption and not merely to reflect external costs. A carbon tax that is sensitive to different abilities to pay is better in achieving this than a flat carbon tax. © 2019, Editura Academiei Romane.

In this experiment, the phytoremediation potential of V. zizanioides is further tested. Apart from V. zizanioides, eight locally available plant species, namely Phragmitis karka, Jatropha curcas, Brassica juncea, Vigna radiata, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum melongena, Spinacia oleracea and Withania somnifera, were also tested against different concentrations of endosulfan (0–1500 μg g−1) the interval of at 500 μg g−1. Morphological parameters in terms of fresh weight, biomass, shoot length and root length were deliberate just after harvesting. The chlorophyll, carotenoids and lipid peroxidation were estimated in plant samples. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dehydrogenase activity (DHA), pH, electrical conductivity and endosulfan concentration were analyzed in soil before and after cropping. The result shows that there was a noteworthy difference at 95% confidence level in growth of experimental plants when compared with control. Enhanced MBC and DHA showed active degradation of endosulfan by microbes that proliferate due to secretion of root exudates of test plants. Among all the test plants, V. zizanioides accumulated the highest and B. juncea accumulated the lowest concentration of endosulfan in their tissues.

It is expected to further expand the risk of plant invasion through ecosystem disturbance. Particularly, island ecosystems are under pressure, and climate change may threaten forest-dependent species. However, scientific and societal unknowns make it difficult to predict how climate change and biological invasions will affect species interactions and ecosystem processes. The purpose of this study was to identify possible limitations when making species distribution model projections based on predicted climate change. We aimed to know if climatic variables alone were good predictors of habitat suitability, ensuring reliable projections. In particular, we compared the performance of generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and a selection of machine learning techniques (BIOMOD 2) when modelling the distribution of forest species in the Azores, according to the climatic changes predicted to 2100. Some limitations seem to exist when modelling the effect of climate change on species distributions, since the best models also included topographic variables, making modelling based on climate alone less reliable, with model fit varying among modelling approaches, and random forest often providing the best results. Our results emphasize the adoption of a careful study design and algorithm selection process. The uncertainties associated with climate change effect on plant communities as a whole, including their indigenous and invasive components, highlight a pressing need for integrated modelling, monitoring, and experimental work to better realize the consequences of climate change, in order to ensure the resilience of forest ecosystems in a changing world. © 2019 by the author.","Azores; BIOMOD 2; Climatic and topographical variables; Forest ecosystems; Global climate change","Biodiversity; Climate models; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Learning systems; Population distribution; Uncertainty analysis; Azores; BIOMOD 2; Climatic and topographical variables; Forest ecosystem; Global climate changes; Climate change; biological invasion; climate change; ecosystem modeling; forest ecosystem; global change; machine learning; population distribution; topography; Azores; Biodiversity; Bombax; Distribution; Ecosystems; Forests; Models; Variables; Azores; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073889193

In Switzerland, the European Nightjar is a rare bird, decreasing in numbers since the 1970s, and is therefore highly threatened. The last breeding population occurs in the canton Valais. Initial expert-based conservation measures on formerly inhabited breeding sites were successful until 2000, however recent additional measures have failed. Nightjars are highly sensitive to light due to their special retina adapted to living in semi-darkness. We hypothesized that food availability, mainly moths, is not a critical limiting factor, but that artificial light emissions prevent successful foraging as well as recolonizing revitalised breeding habitats of the nightjar. To test this hypothesis, we used light trapping data of moths from the last 30 years to evaluate food availability and compared light emission on abandoned versus still-occupied breeding sites. Abundance of larger moths did not change significantly over the last 30 years, and smaller moths even increased in abandoned as well as in still-occupied nightjar habitats. However, light emission was two to five times higher in abandoned compared to still-occupied sites. These results suggest that increasing light emission during recent decades has exceeded tolerable levels for this highly specialized night bird. Authorities of the canton Valais should therefore order a reduction in light emission near nightjar habitats by replacing bulbs currently in use with customized LED or broad-spectrum lamps low in white and blue light, and assign remaining nightjar habitats as areas of complete nocturnal darkness, thereby also protecting other threatened nocturnal animals, including moths. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.","Caprimulgus europaeus; Conservation measures; Moth availability; Nocturnal adaptation","conservation; food availability; habitat; light pollution; moth; nocturnal activity; passerine; population decline; recolonization; Switzerland; Valais; Animalia; Aves; Caprimulgidae; Caprimulgus europaeus; Lepidoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064518146

The annihilation of cosmic positrons with electrons in the interstellar medium results in the strongest persistent γ-ray line signal in the sky. For the past 50 yr, this 511 keV emission - predominantly from the galactic bulge region and from a low surface-brightness disk - has puzzled observers and theoreticians. A key issue for understanding positron astrophysics is found in cosmic-ray propagation, especially at low kinetic energies (≲ 10 MeV). Aims. We want to shed light on how positrons propagate and the resulting morphology of the annihilation emission. We approach this ""positron puzzle"" by inferring kinematic information of the 511 keV line in the inner radian of the Galaxy. This constrains propagation scenarios and positron source populations in the Milky Way. Methods. By dissecting the positron annihilation emission as measured with INTEGRAL/SPI, we derived spectra for individual and independent regions in the sky. The centroid energies of these spectra around the 511 keV line are converted into Doppler shifts, representing the line-of-sight velocity along different galactic longitudes. This results in a longitude-velocity diagram of positron annihilation. From high-resolution spectra, we also determined Doppler-broadening from γ-ray line shape parameters to study annihilation conditions as they vary with galactic longitude. Results. We found line-of-sight velocities in the 511 keV line that are consistent with zero, as well as with galactic rotation from CO measurements (2-3 km s-1 deg-1), and measurements of radioactive 26Al (7.5-9.5 km s-1 deg-1). The velocity gradient in the inner ±30° is determined to be 4 ± 6 km s-1 deg-1. The width of the 511 keV line is constant as a function of longitude at 2.43 ± 0.14 keV, with possibly different values towards the disk. The positronium fraction is found to be 1.0 along the galactic plane. Conclusions. The weak signals in the disk leave the question open of whether positron annihilation is associated with the high velocities seen in 26Al or rather with ordinarily rotating components of the Milky Way's interstellar medium. We confirm previous results that positrons are slowed down to the 10 eV energy scale before annihilation and constrain bulk Doppler-broadening contributions to ≲ 1.25 keV in the inner radian. Consequently, the true annihilation conditions remain unclear. © T.

Birla Science Centre, Hyderabad, India","The anthology titled ""Spacetime Energy: A Twenty First Century Perspective"" encompasses novel and avant garde ideas that delineate the intrinsic nature of spacetime and several of its aspects. The collection of papers epitomizes the fundamental aspects of the physical world. For instance, the authors have considered the affine connection between gravitation and electromagnetism. The noncommutative nature of spacetime has also been elaborated in connection with gravitation and electromagnetism and also in terms of monopoles. On the other hand, the rudimentary nature of the zero point field or the field of the vacuum has also been considered to describe the 2-state asymmetries that are found in nature. Several interesting models have been considered to get a novel perspective on the nature of the universe we live in; the importance of dark energy has been implied therein. The authors have also considered the phenomenon of photoelectric effect in case of grapheme and other similar crystals. A new formula has also been found for the conductance in case of carbon nano tubes. Ultra-high energy fermionic behavior has been elaborately discussed from a novel perspective and the anomalous gyromagnetic ratio of the electron has also been elucidated on the pedestal of the noncommutative nature of spacetime. Resorting to an altogether different approach, the nature of symmetry breaking and the details related to the relevant Lie algebras has also been discussed. Essentially, the collection of works provides a broad range of conceptual understanding of the universe, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic scale. Nevertheless, the reader should find the works to broaden their view of the physical world that exists around us. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In order to simplify calculations of leff, it was proposed to use a model (“effective”) source of such emissions because taking into account all of the real source properties (that are determined by the nonlinear processes of interaction between waves and charged particles in a wide region of space) would lead to unreasonably cumbersome calculations. The present paper analyzes how the effective length of the spacecraft-borne receiving antenna depends on the parameters of the space charge distribution in the model source of quasi-electrostatic chorus emissions. It is found that the length leff decreases as a power function (with exponent −1/2) with increasing distance (along the group velocity resonance cone) between the model source and the receiving antenna. This relationship is correct up to the distance at which the effective length becomes of the order of the geometric length. At longer distances, the radiation field loses its resonance nature because of the excitation of an electromagnetic (quasi-longitudinal) wave. It is shown that under conditions of the Earth’s magnetosphere, the approximation we used can remain valid up to distances of the order of the geomagnetic field line length, which confirms the importance of the discussed effect for correct interpretation of the electric wave measurement data in the whistler-mode frequency range. It is also shown that the length leff changes by less than 10% when the characteristic scale of spectrum of the charge distribution along the model source varies as Δ ∼ (0.1–1.0) kobs, where the wave number kobs corresponds to the observed spectral maximum of radiation at a given frequency. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Charge distribution; Charged particles; Dipole antennas; Directional patterns (antenna); Electric excitation; Electric lines; Electrostatics; Geomagnetism; Magnetosphere; Receiving antennas; Resonance; Chorus emission; Geomagnetic field lines; Geometric length; Group velocities; Mode frequencies; Nonlinear process; Wave measurement; Whistler-mode waves; Atmospherics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073694979

However, the lagging quantum yields of blue-emitting perovskite NCs have resulted in low efficiency compared to green or red perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs); moreover, the long insulating ligands (such as oleylamine and oleic acid) inhibit charge carrier injection. In this study, we demonstrated a facile ligand-mediated posttreatment (LMPT) method for high-quality perovskite NCs with changing optical properties to allow fine-tuning of the target emission wavelength. This method involves the use of a mixed halide ion-pair ligand, di-dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide, and chloride, which can induce a reconstruction through a selfanion exchange. Using the LMPT method, the PLQY of the surface-passivated blue-emitting NCs was dramatically enhanced to over 70% within the 485 nm blue emission region and 50% within the 467 nm deep-blue emission region.

In this study, an approach of analyzing the implementation effects considering regional characteristics with energy balance simulation model is proposed.

Forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon is mainly due to selective logging of intact/un-managed forests and to uncontrolled fires. The deforestation contribution to carbon emission is already known but determining the contribution of forest degradation remains a challenge. Discrimination of logging from fires, both of which produce different levels of forest damage, is important for the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program. This work presents a semi-automated procedure for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon using fraction images derived from Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM). Part of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene (path/row 226/068) covering part of Mato Grosso State in the Brazilian Amazon, was selected to develop the proposed method. First, the approach consisted of mapping deforested areas and mapping forest degraded by fires using image segmentation. Next, degraded areas due to selective logging activities were mapped using a pixel-based classifier. The results showed that the vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images allowed deforested areas to be mapped and monitored and to separate degraded forest areas caused by selective logging and by fires. The comparison of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RapidEye results for the year 2013 showed an overall accuracy of 94%. We concluded that spatial resolution plays an important role for mapping selective logging features due to their characteristics. Therefore, when compared to Landsat data, the current availability of higher spatial and temporal resolution data, such as provided by Sentinel-2, is expected to improve the assessment of deforestation and forest degradation, especially caused by selective logging. This will facilitate the implementation of actions for forest protection. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Deforestation; Environmental regulations; Fires; Global warming; Image segmentation; Land use; Automated procedures; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Linear spectral mixing models; Operational land imager; Reducing emissions; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spatial resolution; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Mapping; carbon emission; deforestation; environmental degradation; environmental monitoring; forest canopy; Landsat; mapping; RapidEye; Sentinel; Amazonia; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064930641

In this study, we presented gravity center analysis, boundary shifts detected in the X- and Y-coordinate direction and the direction of transects along the boundary, and spatial analysis to detect climate contributions at a 1-km scale in different ecological functional regions from the 1970s to the 2000s.Climate and land use data were used in this study. The results showed that during the 1970s-1980s and 1990s-2000s, the northeastern and southeastern parts of the FPE in northern China had similar spatial patterns with more extensive boundary shifts. In the directions of X-, Y-coordinate and the transects along boundaries, different ecological functional regions had significant differences in climate contributions to FPE boundary shifts during the three periods. In addition, during most of the periods, the results in different directions had good agreement in most of the ecological functional regions. However, the values of contributions in the directions of transects in the X- and Y-coordinate directions (4-56%) were always larger than those in the direction of transects along boundaries (1-17%), which shows that the results in the transect directions are more reliable and stable. Thus, the method of detecting the shifts in the transect directions developed by this study is an alternative one for analyzing the climate contributions to boundary shifts. Further evidences for explanation of the driving forces of climate change were given by spatial analysis of the relationship between climate change and land use change in the context of the FPE boundary shifts in northern China. Our findings provide an improved understanding of the responses of boundary shifts in farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China to climate change, which will be important for addressing adaptation and mitigation measures to climate change and regional land use management. © 2019 IEEE.","Boundary shift; Climate change; Contributions; Farming-pastoral ecotone; Land use","Ecology; Land use; Spatial variables measurement; Boundary shifts; Contributions; Farming-pastoral ecotone; Gravity centers; Land-use management; Mitigation measures; Spatial analysis; Spatial patterns; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072909723

In the present study, we aimed to examine the following. (a) How does the exclusion of above- and below-ground plant C inputs affect soil respiration and soil fungi singly and in combination? (b) Are changes in soil fungal diversity aligned with changes in soil respiration? A field experiment with manipulation of plant C inputs was established in a subtropical forest in southwest China in 2004 with litter removal and tree stem-girdling to exclude inputs of the above- and below-ground plant C, respectively. In 2009, we measured the rates of soil respiration with an infrared gas analyser and soil fungal community structure using Illumina sequencing. We found that the rates of soil respiration were reduced significantly by litter removal and girdling, by similar magnitudes. However, they were not decreased further by the combination of these two treatments compared to either treatment alone. In contrast, litter removal increased the diversity of soil fungal communities, whereas girdling decreased the abundance of symbiotrophic fungi but increased the abundance of saptrotrophic and pathotrophic fungi. These changes in soil fungal community might initiate CO2 emission from soil C decomposition, offsetting further decline in soil respiration when plant C inputs are excluded. These results revealed that the exclusion of the above- and below-ground plant C inputs led to contrasting soil fungal communities but similar soil function. Our findings suggest that both above- and below-ground plant C are important in regulating soil respiration in subtropical forests, by limiting substrates for soil fungal growth and altering the diversity and composition of the soil fungal community. Highlights: Litter removal and girdling decreased soil respiration by similar magnitudes The combination of litter removal and girdling did not further decrease soil respiration Litter removal significantly increased species richness of soil fungal communities Girdling changed the abundance of functional guilds of soil fungal communities. © 2018 British Society of Soil Science","biodiversity; girdling; Illumina sequencing; litter removal; saprotroph; soil respiration; symbiotroph","abundance; biodiversity; community structure; fungus; growth; litter; soil carbon; soil respiration; species diversity; subtropical region; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063393972

However, research concerning the PHH in relation to local areas and regions within country borders is limited. Therefore, this research focused on the relationship between the migration of pollution-intensive industries (PIIs) and environmental efficiency (EE) at the prefecture level throughout China's Guangdong Province from 2001 to 2014. Firstly, this research found that many PIIs migrated from the core industrial region of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) to peripheral Non-Pearl River Delta (NPRD) areas after 2006. A Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model was used to evaluate industrial EE of a range of different cities. Then, analysis using PMG/ARDL regression model shows that industrial EE maintained a negative long run equilibrium relationship with PII migration in the NPRD region where PIIs have moved out, but had little correlation with PII migration in the PRD where PIIs have moved in. The results show pollution transfer caused by migration of PIIs from the PRD to the NPRD region in Guangdong Province that supports the PHH. The NPRD had become a pollution haven for PIIs in the PRD. This study proposes that policymakers should build a series of environmental regulatory policies and industrial developing policies to avoid the creation of pollution havens in the developing area in China, instead of simply pollution emission control policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Environmental efficiency (EE); Guangdong province; Industrial migration; Pollution haven hypothesis (PHH); Pollution intensive industries (PIIs)","data envelopment analysis; developing world; emission control; environmental impact assessment; hypothesis testing; industrial emission; policy development; policy making; pollution policy; urban area; air pollution control; article; China; city; developing country; river; China; industry; pollution; river; China; Guangdong; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; China; Cities; Environmental Pollution; Industry; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066917849

Assessments of future climate are generally based on the ensemble mean of state-of-the-art climate model projections, which prefigures a gradual warming over Europe for the 21st century. However, a few models project single or multiple O(10) year temperature drops over the North Atlantic due to a collapsing subpolar gyre (SPG) oceanic convection. The occurrence of these decadal-scale “cold waves” may have strong repercussions over the continent, yet their actual impact is ruled out in a multi-model ensemble mean analysis. Here, we investigate these potential implications for viticulture over Europe by coupling dynamical downscaled EUR-CORDEX temperature projections for the representative concentration pathways (RCP)4.5 scenario from seven different climate models—including CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 exhibiting a SPG convection collapse—with three different phenological models simulating the main developmental stages of the grapevine. The 21st century temperature increase projected by all the models leads to an anticipation of all the developmental stages of the grapevine, shifting the optimal region for a given grapevine variety northward, and making climatic conditions suitable for high-quality wine production in some European regions that are currently not. However, in the CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 model, this long-term warming trend is suddenly interrupted by decadal-scale cold waves, abruptly pushing the suitability pattern back to conditions that are very similar to the present. These findings are crucial for winemakers in the evaluation of proper strategies to face climate change, and, overall, provide additional information for long-term plans of adaptation, which, so far, are mainly oriented towards the possibility of continuous warming conditions. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; EURO-CORDEX; General circulation model; Phenological model; Vitis vinifera L",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070229729

The photostability of the chromophore has been examined in solution and the dependence of spectral shifts upon solvent parameter has been studied. Also, pH sensitivity of the compound was evaluated in aqueous solutions. On binding to H + ions fluorescence quenching was observed by an approximately 94% reduction in the emission intensity within the pH range of 7.6–1.0 in solution. However, no obvious fluorescence change could be observed in the basic conditions. To identify the underlying mechanism of the probe depending on pH, ultrafast pump probe experiments have been performed.

Many policies have been implemented by central and local governments, from the introduction of alternative fuels until demand management like odd-even policy; results, however, are in most cases disappointing. This paper explained a system dynamics model for the road transportation sector in Indonesia. The model considers basic policy options under Activity, Structure, Intensity, and Fuel (ASIF) framework and includes two main objectives, i.e., reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emission. Policy scenarios were developed to cover business as usual (REF), transport demand management (TDM), the introduction of fuel economy (FE) standard and feebate system (FEE), adoption of electric vehicles (EV) which considers future technological improvement factors and fuel switching strategy. The result indicates that it is mandatory to have a policy mix as the most effective strategy to reduce energy consumption, CO2 emission and achieve national energy mix target in 2050. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Alternative fuels; Barium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Highway administration; Petroleum transportation; Roads and streets; System theory; Business-as-usual; National energy policy; Reduce energy consumption; Road transportation; System dynamics model; Technological improvements; Transport demand management; Transportation sector; Motor transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069447751

Biodiesel is an alternative fuel source that is obtained from renewable biomass, such as canola, soybean, corn, palm, sunflower, and algae. The green alga Botryococcus braunii shows great potential for biodiesel production due to its ability to produce high amounts of hydrocarbon. In this study, we investigated culture media (starter mix, miracle-Gro, and commercial fertilizer) and light sources (yellow, white LED, and pink/blue) effects on the growth of B. braunii for the production of biomass and hydrocarbons.

The U.S. Department of Energy's projections show that, under the reference case, the truck vehicle-miles-travelled (VMT) on the national highway system will further increase in the near future. This outlook with regard to U.S. Class 8 Heavy-Duty Trucks (HDTs) raises concerns regarding environmental, economic, and social impacts of these vehicles and HDT fleets. However, the transition to sustainable trucking is a challenging task for which multiple sustainability objectives must be considered and addressed, such as minimizing the life-cycle costs (LCCs), life-cycle GHGs (LCGHGs), and life-cycle air pollution externality costs (LCAPECs) of trucks while composing a truck fleet. This study proposes a hybrid life-cycle assessment-based robust Pareto optimal approach to developing a HDT fleet mix, accounting for the sector-specific average payloads of 5 U.S. economic sectors. The results of this study indicate that battery-electric, hybrid, and diesel HDTs make up most of the fleet mixes in the studied sectors in order to optimize their environmental, economic, and social impacts. It is therefore concluded that, given the relevant objectives and constraints, the current techno-economic circumstances in the U.S. and current forms of electricity generation should both be improved in order for HDT fleet mixes to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions of 30% or greater. The findings of the study will support decision-making processes by public and private organizations and help them to develop environmentally, economically, and socially optimized fleet mixes for their operations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative fuel adoption; Battery-electric heavy-duty truck; Fleet mix optimization; Heavy-duty truck robust optimization; Hybrid life cycle assessment; Robust Pareto optimal solutions","Automobiles; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Pareto principle; Sustainable development; Trucks; Fleet mix; Heavy duty trucks; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pareto optimal solutions; Robust optimization; Fleet operations; alternative fuel; decision making; economic impact; electricity generation; emission control; environmental impact assessment; freight transport; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; optimization; planning method; social impact assessment; transportation economics; trucking; adoption; air pollution; article; carbon footprint; electricity; human; life cycle assessment; organization; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064243728

Climate change-related reductions in land productivity and habitability and in food and water security can also interact with demographic, economic and social factors to increase migration. In addition to migration, climate change has also implications for travel and the risk of disease. This article discusses the impact of climate change on migration and travel with implications for public health practice. Methods: Literature review. Results: Migrants may be at increased risk of communicable and non-communicable diseases, due to factors in their country of origin and their country of destination or conditions that they experience during migration. Although migration has not been a significant driver of communicable disease outbreaks to date, public health authorities need to ensure that effective screening and vaccination programmes for priority communicable diseases are in place. Population growth coupled with socio-economic development is increasing travel and tourism, and advances in technology have increased global connectivity and reduced the time required to cover long distances. At the same time, as a result of climate change, many temperate regions, including high-income countries, are now suitable for vector-borne disease transmission. This is providing opportunities for importation of vectors and pathogens from endemic areas that can lead to cases or outbreaks of communicable diseases with which health professionals may be unfamiliar. Conclusion: Health systems need to be prepared for the potential population health consequences of migration, travel and tourism and the impact of climate change on these. Integrated surveillance, early detection of cases and other public health interventions are critical to protect population health and prevent and control communicabledisease outbreaks. © 2019 International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

Their policy strategies emphasize energy efficiency by means of technological innovations. However, these strategies are at risk of severe rebound effects, as savings from more efficient products and facilities may be (over-)compensated by rearrangements in consumer behavior. While rebound effects are widely acknowledged, it is less clear how they arise from the complex interactions between market actors, consumer preferences, and policy initiatives. Results: We propose a simplified representation of these complex dynamics, in order to point out levers for counteracting rebound effects. A pathway mapping integrates results from fuzzy cognitive mapping of expert knowledge, from a household survey on adoption and use and from macroeconomic modelling of energy efficiency policies. Core drivers identified across all methods are joined to a cause-and-effect diagram. The respective strengths of influence are standardized to effect coefficients. By tracing policy impulses through the web of interlinked drivers, the pathway mapping illustrates direct, mediated, and unintended impacts on market diffusion, rebound, and carbon emission reductions of energy-efficient technologies. Pathway mapping is demonstrated as an approach for integrating diverse disciplinary methods into a joint narrative illustrating overarching dynamics. Conclusions: Applying this methodology to building renovations and electric cars in Austria, the need to balance technology adoption and use becomes apparent. Convergent drivers stimulate the market uptake of the energy-efficient technology and simultaneously constrain rebound effects. For instance, educating customers on product features and activating their pro-environmental values, encourages technology adoption as well as ecological use. Contrastingly, divergent drivers have opposing effects on adoption and use. For example, fuel taxes counteract rebound, but also hinder adoption by increasing lifetime costs. Higher income enables adopters to carry upfront investment costs, but also increases spending in other, carbon-intensive consumption domains. The pathway maps show that market-oriented instruments promote the adoption of energy-efficient technologies but also the rebound effect in their subsequent use. Policy interventions should be carefully designed to leverage convergent and to circumnavigate divergent drivers in order to address multiple impact paths. Climate strategies should not underestimate the role of socio-psychological characteristics and key actors. © 2019 The Author(s).","Energy efficiency; Policy design; Rebound effect; System analysis; System model; Technological innovation","Carbon; Commerce; Consumer behavior; Economic analysis; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Environmental technology; Investments; Mapping; Surveys; Systems analysis; Adoption of energy-efficient technologies; Energy efficiency policies; Energy efficient technology; Policy design; Psychological characteristics; Rebound effect; System modeling; Technological innovation; Energy efficiency; automobile; building; carbon emission; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; household survey; innovation; policy making; policy strategy; systems analysis; technological change; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068527378

It also regulates the rate of global temperature rise in response to rising GHGs4. The tropical Pacific Ocean response to rising GHGs impacts all of the world’s population. State-of-the-art climate models predict that rising GHGs reduce the west-to-east warm-to-cool sea surface temperature gradient across the equatorial Pacific5. In nature, however, the gradient has strengthened in recent decades as GHG concentrations have risen sharply5. This stark discrepancy between models and observations has troubled the climate research community for two decades. Here, by returning to the fundamental dynamics and thermodynamics of the tropical ocean–atmosphere system, and avoiding sources of model bias, we show that a parsimonious formulation of tropical Pacific dynamics yields a response that is consistent with observations and attributable to rising GHGs. We use the same dynamics to show that the erroneous warming in state-of-the-art models is a consequence of the cold bias of their equatorial cold tongues. The failure of state-of-the-art models to capture the correct response introduces critical error into their projections of climate change in the many regions sensitive to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068105851

However, due to complex emission sources and nonlinear chemistry, it is unclear how such a shift might impact air quality. Here we apply a prototype version of the new-generation NOAA GFDL global Atmospheric Model, version 4 (GFDL AM4) to investigate the impact on U.S. air quality from an aggressive conversion of internal combustion vehicles to battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). We examine a suite of scenarios designed to quantify the effect of both the magnitude of EV market penetration and the source of electricity generation used to power them. We find that summer surface ozone (O3) decreases in most locations due to widespread reductions of traffic NOx emissions. Summer fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases on average and largest in areas with increased coal-fired power generation demands. Winter O3 increases due to reduced loss via traffic NOx while PM2.5 decreases since larger ammonium nitrate reductions offset increases in ammonium sulfate. The largest magnitude changes are simulated at the extremes of the probability distribution. Increasing the fraction of vehicles converted to EVs further decreases summer O3, while increasing the fraction of electricity generated by “emission-free” sources largely eliminates the increases in summer PM2.5 at high EV adoption fractions. Ultimately, the number of conventional vehicles replaced by EVs has a larger effect on O3 than PM2.5, while the source of the electricity for those EVs exhibit greater control on PM2.5. © 2019","Air quality; Chemistry model; Electric vehicles; Ozone; Particulate matter","Air quality; Coal combustion; Electric vehicles; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Probability distributions; Sulfur compounds; Vehicles; Battery-powered electric vehicles; Chemistry modeling; Coal-fired power generation; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Global atmospheric models; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Light duty passenger vehicles; Particulate Matter; Electric power generation; ammonium nitrate; ammonium sulfate; diesel fuel; fossil fuel; gasoline; ozone; air quality; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electrification; greenhouse gas; ozone; particulate matter; power generation; air quality; Article; biomass; combustion; electricity; electrification; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; grid cell; particulate matter; priority journal; probability; reduction (chemistry); seasonal variation; summer; thermostability; traffic and transport; United States; winter; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063948959

In particular, the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) annual limit-value set by the European Union of 40 μg/m3 was not met at ~40% of roadside monitoring stations across German cities in 2018. In response to this issue, many cities are experimenting with various traffic-reducing measures targeting diesel passenger vehicles so as to reduce emissions of NO2 and improve air quality. Identifying the determinants of public acceptance for these measures using a systematic approach can help inform policy-makers in other German cities. Survey data generated from a questionnaire in Potsdam, Germany, were used in predictive models to quantify support for investments in traffic-reducing measures generally and to quantify support for a specific traffic-reducing measure implemented in Potsdam in 2017. This exploratory analysis found that general support for investments in such measures was most strongly predicted by environmental and air pollution perception variables, whereas specific support for the actual traffic measure was most strongly predicted by mobility habits and preferences. With such measures becoming more common in German cities and across Europe, these results exemplify the complexity of factors influencing public acceptance of traffic-reducing policies, highlight the contrasting roles environmental beliefs and mobility habits play in determining support for such measures, and emphasize the connections between mobility, air pollution, and human health. © 2019 by the authors.","Air quality; Public acceptance; Transdisciplinary; Transport policy; Urban","air quality; atmospheric pollution; diesel engine; European Union; nitrogen dioxide; perception; pollution incidence; traffic emission; Brandenburg [Germany]; Germany; Potsdam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073900616

In contrast, we identify four drivers that facilitate trade of renewable energy carriers. These drivers may lead to trade volumes remaining at current levels or even to an increase during the transition to an energy system with very high shares of renewables. First, new land-efficient technologies for renewable fuel production become increasingly available and technically allow for long-distance trade in renewables. Second, regional differences in social acceptance and land availability for energy infrastructure support the development of renewable fuel import and export streams. Third, the economics of renewable energy systems, i.e. the different production conditions globally and the high costs of fully renewable regional electricity systems, will create opportunities for spatial arbitrage. Fourth, a reduction of stranded investments in the fossil fuel sector is possible by switching from fossil fuels to renewable fuel trade. The impact of these drivers on trade in renewable energy carriers is currently under-investigated by the global energy systems research community. The importance of the topic, in particular as trade can redistribute profits and losses of decarbonization and may hence support finding new partners in climate change mitigation negotiations, warrants further research efforts in this area therefore. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.",,"Climate change; Commerce; Depreciation; Electric utilities; Financial markets; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Climate change mitigation; Efficient technology; Electricity system; Energy infrastructures; Regional differences; Renewable energy carrier; Renewable energy systems; Spatial arbitrages; Fossil fuels; alternative energy; climate change; comparative study; economics; energy market; fossil fuel; global change; investment; negotiation process",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069043430

Given increasing environmental variability and uncertainty under global change, an emerging question is how biodiversity influences the stability of multiple functions (i.e. multifunctional stability). We currently know little, however, about the determinants and mechanisms of multifunctional stability, which is of practical importance for ensuring the sustainable provision of multiple functions. Here, we examined mechanisms contributing to stability (quantified as the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation) of multiple functions related to ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration, including plant above-ground and below-ground productivity, litter production, gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration, in a large grassland biodiversity experiment in Inner Mongolia. We found that community-wide species asynchrony was a strong driver to stabilize multiple functions. Community-wide asynchrony mediated the positive effects of species richness and response diversity (describing how species with similar effects on ecosystem function respond differently to environmental change) on multifunctional stability. However, species richness had a negative direct effect on multifunctional stability because, although it increased the averaged temporal mean of multiple functions, it strongly increased the averaged temporal standard deviation of multiple functions. The overall effects of species richness on multifunctional stability were thus negative, whereas those of response diversity were positive. Synthesis. The studied ecosystem functions related to ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration are important in natural grasslands across the world. We conclude that species asynchrony and response diversity, rather than species richness, are key to the ecosystem multifunctional stability. The loss of response diversity and compensatory mechanisms would likely reduce the long-term sustainability of grasslands in the face of global change. © 2019 The Authors.

Promissory discourse accords smart grids pride of place within them. We employ a living lab to study smart grids as a solution geared towards upscaling and systematisation, investigate their limits as a climate change mitigation solution, and assess them rigorously as urban energy transitions. Our 18 month living lab simulates a household energy management platform in Bergen. Norway's mitigation focus promotes smart meter roll-out as reducing carbon emissions, by (i) unlocking efficiency gains, and (ii) increasing awareness for demand-side management. We problematise this discourse. Raising awareness encounters intractable challenges for smart grid scalability. Scattered efficiency gains constitute modest increments rather than the substantial change requisite for rapid mitigation. Whereas promissory smart grid discourse overlooks these ground-truthed limits, our findings caution against misplaced expectations concerning mitigation. We contest discursive enthusiasm on smart grids and argue for aligning local and systemic concerns before upscaling to avoid obscuring risks. Scaling up requires understanding and addressing interdependencies and trade-offs across scales. Focus group discussions and surveys with living lab participants who used sub-meter monitors to track real-time household electricity consumption data over an extended period show that technical issues and energy behaviour, as well as political economic and policy structures and factors, pose significant limits to smart grids. Urban strategies for climate change mitigation must be informed by this recognition. Our results indicate that upscaling relies on bottom-up popular acceptance of the salient technical, organisational and standardisation measures, but that measures to improve the democratic legitimacy of and participation in energy transitions remain weak.

By appraising how GHG emissions have changed with respect to agricultural production (elasticity), we are able to classify countries into six decoupling states. While the decoupling elasticity provides information for assessing the evolution within countries, we introduce a performance ratio for country comparison by calculating GHG emissions over agricultural production for 2015 and using the global distribution as benchmark. The information from both measurements serves to identify various country and sub regional situations. The findings illustrate that countries with performance ratios in the top 25% and under the best-case elasticity scenario (of strong decoupling) are not necessarily the same as the ones usually identified under factor productivity analyses, suggesting that environment-specific policy incentives and tools play a key role in enhancing sustainable agricultural production. Another major finding is that very few countries in the region (and worldwide) are able to offset agriculture emissions with land use-related carbon sequestration practices. Lastly, the evidence on small Caribbean island-states reporting the worst-case elasticity scenario (of strong negative decoupling) and performance ratios close to the world median, further supports the need for development plans related to climate change mitigation and adaptation in this sub region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural; Decoupling elasticities; Environmental policy; Forestry and other land use change (AFOLU)","Benchmarking; Climate change; Elasticity; Environmental protection; Forestry; Gas emissions; Land use; Agricultural; Agricultural productions; Climate change mitigation; Environmental efficiency; Environmental policy; Land-use change; Latin America and the Caribbean; Sustainable agricultural; Greenhouse gases; agricultural emission; agricultural production; agroindustry; carbon sequestration; climate change; factor productivity; greenhouse gas; spatiotemporal analysis; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062222826

Through dispersion of silica gel in a polymer, films can be made that absorb and desorb water vapor. The water vapor absorption becomes reversible by exposing such films to a water vapor pressure below that of the water vapor pressure during absorption, or by heating the film. The intention of this study was to achieve a better understanding about the water vapor absorption, permeability (H2O, N2, O2, CO2), and mechanical properties of films with dispersed silica gel. Low-density polyethylene (PE-LD) monolayer films with a nominal silica gel concentration of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 g dispersed silica gel per 1 g film (PE-LD) were prepared and they absorbed up to 0.08 g water vapor per 1 g of film. The water vapor absorption as a function of time was described by using effective diffusion coeffcients. The steady state (effective) water vapor permeation coeffcients of the films with dispersed silica gel were a factor of 2 to 14 (8.4 to 60.2·10-12 mg·cm·(cm2·s·Pa)-1, 23 °C) higher than for pure PE-LD films (4.3·10-12 mg·mg·(cm2·s·Pa)-1, 23 °C). On the other hand, the steady state gas permeabilities for N2, O2, and CO2 were reduced to around one-third of the pure PE-LD films. An important result is that (effective) water vapor permeation coeffcients calculated from results of sorption and measured by permeation experiments yielded similar values. It has been found that it is possible to describe the sorption and diffusion behavior of water by knowing the permeability coeffcient and the sorption capacity of the film (Peff. ≈ Seff.≈Deff.). The tensile stress changed only slightly (values between 10 and 14 N mm-2), while the tensile strain at break was reduced with higher nominal silica gel concentration from 318 length-% (pure PE-LD film) to 5 length-% (PE-LD with 0.6 g dispersed silica gel per 1 g film). © 2019 by the authors.","Active packaging; Mixed matrix membranes; Moisture control; Water vapor absorption; effective diffusion coefficient","Carbon dioxide; Density (specific gravity); Diffusion; Driers (materials); Hydrostatic pressure; Mechanical permeability; Moisture control; Polyethylenes; Polymer films; Silica; Silica gel; Tensile strain; Water absorption; Active packaging; Effective diffusion; Effective diffusion coefficients; Mixed matrix membranes; Permeation experiments; Sorption capacities; Water vapor permeation; Water-vapor absorption; Water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070461095

However, a typical construction will incur several air emission substances which can be categorised as direct and indirect emissions. The effect of these pollutant substances may have severe health impacts on the immediate surrounding environment of the construction site. The study attempts to quantify direct and indirect emissions associated with off-site construction and compare with traditional on-site construction. Two case studies in Chengdu, China is used to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of off-site construction as compared to conventional construction. The results indicate GHG emissions reduction of 8.40% for off-site construction. Impact assessment revealed pre-fabrication having more reduction on global warming and oxidation formation at global level and eutrophication, human toxicity and acidification at regional and local environment. Further analysis revealed a strong relationship between the transportation distance and the level of pre-fabrication on total carbon emission reduction. The methodology provided in the current study exemplified the importance of conducting a well-articulated assessment to help decision making on environmental impact reduction in off-site construction.

Optical passive RS has been vastly explored for agricultural mapping and monitoring, in despite of cloud cover issue. This is observed even in the tropics, where frequency of clouds is very high. However, more studies are needed to better understand the high dynamism of tropical agriculture and its impact on the use of passive RS. In tropical countries, such as in Brazil, the use of current agricultural technologies, associated with favourable climate, allow the planting period to be wide and to have plants of varying phenological cycles. In this context, the main objective of the current study is to better understand the dynamics of a selected area in Southeast of São Paulo state, and its impact on the use of orbital passive RS. For that purpose, data (from field and satellite) from 55 agricultural fields, including annual, semi-perennial and perennial crops and silviculture, were acquired between July 2014 and December 2016. Field campaigns were conducted in a monthly base to gather information about the condition of the crops along their development (data available in a website). Field data corresponding to the 2014-2015 crop year were associated with a time series of Landsat-8/OLI RGB false-colour compositions images and MODIS/Terra NDVI profiles. The type of information that can be extracted (such as specie identification, crop management practices adopted, date of harvest, type o production system used etc) by combining passive remote sensing data with field data is discussed in the paper. © Authors 2019.

To alleviate this problem, CO2 is added to the injected brine and transported in the reservoir by flood water. Therefore, Carbonated Water Injection (CWI) takes advantage of both CO2 and water flooding processes. Furthermore, geochemical reactions between the injected carbonated brine and rock can alter petrophysical properties of the reservoir and affect final oil recovery. While there are several CWI coreflood experiments reported in the literature, simulation studies for this process are scarce. Accurate modeling of CWI performance requires a simulator with the ability to capture true physics of the CWI process. In this study, a compositional reservoir simulator developed at The University of Texas at Austin, UTCOMP, coupled with a state-of-the-art geochemical package developed by United States Geological Survey, IPhreeqc, is used to model CWI process. We considered the impact of CO2 mass transfer between brine and hydrocarbon phases based on thermodynamic constrains at the reservoir condition. In order to validate our simulation approach, the results of our CWI simulations were compared with a recently published coreflood experiment. Moreover, we investigated the fluid-rock interactions in CWI. The results of the simulations, indicated that prior to water breakthrough the main drive mechanism is displacement. But as more carbonated water is injected, CO2 diffuses more into the trapped oil left behind, which results in oil swelling and subsequent oil viscosity reduction. Moreover, reaction of carbonate minerals such as calcite with carbonated brine results in dissolution of the main rock matrix which consequently creates wormholes similar to carbonates acidizing. In this study we propose a novel approach for accurate modeling of carbonated waterflooding process. The results of this study highlight the importance of geochemical reactions in modeling CWI process. Our approach has been validated based on history matching at the backdrop of a recently published coreflood experiment. © 2019",,"Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Enhanced recovery; Floods; Geochemical surveys; Geochemistry; Mass transfer; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petrophysics; Reservoirs (water); Water injection; Compositional reservoir simulators; Coreflood experiments; Enhanced oil recovery; Fluid-rock interaction; Mechanistic modeling; Petrophysical properties; Reservoir conditions; United states geological surveys; Oil well flooding; carbon dioxide; carbonate rock; enhanced oil recovery; fluid injection; hydrocarbon reservoir; swelling; water flow; Austin [Texas]; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064091639

However, finding scientifically robust research and distilling knowledge to draw confident conclusions in a reasonable timeframe is challenging due to the sheer volume of rapidly accumulating research evidence. Primary evidence is aggregated in secondary studies, i.e. various types of reviews, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, the number of secondary studies is also growing rapidly and their quality varies. This work presents the first systematic review of secondary studies which were claimed to be systematic reviews or meta-analyses of literature relevant to reducing carbon footprint of the built environment or its co-benefits (e.g., health and well-being). The resulting searchable and updatable database contains 131 reviews published between 2001 and early 2018. Importantly, the quality of the included reviews was assessed and categorized. The database is available via a dedicated website which includes interactive visualizations and filtering tools. In its current form, the interactive map and database can help discovery and appraisal of secondary evidence for decision-making and research use, supporting transition to low carbon future. This overview aimed to reveal trends and patterns, including gaps, in the publications of research syntheses relevant to sustainable built environment. The results showed that the number of reviews claiming to by systematic reviews or meta-analyses is rapidly increasing in recent years. However, the exact methodology used and the standard of adherence to methodological and reporting guidelines varies widely among reviews. The included reviews span different disciplines, such as environmental sciences, engineering, urban planning, public health, and social sciences. The first authors from USA, UK and Australia contributed the most relevant reviews. Health and well-being, along with closely related environment and nature, are currently the best synthesized subject areas, while there are still very few included reviews related to policy, economy or information technology, indicating synthesis gaps in these areas.

Although CuxO is highly photoactive, it is limited by the mismatched charge diffusional length and light absorption depth near the band gap. Recent progress on the effort to alleviate this problem is presented in this review, including the state of the art in morphological modulation of CuxO as a photocathode. While the issue associated with the incongruity of semiconductor property is progressively manageable, another issue related to stability in photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC-HER) is rather challenging. Continuous efforts to mitigate the stability issue include multilayer heterojunction, buffer layer, metal doping, and chemical bias. Conversely, the PEC reduction of CO2 (PECRC) is proven to encourage the stability of CuxO because of the reversible phase phenomenon. However, the efficiency remains low owing to the competitive reaction with the hydrogen evolution reaction. Efforts to mitigate this issue are in progress and are also reviewed in this work. A recent PEC performance of all oxide nanostructured CuxO set a new benchmark at par with Cu-based complex heterojunction and a noble metal–toxic element incorporated type of photoelectrode. A low-cost material and fabrication technique for a highly photoactive and stable CuxO photocathode film are expected to be realized for this green application in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide reduction; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Nanostructured copper (I/II) oxide; Photoelectrochemical; Solar fuel generation","Benchmarking; Buffer layers; Carbon dioxide; Chemical stability; Energy gap; Green manufacturing; Heterojunctions; Hydrogen; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Hydrogen fuels; Light absorption; Photocathodes; Photoelectrochemical cells; Pollution control; Precious metals; Reduction; Semiconductor doping; Solar power generation; Carbon dioxide reduction; Fabrication technique; Multilayer Heterojunction; Nanostructured copper; Photoelectrochemical hydrogen; Photoelectrochemicals; Semiconductor properties; Solar fuels; Copper oxides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067542737

Sequential extraction procedure was applied to partition the heavy metals into four fractions (soluble and exchangeable fraction (F1); carbonates, oxides, and reducible fraction (F2); bound to organic matter, oxidizable, and sulphidic fraction (F3); and residual fraction (F4)) in PM2.5 samples. The metals in each fraction were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Daily PM2.5 concentration ranged between 13 and 238 μg m−3 during the study period. For more than 92% of the days, the mass concentrations were greater than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) set at 60 μg m−3. The total mass concentration of the eight metals was 3.3 μg m−3 that accounted for 2.5% of the PM2.5 mass concentration and followed the order Fe &gt; Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Mn &gt; Pb &gt; Ni &gt; Cd &gt; Cr in dominance. The carcinogenic metals (Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb) comprised 10% of the total metal determined. Almost all the metals had the highest proportion in the residual fraction (F4) except Ni, which had the highest proportion in the reducible fraction (F2). Chemical fractionation and contamination factor (CF) showed that Pb and Ni are readily mobilized and more bioavailable. Risk assessment code (RAC) showed that Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn had medium environmental risk, while Cr and Fe had low risk. When the bioavailable (F1 + F2) concentrations were applied to calculate non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk, the results showed that the value of hazard index (HI) for toxic metals was 1.7 for both children and adults through inhalation. The integrated carcinogenic risk was 1.8 × 10−6 for children and 7.3 × 10−6 for adults, with both values being higher than the precautionary criterion (1 × 10−6). Enrichment factor (EF) calculations showed that Cd, Pb, Zn, and Ni were enriched being contributed by anthropogenic activities carried out in the industrial sectors of the city. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bioavailability; Chemical fractionation; Enrichment factor; Health risk; Heavy metal; PM2.5","adult; bioavailability; carcinogen; child health; concentration (composition); detection method; fractionation; health risk; heavy metal; human activity; particulate matter; public health; sequential extraction; suspended particulate matter; toxicity; Agra; Gangetic Plain; India; Uttar Pradesh; heavy metal; adult; air pollution; analysis; bioavailability; child; city; environmental monitoring; exposure; female; fractionation; human; India; metabolism; particulate matter; procedures; risk assessment; Adult; Air Pollution; Biological Availability; Chemical Fractionation; Child; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; India; Inhalation Exposure; Metals, Heavy; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065990474

Governance in the health system is a multifaceted sphere, with political, economic, and legal dimensions. Disaster risk governance is an analytical framework employed for assessing the capacity of institutional governance. This study has been conducted to investigate the current status of national strategy documents concerned with disaster risk governance in Iran through document analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigated documents were collected through requests from the secretariat and the archives. 102 documents were analyzed. Twelve documents in the domain of accountability, 7 in participation, 9 in state and nonstate actor, 14 in knowledge sharing, 21 in sustainable developments, and 19 documents in integrated risk management were analyzed. The process of analysis included selecting documents and evaluating and analyzing them by content analysis method. RESULTS: Documents coded according to the main areas of policymaking in disaster risk governance were analyzed, and sub‑component and related topics were deduced in each domain. The acquired themes include unity of command, trustee, commitment, capacity prosperity, align strategy, information synergy, knowledge enhancement, sustainable security, justice clarity, land use planning, climate change adaptation, environment reform, wisdom, environment, diplomacy, capacity and coherence. CONCLUSIONS: Disaster good governance is strengthened by the trustee, commitment, capacity prosperity, align strategy, and organize. Information synergy and knowledge enhancement are effective in the culture of prevention. Collective wisdom, diplomacy, and capacity coherence raise the alignment of public organizations and the government in the risk management process. © 2019 Journal of Education and Health Promotion | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow","Disaster risk governance; Document analysis; Iran; Risk governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071099967

Previous studies have shown that both climate and regulation affect IJF probabilities, but their relative impacts are poorly understood. This study presents a probabilistic modelling framework that couples hydrologic and hydraulic models to assess the relative role of regulated and naturalized flows on ice-affected backwater staging. The framework is evaluated at an IJF-prone town on the Peace River in western Canada, which has been regulated since 1972. Naturalized flows were generated for the comparison, and ice-affected backwater profiles were calculated along jams of varying length and location and for different combinations of model parameters and boundary conditions. Results show significant differences in backwater staging (~2 m for a return period of T = 1:10 year) between two study time periods (1973–1992 vs 1993–2012) as compared with two different hydraulic flow conditions (regulated vs naturalized), suggesting a larger role of climate than regulation in backwater staging. However, regulation was found to offset flood risk during the 1973–1992 period and exacerbate flood risk during the 1993–2012 period. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","backwater staging; ice-jam flood; probability modelling; regulation; risk assessment","backwater; climate conditions; flooding; flow regulation; hydrological modeling; ice cover; probability; regulatory approach; risk assessment; river flow; Canada; Peace River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069449145

Accurate assessment of trees on farmlands i.e. agroforestry would help in determining their contribution in meeting timber demand and also in carbon sequestration vis-a-vis climate change mitigation. In the present, high resolution multispectral satellite imagery (LISS-IV) has been used for mapping and estimating agroforestry area in Koraput district of Odisha. Both supervised and Object based Image Analysis (OBIA) classifications methods have been applied. In case of supervised maximum likelihood method, those pixels are fully captured where trees exist, whereas in OBIA captures trees according to their crown shapes. This proved OBIA method to be better in identification of trees on farmlands (scattered trees, boundary, and block plantations) than supervised method. This can lead to accurate estimation of area under trees in scattered form, in linear form and also in patch form. Improved results were obtained in case of OBIA classification with more than 90% accuracy. This research implies that remote sensing provide promising tools for evaluating and mapping of agroforestry at district level. Hence, the proposed approach of using high resolution remote sensing data in conjunction with OBIA method would be promising for mapping agroforestry area. © Authors 2019.

For that reason new solutions for clean and efficient combustion are investigated. One promising approach is the so-called combustion rate shaping. In this case the entire in-cycle resolved pressure or combustion rate trace is controlled by manipulating the whole fuel injection rate profile. One substantial task within combustion rate shaping is therefore the realization of the continuously shaped fuel injection rate profile. State of the art series production injection systems do not allow for a continuously shaping of the injection rate profile. Instead a multi-pulse fuel injection pattern with a finite number of injection events is being applied to approximate a continuous shaping. Each of these pulses is parameterized by corresponding actuation timings controlling the start and the duration of the injection event. In this contribution an optimization-based method for the digitalization of a continuous fuel injection rate profile is presented. For this purpose a reduced order injector model is presented. Additionally a suitable optimization problem is derived and presented along with numerical solution techniques. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072291151

In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), elk are the primary ungulate, with approximately 20,000 individuals migrating to exploit seasonal gradients in forage while also avoiding energetically costly snow conditions. How climate-induced changes in plant phenology and snow accumulation are influencing elk migration timing is unknown. We present the most complete record of elk migration across the GYE, spanning 9 herds and 414 individuals from 2001 to 2017, to evaluate the drivers of migration timing and test for temporal shifts. The timing of elk departure from winter range involved a trade-off between current and anticipated forage conditions, while snow melt governed summer range arrival date. Timing of elk departure from summer range and arrival on winter range were both influenced by snow accumulation and exposure to hunting. At the GYE scale, spring and fall migration timing changed through time, most notably with winter range arrival dates becoming almost 50 days later since 2001. Predicted herd-level changes in migration timing largely agreed with observed GYE-wide changes—except for predicted winter range arrival dates which did not reflect the magnitude of change detected in the elk telemetry data. Snow melt, snow accumulation, and spring green-up dates all changed through time, with different herds experiencing different rates and directions of change. We conclude that elk migration is plastic, is a direct response to environmental cues, and that these environmental cues are not changing in a consistent manner across the GYE. The impacts of changing elk migration timing on predator–prey dynamics, carnivore–livestock conflict, disease ecology, and harvest management across the GYE are likely to be significant and complex. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; forage; GPS; phenology; range; snow; telemetry; ungulate; Yellowstone","climate change; environmental conditions; forage; GPS; migration; phenology; plasticity; range size; snow; telemetry; ungulate; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; United States; Ungulata; snow; animal; climate change; deer; ecosystem; population migration; season; Animal Migration; Animals; Climate Change; Deer; Ecosystem; Seasons; Snow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065290294

The Lancet Countdown on Climate Change calls for urgent action on health and climate change; this requires appropriate knowledge, skills and competencies that can be gained through undergraduate education. The International Council of Nurses calls for leadership in nursing for sustainability; however, climate change and health are given little attention in nursing and health-care curricula. Design/methodology/approach: A cohort of nursing and midwifery students was introduced to sustainability and climate change in the context of health care through scenario-based learning sessions in each of their three years of undergraduate education. Questionnaires were used to collect data on participant’s attitudes toward sustainability and climate change, how useful the educational sessions were and the extent to which their clinical practice had changed. Findings: Significant differences were found between scores in Years 1 and 2 suggesting greater awareness of the importance of sustainability in nursing education and practice. Comparison of Years 2 and 3 scores found participants more likely to apply sustainability principles in clinical practice and challenge unsustainable practices in the work environment. Research limitations/implications: Further research is required to explore sustainability practice in postgraduate nurses/midwives.

A total of 240 seeds were randomly distributed among three different temperature treatments (32 ºC, 36 ºC, and 40 ºC), and monitored for 35 days. We measured seven seed traits and estimated the ecological niche of D. alata using a consensus of four methods. The treatment with the highest temperature produced smaller and lighter seedlings. The consensus of ecological niche modeling indicated that are expected to reduce the areas with climates favorable for D. alata in future scenarios. Thus, our two results (experiment and ecological niche modeling) are concordant, and both indicate the impact of global warming on germination (initial stage of the plant) and potential geographic distribution. Moreover, in geographic context, our experiment and ecological niche modeling indicated that north, northwest and central regions of the “Cerrado” are predicted to have lower morphological traits of germination and loss climate favorable area, since these regions are predicted to have higher temperatures (nearly 40 ºC) in future climatic scenarios. © 2019, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

However, to date, there is no comprehensive, large-scale evaluation on the effects of climate warming on the cropping systems of Iran. The objective of the current study was to quantify the effects of climate warming on the length of the growing period and grain yield of maize. We also tested the potential of changes in irrigation, nitrogen application rate, and using late maturity cultivars of maize to offset the negative impact of climate warming in order to maintain the current levels of grain yield (4 to 10 t ha−1 depending upon the province) in Iran. The crop modeling framework SIMPLACE was used to evaluate the effects of the warming temperatures, nitrogen application rate, and changes in thermal requirements of the cultivar scenario combinations on grain yield of maize in Iran. The climate, soil, and management inputs of the crop model were obtained from global datasets as grid cells at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution, and the outputs of the crop model were aggregated to the province level. Results of the grain yield projections showed a decline (− 0.1 to − 22%) in maize, especially in the Southern provinces (Khuzestan, Fars, and Kerman) under different warming scenarios by + 0.5 to + 2 °C, an increase from the baseline. The grain yield decline appeared to be mainly driven by a shortening of the length of the growing season and extreme heat stress during anthesis, the most sensitive period of crop growth. Increasing temperatures during the growing season lead to a marginal increase of absolute irrigation requirements over the maize growing areas. For all provinces, application of 10–25% more nitrogen than the current rate (170 kg N/ha-1) was able to offset the negative effects of higher temperatures (+ 0.5 and + 1.0 °C) during the growing season. However, the increased nitrogen application rates were not able to maintain the baseline level of grain yield under the + 1.5 and + 2.0 °C warming scenarios. Introducing late maturity cultivars, which required 20% more temperature sum than current cultivars to reach maturity, improved the grain yield in the cooler provinces by up to 10%. In conclusion, the grain yield baseline level may not be maintained under the highest magnitude of warming by increasing nitrogen application rates or using late maturity cultivars. Furthermore, more water is needed to produce a unit of grain under a warming climate. This study also suggests that combined adaptation strategies should be considered by policymakers in order to mitigate the negative impact of climate warming on the cropping systems of Iran. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate effect; crop yield; cropping practice; cultivar; growing season; maize; management practice; warming; Iran; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054347521

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite allows retrievals of the column-average dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2). However, regional column-average enhancements of individual point sources are usually small, compared to the background concentration and its natural variability, and often not much larger than the satellite's measurement noise. This makes the unambiguous identification and quantification of anthropogenic emission plume signals challenging. NO2 is co-emitted with CO2 when fossil fuels are combusted at high temperatures. It has a short lifetime on the order of hours so that NO2 columns often greatly exceed background and noise levels of modern satellite sensors near sources, which makes it a suitable tracer of recently emitted CO2. Based on six case studies (Moscow, Russia; Lipetsk, Russia; Baghdad, Iraq; Medupi and Matimba power plants, South Africa; Australian wildfires; and Nanjing, China), we demonstrate the usefulness of simultaneous satellite observations of NO2 and XCO2. For this purpose, we analyze co-located regional enhancements of XCO2 observed by OCO-2 and NO2 from the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite and estimate the CO2 plume's cross-sectional fluxes. We take advantage of the nearly simultaneous NO2 measurements with S5P's wide swath and small measurement noise by identifying the source of the observed XCO2 enhancements, excluding interference with remote upwind sources, allowing us to adjust the wind direction, and by constraining the shape of the CO2 plumes. We compare the inferred cross-sectional fluxes with the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC), and, in the case of the Australian wildfires, with the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). The inferred cross-sectional fluxes range from 31&amp;thinsp;MtCO2&amp;thinsp;a-1 to 153&amp;thinsp;MtCO2&amp;thinsp;a-1 with uncertainties (1&lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;) between 23&amp;thinsp;% and 72&amp;thinsp;%. For the majority of analyzed emission sources, the estimated cross-sectional fluxes agree, within their uncertainty, with either EDGAR or ODIAC or lie somewhere between them. We assess the contribution of multiple sources of uncertainty and find that the dominating contributions are related to the computation of the effective wind speed normal to the plume's cross section. The flux uncertainties are expected to be reduced by the planned European Copernicus anthropogenic CO2 monitoring mission (CO2M), which will provide not only precise measurements with high spatial resolution but also imaging capabilities with a wider swath of simultaneous XCO2 and NO2 observations. Such a mission, particularly if performed by a constellation of satellites, will deliver CO2 emission estimates from localized sources at an unprecedented frequency and level of accuracy. © Author(s) 2019.",,"anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); monitoring; nitrogen dioxide; OCO; Sentinel; Australia; Baghdad [Baghdad (GVR)]; Baghdad [Iraq]; China; Iraq; Jiangsu; Moscow [(ADS) Russian Federation]; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Russian Federation; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069783569

Initiative 732 promised to reduce fossil fuel consumption by taxing carbon emissions, while remaining revenue-neutral by lowering taxes on businesses, consumers, and working families. In promising revenue-neutrality, Initiative 732 sought support beyond environmentalists and similarly sympathetic voters. It failed to pass, achieving 41.2 percent of votes cast.

In this regard, several researchers have focused on developing biocovers that are primarily aimed at reducing CH4 emissions from MSW landfills. Although these studies have been successful in reducing CH4 emissions, the continuous CO2 emissions due to microbial CH4 oxidation and MSW decomposition remain a major concern. In this study, the CO2 sequestration potential of basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steel slag subjected to simulated landfill gas (LFG) conditions was examined to remove CO2 emissions from landfills while also promoting the beneficial use of BOF slag. Several series of batch experiments were performed at typical ambient conditions with varying moisture contents to evaluate the CO2 removal capacity of BOF slag. Small-scale column experiments were also performed simulating various LFG flow conditions, such as dry and humid LFG, and continuous and intermittent LFG flow into the column. The results from the batch experiments showed that moisture is requisite for the initiation of carbonation reactions in BOF slag; however, there was no definitive trend or an optimum moisture content that could be defined for the range of moisture contents tested. The CO2 removal rate appeared to have a two-step mechanism: initial rapid CO2 removal followed by gradual removal of CO2. The CO2 removal capacity of BOF slag was found to be 350 and 155 mg/g of CO2 under humid and dry LFG conditions, respectively. The total residual lime/portlandite, which is readily available at the slag surface, appears to be responsible for the instantaneous carbonation of CO2. In the long term, CO2 removal exceeded the theoretical capacity of total residual lime/portlandite content, which was likely associated with the leaching of other reactive minerals such as larnite (Ca2SiO4). Substantial CH4 removal by BOF slag (120 and 40 mg/g under humid and dry conditions, respectively) was observed. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Basic oxygen furnance (BOF) slag; Biocover; CO 2 sequestration; Landfill gas (LFG) emissions; Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill","Basic oxygen converters; Biogas; Calcium silicate; Carbon dioxide; Flow of gases; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Lime; Moisture; Moisture determination; Municipal solid waste; Slags; Basic oxygen furnace slag; Biocover; Carbon dioxide emissions; Co 2 sequestrations; Landfill gas; Landfill gas emissions; Municipal solid waste landfills; Optimum moisture content; Renewable energy resources; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; decomposition; flow velocity; humidity; landfill; larnite; microbial activity; moisture content; municipal solid waste; oxidation; oxygen; slag",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065330115

As a consequence, the species has already become endangered, facing enhanced threats of regional extinction. To compound this, the species shows high vulnerability to climate change impacts that may significantly reduce its present climatic niche. In spite of the ecological and enormous commercial importance of the species, the direct or indirect impacts of climate change on the species are not yet well-researched and well-documented. To develop sustainable adaptation pathways to conserve the surviving populations of the species, it is important to have precise assessments of the future distribution ranges of the species. The present study models the potential current and future distribution ranges of Taxus wallichiana based on its suitable climatic envelop developed under a baseline scenario (1960–1990) and climate change scenarios centred on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the year 2070, as provided in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the UNO's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The projected shrink in climatic niche of Taxus wallichiana by 28% (RCP 4.5) and 31% (RCP 8.5) highlights the vulnerability of the endangered species to climate change impacts and the perturbations on the structure of mountain ecosystem.

The electrochemical results demonstrate that pristine Sn electrodes show higher CO2 Faradaic Efficiency (FE) to formate compared to pristine Sn-Pb-Sb alloy electrode (80% vs. 66%) at -1.4 V vs. RHE. Upon oxidation treatment of pristine Sn at 4 V, the FEHCOO- improves to 84% at the expense of decreased current density. On the contrary, upon oxidation treatment of Sn-Pb-Sb alloy at 5 V, the FEHCOO- improved remarkably from 68% to 91% without any reduction in current density. The improved eCO2R performance of OD-Sn and OD-Sn-Pb-Sb electrodes relative to their pristine electrodes could be attributed to the presence of composite metal/metal oxide structure which leads to local geometric and electronic structural changes. © 2019 The Authors.

Nevertheless, the reliability of the service needs to be improved in order to attract more users. Traffic congestion results in unpredictable and inconsistent journey times, especially at peak times, hence, this IoT based system proposes to provide an analytics platform that normalizes data in order to improve the accuracy of bus estimated time of arrival (ETA) and gain insight on service performance. A Bus Stop module consists of an RFID tag, and a card reader will be placed on the bus and at the bus stop. This Bus Stop module will be installed at every bus stop together with LCD and interfaced to a Microcontroller-Arduino Mega 2560 and Uno R3. This module receives and sends information of the current, previous and next stop of the bus. The Real Time Clock (RTC) indicates the ETA of the bus at the next stop.

Energy demand can be supplied by renewable energy which is more clean and help reducing carbon emissions. Solar energy has become the dominant renewable energy in Malaysia since it is situated at the equatorial region with an average solar radiation of 400-600 MJ/m2 per month. In this paper, factors that affected solar power generation are studied. All data from these factors are collected and the correlation analysis is done to determine which factor has strong correlation with solar power generation. The factors that have strong correlation with power generation will be used to predict solar power generation for next month.

An attempt has been made to study the effect of operating parameters such as TiO2 load, initial concentration of the pollutant, emitted photonic flux, and pH of the solution. The degradation efficiency of toluene and benzene, as target molecules, was studied. In fact, result showed that the toluene is better degraded alone than when it is in a mixture. The rate of elimination of toluene separately was 89.5%, while it was 76.19 and 79.55% in the binary (toluene/benzene) and the ternary mixtures (toluene/benzene/xylene), respectively. Moreover, the mineralization of the solution decreased more rapidly when toluene was pure with a rate of 83.13% compared to binary and ternary mixtures. A mathematical model is proposed taking into account the parameters influencing the process performances. The mass transfer step, the degradation, and the mineralization kinetics of the pollutants were defined as model parameters. To build the model, mass balances are written in bulk region and catalyst phase (solid phase). The degradation mechanism on solid phase is divided in two stages. Firstly, the removal of toluene gives an equivalent intermediate (EI). Secondly, EI is oxidized into carbon dioxide (CO2). This approach gives a good agreement between modeling and empirical data in terms of degradation and mineralization. It also allows for the simulation of toluene kinetics without knowing the plausible chemical pathway. A satisfactory fit with experimental data was obtained for the degradation and mineralization of toluene. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Mass transfer; Modeling; Photocatalysis; Pilot scale reactor; Toluene; Wastewater","aqueous solution; carbon dioxide; catalysis; catalyst; comparative study; degradation; enzyme; enzyme activity; equipment; experimental study; inorganic compound; mass transfer; modeling; petroleum; pollutant removal; reaction kinetics; toluene; wastewater; wastewater treatment; benzene; toluene; xylene; catalysis; chemistry; comparative study; kinetics; oil industry; oxidation reduction reaction; photolysis; procedures; waste water; water management; Benzene; Catalysis; Kinetics; Oil and Gas Industry; Oxidation-Reduction; Photolysis; Toluene; Waste Water; Water Purification; Xylenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053035557

Results indicate that LCZs demonstrated significant differences in diurnal thermal responses, varying with the seasons. In general, compact LCZs had higher diurnal maximum (Max), minimum (Min), average (Avg) temperatures and temperature range (DTR) than open LCZs, and compactness had a greater impact on diurnal characteristics than the building height. Built-up types had larger DTR than non-built-up types and vegetated types had smaller DTR than water and bare zones.

China has set a macro carbon emission target, which will reduce carbon emissions per unit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 40% in 2020 and 60–65% in 2030 than that in 2005. To achieve the emission reduction target, the industrial structure must be adjusted and upgraded. Furthermore, it must start from a high-pollution and high-emission industry. Therefore, it is of practical significance to construct a low-carbon sustainability and green operation benefits of power generation enterprises to save energy and reduce emissions. In this paper, an intuitionistic fuzzy comprehensive analytic hierarchy process based on improved dynamic hesitation degree (D-IFAHP) and an improved extreme learning machine algorithm optimized by RBF kernel function (RELM) are proposed. Firstly, we construct the evaluation indicator system of low-carbon sustainability and green operation benefits of power generation enterprises. Moreover, during the non-dimensional processing, the evaluation index system is determined. Secondly, we apply the evaluation indicator system by an empirical analysis. It is proved that the D-IFAHP evaluation model proposed in this paper has higher accuracy performance. Finally, the RELM is applied to D-IFAHP to construct a combined evaluation model named D-IFAHP-RELM evaluation model. The D-IFAHP evaluation results are used as the input of the training sets of the RELM algorithm, which simplifies the comprehensive evaluation process and can be directly applied to similar projects. © 2019 by the authors.

We performed the first national-scale exploration of the relationship between the Air Pollution Index (API) and multiple meteorological parameters in China, using partial correlation and hierarchical cluster analyses. Relative humidity, wind speed, and temperature were the dominant factors influencing air quality year-round, due to their significant effects on pollutant dispersion and/or transformation of pollutants. The response of the API to single or multiple meteorological factors varied among cities and seasons, and a regional clustering of response mechanisms was observed, particularly in winter. Clear north-south differentiation was detected in the mechanisms of API response to relative humidity and wind speed. These findings provide insight into the spatiotemporal variation in air quality sensitivity to meteorological conditions, which will be useful for implementing regional air pollution control strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Air Pollution Index (API); China; Meteorological parameters; Partial correlation analysis; Spatiotemperal variation","air quality; atmospheric pollution; correlation; pollutant transport; relative humidity; seasonality; spatial variation; temporal variation; transformation; wind velocity; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071994017

To estimate the risks of O 3 exposure to forest health, several frequently used O 3 exposure indices (M7, M24, N100, SUM60, W126, and AOT40f) were calculated for the entire year of 2013 and the source contributions to exposure in April and August were quantified using a source-oriented version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Critical loads for natural ecosystems (12 ppm-h for SUM60) and for moderately sensitive plant species (23.8 ppm-h for W126) are exceeded in 85% and 75% of the forest areas in China, respectively. About 90% of the forest areas have AOT40f higher than the critical load of 10 ppm-h. Forests in the western rim of the Sichuan Basin (WSCB), parts of the southern rim of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (SQTP), Yunnan Province, and the North China Plain (NCP) have higher O 3 exposure than that of other areas. In spring, transport of O 3 and precursors from Southeast Asia have significant contributions to O 3 exposure for forests in Yunnan, SQTP and to a less extent in WSCB. In both spring and summer, industries and transportation sectors have large contributions to O 3 exposure along the WSCB and in the NCP. A higher priority in future field investigations to assess O 3 impacts on forests in China should be given to these regions. The results also suggest that O 3 production in China is much more due to nitrogen oxides (NO x ) than due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In order to protect China's forest from O 3 , it would be most efficient to reduce NO x emissions from industries, transportation, and other countries in general. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Critical load; Nature reserve; Southeast Asia; Tree","Air pollution; Air quality; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Risk perception; Volatile organic compounds; Community multi-scale air qualities; Critical load; Nature reserves; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Source contributions; Southeast Asia; Transportation sector; Tree; Forestry; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; forest health; nature reserve; ozone; pollution exposure; spatial variation; temporal variation; Article; China; controlled study; exposure; forest management; health hazard; nonhuman; oxygen transport; priority journal; quantitative analysis; risk; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; thermal analysis; urban area; China; North China Plain; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Sichuan Basin; Yunnan; Mimosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064313979

Due to the presence of two different couplings between the upper levels and the waveguide modes, we find that the bound states in this system are quite different from the case of a two-level emitter. The energy structure is dependent on the relative position of the emitter's transition frequencies from the band with finite width. We obtain the phase diagrams through numerical analysis. The dynamics of spontaneous emission of the system is calculated exactly in the general case by means of the Green's function approach.

A comprehensive evaluation of climate change impacts on Canada's crop production under different levels of global warming is currently lacking. The DayCent, DNDC and DSSAT models were employed to estimate changes in crop yield and production for three prominent crops including spring wheat, canola and maize in current agricultural regions of Canada. Four warming scenarios with global mean temperature changes of 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, 2.5 °C and 3.0 °C above the pre-industrial level were investigated. Climate scenarios from 20 Global Climate Models, included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and downscaled with a multivariate quantile mapping bias correction method, were used to drive the crop simulation models. Simulated yield changes demonstrate a potentially positive impact on spring wheat and canola yields at all four temperature levels, particularly when shifting planting date is considered in the simulations. There was less consensus for the currently utilized short-season maize cultivars, as yields were only projected to increase by DNDC compared to a slight decrease by DayCent and a slight increase up to 2.5 °C followed by a decrease at 3.0 °C by DSSAT. These findings indicate that climate at the global warming levels up to 3.0 °C above the pre-industrial level could be beneficial for crop production of small grains in Canada. However, these benefits declined after warming reached 2.5 °C. © 2018 Canadian Crown.","Agriculture; Canada; climate change; climate targets; crop models; crop yields","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Global warming; Plants (botany); Canada; Climate targets; Comprehensive evaluation; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Crop model; Crop simulation model; Crop yield; Global-mean temperature; Climate models; Brassica napus var. napus; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072048304

However, research shows these low-carbon technologies may create issues at the low-voltage (LV)distribution grid. High-level policy assessment currently lacks the support to take into account such local grid restrictions. To achieve this, we propose the use of a probabilistic simulation framework in combination with metamodeling, that allows to assess the potential LV grid impact for a wide range of cases. The probabilistic framework is first presented, which is developed for Belgian residential neighborhoods with air-source heat pumps and rooftop PV, based on previous work. Given the complexity and computational requirements of this approach, the paper furthermore proposes metamodeling as a technique to obtain inexpensive evaluation of low-voltage grid impact indicators, suitable for high-level assessments. Although metamodeling is extensively used in various engineering domains, no application in district-level grid-related indicators is available. Consequently, this paper's focus lies on discussing the various steps and options of the metamodeling procedure, while emphasizing problem-specific challenges. Lastly, the proposed metamodeling methodology is used for training simple metamodels for voltage indicators in neighborhood-level LV grids. Linear regression performed fairly well in predicting the minimum voltage levels, though less accurately close to the lower voltage limit, while logistic regression effectively detected feeders with violations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Grid impact; Heat pump; Low-voltage; Metamodeling; Modelica; Probabilistic framework; PV","Carbon; Emission control; Energy conservation; Housing; Grid impacts; Heat pumps; Low voltages; Metamodeling; Modelica; Probabilistic framework; Air source heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064653319

With the goal to reduce CO2 emissions through hydrogenation to CH3OH, a higher H2O formation rate than in the production from compressed CO-rich feed should also be considered. It is known that steam accelerates the sintering of metals, several oxide compounds, and their interfaces. To determine the effect of moisture on the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, a commercial catalytic material was systematically aged at various gas compositions and analyzed using transient H2 surface adsorption, N2O pulse efficient chemisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy mapping, X-ray powder diffraction, and N2 physisorption, and the mechanisms of deactivation were observed. A strong consistent relation between the compacting of Al2O3, the amount of water in the controlled streamflow, and the activity was found. This connected loss of support resulted in the (re)forming of Cu, ZnO, and Cu/ZnO phases. Copper particle growth was modeled by applying a physical coalescence model.

From the absorption and emission spectra of the synthesized derivative in studied solvents showed bathochromic shift in both the cases (Uv-vis and emission spectra), the ground state dipole moment (μg) and excited state dipole moment (μe) were obtained by implementing [Chamma-Kwaski-Villate, Bakhshiev, Lippert-Mataga, McRay and Suppan] solvatochromic shift techniques depending on solvent polarity parameters. The larger dipole moment value is observed in the excited state as compared to the ground state dipole moment and this discrepancy in the dipole moment value is due to polar nature of the molecule. From the results of both experimental and theoretical energy gap is found to 3.14 eV in average, from this, it can be concluded that the 3-BMH molecule showed a good agreement with the semiconducting material bandgap so that the 3-BMH molecule can be used as a potential material for the optoelectronic application.

Each route was driven six times, the first drive on each route was driven very timidly, each subsequent drive systematically became more aggressive with the sixth drive being very aggressive. From the vehicle speed and road gradient data, the instantaneous vehicle energy was estimated and correlated against the instantaneous NOX emission. In order to investigate for monotonic relationships, Spearmans rank correlation coefficient was used to investigate potential correlations between NOX emissions and driving parameters. A strong positive correlation was observed between instantaneous NOX emissions and instantaneous vehicle energy irrespective of the driving behaviour. The correlation of driving dynamics parameters with NOX emissions also showed a similar trend indicating that driving aggressiveness and vehicle NOX emissions have a strong relationship.

Our results spotlight differences related to wine production in the eight main wine producing countries for the Finnish market (Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Africa, and the United States), related logistics, and all packaging types for wine used in Finland (glass bottle, Bag-in-Box, PET bottle, beverage carton, and pouch). We found an average value of 1.23 kg CO 2 e for 0.75 L wine consumed in Finland, ranging from 0.59 kg CO 2 e for French wine in a bag-in-box packaging to 1.92 kg CO 2 e for Australian wine in a glass bottle. After identifying the main GHG emission hotspots in the wine supply chain, our scenario analyses highlight the effects of reducing glass bottle weight, moving away from glass packaging toward bag-in-box, increasing bulk wine export volumes to Finland, and following the European Commission's Energy 2020 strategy which targets increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent. © 2019","Finland; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Scenario analysis; Supply chain management; Wine","Breweries; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Glass; Glass bottles; Glass plants; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Beverage cartons; Domestic production; Environmental sustainability; European Commission; Finland; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Scenario analysis; Sustainability issues; Wine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064314070

Unlike conventional mass balance methods, our approach does not assume that city-scale emissions are confined to a well-defined urban area and that peri-urban emissions are negligible. We apply our new approach to a case study conducted in March 2016, investigating CO, <span classCombining double low lineCH4 and <span classCombining double low lineCO2 emissions from a region focussed around Greater London using aircraft sampling of the downwind plume. For each species, we simulate the flux per unit area that would be observed at the aircraft sampling locations based on emissions from the UK national inventory, transported using a Lagrangian dispersion model. To reconcile this simulation with the measured flux per unit area, assuming the transport model is not biased, we require that inventory values of CO, <span classCombining double low lineCH4 and <span classCombining double low lineCO2 are scaled by 1.03, 0.71 and 1.61, respectively. However, our result for <span classCombining double low lineCO2 should not be considered a direct comparison with the inventory which only includes anthropogenic fluxes.</p> For comparison, we also calculate fluxes using a conventional mass balance approach and compare these to the emissions inventory aggregated over the Greater London area. Using this method we derive much higher inventory scale factors for all three gases, as a direct consequence of the failure to account for emissions outside the Greater London boundary. That substantially different conclusions are drawn using the conventional mass balance method demonstrates the danger of using this technique for cities whose emissions cannot be separated from significant surrounding sources. © Author(s) 2019.",,"airborne survey; atmospheric plume; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; dispersion; emission inventory; flux measurement; Lagrangian analysis; mass balance; methane; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068893611

We analyse the case of Brazil, the country whose land-use emissions from deforestation and forest degradation have declined the most. Through semi-structured interviews with 29 country policy experts–analysed in full text around 7 categories of activities that existing literature identifies as central elements of an effective governance system–we find weak links between the international REDD+ system and what actually happens on the ground inside Brazil. The greatest weaknesses are rooted in the absence of any formal learning system, which prevents higher-level efforts from obtaining useful feedback from lower-level entities responsible for implementation. Analytically our approach is rooted in the idea of ‘experimentalist governance’ in which local policy experiments map the space of what is possible and effective with transformative land policy. These experiments provide information to broader international initiatives on how local implementation shapes the ability and strategy to reach global goals. The Brazilian experience suggests that even when international funding is substantial, local implementation remains a weak link. REDD+ reforms should focus less on the total amount of money being spent and much more on how those funds are used to generate useful local policy experiments and learning. Key policy insights A nascent system of experimentalist governance to implement REDD+ is taking shape in Brazil. However, the potential for experimentalism to improve policy reforms within Brazil is far from realized; Experimentalist problem-solving approaches could have a big impact on REDD+ with stronger incentives to promote experimentation and learning from experience; Reforms to REDD+ incentive schemes should focus less on the total amount of money being spent and more on whether those funds are actually generating experimental learning and policy improvement–in Brazil and in other countries struggling with similar challenges. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Amazon Fund; climate finance; experimentalist governance; results-based financing; UNFCCC; Warsaw Framework for REDD+","climate change; conceptual framework; environmental degradation; environmental policy; experimental study; governance approach; land use change; participatory approach; public spending; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060778234

To understand the impact of storage operation and demand response on emissions, it is necessary to determine the marginal emissions factor (MEF) at the time the storage or demand response was operated. This paper presents statistical approaches to determining regional MEFs using data on regional electricity demand and generation by fuel type, with a simple power flow model used to determine consumption emissions by region. The technique is applied to the electricity system in Great Britain in 2018. It is found that the impact of storage varies widely by location and operating mode, with the greatest emissions reductions achieved when storage is used to reduce wind curtailment in areas which consume high levels of fossil fuel generation, and the greatest emissions increases occurring where storage is used for wind balancing in areas where wind is not curtailed. The difference between the highest emissions reduction and highest emissions increase is found to be significant, at 785 gCO2 per kWh that passes through storage. © 2019 IEEE.","Decarbonization; Demand-side response; Emissions factors; Flexibility; Storage","Carbon; Decarbonization; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric load flow; Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy storage; Fossil fuels; Offshore oil well production; Particulate emissions; Demand side response; Electricity demands; Emissions factors; Emissions reduction; Flexibility; Low-carbon electricities; Statistical approach; Storage operations; Fuel storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074268393

Improved cooking technologies could generate environmental health benefits, yet prior results regarding reduced personal exposure to air pollution are mixed. In this study, two improved stove types were distributed over four study groups in Northern Ghana. Participants wore real-time carbon monoxide (CO) monitors to measure the effect of the intervention on personal exposures. Relative to the control group (those using traditional stoves), there was a 30.3% reduction in CO exposures in the group given two Philips forced draft stoves (p = 0.08), 10.5% reduction in the group given two Gyapa stoves (locally made rocket stoves) (p = 0.62), and 10.2% reduction in the group given one of each (p = 0.61). Overall, CO exposure for participants was low given the prevalence of cooking over traditional three-stone fires, with 8.2% of daily samples exceeding WHO Tier-1 standards. We present quantification methods and performance of duplicatemonitors.

This represents a challenge to most remote sensing technologies, which typically detect surface structure and parameters related to wood volume but not to its density. Since wood density is largely determined by taxonomic identity this challenge is greatest in tropical forests where there are tens of thousands of tree species. Here, using pan-tropical literature and new analyses in Amazonia with plots with reliable identifications we assess the impact that species-related variation in wood density has on biomass estimates of mature tropical forests. We find impacts of species on forest biomass due to wood density at all scales from the individual tree up to the whole biome: variation in tree species composition regulates how much carbon forests can store. Even local differences in composition can cause variation in forest biomass and carbon density of 20% between subtly different local forest types, while additional large-scale floristic variation leads to variation in mean wood density of 10–30% across Amazonia and the tropics. Further, because species composition varies at all scales and even vertically within a stand, our analysis shows that bias and uncertainty always result if individual identity is ignored. Since sufficient inventory-based evidence based on botanical identification now exists to show that species composition matters biome-wide for biomass, we here assemble and provide mean basal-area-weighted wood density values for different forests across the lowand tropical biome. These range widely, from 0.467 to 0.728 g cm−3 with a pan-tropical mean of 0.619 g cm−3. Our analysis shows that mapping tropical ecosystem carbon always benefits from locally validated measurement of tree-by-tree botanical identity combined with tree-by-tree measurement of dimensions. Therefore whenever possible, efforts to map and monitor tropical forest carbon using remote sensing techniques should be combined with tree-level measurement of species identity by botanists working in inventory plots. © 2019, The Author(s).","Amazon; Biomass; Carbon; Dynamics; Identity; Species; Tropical forests","Biomass; Carbon; Dynamics; Hardwoods; Remote sensing; Surface structure; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Amazon; Identity; Remote sensing techniques; Remote sensing technology; Species; Species composition; Tree species composition; Tropical forest; Forestry; biomass; carbon; density; remote sensing; tree; tropical forest; wood; Amazonia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068177765

Here, we investigated the effects of extreme drought and exotic plants, two of the most significant threats to Mediterranean-type ecosystems, on soil microbial community composition and carbon metabolic genes within a four-year field rainfall manipulation experiment. We combined measurements of bulk microbial and soil properties with high-throughput microbial community analyses to elucidate microbial responses and microbial-mediated alterations to carbon cycling. While microbial responses to experimental droughts were weak, scant rainfall periods resulted in decreased microbial biomass and activity, and relative abundances of bacterial groups such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Acidobacteria decreased concomitantly with increases in Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes abundance. Soils under exotic plants had increased temperatures, enhanced infiltration during rainfall events, and decreased water retention and labile carbon in comparison to soils under native plants. Higher peaks and more seasonally variable microbial activity were found under exotic plants and, like drought periods, the microbial community shifted towards osmotic stress life-strategies. Relationships found between microbial taxonomic groups and carbon metabolic genes support the interpretation that exotic plants change microbial carbon cycling by altering the soil microclimate and supplying easily decomposed high-quality litter. Soil microbial community responses to drought and exotic plants could potentially impact ecosystem C storage by producing a smaller, more vulnerable C pool of microbial biomass that is prone to increased pulses of heterotrophic respiration. © 2019, International Society for Microbial Ecology.",,"bacterium; biomass; community composition; drought; ecosystem response; global change; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; microclimate; rainfall; respiration; soil carbon; soil microorganism; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Firmicutes; Proteobacteria; Verrucomicrobia; carbon; bacterium; biomass; carbon cycle; drought; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; plant; Bacteria; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Droughts; Ecosystem; Microbiota; Plants; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063024313

Shocks of climate change, considerable expenditure to rural households, and the households’ sensitivity and adaptive capacity to shocks are explored, resulting in the following findings: (1) In villages where landslides have occurred, rural households’ exposure dimension and sensitivity dimension scores are relatively high, indicating that high vulnerability is accompanied by high sensitivity. (2) Rural household livelihood capital and strategies are always key means of resisting external shocks: vulnerable groups resist external shocks primarily with the help of social capital and community adaptive capacity, whereas invulnerable groups primarily cope by means of human capital and community adaptive capacity.

As electricity systems change, understanding the implications for water demand is important, given differential water availability. This letter presents regional water consumption and consumptive intensities for the United States electric grid by region using a 2014 base year, based on the 26 regions in the Environmental Protection Agency's Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database. Estimates encompass operational (i.e. not embodied in fixed assets) water consumption from fuel extraction through conversion, calculated as the sum of induced water consumption for processes upstream of the point of generation (PoG) and water consumed at the PoG. Absolute water consumption and consumptive intensity is driven by thermal power plant cooling requirements. Regional consumption intensities vary by roughly a factor of 20. This variability is largely attributed to water consumption upstream of the PoG, particularly evaporation from reservoirs associated with hydroelectricity. Solar and wind generation, which are expected to continue to grow rapidly, consume very little water and could drive lower water consumption over time. As the electricity grid continues to change in response to policy, economic, and climatic drivers, understanding potential impacts on local water resources can inform changes. © 2019 The Author(s).

If not accounted for in geological studies, this can lead to substantial misinterpretation of δ18O values in terms of paleoclimate and paleoelevation. Evaporation also leads to a lowering in residual waters of Δ17O, a measure of the departure of δ′ 17O from a characteristic relationship with δ′ 18O. We present new triple oxygen isotope data from waters and carbonates from lakes and their source rivers in the western United States (Bear Lake, Great Salt Lake, Lake Tahoe, Mono Lake, and Pyramid Lake). Consistent with predictions from steady-state isotopic mass balance models, the data illustrate marked lowering of Δ17O in closed basin lakes and freshwater lakes relative to their source rivers. The evaporation slope in triple oxygen isotope space (λlake)is similar for these lakes, averaging 0.5229 and ranging between 0.5219 and 0.5239. Moreover, models and data both show that the evaporation slope correlates with Δ17O, meaning that the slope can be estimated on the basis of the measured Δ17O value of the carbonate. We show how triple oxygen isotopes in lake waters and carbonates and ‘clumped isotopes’ (Δ47)in carbonates can be combined to reconstruct the δ18O values of primary (unevaporated)catchment precipitation (δ18Orucp). We use our lacustrine carbonate data as a test case for this approach, and find that δ18Orucp values closely approximate independently-measured δ18O values of catchment precipitation. However, the δ18Orucp values are consistently higher than δ18O of catchment precipitation by ∼2‰, which may reflect present incomplete understanding of a number of triple oxygen isotope parameters used in the calculation, such as the fractionation exponent for carbonate-water equilibrium, the evaporation slope λlake, and the Δ17O values of unevaporated meteoric waters. In conclusion, triple oxygen isotope analysis of lake waters and lacustrine carbonates is a promising new method for studying evaporation in fossil lake systems, but will benefit from additional research into triple oxygen isotope systematics relevant to meteoric waters, lake systems, and carbonate–water fractionation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","aridity; evaporation; paleoclimate; paleoelevation; stable isotopes; water","Carbonates; Carbonation; Catchments; Chloride minerals; Evaporation; Isotopes; Oxygen; Runoff; Water; aridity; Fresh water lakes; Isotopic mass balance model; Paleoclimates; Paleoelevation; Stable isotopes; Triple oxygen isotopes; Western United States; Lakes; aridity; carbonate; evaporation; lake water; oxygen isotope; paleoclimate; stable isotope; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065125805

Achieving internationally discussed goals for reducing carbon emission will be either impossible or involve significant costs without implementing the CO2 capture and storage (CCS). The volumetric CO2-storage capacity of a brine aquifer is among the most critical factors for the economically-viable &amp; large-scale geologic CO2-storage projects. The maximum sustainable injection rate or CO2 injectivity is another important criterion that depends on many reservoir properties. Based on previous experimental studies, we hypothesized that if the sweep efficiency of CO2 is improved by using suitable additives, then a higher end-maximum CO2 saturation can be achieved that, in turn, can increase the CO2 injectivity. In this regard, a strategy to enhance the CO2 injectivity was proposed by reducing the irreducible water saturation in a near-well region. In this study, the influence of reducing the irreducible water saturation and thus improving the relative permeability of CO2 on the CO2 injectivity and storage capacity is investigated in depth. A series of numerical simulations involving two test models – a hypothetical horizontal aquifer and a pilot test site in South Korea – were conducted to examine our assumptions with the concentration of surfactants confirmed from the previous experimental study. The results help to ascertain the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed injectivity-enhancing strategy. It was observed that the pre-injection of surfactant solution slows down the well-bottom-hole pressure and increases the total CO2 injection capacity, with the effect deemed proportional to the quantity of surfactant for a hypothetical flat aquifer. However, a nonlinear relationship between the surfactant quantity and the injectivity was found in the case of the pilot test site, which revealed that the surfactant pre-injection influences the migration of CO2-plume and solubility trapping as well. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 geological storage; CO2 injectivity; Numerical simulation; Pressure buildup; Storage capacity; Surfactant","Additives; Aquifers; Bottom hole pressure; Carbon; Climate change; Computer simulation; Fossil fuels; Numerical models; Reservoirs (water); Surface active agents; Carbon concentrations; Co2 geological storages; Injectivity; Injectivity enhancing; Irreducible water saturation; Non-linear relationships; Pressure build up; Storage capacity; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; computer simulation; efficiency measurement; numerical model; pressure field; saturation; structural geology; surfactant; underground storage; water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065186495

This characteristic is a consequence of plant's adaptive evolutionary processes to a given set of environmental conditions. Changing climate in northern lands (&gt;30°N) alters the state of climatic constraints on plant growth, and therefore, changes in the seasonality and carbon accumulation are anticipated. However, how photosynthetic seasonality evolved to its current state, and what role climatic constraints and their variability played in this process and ultimately in carbon cycle is still poorly understood due to its complexity. Here, we take the “laws of minimum” as a basis and introduce a new framework where the timing (day of year) of peak photosynthetic activity (DOYPmax) acts as a proxy for plant's adaptive state to climatic constraints on its growth. Our analyses confirm that spatial variations in DOYPmax reflect spatial gradients in climatic constraints as well as seasonal maximum and total productivity. We find a widespread warming-induced advance in DOYPmax (−1.66 ± 0.30 days/decade, p &lt; 0.001) across northern lands, indicating a spatiotemporal dynamism of climatic constraints to plant growth. We show that the observed changes in DOYPmax are associated with an increase in total gross primary productivity through enhanced carbon assimilation early in the growing season, which leads to an earlier phase shift in land-atmosphere carbon fluxes and an increase in their amplitude. Such changes are expected to continue in the future based on our analysis of earth system model projections. Our study provides a simplified, yet realistic framework based on first principles for the complex mechanisms by which various climatic factors constrain plant growth in northern ecosystems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon cycle; climate change; climate constraint; earth system model; eddy covariance; gross primary productivity; law of minimum; photosynthetic seasonality; remote sensing","carbon cycle; climate change; complexity; ecological modeling; ecosystem response; eddy covariance; growth response; photosynthesis; plant; primary production; remote sensing; seasonal variation; seasonality; carbon cycle; ecosystem; photosynthesis; plant; season; Carbon Cycle; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Plants; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065644023

The effect of pulse voltage on morphology of the Bi nanoflake and electrochemical property was investigated. The pulse voltage of 80 mVAg/AgCl with six pulse cycles successfully produces ultrathin Bi nanoflakes. The finite-element-based simulation shows that the two-dimensional geometry with large lateral dimensions and ultrathin thickness can localize a strong electric field at the corner site of the flakes, resulting in facilitating efficient reduction of CO2 to formate. As a result, formate Faradaic efficiency of the Bi nanoflakes showed over 90% at − 0.8 VRHE. Also, the formate production rate reached 69 µmol/cm2/h at − 0.8 VRHE.

Altered phenology can introduce organisms to novel abiotic conditions during growth and modify species interactions, both of which could drive changes in reproduction. We explored how climate change can alter plant reproduction using an experiment in which we manipulated the individual and combined effects of snowmelt timing and frost exposure, and measured subsequent effects on flowering phenology, peak flower density, frost damage, pollinator visitation and reproduction of four subalpine wildflowers. Additionally, we conducted a pollen-supplementation experiment to test whether the plants in our snowmelt and frost treatments were pollen limited for reproduction. The four plants included species flowering in early spring to mid-summer. The phenology of all four species was significantly advanced, and the bloom duration was longer in the plots from which we removed snow, but with species-specific responses to snow removal and frost exposure in terms of frost damage, flower production, pollinator visitation and reproduction. The two early blooming species showed significant signs of frost damage in both early snowmelt and frost treatments, which negatively impacted reproduction for one of the species. Further, we recorded fewer pollinators during flowering for the earliest-blooming species in the snow removal plots. We also found lower fruit and seed set for the early blooming species in the snow removal treatment, which could be attributed to the plants growing under unfavourable abiotic conditions. However, the later-blooming species escaped frost damage even in the plots where snow was removed, and experienced increased pollinator visitation and reproduction. Synthesis. This study provides insight into how plant communities could become altered due to changes in abiotic conditions, and some of the mechanisms involved. While early blooming species may be at a disadvantage under climate change, species that bloom later in the season may benefit from early snowmelt, suggesting that climate change has the potential to reshape flowering communities. © 2019 The Authors.

Mangrove ecosystems play an important role in regulating carbon cycling, thus having a significant impact on global environmental change. Extensive studies have been conducted for the estimation of mangrove species identification and biomass estimation. However, estimation at a regional level with species-wise biomass distribution has been insufficiently investigated in the past because either research focuses on the species distribution or biomass assessment. Study shows that good relationship has been achieved between stem volume (field measured data) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from satellite image and further these two indices are employed to estimate the biomass in the study site. Three models- linear, logarithmic and polynomial (second degree) are used to estimate biomass derived from EVI and NDVI. The hyperspectral data (spatial resolution ~ 30 m) is utilised to identify ten mangrove plant species. We have prepared the spatial distribution map of these species using spectral angle mapper. We have also generated mangrove species-wise biomass distribution map of the study site along with areal coverage of each species. The results indicate that the Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. and Cynometra iripa Kostel has the highest biomass among all ten identified species, 643.12 Mg ha−1 and 652.14 Mg ha−1. Our study provided a positive relationship between NDVI, EVI, and the estimated biomass of Bhitarkanika Forest Reserve Odisha India. The study finds a similar results for both NDVI and EVI derived biomass, while linear regression has more significant results than the polynomial (second degree) and logarithmic regression derived biomass. The polynomial is found slightly better than the logarithmic when using the EVI as compared to NDVI derived biomass. The spatial distribution of species-wise biomass map obtained in this study using both, EVI and NDVI could be used to provide useful information for biodiversity assessment along with the sustainable solutions to different problems associated with the mangrove forest biodiversity. Thus, biomass assessment of larger regions can be achieved by utilization of remote sensing based indices as concluded in the present study. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Biodiversity; Biomass; Field inventory; Hyperspectral; Mangrove; NDVI; Regression model; Species distribution","biodiversity; biomass; climate change; data set; ecological modeling; environmental change; field method; mangrove; NDVI; remote sensing; spatial distribution; Bhitarkanika; India; Odisha; Cynometra iripa; Sonneratia apetala",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060123937

However, to obtain more revenue, emission generating companies (GCs) may collude with third-party verifiers (3 PVs) and conceal real carbon emission data. Based on actual practice of Shenzhen's C&T system, a three-player game model has been devised in this paper to analyze the behaviors among GCs, 3 PVs and government. Given the government's current piecewise linear re-verification policy, the optimal reported carbon intensity for GCs has been provided. Our research reveals that if the actual carbon intensity is larger than historical carbon intensity GCs may report less carbon intensity and conceal actual carbon emission. To deal with this issue, a new exponential re-verification policy is proposed. Based on authentic data from Shenzhen's C&T system, the experimental results show that the government should devote more attention to GCs with a decreasing industrial product output value-added (IVA) than to those with high carbon emissions when selecting GCs for re-verification. Our experiments also illustrate that the new policy outperforms the current one on both total concealed amount of carbon emission and total re-verification cost if the initial re-verification probability is set within a specific range. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cap-and-trade; Carbon emission verification; Emission reduction policy; Game analysis","Commerce; Emission control; Game theory; Piecewise linear techniques; Public policy; Cap and trade; Carbon emissions; Emission reduction policies; Game analysis; Generating companies; Industrial product; Piecewise linear; Third party verifiers; Carbon; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; game theory; pollution policy; state role; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064942424

In order to achieve these policy objectives, in the last decades the number of biomass power plants has increased throughout the EU. This study analyzed the environmental impacts of the bioenergy systems at global and local level to support communication and information strategies to increase social acceptance and to reduce conflicts between stakeholders. The environmental impacts were estimated to a sample of biomass power plants in North Italy selected based on the size, feedstock and type (cogeneration or heating). The study aims to identify and evaluate the environmental impacts associated with the thermal energy production in biomass power plants using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. Materials and methods: For each biomass district plant an LCA analysis was performed to: compare the environmental impacts associated with the production of the same functional unit, quantifying and valuating the environmental performance deriving from the production process life cycle, and highlighting the production phases with greater impact. Results: The results show an average climate change impact by biomass energy plant of 45.84 gCO2eq MJ−1 and a range between 14.93 gCO2eq MJ−1 and 90.70 gCO2eq MJ−1. The results show that the size of the biomass energy plant (less than 1 MW or more than 1 MW) and the feedstock used (forest or sawmill woodchip) are two main variables that influence many categories of environmental impact. © 2019","Bioenergy; Conflicts; Energy engineering; Engineering; Environmental assessment; Environmental pollution; Environmental science; Heating district plants; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Local community; Renewable energy policy; Trentino-Alto Adige (Italy)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068865724

Estuaries are known sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4); however, less is known about GHG dynamics in subterranean estuaries (STEs). We evaluate CO2 and CH4 dynamics in three proximal STEs bordering Indian River Lagoon, Florida, where groundwater flows through siliciclastic sediments with minor carbonate mineral contents. Although the three STEs have similar mineralogical and flow characteristics, CO2 and CH4 concentrations vary by orders of magnitude. Nonconservative mixing of both gases is observed, and CH4 is generally produced while CO2 is sequestered. The extent of methanogenesis is linked to the redox potential of inflowing groundwaters, as well as degree of CH4 oxidation, which results mostly from anaerobic oxidation of methane. Methane concentrations vary by orders of magnitude, and stable isotopic signatures suggest differences in the microbial production pathway between sites. CO2 is sequestered due to the production of alkalinity relative to dissolved inorganic carbon, which occurs both through rapid CaCO3 dissolution at the shoreline as low-pH groundwater from the siliciclastic aquifer interacts with carbonate minerals in lagoon sediments, as well as redox reactions, particularly sulfate reduction and denitrification. These results demonstrate a high variability in CO2 and CH4 concentrations, and thus fluxes, even among geographically constrained and hydrogeologically similar STEs. Although STEs are sources of both CO2 and CH4 to surface waters, the variability of production and consumption complicates global estimates of GHG fluxes from STEs. © 2019 The Authors.

This compelling new science mission will attempt to answer the question ""Why is the Arctic warming faster than the rest of the planet?"" by filling an important gap in our knowledge of energy flows in Polar Regions. PREFIRE will fly a pair of small CubeSat satellites to probe a little-studied portion of the radiant energy emitted by Earth for clues about Arctic warming, sea ice loss and ice-sheet melting. Two miniaturized Thermal Infrared Spectrometers (TIRS) on two CubeSat satellites, are based on technology previously flown on the Mars Climate Sounder, an instrument on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The CubeSats will orbit Earth's poles to measure far-infrared emissions and how they change throughout the day and over seasons. By building, characterizing, and operating, TIRS payloads in two different polar orbits, the PREFIRE mission has potential impact on NASA in these focus areas through (1) Quantification of the influence of variable surface conditions on Arctic and Antarctic thermal emission, (2) Estimation of the impact of atmospheric constituents on the polar greenhouse effect, and, (3) Determination of the impacts of variations in far-infrared emissivity and greenhouse effect on ice sheet melt and sea level rise. The observations will allow scientists to assess how changes in thermal infrared emissions at the top of Earth's atmosphere are related to changes in cloud cover and surface conditions below.

The Himalaya, a global biodiversity hotspot, lacks spatially explicit representation of plant richness patterns and predictor environmental covariates. The rugged Himalayan terrain limits large-scale field surveys, we, therefore, disentangle the role of remotely sensed environmental proxies for characterization of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) and prediction of plant richness in an alpine area in Western Himalaya. Alpine plant richness was recorded in cluster plots (10 random quadrants of 1 m2 in approximately 1-ha area) across 97 sites in Pithoragarh district in part of the Western Himalaya (India). The dominant PFTs were mapped based on support vector machine classification of Landsat 8 image. The satellite-derived climate, landscape, and topographic variables were correlated to plant richness using generalized linear model (GLM) with poisson distribution to unravel species richness-environment linkages in the study area. The dominant PFTs mapped were herbaceous meadow, Danthonia grassland, Kobresia sedge meadow, moist scrub, and dry scrub. The GLM based plant richness model explained 70% variation in alpine plant richness.

However, whether and how different features of urban forms (such as compactness) affecting the levels of CO2 emissions is still debatable, specifically considering the different development levels of the cities. Therefore, this study is to synthetically explore how socioeconomic factors and urban forms work together to affect CO2 emissions with the consideration of differences in development levels of five city tiers in China. First, CO2 emissions in each city were derived from provincial energy statistics, radiance-calibrated nighttime light imageries, and population distribution data based on a disaggregating model. Then, a set of variables representing socioeconomic factors and urban forms were acquired from the city statistics and land use data, respectively. After obtaining the balanced dataset of these five city tiers from 1995 to 2015, the panel data analysis was finally applied to evaluate the consequences of socioeconomic factors and urban forms on CO2 emissions under different development stages. The estimation results show that the economic development, population growth, and urban land expansion are important factors that accelerating CO2 emissions in all the city tiers. Besides, irregular or fragmented structures of urban land use could result in more CO2 emissions due to the increase in potential transportation requirements in all the city tiers. Notably, an increasing concentrated pattern in the urban core is found to increase CO2 emissions in the tier-one cities, but to promote the reduction of CO2 emissions in other four city tiers. The urban spatial development with a compact and multiple-nuclei pattern is suggested to be closely linked with a lower level of CO2 emissions. Such results highlight the importance of a city's development level for decision-making involving the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and provide scientific support for building a low-carbon city from the perspective of both socioeconomic development and urban spatial planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese cities; CO2 emissions; Development levels; Panel data analysis; Socioeconomic development; Urban forms","Carbon dioxide; Data handling; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Information analysis; Land use; Population statistics; Structure (composition); Urban growth; Chinese cities; CO2 emissions; Development levels; Panel data analysis; Socio-economic development; Urban form; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064501550

Besides microbial denitrification, abiotic nitrite reduction by Fe(II) (chemodenitrification) has the potential to be an important source of N2O. Here, using microcosms, we quantified N2O formation in coastal marine sediments under typical summer temperatures. Comparison between gamma-radiated and microbially-active microcosm experiments revealed that at least 15-25% of total N2O formation was caused by chemodenitrification, whereas 75-85% of total N2O was potentially produced by microbial N-transformation processes. An increase in (chemo)denitrification-based N2O formation and associated Fe(II) oxidation caused an upregulation of N2O reductase (typical nosZ) genes and a distinct community shift to potential Fe(III)-reducers (Arcobacter), Fe(II)-oxidizers (Sulfurimonas), and nitrate/nitrite-reducing microorganisms (Marinobacter).

However, only a few studies have shown suitable strategies for reducing these adverse effects. In this study, climate conditions were predicted for the future period of 2020–2044, under the emission scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, for Isfahan–Borkhar aquifer, Isfahan, Iran, using MODFLOW-2000 (MODFLOW is United States Geological Survey product). Results showed that the average groundwater level of the aquifer would decrease to 13, 15, and 16 m in 2012 to 2044 approximately under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Then, three groundwater sustainability management scenarios were defined that included 10%, 30%, and 50% reduction in groundwater extraction. These strategies simulated the reduced negative effects of climate change on the aquifer. The results showed that decreases in water withdrawal rates of 10%, 30%, and 50% under RCP8.5 scenario (critical scenario) could decrease the mean groundwater level by 14, 11, and 7 m, respectively. The main result of the study showed that 50% reduction in groundwater withdrawal may increase the groundwater levels significantly in order to restore the aquifer sustainability in the study area. In this study, with assuming that the current harvest of wells in the future period is constant, so the results of studies showed that for the aquifer's sustainability management, the water abstraction from the aquifer should reduce up to 50% of the existing wells. Changing the irrigation method from surface to subdroplet irrigation plays an important role in reducing the withdrawal from the aquifer. The results of a study in Iran have shown that the change in the irrigation method from surface to subdroplet irrigation causes a 40% reduction in water use for agriculture. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","climate change; groundwater management; groundwater modelling system; Iran; MODFLOW","aquifer; climate change; flow modeling; irrigation; sustainability; water level; water management; well water; Borkhar; Esfahan [Esfahan (PRV)]; Esfahan [Iran]; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069469244

The recognized compositional and structural features of this horizon suggest that the anorthosites formed as a result of not only magmatic processes proper, but also late magmatic and postmagmatic processes with extremely high volatile-component activity. The origin of this horizon can be explained by the “compaction” hypothesis and thermal shrinking phenomenon. Zones of weakness up to fractures and cavities formed at the interface of rocks with contrasting compositions and properties while they cooled. Due to the decompression effect, these zones “sucked in” the interstitial leucocratic melt and the volatiles squeezed out of the massif’s deeper horizons. The established trends of variation in mineral composition—Pl (82–88% An); Ol (78–81% Fo); Cpx (40–44% En, 9–18% Fs, and 41–47% Wo); and Opx (74–78% En, 16–24% Fs, and 2–5% Wo)—suggest fractional crystallization of the residual liquor. Fluid–magma interaction processes led to the significant heterogeneity of anorthosites and other rocks, the formation of nonequilibrium mineral assemblages, and the concentration of ore-bearing components. The sulfide assemblages were viewed as products of the subsolidus transformation of solid solutions (mss and iss + poss) that formed during the crystallization of a Cu-rich immiscible sulfide fluid. It was demonstrated that noble metals were associated not only with the limited volume of the sulfide fluid. The bulk of the noble metals with “crustal” components (Sn, Pb, Hg, Bi, As, Sb, Te, S, etc.) were supplied to anorthosite cavities together with volatile components and chlorine, and this accounts for the abundance of platinoid minerals among the other forms of platinoid occurrence. The leading role of reduced gases (H2, CH4, and CO), H2O, and Cl has been established in the genesis of noble metal minerals. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","anorthosites; critical zone; fluid regime; low-sulfide platinum group metal mineralization; PGE minerals; sulfides; Yoko–Dovyren intrusion","Gold compounds; Mineralogy; Ores; Precious metals; Reefs; Sulfur compounds; anorthosites; Critical zones; Fluid regime; Platinum group metals; sulfides; Copper compounds; anorthosite; crystallization; igneous intrusion; mineralization; ore deposit; ore mineral; platinum group element; Riphean; Cisbaikalia; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071983414

However, the moving blades of tidal turbines pose potential collision risks for marine animals. Accurate assessment of mortality risk as a result of collisions is essential for risk management during planning and consenting processes for marine energy developments. In the absence of information on the physical consequences of such collisions, predicting likely risks relies on theoretical collision risk models. The application of these at a population level usually assumes that all collisions result in mortality. This is unlikely and the approach therefore produces upwardly biased estimates of population consequences. In this study, we estimate the pathological consequences of direct collisions with tidal turbines using seal carcasses and physical models of tidal turbine blades. We quantify severe trauma at a range of impact speeds and to different areas of seal carcasses. A dose–response model was developed with associated uncertainty to determine an impact speed threshold of severe trauma to use in future collision risk models. Results showed that severe trauma was restricted to the thoracic region, with no evidence of injury to the lumbar or cervical spine. Pathological indicators of mortality were only predicted to occur in collision speeds in excess of 5.1 m/s (95% C.I. 3.2–6.6) and was affected by body condition; increasing blubber depth reduced the likelihood of severe trauma. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important information for policy makers and regulators looking to predict the potential impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals. We demonstrate that the probability of severe trauma in seals due to collisions with turbine blades is highly dependent upon collision speed, and that the majority of predicted collisions are unlikely to cause fatal skeletal trauma. We recommend that collision risk models incorporate appropriate mortality assumptions to ensure accurate estimates of the population consequences are produced in risk assessments for tidal turbine deployments. © 2019 The Authors.

A few recent studies have indicated the potential to reduce N 2 O emission rates in agricultural systems through management of soil microbiota, such as mycorrhizal fungi. Our limited understanding of how mycorrhiza influences N 2 O emission rates, however, forestalls such management practices. To address the knowledge gap regarding the mechanism of mycorrhizal modification of N 2 O formation and denitrification, we disentangle the direct effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) via hyphal growth on potential denitrification activity from those resulting from indirect AMF-induced changes in soil aggregation. We manipulated AMF status in a factorial experiment through adding or not AMF inoculum in the form of Rhizophagus irregularis and soil aggregation state through either crushing soil aggregates or using agricultural soil with intact soil aggregates. We then grew Zea mays (maize) in compartmentalized mesocosms for 4 months. At harvest, we observed approximately three-fold higher AMF root colonization and hyphal densities in the treatments where we had added Rhizophagus irregularis. Potential N 2 O activity rates and the denitrification ratio were higher in the undisturbed soil and in the mesocosms with a dense AMF hyphal network (direct effect of mycorrhiza). Further, AM-hyphae promoted soil aggregation while also altering potential denitrification activity (indirect effect of mycorrhiza).

Alterations to feedbacks between important eco-physical structuring processes driven by climate change may modulate river morphology, floodplain characteristics, and their biological communities. Current understanding is reviewed and synthesised to explore the potential responses, mechanisms, and ramifications of climatic shifts for the European riverscape. Fundamental drivers of change are expected to be (a) disturbance deviation beyond the historical norm and (b) vegetation morphodynamics, a key river process where ecological and fluvial-geomorphological attributes interact to shape the physical environment. Increased seasonal temperature, summer drought, and winter flooding may affect the colonisation, growth, and mortality of plant species with consequences for riverscape structure and function as succession patterns adjust with repercussions for hydraulics and sediment dynamics. Such opposing winter and summer climate regimes are likely to impact vegetation patch dynamics, reflected in an increasingly variable patch mosaic as disturbance intensity deviates further from historical background conditions. How changes to climate drivers manifest themselves in individual river systems will also be affected by attributes such as catchment topography, geology, vegetation type, and previous human alterations. Where large scale change occurs, it will have consequences for the type and function of biological communities inhabiting the riverscape. Conventional engineering responses to meteorological disturbance will amplify the effect on river biota by reducing their ecological resilience, highlighting the need for a management response that integrates ecological and societal benefits simultaneously. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","bio-geomorphology; climate change adaptation and mitigation; disturbance regime; ecosystem change; invasive species; plant succession","Catchments; Ecology; Floods; Rivers; Topography; Vegetation; Climate change adaptation; Disturbance regime; Ecosystem changes; Invasive species; Plant successions; Climate change; adaptive management; catchment; climate change; climate effect; ecohydrology; ecosystem dynamics; environmental disturbance; geomorphology; invasive species; morphodynamics; plant; river system; succession; topography; Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068788053

Observations show a reduction of atmospheric concentrations of NOx and SOx species and their wet and dry deposition since monitoring began in 1978 and 1987, respectively, although deposition observations are sparse. This study used a regional model (CAMx) nested within a global model (GEOS-Chem) to characterize regional changes in sulfur and nitrogen deposition due to intercontinental transport and local/regional anthropogenic emissions representing six modeling years spanning five decades (1970–2020). The meteorological year and the natural emissions were fixed at 2005 to isolate the effects of changing anthropogenic emissions. The downward trend from 1970 to 2020 of mean atmospheric SO2 concentration is 1.5–1.8%; of total S deposition is 1.0–1.7%; and of SO2 emissions is 1.4–1.8% per year. The rate of decline in NOy deposition of 0.6–1.4% per year is similar to the 0.5–1.6% per year reduction in NOx emissions, thus showing that the changes in deposition have tracked changes in emissions of SO2 and NOx emissions quite well. Further reducing N deposition could face some challenges due to increasing NHx contribution from NH3 emissions and the expectation of these to increase globally. Our study also examined the transference ratios of NOy and SOx in the context of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx and found them to be sensitive to emission reductions over the study period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality trends; CAMx; Deposition trends; Nitrogen; Photochemical modeling; Sulfur","Air quality; Ammonia; Emission control; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Quality management; Sulfur; Air quality trends; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric concentration; CAMx; Control strategies; Intercontinental transport; Nitrogen deposition; Photochemical modeling; Sulfur compounds; ammonia; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; sulfur derivative; sulfur dioxide; sulfur oxide; air quality; atmospheric deposition; decadal variation; emission; modeling; nitrogen compound; photochemistry; regional pattern; sulfur compound; trend analysis; aerosol; air monitoring; air quality; Article; atmospheric deposition; carbon footprint; climate change; dry deposition; greenhouse gas; measurement; meteorological phenomena; nitrogen deposition; priority journal; transference; United States; wet deposition; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064573277

In order to study carbon released by soil respiration (SR) after rainfall pulses in natural grassland on the Loess Plateau, a rainfall simulation experiment was conducted in a grassland community co-dominated by a C 4 herbaceous grass [Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng] and a C 3 leguminous subshrub [Lespedeza davurica (Laxm.) Schindl] in the loess hilly-gully region. Soil respiration rate (R s ), soil temperature (T s ), and soil volumetric water content (S v ) were measured 1 day before and 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after four rainfall treatments (ambient rainfall plus a 5 mm, 10 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm rainfall pulse) and one control treatment (only ambient rainfall) in June and August 2013. Results showed that R s and S v largely increased one day after simulated rainfall &gt; 5 mm. In June, the peak R s under 10, 20, and 30 mm rainfall was 0.80–1.03 μmol C m −2 s −1 in B. ischaemum, with a 25–62% increase compared with the control treatment, and 0.74–1.0 μmol C m −2 s −1 (+51–104%) in L. davurica. In August, the peak R s was 1.23–1.73 μmol C m −2 s −1 (+23–73%) and 1.52–1.70 μmol C m −2 s −1 (+81–102%) in B. ischaemum and L. davurica, respectively. The magnitude and duration of the increase in SR were positively related to the rainfall size, and a more considerable increase was observed in August. There was a threshold rainfall (i.e., 5–10 mm) for triggering SR increases in both months. And different responses were found between the two species, there was more substantial SR increases in L. davurica in comparison to B. ischaemum. After rainfall pulses, soil moisture and soil temperature co-regulated SR. During the relatively dry season (i.e., June), SR was negatively correlated with soil temperature and the temperature sensitivity Q 10 value of SR was small (0.5–0.6), while it changed to positively in August and the Q 10 was largely increased (3.2–4.3). Conversely, soil moisture was positively related to SR in both months and explained a large portion of the variation in SR (32–43% and 42–52% in B. ischaemum and L. davurica, respectively). These findings indicated that soil moisture was the major environmental factor in controlling SR in this grassland. Overall, our study suggests that SR response following rainfall pulses is species-specific within the grassland community and tends to be controlled by soil moisture, and these should be considered in the regional carbon budget assessment in the background of vegetation rehabilitation and rainfall pattern changes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Q 10 value; Semi-arid grassland; Simulated rainfall; Soil CO 2 efflux","carbon budget; carbon flux; climate change; dry season; environmental factor; experimental study; grass; grassland; herb; legume; plant community; rainfall; semiarid region; soil respiration; threshold; vegetation dynamics; water content; China; Loess Plateau; Bothriochloa ischaemum; Lespedeza daurica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062902257

This renewable energy option makes use of the kinetic energy from flowing water, rather than potential energy, which is more often used in conventional hydropower. Updated refined versions of this technology are now being investigated and manufactured due to the global drive towards reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy efficiency. These modular units allow for installation of HK turbines into existing water infrastructure with very little civil works. The study’s objective was to develop a simplified design and implementation process for HK devices within the South African legislative and regulatory environment. Approximately 66% of South Africa’s water supply is used by the agricultural sector with more than 6 500 km of canal systems running through many areas which could benefit from alternative energy sources. The recent electricity crisis in the country allowed for problem resolution through funding opportunities and thereby an introduction of an innovative and sustainable technology to provide renewable electricity where otherwise not feasible. A pilot HK project was implemented in an applicable section on the Boegoeberg irrigation canal in the Northern Cape Province and tested for optimum functionality and correct application. This process allowed evolution of a development process for the implementation of HK devices in existing water infrastructure. © 2019, South African Water Research Commission.

Hence, the main research question is “how are learning processes within a company—organizational learning—and social interaction in a Community of Practice—social learning—related and how do they contribute to leveraging changes in management practices in a company's adaptation to climate change?” The case study presents how the company's representatives' participation in a social learning process within a CoP supported not only the development of a comprehensive adaptation strategy but also the mainstreaming of climate concepts, impacts and adaptation actions. Therefore, it demonstrated that combining social learning and organization learning processes is useful to consistently build resilience, given that they are mutually supportive in the recognition of the relevance of adaptation, the dissemination of risk perception throughout the organization and the development of an internal capacity to continuously plan and act. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business risk management; Climate change adaptation; Community of practice; Organizational learning; Social learning","Knowledge management; Learning systems; Petrochemicals; Planning; Reinforced plastics; Research and development management; Resins; Risk management; Risk perception; Business risks; Climate change adaptation; Community of practice; Organizational learning; Social learning; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064262765

The solution also improves trust and transparency for all stakeholders as well as eliminates the need to make commercial agreements with separate MaaS agents.

The paper employed numerous planning data of Phu Quoc for the period of 2020-2030 related to the population increase, forecasted income per capita, computed growth of vehicles by fossil fuels. Also, the paper has launched a technology diffusion model and different approaches on electric vehicle market, refer to policy frameworks of many countries around the world to promote electric vehicles development. On that basis, the author proposes numerous electric vehicle scenarios to penetrate the market and determine the potential of CO2 emission reduction by 2030. At the same time, the author releases suggestions on policy frameworks and recommendations so that the research results could be soon implemented in practice. With the forecast until 2030, the emission resulted by fossil fuel vehicles is about 79,901 tons. Through the policy framework proposals for the government in the development of electric vehicles, it is forecasted that CO2 emission reductions will be from 13,859 to 16,489 tons of C02/year, corresponding to a reduction of 17-20% for scenarios. Research results show that if the proposed policy frameworks are implemented soon and the introduction of electric vehicles to replace traditional fuel vehicles in Phu Quoc is necessary and feasible not only in terms of ability reduce CO2 emissions, but also contribute to local development to become a regional and international green tourism destination. © 2019 IEEE.","electric vehicle; emissions; intrusion; Phu Quoc; policy; script","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Particulate emissions; Population statistics; Public policy; CO2 emission reduction; intrusion; Local development; Phu Quoc; Research results; script; Technology diffusion models; Traditional fuels; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072910095

Recognition as one of the Global biodiversity hotspot implies its global significance. The forest ecosystems and plant biodiversity in the region is predicted to respond to the rapid warming and the human induced perturbations. However, documentation of these responses and likely consequences is meagre so as to provide a basis for future comparison. Realizing the importance of understanding relationships of climate change (CC) and forest biodiversity, systematic collection of data sets, covering various aspects of environment was attempted through establishing Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) and monitoring. The LTERs in general, have emerged to be important to improve our understanding on spatio-temporal variations happening in a particular ecosystem. Indian National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) sets out National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE) to conserve Himalayan ecosystem from the brunt of climate vulnerabilities. Considering importance of Himalaya forests and their sensitivity to CC impacts, NMSHE has stressed on undertaking Long-Term Ecological Monitoring (LTEM) and development of monitoring protocol with forest biodiversity specific parameters and indicators. In this context first of its kind attempt have been made to develop long-term ecological monitoring protocol along with suitable criteria and indicators for the Indian Himalaya, and demonstrate it through documenting base line data of established LTEM plots in diverse forest types in the Indian western Himalaya. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Climate change; Criteria & indicator; Ecosystem; Forest; Indian Himalayan Region; Long-term ecological monitoring; Long-term ecological research; Western Himalaya","Biodiversity; Climate change; Forestry; Monitoring; Ecological monitoring; Forest; Himalayas; Indian Himalayan Region; Long-term ecological research; Ecosystems; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem approach; environmental monitoring; environmental research; forest ecosystem; long-term change; vulnerability; Himalayas; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062302523

AIM-North would consist of two satellites in a highly elliptical orbit formation, observing over land from ∼40°N to 80°N multiple times per day. Each satellite would carry a near-infrared to shortwave infrared imaging spectrometer for CO2, CH4, and CO, and an ultraviolet-visible imaging spectrometer for air quality. Both instruments would measure solar-induced fluorescence from vegetation. A cloud imager would make near-real-time observations, which could inform the pointing of the other instruments to focus only on the clearest regions. Multiple geostationary (GEO) AQ and GHG satellites are planned for the 2020s, but they will lack coverage of northern regions like the Arctic. AIM-North would address this gap with quasi-geostationary observations of the North and overlap with GEO coverage to facilitate intercomparison and fusion of these datasets. The resulting data would improve our ability to forecast northern air quality and quantify fluxes of GHG and AQ species from forests, permafrost, biomass burning and anthropogenic activity, furthering our scientific understanding of these processes and supporting environmental policy. © 2019, © 2019 Copyright of the Crown in Canada.

This is because H2O high-pressure (HP) ice on the seafloor prevents chemical weathering and, thus, removal of atmospheric CO2. Previous studies, however, ignored melting of the HP ice and horizontal variation in heat flux from oceanic crusts. Here, we examine whether high heat fluxes near the mid-ocean ridge melt the HP ice and thereby remove atmospheric CO2. We develop integrated climate models of an Earth-size ocean planet with plate tectonics for different ocean masses, which include the effects of HP ice melting, seafloor weathering, and the carbonate-silicate geochemical carbon cycle. We find that the heat flux near the mid-ocean ridge is high enough to melt the ice, enabling seafloor weathering. In contrast to the previous theoretical prediction, we show that climates of terrestrial planets with massive oceans lapse into extremely cold ones (or snowball states) with CO2-poor atmospheres. Such extremely cold climates are achieved mainly because the HP ice melting fixes seafloor temperature at the melting temperature, thereby keeping a high weathering flux regardless of surface temperature. We estimate that ocean planets with oceans several tens of the Earth's ocean mass no longer maintain temperate climates. These results suggest that terrestrial planets with extremely cold climates exist even in the habitable zone beyond the Solar system, given the frequency of water-rich planets predicted by planet formation theories. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: oceans; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072292893

The influence of CO on carbon concentration during the heating stage in a laboratory-scale Czochralski furnace was investigated using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. A strong peak of CO and H2O partial pressure was observed before the silicon feedstock began to melt. We believe that the purge tube is a major source of CO during the heating stage because carbon contamination of the order of 1016 occurred in the silicon melt by CO generated from the purge tube.

CsrA binds to single-stranded GGA motifs around the SD sequence of target mRNAs where it inhibits or activates translation or influences RNA processing. Small RNAs like CsrB or CsrC containing 13–22 GGA motifs can sequester CsrA, thereby abrogating the effect of CsrA on its target mRNAs. In B. subtilis, CsrA has so far only been found to regulate one target, hag mRNA and to be sequestered by a protein (FliW) and not by an sRNA. Here, we employ a combination of in vitro and in vivo methods to investigate the effect of CsrA on the small regulatory RNA SR1 from B. subtilis, its primary target ahrC mRNA and its downstream targets, the rocABC and rocDEF operons. We demonstrate that CsrA can promote the base-pairing interactions between SR1 and ahrC mRNA, a function that has so far only been found for Hfq or ProQ.

However, as previous studies and day-to-day interactions with local leaders make clear, identifying ways to resource adaptation is one of the most significant barriers to progress. This paper draws on selected findings from a study that aimed to better describe the nature of the adaptation finance challenges local governments face so as to find ways to overcome them. Building on initial findings from an online survey and nine stakeholder workshops to deepen the understanding of the nature of funding and financing challenges for local governments, we use a methodological innovation in archetype analysis, grounded theory, to develop a suite of 15 archetypal adaptation finance challenges, i.e., repeatedly found patterns of interrelated causal factors, traits, and outcomes ranging from establishing a matter of concern worthy of attention (and funding) to acquiring, using, and managing adaptation finance. These archetypes are found across different types and sizes of local governments facing different climate change threats.

A particularly important functional trait in this context is reproductive potential. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is invasive world-wide and threatens the native brown mussel Perna perna on South African rocky shores. Where they co-exist, Mytilus dominates the high and Perna the low mussel zone, overlapping in the middle. Mytilus generally exhibits high individual reproductive output, but feeding time is reduced, physical conditions are stressful and adult densities are lower on the higher shore. We compared overall reproductive potential of populations of the two species using a 1-year data set for three sites, accounting for within-shore distribution and abundances. Despite the restriction of Mytilus to the more stressful upper-shore, its aggregate reproductive potential was comparable to that of Perna. We then used Dynamic Energy Budget modelling to test the effects of changing conditions by calculating aggregate reproductive potential under temperature conditions predicted for the end of the century by the International Panel on Climate Change. The results suggest increased aggregate reproductive potential for both species, but the effect was stronger for the native species at two of three sites, implying increased biotic resistance by Perna to the further spread of Mytilus. Combining ecological context and physiological performance elucidates how interactions between native and invasive species may alter. Such nuances are fundamental to anticipating winners or losers in a world where distribution shifts are increasingly common. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Dynamic Energy Budget model; Invasive species; Physiological performance; Reproductive output; Rocky shore; Species distribution","bioenergetics; climate change; feeding behavior; intertidal environment; invasive species; mollusc; native species; physiological response; population distribution; reproductive behavior; reproductive potential; rocky shore; species diversity; Mytilus; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Perna; Perna perna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064623543

At present, many of these glaciers show high thinning rates despite thick debris cover. Due to the lack of observations, most existing studies have neglected the dynamic interactions between debris cover and glacier evolution over longer time periods. The main aim of this study is to reveal such interactions by reconstructing changes of debris cover, glacier geometry, flow velocities, and surface features of Zmuttgletscher (Switzerland), based on historic maps, satellite images, aerial photographs, and field observations. We show that debris cover extent has increased from ∼ 13% to ∼ 32% of the total glacier surface since 1859 and that in 2017 the debris is sufficiently thick to reduce ablation compared to bare ice over much of the ablation area. Despite the debris cover, the glacier-wide mass balance of Zmuttgletscher is comparable to that of debris-free glaciers located in similar settings, whereas changes in length and area have been small and delayed by comparison. Increased ice mass input in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in a temporary velocity increase, which led to a local decrease in debris cover extent, a lowering of the upper boundary of the ice-cliff zone, and a strong reduction in ice-cliff area, indicating a dynamic link between flow velocities, debris cover, and surface morphology. Since 2005, the lowermost 1.5 km of the glacier has been quasi-stagnant, despite a slight increase in the surface slope of the glacier tongue. We conclude that the long-term glacier-wide mass balance is mainly governed by climate. The debris cover governs the spatial pattern of elevation change without changing its glacier-wide magnitude, which we explain by the extended ablation area and the enhanced thinning in regions with thin debris further up-glacier and in areas with abundant meltwater channels and ice cliffs. At the same time rising temperatures lead to increasing debris cover and decreasing ice flux, thereby attenuating length and area losses. © Author(s) 2019.",,"ablation; aerial photograph; cliff; flow velocity; glacier; glacier mass balance; Little Ice Age; meltwater; satellite imagery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068857098

The 2017 August 17th detection of the GW170817 gravitational-wave (GW) signal by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo in coincidence with the electromagnetic observation of the SGRB GRB 170817A confirmed this scenario and provided new physical information on the nature of these astronomical events. We use SGRB observations by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Burst Alert Telescope and GW170817/GRB 170817A observational data to estimate the detection rate of coincident GW and electromagnetic observations by a GW detector network and constrain the physical parameters of the SGRB jet structure. We estimate the rate of GW detections coincident with SGRB electromagnetic detections by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor to be between ∼0.1 and ∼0.6 yr-1 in the third LIGO-Virgo observing run and between ∼0.3 and ∼1.8 yr-1 for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network at design sensitivity.

We aimed to quantify the future health gain, health-sector cost-savings, and change in greenhouse gas emissions that could be achieved by switching short vehicle trips to walking and cycling in New Zealand. Methods We used unit-level survey data to estimate changes in physical activity, distance travelled by mode, and air pollution for: (a) switching car trips under 1km to walking and (b) switching car trips under 5km to a mix of walking and cycling. We modelled uptake levels of 25%, 50%, and 100%, and assumed changes in transport behaviour were permanent. We then used multi-state life table modelling to quantify health impacts as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and changes in health system costs over the rest of the life course of the NZ population alive in 2011 (n = 4.4 million), with 3% discounting. Findings The modelled scenarios resulted in health gains between 1.61 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 1.35 to 1.89) and 25.43 (UI 20.20 to 30.58) QALYs/1000 people, with total QALYs up to 112,020 (UI 88,969 to 134,725) over the remaining lifespan. Healthcare cost savings ranged between NZ$127million (UI $101m to 157m) and NZ$2.1billion (UI $1.6b to 2.6b). Greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by up to 194kgCO2e/year, though changes in emissions were not significant under the walking scenario. Conclusions Substantial health gains and healthcare cost savings could be achieved by switching short car trips to walking and cycling. Implementing infrastructural improvements and interventions to encourage walking and cycling is likely to be a cost-effective way to improve population health, and may also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Mizdrak et al.

Studies done to analyze pollution suggests that vehicle exhaust emissions are major contributor to the urban air quality along with many other comparable sources. Hence to check instantaneous pollution increment, government aims to reduce vehicle emission. Traditional policies are working at times for holding sudden increase but long-term effects are not seen which need meso-spatial and small temporal policy. For optimizing meso-spatial policies implementation, many intricacies related to moving and stationary sources in near real-time have to be monitored including vehicular emission, itself. Analyzing these moving source emissions on the meso-spatial level is challenging. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to first understand the need of meso-spatial and near real-time checking policy and then leveraging the usage of previous region specific pollutant survey reports to map real-time pollution monitoring parameters. For that, a real-time vehicle monitoring strategy is proposed to map city-wide traffic congestion and emission using crowd-source data of Google Maps. For comparative study of different meso-spatial regions real-time moving source pollutant parameter ‘μ’ is calculated using a factor ‘F’. Also, the different effects of congestion on vehicular emission in two different meso-spatial areas of Delhi is presented using comparative case study. Analysis of case study revealed that Anand Vihar area is more prone to vehicle emission variability in case of congestion fluctuation. Further the discussion of short temporal and spatial emission calculation, for weekly pollution evaluation is presented in the paper.

However, lignocellulosic biomass should be properly treated for its effective utilization during biotransformation. The current work aimed to demonstrate biobased production of butyrate and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) in engineered Escherichia coli using pretreated and detoxified aspen tree (Populus tremuloides) wood chips as the feedstock. Various bioprocessing and genetic/metabolic factors limiting the production of cellulosic butyrate and 3-HB were identified. With these developed bioprocessing strategies and strain engineering approaches, major carbons in the hydrolysate, including glucose, xylose, and even acetate, could be completely dissimilated during shake-flask cultivation with up to 1.68 g L−1 butyrate, 8.95 g L−1 3-HB, and minimal side metabolites (i.e., acetate and ethanol) being obtained.

However, experimental investigations of the interior transport have been limited by the extremely low yields of fabricated nanochannels and their characterization. Here, this challenge is addressed by assembling nanotube membranes on glass capillaries and employing a voltage-ramping protocol. Centimeter-long carbon nanotubes embedded in an epoxy matrix are sliced to hundreds of 10 µm-thick membranes containing essentially identical nanotubes. The membrane is attached to glass capillaries and dipped into analyte solution. Repeated ramping of the transmembrane voltage gradually increases ion conductance and activates the nanotube ion channels in 90% of the membranes; 33% of the activated membranes exhibit stochastic pore-blocking events caused by cation translocation through the interiors of the nanotubes. Since the membrane-capillary assembly can be handled independently of the analyte solution, fluidic exchange can be carried out simply by dipping the capillary into a solution of another analyte. This capability is demonstrated by sequentially measuring the threshold transmembrane voltages and ion mobilities for K+, Na+, and Li+. This approach, validated with carbon nanotubes, will save significant time and effort when preparing and testing a broad range of solid-state nanopores. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To better understand the climatic conditioning on the tourism in this region, we have selected five representative balneary-climatic resorts, located in three different bioclimatic zones: tonic-stimulant (Vatra Dornei), sedative-indifferent (Slănic Moldova, Târgu Ocna, and Bălţăteşti), and turn-applicant (Nicolina). The location under different bioclimatic conditions allowed us a good comparative analysis of the differences and similarities between the resorts. For this, we used an hourly database for the period January 1, 1961 to December 31, 2015, from which we built the daily database for all the elements and parameters required to calculate the physiologically equivalent temperature index, based on the RayMan model, its representations, and the climate-tourism schemes. The physiologically equivalent temperature and the climate-tourism schemes allowed us to identify the best periods of the year for conducting balneary and climate-therapeutic activities—both adjacent and standalone, or a variety of relaxing or recreational leisure activities conducted in the open. Finally, the trends of the annual series of PET data for the interval 1961–2015 and the subintervals 1961–1980 and 1981–2015 were identified and analyzed. We were consequently able to draw a set of conclusions outlining a series of changes that are likely to intervene in the relationship between climate and tourism in this region in the immediate future. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"bioclimatology; climate modeling; regional climate; temperature profile; tourism market; trend analysis; Romania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053515176

Material and energy efficiency are the focus of industrial and policy decision-makers but are often pursued as separate strategies. In addition, the solutions investigated are often localised without exploring the dynamics and efficiency relationships between different areas of a chemical site. Past studies have applied network analysis to study large complex systems such as national economies. The applicability to complex systems at the scale of a chemical site are clear but unexplored so far. This paper uses an integrated energy and materials metric to study an ammonia site and a steam methane reforming (SMR) plant in detail. Exergy flow maps are constructed using Sankey diagrams to illustrate the resource (material and energy) flows around the site and the principal sources of exergy loss and destruction. Exergy efficiencies and exergy destruction values are calculated for every plant, equipment within the SMR plant and mechanism of exergy destruction. This information can guide improvement interventions. The site is then modelled using a network analysis approach to improve the understanding of the energy and material interactions within it. The SMR plant is the main source of exergy destruction with an exergy efficiency of 68% and exergy destruction of 600 GJ/h, followed by the ammonia synthesis and water gas shift (WGS) plants with 99 and 59 GJ/h respectively. Within the SMR plant, the two main burners contributed the most destruction with a total of 190 GJ/h. Combustion and heat exchange are the main exergy destruction mechanisms with 206 and 141 GJ/h respectively, a result that could guide higher-level improvement efforts. More realistic transit and fuel-product exergy efficiencies definitions are found to be consistently lower than conventional efficiency definitions, an effect most pronounced in heat exchangers. The network analysis detected communities of tightly connected plants in the ammonia site and can indicate groups where cascading effects of resource efficiency improvements could materialise. The different network metrics quantifying the importance of individual plants ranked some plants, such as the steam and ammonia synthesis plant, consistently highly. Other plants, like the tail gas stripping, ranked highly on some metrics and low on others. Further work can be undertaken to better tailor some of the network metrics for the purposes of a chemical site modelled as a network. This study's focus is ammonia production and the SMR process, but the methodology can be applied to any industrial process, particularly chemical sites, with minimal adjustments. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Efficiency; Energy; Exergy analysis; Materials; Network analysis; Sankey diagrams",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073750820

Thus, promoting residents' electricity saving has become an important way to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction targets in China. Although goal setting has proven effective in motivating households to save electricity, little is known about how to use feedback to motivate families to achieve challenging power-saving goals. We conducted an 18-week randomized controlled field trial in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, to explore what kind of feedback measures can encourage urban residents to save electricity when given a challenging power-saving goal. The experiment included 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. The four experimental groups were given the same 15% power-saving goal in the first 14 weeks and received contrast feedback. Different types of feedback content (self-contrast and others-contrast) and different feedback frequencies (once a week and twice a week) were used. After 14 weeks, the contrast feedback stopped, and we observed whether the power-saving behavior was sustainable only in the target situation. We collected household electricity consumption data from the power supply company's metering system, and we performed an analysis of covariance to control the influence of residents' existing electricity consumption habits. The results revealed four key findings. (1) Setting the 15% power-saving goal and providing others-contrast feedback (OCF) effectively promoted urban residents' power savings. The goal and OCF groups saved 14.45% and 11.86%, respectively. (2) Regarding the feedback content, the power-saving effect was significantly stronger in the OCF groups than in the self-contrast feedback (SCF) groups. (3) An increase in the feedback frequency from once a week to twice a week did not substantially affect residents' electricity-saving behaviors. (4) When the contrast feedback stopped, the goal itself was insufficient to encourage residents to save electricity sustainably. After the contrast feedback process stopped for four weeks, there were no significant differences between the experimental groups and the control group. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Contrast feedback; Feedback frequency; Goal setting; Power-saving behavior; Randomized controlled field trial; Urban residents","Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy conservation; Feedback; Regression analysis; Feedback frequency; Field trial; Goal setting; Power savings; Urban residents; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064486522

I also find a negative effect of a Republican governor on belief in human-caused global warming that does not differ by constituent partisan affiliation.

Here, we report the design and operation of a chemical reactor capable of approaching thermodynamically reversible operation. The reactor was employed for hydrogen production via the water–gas shift reaction, an important route to ‘green’ hydrogen. The reactor avoids mixing reactant gases by transferring oxygen from the (oxidizing) water stream to the (reducing) carbon monoxide stream via a solid-state oxygen reservoir consisting of a perovskite phase (La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ). This reservoir is able to remain close to equilibrium with the reacting gas streams because of its variable degree of non-stoichiometry and thus develops a ‘chemical memory’ that we employ to approach reversibility. We demonstrate this memory using operando, spatially resolved, real-time, high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction on a working reactor. The design leads to a reactor unconstrained by overall chemical equilibrium limitations, which can produce essentially pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide as separate product streams. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067645051

One approach is feeding the electron acceptor NO3 −, thus outcompeting methanogens for aqueous H2. We hypothesized that a live yeast culture (LYC; Saccharomyces cerevisiae from Yea-Sacc 1026, Alltech Inc., Nicholasville, KY) would stimulate the complete reduction of NO3 − to NH3 by selenomonads, thus decreasing the quantity of CH4 emissions per unit of energy-corrected milk production while decreasing blood methemoglobin concentration resulting from the absorbed intermediate, NO2 −. Twelve lactating Jersey cows (8 multiparous and noncannulated; 4 primiparous and ruminally cannulated) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Cattle were fed diets containing 1.5% NO3 − (from calcium ammonium nitrate) or an isonitrogenous control diet (containing additional urea) and given a top-dress of ground corn without or with LYC, with the fourth week used for data collection. Noncannulated cows were spot measured for CH4 emission by mouth using GreenFeed (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD). The main effect of NO3 − decreased CH4 by 17% but decreased dry matter intake by 10% (from 19.8 to 17.8 kg/d) such that CH4:dry matter intake numerically decreased by 8% and CH4:milk net energy for lactation production was unaffected by treatment. Milk and milk fat production were not affected, but NO3 − decreased milk protein from 758 to 689 g/d. Ruminal pH decreased more sharply after feeding for cows fed diets without NO3 −. Acetate:propionate was greater for cows fed NO3 −, particularly when combined with LYC (interaction effect). Blood methemoglobin was higher for cattle fed NO3 − than for those fed the control diet but was low for both treatments (1.5 vs. 0.5%, respectively; only one measurement exceeded 5%), indicating minimal risk for NO2 − accumulation at our feeding level of NO3 −. Although neither apparent organic matter nor neutral detergent fiber digestibilities were affected, apparent N digestibility had an interaction for NO3 − × LYC such that apparent N digestibility was numerically lowest for diets containing both NO3 − and LYC compared with the other 3 diets. Under the conditions of this study, NO3 − mitigated ruminal methanogenesis but also depressed dry matter intake and milk protein yield. Based on the fact that few interactions were detected, LYC had a minimal role in attenuating negative cow responses to NO3 − supplementation. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association","methane emission; nitrate; yeast culture","calcium ammonium nitrate; methane; milk protein; nitric acid derivative; probiotic agent; quaternary ammonium derivative; animal; animal food; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; bovine; diet; female; fermentation; lactation; maize; metabolism; milk; rumen; rumination; silage; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Female; Fermentation; Lactation; Methane; Milk; Milk Proteins; Nitrates; Probiotics; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Rumen; Rumination, Digestive; Silage; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064898440

Unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae, K. marxianus grows on low-cost substrates to cell densities that equal or surpass densities in glucose, which can be beneficial for utilization of lignocellulosic biomass (xylose), biofuel production waste (glycerol), and whey (lactose). We have evaluated K. marxianus for the synthesis of polyketides, using triacetic acid lactone (TAL) as the product. The 2-pyrone synthase (2-PS) was expressed on a CEN/ARS plasmid in three different strains, and the effects of temperature, carbon source, and cultivation strategy on TAL levels were determined. The highest titer was obtained in defined 1% xylose medium at 37°C, with substantial titers at 41 and 43°C. The introduction of a high-stability 2-PS mutant and a promoter substitution increased titer four-fold. 2-PS expression from a multi-copy pKD1-based plasmid improved TAL titers a further five-fold. Combining the best plasmid, promoter, and strain resulted in a TAL titer of 1.24 g/L and a yield of 0.0295 mol TAL/mol carbon for this otherwise unengineered strain in 3 ml tube culture.

Although the term emissions is often intuitively understood to mean release of greenhouse gases from terrestrial sources to the atmosphere, in fact, emission factors can also be negative, meaning removal of the gases from the atmosphere to terrestrial sinks. For remote and inaccessible forests for which ground sampling is difficult if not impossible, emission factors may be based on map-based estimates of biomass or biomass change obtained from regional maps. For the special case of complete deforestation, the emission factor for the aboveground biomass pool is simply mean aboveground, live-tree, biomass per unit area prior to the deforestation. If biomass maps are used for these purposes, estimates must still comply with the first IPCC good practice guideline regarding accuracy relative to the true value and the second guideline regarding uncertainty. Accuracy assessment for a map-based estimate entails comparison of the estimate to a second estimate obtained using independent reference data. Assuming ground sampling is not feasible, a map of greater quality than the regional map may be considered as a source of reference data where greater quality connotes attributes such as finer resolution and/or greater accuracy. For a local, sub-regional study area in Minnesota in the USA, the accuracy of an estimate of mean aboveground, live-tree biomass per unit area (AGB, Mg/ha) obtained from a coarser resolution, regional, MODIS-based biomass map was assessed using reference data sampled from a finer resolution, local, airborne laser scanning (ALS)-based biomass map. The rationale for a local assessment of a regional map is that, although assessment of a regional map would be difficult for the entire extent of the map, it can likely be assessed for multiple local sub-regions in which case expected local regional accuracy for the entire map can perhaps be inferred. For this study, the local assessment was in the form of a test of the hypothesis that the local sub-regional estimate from the regional map did not deviate from the local true value. A hybrid approach to inference was used whereby design-based inferential techniques were used to estimate uncertainty due to sampling from the finer resolution map, and model-based inferential techniques were used to estimate uncertainty resulting from using the finer resolution map unit values which were subject to prediction error as reference data. The test revealed no statistically significant difference between the MODIS-based and ALS-based map estimates, thereby indicating that for the local sub-region, the regional, MODIS-based estimate complied with the first IPCC good practice guideline for accuracy. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Design-based inference; Greenhouse gas inventory; Hybrid inference; IPCC good practice guidelines; Model-based inference","Biomass; Deforestation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Radiometers; Above ground biomass; Accuracy assessment; Airborne Laser scanning; Good practices; Greenhouse gas inventory; Hybrid inference; Model-based OPC; Statistically significant difference; Uncertainty analysis; aboveground biomass; accuracy assessment; design; emission inventory; forest; guideline; MODIS; vegetation mapping; Minnesota; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061269428

We tested biochar impact on soil biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and their interactions, in temperate agricultural soils. Methods: We performed a 27-month factorial experiment to determine effects of biochar, soil texture, and crop species treatments on microbial biomass (PFLA), soil invertebrate density, crop biomass and ecosystem CO2 flux in plant-soil mesocosms. Results: Overall soil microbial biomass, microarthropod abundance and crop biomass were unaffected by biochar, although there was an increase in fungal-bacterial ratio and a positive relationship between the 16:1ω5 fatty acid marker of AMF mass and collembolan density in the biochar-treated mesocosms. Ecosystem CO2 fluxes were unaffected by biochar, but soil carbon content of biochar-treated mesocosms was significantly lower, signifying a possible movement/loss of biochar or priming effect. Conclusions: Compared to soil texture and crop type, biochar had minimal impact on soil biota, crop production and carbon cycling. Future research should examine subtler effects of biochar on biotic regulation of ecosystem production and if the apparent robustness to biochar weakens over greater time spans or in combination with other ecological perturbations. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AM fungi; Biodiversity-function; Charcoal; Collembola; Crop production; Ecosystem CO2 flux; Mites; Nematode; PLFA; Soil carbon cycling; Soil community","abundance; arbuscular mycorrhiza; biodiversity; carbon cycle; carbon flux; charcoal; crop plant; crop production; fungus; mesocosm; mite; nematode; phytomass; soil carbon; soil fauna; soil microorganism; soil texture; Acari; Bacteria (microorganisms); Collembola; Fungi; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065490745

In this context, cogeneration units arranged in CHP layout are able to generate concurrently the assets required by the user, allowing for higher global system efficiencies and reduced CO2 emissions, especially when integrated in smart-district where energy storage technologies are also adopted. The multi energy mixing on the primary source and on the demand sides requires advanced algorithm in order to optimally design and operate the cogeneration smart district. The paper deals with the setup of a cogeneration smart-district simulation tool based on a mixed integer quadric programming technique for solving the optimal dispatch problem, by optimizing the primary energy consumption and the CO2 emissions related to the smart-district design and operation. A real test-case related to an industrial site in the port area of Singapore has been assumed as reference for demonstrating the capabilities of cogeneration smart-district to reduce the primary energy consumption and the greenhouse emissions. The simulation tool has been firstly validated among the data available by two end-users (User A and B), constituting the industrial plant, then it has been adopted for exploring the optimal smart-district design, demonstrating that the cogeneration layout, in which User A and User B are served as a unique User A+B, allows for achieving 15% primary energy saving and up to 18% CO2 pollutant emissions. Furthermore, the advanced mathematics embedded in the cogeneration simulation tool has been used for establishing the best control strategy for a reference week of operations. Accordingly, components sized and capacities and optimal dispatch profile are presented and discussed. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069771325

Yet a major methodological difficulty is faced when interpreting this general mitigation obligation: how to determine the requisite level of mitigation action? This article identifies and discusses various methods for the interpretation of States’ general mitigation obligations in light of domestic cases. On the one hand, a top-down approach seeks to determine a State's requisite mitigation action in the light of a global objective on climate change mitigation and of effort-sharing criteria. On the other hand, bottom-up methods put emphasis on the demand for internal consistency, on the obligation for a State not to downplay its contribution to environmental impacts unfolding beyond its territory, and on various emerging transnational standards. The article argues that the top-down and bottomup approaches enable a sound interpretation of States’ general mitigation obligations especially when these approaches are used in combination. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148, USA.",,"bottom-up approach; climate change; environmental impact; international law; methodology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065047899

The manufacturing process of hybrid composites is that discontinuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastics are injected onto the textile-reinforced thermoplastics through injection over-molding. The key topic of this process is to achieve a reliable interfacial bonding strength, which has a strong dependence on the molding conditions. As a novel approach, we adopted a carbon nanotube-based thermoplastic film to make nanoscale interconnections between different layers by inserting films between the layers. In this work, the following influences were investigated with respect to the interlaminar shear strength by short beam shear test: the (i) existence, (ii) dispersion state, (iii) concentration of carbon nanotubes, and (iv) injection over-molding conditions. Furthermore, the delaminated surface after short beam shear test was assessed via SEM observation. Consequently, polypropylene-injected hybrid composite with 1 wt% carbon nanotubes exhibited a 52% increase in interlaminar shear strength compared with the specimen without carbon nanotubes. Additionally, the combination of short carbon fibers, which were filled in injected polypropylene, and carbon nanotubes drastically enhanced the interlaminar shear strength. The optimization of carbon nanotube dispersion and molding condition provides strong improvement of interlaminar shear strength. However, excessive addition of carbon nanotube deteriorates the interlaminar shear strength. © The Author(s) 2019.","carbon nanotube; Hybrid thermoplastic composites; injection over-molding; interlaminar shear strength; twin-screw extrusion","Carbon films; Extrusion molding; Filled polymers; Injection molding; Polypropylenes; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Shear strength; Yarn; Discontinuous fibers; Inter-laminar shear strengths; Interfacial bonding strength; Manufacturing process; Nanotube dispersions; Reinforced thermoplastics; Thermoplastic composite; Twin screw extrusion; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063574702

However, intraspecific differences in functional traits could modulate the plant responses to the expected increase in drought. Using a trait-based approach, we evaluated under controlled conditions how Quercus suber seedlings from the latitudinal edges of the distribution range of the species respond to different watering treatments in terms of vegetative growth and biomass allocation. In addition, we simulated an extreme drought by stopping watering until death to determine chemical and physiological traits under drought stress and to identify which morphological traits were more associated to drought resistance (expressed as survival time without watering). Seedlings from the northern provenance presented higher aboveground biomass allocation (i.e. shoot length and biomass allocation to shoot and leaves), while the southern ones were characterised by longer roots and higher biomass allocation to roots. Under extreme drought, seedlings from the southern provenance maintained higher photosynthetic rates than northern seedlings and were able to modulate their water-use efficiency (estimated from δ13C) depending on environmental conditions, which allowed them to survive for a longer period. Finally, drought resistance was partially explained by the plant biomass allocation pattern. Traits related to growth in height and light interception were negatively related with drought resistance, whereas traits involving investment in root biomass were positively related with resistance. These geographical differences evidence a local adaptation to drought at the southern edge of Q. suber distribution. Our results highlight the importance of the conservation of the genetic resources that peripheral populations harbour at distribution edges. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass allocation; Functional traits; Local adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity; Photosynthesis; Range edge","aboveground biomass; biomass allocation; deciduous tree; drought resistance; drought stress; edge effect; growth; local adaptation; morphology; phenotypic plasticity; photosynthesis; physiological response; provenance; seedling; water use efficiency; Quercus suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064259814

This reaction has long been considered to be driven by typical denitrifiers mostly belonging to Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria. Our recent metatranscriptomic analysis of rice paddy field soil suggested that paddy soil denitrification is a cooperative process of different nitrogen oxide reducers, i.e., NO2−, NO, and N2O reducers. However, it was not clear whether denitrification actually occurred in the soil samples examined, which was not easy to confirm under field conditions. Therefore, we carried out this study (1) to establish a soil microcosm with the steady activity of denitrification, and (2) to identify microbial communities, which drive each step of denitrification in the soil microcosm by metatranscriptomic analysis. As a result, a chemostat-type soil microcosm with steady denitrification activity was successfully established. Metatranscriptomic analysis of the denitrification-induced soils, together with supportive PCR-based clone library analysis, indicated that the community compositions of microbial drivers at each step of denitrification are different from each other. The results verified our above-mentioned suggestion of denitrification in paddy soil being a cooperative process of different nitrogen oxide reducers. Microbial communities of the cooperative denitrification in paddy soil might be established, and might have advantages to eliminate/detoxify microbiologically and/or chemically generated nitrogen oxides smoothly under changing paddy soil environments. © 2019, © 2019 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Paddy soil; soil microcosm; denitrification; microbial community; metatranscriptome",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070265284

Low fruit and vegetable consumption is itself a major nutritional problem. We aim to better quantify the gap between future fruit and vegetable supply and recommended consumption levels by exploring the interactions between supply and demand in more than 150 countries from 1961 to 2050. Methods: In this global analysis, we use the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade, which simulates the global agricultural sector, to explore the role of insufficient production of fruits and vegetables and the effects of food waste and public policy in achieving recommended fruit and vegetable consumption. First, we estimate the average historical (1961–2010) and future (2010–50) national consumption levels needed to meet WHO targets (a minimum target of 400 g/person per day or age-specific recommendations of 330–600 g/person per day) using population pyramids; for future consumption, we use projections from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), a set of global socioeconomic scenarios characterised by varied assumptions on economic and population growth. We then simulate future fruit and vegetable production and demand to 2050 under three such scenarios (SSP1–3) to assess the potential impacts of economic, demographic, and technological change on consumer and producer behaviour. We then explore the potential effects of food waste applying various waste assumptions (0–33% waste). Finally, we apply two policy analysis frameworks (the NOURISHING framework and the Nuffield ladder) to assess the current state of public policy designed to achieve healthy diets. Findings: Historically, fruit and vegetable availability has consistently been insufficient to supply recommended consumption levels. By 2015, 81 countries representing 55% of the global population had average fruit and vegetable availability above WHO's minimum target. Under more stringent age-specific recommendations, only 40 countries representing 36% of the global population had adequate availability. Although economic growth will help to increase fruit and vegetable availability in the future, particularly in lower-income countries, this alone will be insufficient. Even under the most optimistic socioeconomic scenarios (excluding food waste), many countries fail to achieve sufficient fruit and vegetable availability to meet even the minimum recommended target. Sub-Saharan Africa is a particular region of concern, with projections suggesting, by 2050, between 0·8 and 1·9 billion people could live in countries with average fruit and vegetable availability below 400 g/person per day. Food waste is a serious obstacle that could erode projected gains. Assuming 33% waste and socioeconomic trends similar to historical patterns, the global average availability in 2050 falls below age-specific recommendations, increasing the number of people living in countries with insufficient supply of fruits and vegetables by 1·5 billion compared with a zero waste scenario. Interpretation: Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is an important component of a shift towards healthier and more sustainable diets. Economic modelling suggests that even under optimistic socioeconomic scenarios future supply will be insufficient to achieve recommended levels in many countries. Consequently, systematic public policy targeting the constraints to producing and consuming fruits and vegetables will be needed. This will require a portfolio of interventions and investments that focus on increasing fruit and vegetable production, developing technologies and practices to reduce waste without increasing the consumer cost, and increasing existing efforts to educate consumers on healthy diets.

We conducted an accountability study assessing the improvement in ambient air quality and estimating the effect on health outcomes of the policy. Method: We used interrupted time series (ITS) with segmented regression to identify any change in ambient concentrations of SO2 in contrast to other ambient pollutants (particulate matter &lt;10 μm in diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3)) at 10 monitoring stations in Hong Kong from 2010 to 2017. We validated these findings using cumulative sum control (CUSUM) charts. We used a validated risk assessment model to estimate effects of changes in air quality on death for natural causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Results: Mean monthly concentrations of SO2 fell abruptly at the monitoring station closest to the main shipping port (Kwai Chung (KC)) by −10.0 μgm3 p-value = 0.0004, but not elsewhere. No such changes were evident for the other pollutants (PM10, NO2, O3). CUSUM charts confirmed a change in July 2015. Estimated deaths avoided per year as a result of the policy were 379, 72, 30 for all natural causes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases respectively. Conclusion: Implementation of the shipping emission policy in Hong Kong successfully reduced ambient SO2, with the potential to reduce mortality. However, to gain full benefits, restrictions on shipping emissions need to be implemented throughout the region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CUSUM; Interrupted time series; Kwai chung; Segmented regression analysis; Shipping emission policy; Sulfur dioxide","Air quality; Control charts; Nitrogen oxides; Pathology; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sulfur dioxide; Time series; Time series analysis; Ambient air quality; Ambient concentrations; Cardio-vascular disease; CUSUM; Kwai chung; Risk assessment models; Segmented regressions; Shipping emissions; Ships; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; accountability; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; emission control; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; regression analysis; shipping; sulfur dioxide; time series analysis; traffic emission; air pollutant; air quality; ambient air; Article; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; controlled study; environmental policy; health impact assessment; particulate matter; respiratory tract disease; shipping; air pollution; analysis; cardiovascular disease; commercial phenomena; environmental monitoring; Hong Kong; human; legislation and jurisprudence; lung disease; mortality; procedures; social responsibility; China; Hong Kong; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Commerce; Environmental Monitoring; Hong Kong; Humans; Lung Diseases; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Social Responsibility; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064228688

Five radiocarbon dates were obtained. The results revealed the plant succession in an ancient water reservoir near the coastal line. 7500–4000 BP: Marine organisms and freshwater taxa, with herbaceous marsh at the margins. Marine taxa were markedly present from 6000 to 5000 BP, the time of the maximum transgression. Regionally, the vegetation was dominated by grasslands and forest groupings. 4000–2000 BP: Regressive marine phase, with an increased record of freshwater organisms due to increased rainfall. A large increase in herbaceous marsh components resulted in a gradual filling-in of the water reservoir and the development of regional vegetation. 2000–1760 BP: With the end of the marine regression, progressive desalinization promoted the local herbaceous marsh development. Regionally, grassland and forest also developed, indicative of climate amelioration. Local plant succession ceased during this phase of herbaceous marsh ca. 1760 BP, when beach sands covered the sedimentary sequence. This study reveals the phases of a hydrosere in a coastal water reservoir, influenced by marine oscillations, with gradual desalinization and filling-in that culminated in an herbaceous marsh deposit. These results provide a basis for understanding many other similar relict muds spread throughout the coastal plain in the extreme south of Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Coastal plain; Holocene; Paleoenvironmental reconstruction; Palynology; Southern Brazil","coastal plain; Holocene; paleobiogeography; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; palynology; radiocarbon dating; reconstruction; sedimentary sequence; transgression; vegetation dynamics; Brazil; Hermenegildo; Rio Grande do Sul",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068739179

Catalytic hydrogenolysis assisted by isopropanol (IPA) is used to convert the lignin recovered after ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment, saccharification, and fermentation. This process was compared to a biorefinery using lignin for energy generation and simulated in SuperPro Designer. Spatial analysis was performed to determine biorefinery locations and capacities in a Mexican state with potential for lignocellulosic biomass, including corn stover, sorghum stubble, and Jatropha fruit shells. Relative to the base case, diverting 50% of lignin to phenolics decreased the ethanol cost of production significantly due to the high market value of the co-products. The minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) for this case was $2.02 gal−1. The resulting cradle-to-gate GHG footprint of bioethanol was 21 g CO2-eq MJ−1, a 78% reduction with respect to gasoline when system expansion is used for allocation. Using market value-based allocation resulted in 82% GHG reduction. Analysis of scenarios showed that a biorefinery processing 3000 t day−1 biomass and diverting 80% of lignin to phenolics can potentially yield an MESP lower than $1.5 gal−1. To achieve this, research should target a reduction in IL input by 30% and IPA input by 40%, together with more energy-efficient separation processes. The reduction in IL and IPA can be achieved by decreasing their loading rates and increasing recycling. Sensitivity analysis showed that, for biomass prices higher than $45 t−1, biorefinery capacities must exceed 5000 t d−1 biomass input. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","bioethanol; eugenol; GHG analysis; lignin valorization; techno-economic analysis","Bioconversion; Bioethanol; Biomass; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Commerce; Energy efficiency; Ethanol; Finance; Greenhouse gases; Ionic liquids; Lignin; Refining; Saccharification; Sensitivity analysis; Catalytic hydrogenolysis; Cost of productions; eugenol; GHG analysis; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Lignocellulosic biomass; Separation process; Techno-Economic analysis; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063624049

Nevertheless, in the context of the ESA Arctic+ initiative, BEC has planned to introduce improvements in all the processing levels. Some of the planned improvements include: (i) optimizing the projection grid of level 1, (ii) studying the performance of different dielectric models in the Artic region and (iii) producing an additional level 4 product. The SSS Arctic products from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission could be used to produce a level 4 by merging them with this new version of SSS level 3 produced from SMOS.Big data techniques are applied to produce debiased SSS maps. These techniques will be refined by introducing a new grouping method for the statistical study of the data.The aim of this work is to obtain a more accurate version of the Arctic salinity maps starting at 2011.

Processes and interactions within the negotiations have been historically perceived as inequitable, as low-income countries' interests were undermined by the small size of their delegations. Since COP21 in Paris, however, the delegation size of poorer countries has significantly increased. Following the Paris Agreement, the average delegation size of low-income and lower middle-income countries, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, has risen considerably compared with other country income groupings and regions. While the drivers behind this increase are yet unclear, the trend could contribute to greater equity in the negotiations through better representation and visibility of issues shared by these countries, for instance those related to high climate vulnerability and low readiness.

The ‘green rating tool,’ industry's adherence to relevant standards and governmental policies represent the primary means of effecting the sustainability transition. However, only high-profile commercial building owners seem interested in being green-rated; the actual end-users of buildings are far less committed (e.g. employees ensconced in commercial buildings and residential home occupiers). Through a systematic review of 103 journal articles published on the topic of end-users and sustainability transition, original findings are presented. The findings reveal that most residential end-users do not purchase green homes and without their ‘buy-in,’ sustainability transition across Australia will continue to fail. This paper offers a critical analysis of the status-quo, identifying where the effort to generate a sustainable urban environment has been misdirected, what challenges prevail, and why residential end-users have been overlooked. In looking for a way forward that engages end-users, the paper proposes that financial incentives for the purchase of low-carbon buildings must be introduced into the residential real-estate market. And the modeling for this rebate is discussed in terms of emissions trading schemes or carbon tax. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Green transition; Livable cities; Low carbon living; Occupants; Sustainable buildings; Sustainable cities","Carbon; Commerce; Emission control; Housing; Human computer interaction; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Purchasing; Urban planning; Green transitions; Livable cities; Low carbon; Occupants; Sustainable building; Sustainable cities; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063996386

One possible way to accommodate this larger population is to transform smaller cities in Switzerland through the direct intervention of urban planners. In this work, we integrate agent-based simulation models of people flow, mobility and urban infrastructure with models of the electricity and gas systems to examine the increase of the density of existing residential zones and the creation of new workplaces and commercial activities in these urban areas. This novel simulation framework is used to assess, for the year 2050, two different scenarios of urbanization in a region with small urban areas. It is shown that a densification scenario, with a preference for multi-dwelling buildings, consumes 93% less land than a sprawl scenario, with a preference for single-family houses. The former scenario also accommodates 27% more people than the latter scenario, as there is a higher penetration of battery electric vehicles – and therefore reduced air pollution from the transportation sector – and also a larger shift of commuters to the use of public transport. However, in the former scenario, the commuting time is 20% longer. The outcome of this work demonstrates how this novel simulation framework can be used to support the formulation of policies that can direct the transformation of urban areas. © The Author(s) 2018.","Agent-based modelling; planning processes; population simulation; traffic simulation","colonial breeding; commuting; computer simulation; future prospect; numerical model; planning process; policy approach; population dynamics; traffic congestion; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069451291

Iran is geographically located in a part of the planet with specific climate constraints. Drought is one of the constraints that has been a major challenge to agricultural development for many years and has always been the subject of discussions and investigations. On the other hand, constraints such as agricultural soils, economic factors, climate change, agricultural workforce, etc., multiply the production challenges in the country. Despite such constraints, planning a coherent and targeted program for the cultivation of crops and overcome the existing problems is inevitable. The present study introduced a model for optimization of regional cropping pattern decisions, which is one of the subsets of the Multi-Objective Structural Planning (MOSP) approach, and addressed different objectives, such as economic, social and environmental objectives, separately and jointly. However, it is important to address the exchange of crops in different areas in order to achieve the fundamental objectives of determining the optimal cropping pattern. Therefore, in the proposed model of optimal regional cropping pattern, issues such as the transportation of crops and, consequently, virtual water and energy exchanges were also considered. In order to evaluate the proposed model, agricultural arable lands located in the political-geographic divisions of 23 counties of Isfahan province (Iran) were selected for examination. The results showed that in the main groups of grains and forage, a significant reduction was observed in the optimal crop area of the multi-objective model by 26% and 5%, respectively. Increasing the crop area of horticultural products by 10% in the optimal pattern of multi-objective model was another important factor in the analysis of the results. In general, in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental objectives mentioned in this study within the framework of a multi-objective planning, a 16% reduction in the level of the crop area in Isfahan province is inevitable. The results of this measure are reduction in the irrigation water consumption by 17%, increase in the profit by 58% and increase in the production by 11%. Regarding the fact that in the structural planning of cropping pattern, different and sometimes conflicting objectives are considered and the compromise between the objectives is possible in the multi-objective structural planning model, the decision makers are recommended to use this model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Iran; Multi-objective structural planning; Regional cropping pattern; Robust optimization","agricultural development; agricultural soil; crop plant; cropping practice; cultivation; horticulture; optimization; planning process; Esfahan [Iran]; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062711094

A potential presence of magnetospherically originated emission outside this region, the so-called off-pulse emission, would challenge the existing theories. Detection of significant off-pulse emission has been reported so far from only two pulsars: B0525+21 and B2045-16 at 325 and 610 MHz, respectively. However, the nature of this newly uncovered off-pulse emission remains unclear. To probe its origin we conducted very-high-resolution radio observations of B0525+21 and B2045-16 with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.39 GHz. Whereas the pulsed emission is detected at a level consistent with previous observations, we report an absence of any off-pulse emission above 42 and 96 μJy beam-1 (three times the rms noise levels) for B0525+21 and B2045-16, respectively. Our stringent upper limits imply the off-pulse emission to be less than 0.4 and 0.3% of the period-averaged pulsed flux density, i.e., much fainter than the previously suggested values of 1-10%. Since the EVN data are most sensitive to extremely compact angular scales, our results suggest a non-magnetospheric origin for the previously reported off-pulse emission. The presence of extended emission that is resolved out to these milliarcsecond scales still remains plausible. In this case, we constrain the emission to arise from structures with sizes of ∼(0.61-19) × 103 au for B0525+21 and ∼(0.48-8.3) × 103 au for B2045-16. These constraints might indicate that the two pulsars are accompanied by compact bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae. Future observations probing intermediate angular scales (∼0.1-5 arcsec) will help to clarify the actual origin of the off-pulse emission. © ESO 2019.","Pulsars: individual: B0525+21; Pulsars: individual: B2045-16; Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; Radio continuum: stars; Techniques: high angular resolution; Techniques: interferometric","Magnetosphere; European vlbi networks; Flux densities; Future observations; Pulsar wind nebulae; Pulse emissions; Radio emission; Radio observation; Very high resolution; Pulsars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095098217

In this paper, the charging requirements of electric vehicles are divided into three levels.

Some of the main CO2 contributors are metamorphism and magmatic-mantle degassing. CO2 is discharged from active and quiescent volcanoes, fault zones, geothermal systems and CO2 rich groundwater. Here a new method for the estimation of the geogenic flux of CO2 from tectonically active regions, based on the volume, composition and age of travertine deposits, is proposed. The method is applied to the travertine deposits of western Central Italy where travertine deposition is driven by degassing of CO2 charged groundwater. Results show that the study areas are characterized, since Middle Pleistocene, by diffuse CO2 degassing processes with time averaged CO2 fluxes ranging between 1.24 ± 0.12 106 mol y−1 km−2 and 1.38 ± 0.42 106 mol y−1 km−2. These values are of the same order of magnitude of carbon dioxide fluxes measured by different methods in western central Italy and are higher than the global baseline CO2 flux from high heat flow regions. The review of the available 234U/230Th and 14C data shows that the CO2 degassing processes that affects western Central Italy nowadays were already active at least 350 Ka ago, proving that this region is a globally relevant case for the study of Earth degassing. Considering the widespread occurrence of travertine deposits in tectonically active areas worldwide, the proposed approach can be used as a reliable tool to estimate the CO2 flux in different geodynamic settings within system Earth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide degassing; Quaternary; Travertines; Western central Italy","Degassing; Deposits; Earth atmosphere; Geothermal fields; Groundwater; Limestone; Thorium compounds; Carbon dioxide flux; Central Italy; Degassing process; Geodynamic setting; Geothermal systems; Middle Pleistocene; Quaternary; Travertines; Carbon dioxide; Calluna vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066052800

Globally, India is one of the highest emitters of anthropogenic SO2. However, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data reveal that unlike many other anthropogenic air pollutants, the strongest anthropogenic SO2 sources are not located in the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) but over the coal belts of North Eastern peninsular India. In this study, we report SO2 measurements conducted at Bhubaneswar, a rapidly developing smart city in the Eastern Coast of India. The city is ideally located just downwind of the Indian SO2 hotspots during winter, when SO2 concentrations are the highest, reaching 14.3 ppbv for hourly averaged data. The measurements, reported here from the summer of 2010 to the summer of 2012, show that despite being a rapidly developing location, SO2 over Bhubaneswar is dominated by regional emissions rather than local sources like vehicular exhausts. The influence of regional emissions is strongest in winter as the city is directly downwind of 6 of the 10 largest thermal power plants and 7 out of the 13 largest integrated steel plants in India with a mean SO2 concentration of 3.2 ppbv. This is evinced by multiple pointers viz. Concentration-Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis for surface SO2 data, correlation analysis for OMI SO2 data, analysis of surface concentrations of SO2, organic carbon, black carbon and carbon monoxide; which reveal SO2 emissions from the industrial and mining regions of Chhattisgarh and north-west Odisha. This is the same region that shows up as hotspots of SO2 in OMI retrievals over India. However, despite being downwind of major SO2 sources during winter, SO2 concentrations in Bhubaneswar are lower than over some other cities (Kolkata, Kanpur) in the IGP, due to influence of strong local sources in the later cases. Unlike most other urban regions in India, the diurnal variation of SO2 over Bhubaneswar shows elevated daytime values due to predominant influence of regional emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Boundary layer; Regional emissions; SO2; SO2 source region; SO2 sources","Air pollution; Boundary layers; Carbon monoxide; Organic carbon; Steelmaking; Sulfur dioxide; Thermoelectric power plants; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Correlation analysis; Diurnal variation; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Ozone monitoring instruments; Peninsular india; Source region; Surface concentration; Thermal power plants; Industrial emissions; carbon monoxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; black carbon; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; emission; haze; pollutant source; seasonal variation; smart city; sulfur dioxide; urban area; urban pollution; urban region; air pollution; ambient air; Article; boundary layer; Chhattisgarh; circadian rhythm; combustion; exhaust gas; haze; India; mining; priority journal; seasonal variation; smog; summer; winter; Bhubaneswar; India; India; Odisha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064914044

Although most developed countries have well-formulated RE policies, in developing countries, such policies face many barriers. This study analyzes the policies, drivers, and barriers to RE deployment for fostering environmental sustainability in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. In the GCC region, the need for economic diversification to reduce dependency on single resource, diminishing hydrocarbon reserve, loss of oil export revenue, climate change mitigation pledges, and abundant solar energy resource are the key drivers for diversifying energy sources to include RE. However, the apparent lack of consolidated policy framework for wide-scale RE utilization calls for a well-articulated policy to advance RE development in each member state. Although FIT and RPS approaches could be effective for initial deployment of small-scale RE projects, a competitive tendering and auctioning mechanisms are more suitable for large-scale projects. Whereas, developing effective energy codes could successfully promote RE deployment, the increased share of RE in energy supply would have synergistic impacts on the region. The GHG emissions avoidance expected to be achieved by the GCC countries will vary between 5 and 247 million tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030.

The present study determines hydro-climatic changes in the active parts of the Lake Chad basin by using trend analysis and the causes of declining stream flow to LC due to human interventions and climate variability by using a hydrological approach. One approach, which is used to estimate changes in stream flow due to climate variability, is also modified in this study. Trend results showed that mean temperature exhibited very strong increasing trends, with a mean rise of 1.4 °C for 1951–2015, while precipitation presented very weak to strong declining trends, with an overall decline of 15%. Regarding stream flow, all major rivers showed very strong downward trends, resulting in 67% decline. The northern and eastern regions were the most impacted areas in the basin regarding decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature. The hydrological approach showed that decreasing stream flow to LC varied between 34% and 45% in different decades. In general, human activities attributed a 66% decline in stream flow and climate variability 34% for the impacted period (1972–2013) relative to 1951–1971. Only during 1982–1991, climate variability caused most reduction (59% of total) in stream flow because of devastating drought during this period. Since stream flow to LC was mostly affected by human activities, proper water resources planning and sustainable management are necessary but under the umbrella of considering changing climate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate variability; HEC-HMS; Human activities; Hydrological modelling; Lake Chad basin; Trend analysis","Climate change; Lakes; Rivers; Climate variability; HEC-HMS; Human activities; Hydrological modelling; Lake Chad basins; Trend analysis; Stream flow; climate variation; human activity; hydrological modeling; hydrometeorology; streamflow; trend analysis; Africa; article; climate change; drought; human; precipitation; stream (river); water availability; Lake Chad",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064542162

This paper assesses heat losses of buildings through ground, as part of the energy demand and energy consumption of the building, a domain that still lacks comprehensive knowledge, especially for the large buildings. In order to reduce the significant resources required for numerical analysis in time-dependent state, the authors propose the use of artificial intelligence to allow long-term prediction of the hourly heat transfer losses through ground for large dimension slabs. The attention was directed to this subject due that this slabs are specific for many types of non-residential buildings, such as commercial buildings (hypermarkets, malls), production halls or even educational buildings. An alternative approach is undertaken in the direction of carrying out detailed analyzes using numerical methods to establish input data for neural networks, in order to predict the building's part thermal response, by totally substituting numerical analysis, for arbitrary sizes of slabs on ground. © 2019 IEEE.","Buildings energy performance Heat transfer through ground; Neural networks; Time-dependent numerical analysis","Artificial intelligence; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat losses; Heat transfer performance; Housing; Neural networks; Numerical analysis; Numerical methods; Office buildings; Renewable energy resources; Educational buildings; Energy performance; Long-term prediction; Reduce energy consumption; Research and development; Residential building; Time dependent; Time-dependent state; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075355179

The Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as Solar PV can be suitably used for fulfilling the high energy demands of EVs. In addition, EVs can be used to provide ancillary services such as energy storage, spinning reserve, frequency and voltage regulation for Grid-connected environment. The major challenge is to develop EV charging station integrated with RES, Grid Power and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in order to provide these ancillary services. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for monitoring solar PV based EV community charging station and load frequency regulation using Blockchain technology. In addition, we propose Smart Energy Management Controller (SEMC) which optimally decides the EV charge and discharge operation by considering the present capacity, frequency of the Grid and solar PV availability. We integrate Blockchain technology with the SEMC to record EV owner information, energy status and financial transactions while fulfilling different requirements viz; Owner privacy, data immutability, energy data transparency, tracking and availability with the improved trust among the users.

The urgent utilization of clean energy not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but also promotes future innovations in blast furnace iron making technology. Hydrogen (H2) energy is considered to be one of the most promising alternatives to carbon-based fossil energy for the reduction of iron oxides. Therefore, the gaseous reduction of iron oxides by H2 has been intensively studied for decades. However, the impact of H2 on the shrinkage behavior of iron oxide packed beds above 900 °C has rarely been studied, and the interaction between H2 and carbon monoxide (CO) in the shrinking process is not fully understood. Therefore, this study uses H2, CO and H2+CO mixture gas for the well-designed high temperature experiments of wustite (FeO) packed beds. The results show that H2 protects the coke from further damage in the packed bed at 900–1000 °C, and the corresponding shrinkage rate (SR) decreases from 0.31%/°C for CO case to 0.16%/°C. Meanwhile, when the temperature exceeds 1350 °C, the packed bed under the CO atmosphere accelerates shrinkage due to the melting and dripping of the metallic iron after carbonization. By contrast, when CO is replaced by H2, the carbonization process is controlled by the solid state diffusion of coke carbon rather than the reverse Boudouard reaction. As a result, the lower carbonization efficiency not only increases the transition temperature by up to 100 °C, but also reduces the weight of the melted hot metal by one third, which significantly improves the bed permeability. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Carbonization; High temperature; Hydrogen impact; Shrinkage behavior; Wustite packed bed","Atmospheric temperature; Blast furnaces; Carbon monoxide; Carbonization; Coke; Diffusion in solids; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Iron oxides; Shrinkage; Steelmaking; Blast furnace iron-making; Carbonization process; High temperature; High-temperature experiments; Reduction of iron oxide; Shrinkage behavior; Solid-state diffusion; Wustite; Packed beds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067277282

The legal standing of nature, therefore, could increasingly become an instrument for Indigenous rights to be realised, while at the same time operationalising commitments made by states to climate change action and international treaties.

However, knowledge about field autotrophic bacteria under different tillage systems is limited. In this field study, the effects of 6 years of tillage on autotrophic bacteria were evaluated by high-throughput sequencing of the ribulose 1,5–bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO)gene (cbbL). The results showed that tillage systems had strong influence on the abundance, composition, and activity of cbbL-carrying bacteria. Conventional tillage had more abundant cbbL and 16S rRNA genes as well as higher RubisCO activity, when compared with no tillage. The cbbL sequences were mainly affiliated with Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, which accounted for &gt;96% of the identified community. The predominant cbbL-carrying bacteria in conventional tillage with straw returning were Proteobacteria (94.3%)at the phylum level and Variovorax paradoxus (42.9%)at the species level; in contrast, those in no tillage with straw removal included Actinobacteria (31.5%)at the phylum level and Thermomonospora curvata (29.1%)at the species level. The copy numbers of cbbL correlated positively with dissolved organic carbon and negatively with soil bulk density. Mantel tests confirmed that cbbL-carrying bacterial composition was significantly affected by soil bulk density and also by microbial biomass carbon. Straw returning enhanced the abundance of cbbL-carrying bacteria and had unique species such as Acidiphilium multivorum, which was not detected in treatments with straw removal. These results suggest that the potential for CO2 mitigation by tillage depends on soil conditions and is much more variable and complex than previously considered. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Abundance; Autotrophic bacteria; CO2 fixation activity; Diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065894600

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to determine adoption without deploying thousands of costly household surveys. This research used European Space Agency Sentinel-1a and 1b radar data, combined with in-situ moisture readings, to determine AWD adoption through change detection of a time series wetness index (WI). By using a beta coefficient of the radar data, the WI avoided the pitfalls of cloud cover, surface roughness, and vegetative interference that arise from the sigma coefficient data. The analysis illustrated an AWD adoption likelihood scale across the delta and it showed potential for the use of remotely sensed data to detect adoption. Trends across the Vietnamese delta showed higher adoption rates inland, with lower adoption of AWD in the coastal provinces.

The regulatory changes have triggered a wave of claims from low-carbon investors asserting that the reforms have diminished or exhausted the economic viability of their investments. Unlike local investors, who typically take legal action before domestic courts, foreign investors have filed arbitration claims in accordance with the Energy Charter Treaty, notably against Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, and the Czech Republic, resulting in several awards of damages. However, recent developments in EU state aid law seem to restrict the ability of investors to obtain compensation. This article argues that such developments may undermine renewable energy policy, because arbitration enhances the regulatory stability and predictability which low-carbon investments require only if arbitral awards can be enforced effectively. The article examines the different scenarios that may arise out of the interplay between EU law and investment arbitration in the EU and concludes that the European Commission's arguable redrawing of the boundaries of state aid rules to encompass investment arbitration, combined with the EU's general quest to replace investment arbitration with alternative mechanisms of adjudication, may jeopardize climate change mitigation policies. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","Climate change mitigation; Energy Charter Treaty; EU law; Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS); Renewable energy; State aid",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069296007

Cues that regulate germination have been exhaustively characterized in laboratory experiments. However, the way in which seed populations respond to these cues and the ecological meanings of this phenomenon are scarcely known. To help filling this gap, we studied the thermic regulation of seed germination and its link with local climatic characteristics in Festuca pallescens populations, an iconic perennial grass species of Patagonia. By coupling thermal time models with field and environmental data, we evaluated seed responsiveness to temperature during germination of nine Festuca pallescens populations distributed across their complete longitudinal range in North Patagonia. The idea behind this experimental design was to search for inter-population differences in early life traits relevant for recruitment of the species, and associate seed traits with local environmental characteristics. F. pallescens populations showed strong differences in seed sensitivity to temperature for the thermal regulation of the germination rate, described by the population mean thermal time for germination (θ (50) ) and its standard deviation (σ θ ). The greatest values of θ (50) and σ θ corresponded to populations inhabiting harsh environments. Moreover, θ (50) of the different populations showed strong correlations with their local thermal environmental parameters, indicating a relation between seed physiological traits and climate across the longitudinal gradient. We did not observe inter-population differences in the minimum temperature that allows germination (Tb = -0.47 ± 0.19 °C). Higher θ (50) and σ θ in populations from harsh climates may constitute a strategy of the species to increase fitness in hostile habitats, preventing anticipated germination and promoting a slower seed bank depletion in regions where establishment is highly limited. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arid and semiarid environments; Festuca pallescens; Germination; North Patagonian rangelands; Temperature; Thermal time model","arid environment; fitness; germination; grass; habitat type; interspecific variation; longitudinal gradient; phenotype; rangeland; seed bank; semiarid region; temperature effect; Patagonia; Festuca pallescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063932426

This work applies recent developments in robust multivariate statistical methods to overcome issues with highly non-Gaussian data and support the development of a conceptual model for the regional groundwater chemistry and the occurrence of methane. Principal component analysis reveals that the redox-sensitive species, DO, NO3, Fe, Mn, methane, As and U are the most important parameters that differentiate the samples. Permutation-based MANOVA and ANOVA testing revealed that geology was more important than geographic location and topography in influencing groundwater composition. The statistical inferences are supported by chemistry trends observed in relation to road de-icing salt and other saline sources. However, source differentiation between Carboniferous brines, entrapped post-glacial marine water and modern seawater cannot be made. Furthermore, Cl:Br ratios lower than those of seawater or regional brines suggest an origin related to the diagenesis of organic-rich sediment and that the groundwater may be influenced by local low permeability units. Combined spatial, statistical and chemical analysis shows that, while trace or low levels of methane, &lt;1 mg/L, are found ubiquitously throughout the Maritimes Basin, elevated concentrations, &gt;1 mg/L, are associated with the Horton Group, consistent with it being the host and inferred source of ONG resources in the province. The highest methane concentrations (14–29 mg/L)were detected in the region with a complex history of cycles of uplift and erosion which, in some locations, resulted in the juxtaposition at the surface of the Horton Group with several other groups of the Maritimes Basin. It is thought that proximity to the Horton Group can lead to naturally high methane concentrations in non-ONG-bearing units. © 2019 The Authors","Geochemistry; Maritimes Basin; PERMANOVA; Principal component analysis (PCA); R; Shale gas","Chemical analysis; Exploratory geochemistry; Geochemistry; Groundwater; Groundwater geochemistry; Hydrochemistry; Methanation; Methane; Multivariant analysis; Natural gas deposits; Natural gas wells; Oil field development; Seawater; Shale gas; Topography; Elevated concentrations; Groundwater composition; Maritimes Basin; Methane concentrations; Multivariate statistical method; Multivariate statistics; PERMANOVA; Source differentiations; Principal component analysis; arsenic; bromine; chlorine; dissolved oxygen; ground water; iron; manganese; methane; natural gas; nitrate; sea water; sodium chloride; trace metal; well water; concentration (composition); methane; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; shale gas; water chemistry; well water; aquifer; Article; Canada; Carboniferous; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); conceptual framework; controlled study; diagenesis; environmental erosion; geochemistry; geography; geology; inorganic chemistry; multivariate analysis; permutational statistics; principal component analysis; priority journal; river basin; sediment; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; topography; water permeability; water quality; water supply; Canada; Maritime Provinces; New Brunswick",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064766835

Additionally, this paper analyses the effects on drivers’ stress levels after eco-driving.

A sequential method involving factor analysis, regression analysis and path analysis is used to analyze the sample. The results confirm that eco-driving is strongly affected by driving behavior like deceleration rate, RPM and speed, also showing that external factors as congestion and road slope have a direct influence on fuel consumption.

The experiment was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor with a continuous feeding system to investigate the effect of steam to biomass (S/B) molar ratio (0–0.4), K2CO3 loading amount (0–10 wt%) and reaction temperature (650–850 °C) as three main factors. The experimental results clearly indicated that both S/B and K2CO3 loadings promoted hydrogen production which could reach from 56 to 66% progressively as temperature increased from 650 to 750 °C, the role of potassium carbonate was mainly to change the path of catalytic cracking of tar and reduce the carbon deposit on the surface of the catalyst. While the role of water vapor mainly promoted shifting the reforming reaction in the direction of hydrogen generation. In addition, the water vapor itself could react with carbon to generate more hydrogen. The synergy of K2CO3 modification and steam reforming alleviated the deposited char and changed the components of tar simultaneously, and the optimum value for hydrogen production was acquired with 7.5% K2CO3 loading biomass while the value of S/B was 0.3 as the result of K2CO3 modification. The yield of rich-hydrogen syngas at 650 °C was similar with that of 850 °C, which evidenced that K2CO3 promoted the cracking of biomass at the low temperature region. It was concluded that K2CO3 modification of wood biomass with steam reforming promoted the hydrogen production and changed the path of catalytic cracking of tar and reduced the carbon deposit on the surface of the catalyst.

Therefore, the Co species which could interact with the H+ are removed by acid treatment to inhibit the HER. In addition, after completely removing the surface Co species, the adsorption of CO2 and transfer of electron to CO2 is successfully impoved. Therefore, the catalytic performance of CO2RR is successfully adjusted.A series of Co@N-C materials are synthesized from pyrolysis of ZIF-67 at different temperatures and employed as catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to syngas. Through a systematical investigation of the relationship between structure of Co@N-C catalysts and their catalytic activity, it could be found that the Co species exposed on the material surface mainly promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process to produce H2, while the Co particles packaged by N-C skeleton provide electrons and transfer them to CO2 molecule through the Co-N-C skeleton, promoting the CO2 reduction reaction. Following this thinking, the pristine Co@N-C materials are treated by aqua regia to remove the surface exposed Co species. After acid treatment, the affinity of H species sharply decreases, and adsorption of CO2 and transfer of electron to CO2 are successfully improved. The acid-treated Co@N-C catalysts exhibit improved catalytic activity, faradic efficiency of CO, and stability in CO2RR process.

To date, most emission studies are limited to a few vehicles, making a statistically significant assessment of control options difficult, especially under real-world driving conditions. Exhaust emissions of 234 individual city buses were measured under real-world stop-and-go traffic conditions at a bus stop in Gothenburg, Sweden. The buses comprised models fulfilling Euro III-VI and EEV (Enhanced Environmentally Friendly Vehicle) standards with different engine technologies, fuels, and exhaust after-treatment systems, and also included hybrid-electric buses (HEV). Both gaseous (NOx, CO, HC, and SO2) and size-resolved particle number (PN) and mass (PM) emission factors (EF) were calculated for vehicles using compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel (DSL), Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) and Hydro-treated Vegetable Oil (HVO) equipped with various after-treatment technologies, e.g., diesel particulate filter (DPF), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems. The highest median EFPN was obtained from Euro VHEV-HVO-SCR buses (MdEFPN = 18×1014 # kg-1) when their combustion engines were used though 53% of their accelerations were below detection limits indicating the use of their electrical engine. The highest MdEFPM was obtained from the Euro V-DSL-SCR buses (MdEFPM = 150 mg kg-1) and the lowest from EEV-CNG buses (below detection threshold) and Euro VIHEV-HVO- SCR+EGR+DPF buses (MdEFPM = 19 mg kg-1). The highest MdEFNOx was obtained from the Euro V-RME-SCR (MdEFNOx = 30 g kg-1) and Euro VHEV-HVO-SCR buses (MdEFNOx = 24 g kg-1), and the lowest from CNG buses (MdEFNOx = 4.8 g kg-1) and Euro VIHEV-HVO-SCR+EGR+DPF buses (MdEFNOx = 7.4 g kg-1). Hybrid buses can give higher PN emissions compared to traditional diesel engines, likely due to downsized combustion engines. Replacing diesel by biodiesel fuel reduced MdEFPM significantly but increased MdEFNOx which may be due to the higher combustion temperature and oxygen contents of the fuel (for RME). Overall, the EEV-CNG buses performed the best regarding both the MdEF and low contribution to the high emitters.

A promising strategy for improving activity is to achieve a high density of homogeneously dispersed atomic defects; however, this is seldom accomplished in metals. We hypothesize that vacancy-rich catalysts could be obtained through the synthesis of quantum dots (QDs) and their electrochemical reduction during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Here, we report that QD-derived catalysts (QDDCs) with up to 20 vol % vacancies achieve record current densities of 16, 19, and 25 mAcm−2 with high faradic efficiencies in the electrosynthesis of formate, carbon monoxide, and ethylene at low potentials of –0.2, –0.3, and –0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. The materials are stable after 80 hr of CO2RR. These CO2RR performances in aqueous solution surpass those of previously reported catalysts by 2×. Together, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and computational studies reveal that the vacancies produce a local atomic and electronic structure that enhances CO2RR. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Using renewable electricity to convert CO2 into value-added carbon-based products and feedstocks simultaneously addresses the needs for storage of intermittent renewable energy sources and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We report record current densities with high faradic efficiencies in the electrosynthesis of formate, carbon monoxide, and ethylene at the low applied potentials through the synthesis of quantum-dot-derived catalysts (QDDCs). The QDDCs maximize the density and stability of vacancies in metallic nanocrystals and thus the catalytic activity and stability. The catalysts show excellent stability without deactivation after more than 80 h of operation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.A high density of homogeneously dispersed atomic defects has long been believed to be a promising strategy for improving catalytic activity. Taking the defective nature of quantum dots, Liu et al. synthesize vacancy-rich metal nanocrystals through in situ electrochemical reduction of quantum dots.

After the aerosol pollution with fine aerosol particles less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) accumulates to a certain extent in Beijing and its vicinity (BIV), boundary-layer (BL) meteorological conditions worsen due to radiative cooling effects of aerosols, which further facilitate PM2.5 accumulation. This “two-way feedback mechanism” between unfavorable metrological conditions and cumulative PM2.5, particularly PM2.5 explosive growth with mass concentration doubled in several to 10 h, has been found in BIV. To investigate whether the two-way feedback exists on the southern NCP, we selected four representative cities with radiosonde observations, which lie south of Beijing and used PM2.5 data, radiation observations, and radiosonde data from December 2016 to the beginning of January 2017. We found that the two-way feedback existed in these four cities. In each city, HPEs included transport stages (TSs), during which relative strong winds transport pollutants into different regions, and cumulative stages (CSs), in which temperature inversions occur and became striking due to the radiative cooling effects of elevated aerosols under slight or calm winds. This would further cause an increase of PM2.5 concentration. During the CSs, growth of PM2.5 concentration was governed by the two-way feedback, which explained over 70% of the increase. During HPEs, warm and humid advection, topographic wind, longwave radiation at night were conducive to the inversion at the beginning of HPEs, but not dominant with respect to anomalous inversion in CSs. In addition, with the presence of supersaturated layers, aerosol would enter the cloud-fog system, which would reduce observed PM2.5 mass concentration to a certain degree. © 2019 The Author(s)","Heavy aerosol pollution episodes; Meteorological factor contribution; Two-way feedback","Aerosols; Air pollution; Boundary layers; Feedback control; Radiative Cooling; Radiosondes; Feedback mechanisms; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; PM2.5 concentration; Pollution episodes; Radiosonde observations; Temperature inversions; Two ways; Atmospheric movements; aerosol; air temperature; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; cooling; environmental factor; longwave radiation; meteorology; particulate matter; radiosonde; two-dimensional modeling; urban pollution; advection; aerosol; article; China; city; cooling; feedback system; meteorology; night; pollutant; radiation; Beijing [China]; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063680108

A salient feature of water and energy services in megacities is that they are supported by a web of regional infrastructure, extending far beyond the geographic boundaries of the cities, resulting in a strong dependence on resources imported from outside. Understanding the WEN of megacities has implications not only for more efficient resource utilization but also for synergistic regional development and corporation. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the WEN of Beijing within and beyond its geographic boundaries. Results show that water for local internal energy production and transformation accounts for 220 million m3/year, or 5.6% of its total freshwater use in 2016, and the energy for local water abstraction, supply, and treatment is 3.06 billion kWh, accounting for 1.1% of its total energy consumption for the same year. The external water for ""imported"" energy is 290 million m3/year, 1.3 times of Beijing's freshwater use for internal energy. This means that more water for energy is consumed outside Beijing than that within Beijing. The energy for external water is negligible because the bulk of the water transfer into Beijing relies on gravity and because the energy for construction of the transfer infrastructure is not included. Analysis of the WEN revealed the contradiction between the two independently conceived policies of Beijing: to meet the ""three-red-line"" target in the water sector, recycled water and transferred water use will rise, making it more difficult to meet the carbon emission control targets. Therefore, adopting low energy intensity, nature-based water recycling is a wise policy choice.

Heavy-duty diesel engines retrofitted to NG spark ignition (SI) can achieve higher efficiencies and low NOX, CO, and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions when operated under lean-burn conditions. To investigate the SI lean-burn combustion phenomena in a bowl-in-piston combustion chamber, a conventional heavy-duty direct-injection CI engine was converted to SI operation by replacing the fuel injector with a spark plug and by fumigating NG in the intake manifold. Steady-state engine experiments and numerical simulations were performed at several operating conditions that changed spark timing (ST), engine speed, and mixture equivalence ratio. Results suggested a two-zone NG combustion inside the diesel-like combustion chamber. More frequent and significant late-burn (including double-peak heat release rate) was observed for advanced ST. This was due to the chamber geometry affecting the local flame speed, which resulted in a faster and thicker flame in the bowl but a slower and thinner flame in the squish volume. Good combustion stability (COVIMEP < 3%), moderate rate of pressure-rise, and lack of knocking showed promise for heavy-duty CI engines converted to NG SI operation. © 2019 by ASME.",,"Combustion chambers; Direct injection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gas transportation; Petroleum transportation; Combustion stability; Equivalence ratios; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Higher efficiency; Lean-burn combustion; Lean-burn conditions; Operating condition; Transportation sector; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061366030

Air pollution control devices (APCDs)are widely used in coal-fired power plants (CFPPs)to reduce pollutant emissions including Hg. To gain insight into the Hg isotopic fractionation produced by APCDs, the Hg isotopic compositions of feed coal (FC)samples and combustion byproducts from 7 CFPP utility boilers in Hebei Province of China were studied. Significant mass-dependent fractionation (MDF)was observed in combustion byproducts when comparing with FC samples, while mass-independent fractionation (MIF)was not identified. Compared to FC samples, no significant difference in bottom ash (BA, δ202HgBA-FC = 0.08 ± 0.16‰, 1SD, n = 3)samples while light isotopes were enriched in fly ash (FA, δ202HgFA-FC = −0.38 ± 0.75‰, 1SD, n = 7)samples. Boilers lacking of a selective catalytic reducer (SCR)unit produced gypsum (GY)samples with negative MDF signatures compared to FC samples (δ202HgGY-FC, no SCR = −0.22 ± 0.10‰, 1SD, n = 3). In contrast, boilers equipped with a SCR unit produced GY samples with higher MDF signatures (δ202HgGY-FC, SCR = 0.54 ± 0.40‰, 1SD, n = 3), probably as a result of the oxidation of Hg0 in the SCR unit.

Based on this methodology, the annual variance and composition of carbon sequestration, GHG emissions and net carbon sequestration were analyzed for the first stage of the Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project (BTSSCP) (2001–2010) in the respective project provinces. The total carbon sequestration in the BTSSCP from 2001 to 2010 was 71.25–71.66 Tg C, and the additional GHG emissions from the BTSSCP were 7.28–7.50 Tg Ce, which counteracted 10.2–10.5% of the sequestered carbon. Among the different project measures in their corresponding ecosystems, the counteraction effect of grassland management in the grassland ecosystem was over 50%, which was much higher than that of afforestation and the conversion of cropland to forest. The net carbon sequestration in the BTSSCP was 63.75–64.38 Tg Ce, and the annual average was 6.38–6.44 Tg Ce·yr −1 . The annual rate of net carbon mitigation for Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia was 1.16–1.17, 1.29–1.30, 1.06–1.07, 0.85–0.86 and 0.63–0.65 t Ce·ha −1 ·yr −1 , respectively.

Using highly detailed data on European new vehicle registrations from 2002 through 2010, I estimate the effects of fuel costs and vehicle taxes on consumer vehicle choices. The CO2-based vehicle taxes reduce CO2 emissions but increase NOx and particulates emissions. The environmental harms from the NOx and particulates emissions roughly offset the benefits of the lower CO2 emissions.

The literature has disagreed on the role of storage in reducing emissions. In this paper we present a stylized model, which suggests that the effect of storage costs on emissions depends on the supply responsiveness of both fossil and renewable generators. Under common conditions in the United States, lower storage costs are more likely to reduce emissions when wind investment responds to equilibrium electricity prices and when solar investment does not. Simulations of a computational model of grid investment and operation confirm these intuitions.

The discovery of lead-free, non-toxic halide materials with efficient blue light emission is promising for practical light-emitting applications. Here, we have discovered a series of highly blue-emissive all-inorganic Cu(I)-containing rare-earth halide compounds in the solid state at room temperature.

In this compound, two Cu(I) ions are connected to three rare-earth halide octahedra to form a paddle-wheel-like cluster.

In our previous study, graphene oxide coated with magnetite (GO-Fe3O4) was capable of removing chlorpheniramine in deionized water by adsorption. This study investigated the removal of chlorpheniramine and its nitrosamine formation potentials (FPs) by adsorption onto magnetic GO-Fe3O4, with respect to the influence by using real municipal wastewaters as the background. In the results, the adsorption performances of chlorpheniramine in wastewaters decreased in the order: GO-Fe3O4 suspension &gt; GO-Fe3O4 particles &gt; activated carbon. Chlorpheniramine adsorptions on GO-Fe3O4 particles and activated carbon were reduced by using real wastewaters as the background, whereas chlorpheniramine adsorption on GO-Fe3O4 suspension was enhanced due to the effects of surface charge on GO-Fe3O4 and ionic strength variation in water. The fittings of adsorption isotherms indicated that the wastewater background reduced the surface heterogeneity of GO-Fe3O4 suspension and improved the adsorption performance. Appreciable removal efficiencies of NDMA and other nitrosamine FPs were observed when GO-Fe3O4 particles were added in real wastewaters. However, when chlorpheniramine was present in wastewaters, chlorpheniramine adsorption and degradation reaction simultaneously occurred on the surface of GO-Fe3O4, increasing NDMA and other nitrosamine FPs in wastewaters after GO-Fe3O4 addition for chlorpheniramine adsorption. The assumption was further demonstrated by observing the NDMA-FP increase during chlorpheniramine adsorption on GO-Fe3O4 in deionized water. GO-Fe3O4 is a potential adsorbent for chlorpheniramine removal. Nevertheless, the low treatment efficiencies at high doses limit its application for nitrosamine FP adsorptions in real wastewaters. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adsorption; Chlorpheniramine; Formation potential; Graphene oxide; Magnetite; Nitrosamine","activated carbon; adsorption; chemical pollutant; chemical reaction; degradation; detection method; drug; iron oxide; isotherm; magnetite; oxidation; pollutant removal; wastewater; wastewater treatment; chlorpheniramine; dimethylnitrosamine; graphene oxide; graphite; magnetite; nitrosamine; adsorption; chemistry; disinfection; isolation and purification; procedures; water management; water pollutant; Adsorption; Chlorpheniramine; Dimethylnitrosamine; Disinfection; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Graphite; Nitrosamines; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066034678

The carbon trading system is used to demonstrate the environmental and economic value of forests. The forest carbon sequestrations are estimated and predicted in different regions of China. Furthermore, a market model has been established to assess how the emission reduction costs can be reduced among all regions by the year 2030 to achieve the goal of carbon emissions intensity in China. The results show that carbon sequestration trades can reduce the emissions reduction costs and it can represent the value of forest carbon sinks. In particular, when economic growth is maintained in moderate and low level in China, the national carbon trading market with carbon sequestration will decrease the carbon emissions reduction costs more effectively.

The analysis shows that, among 60–90% of urbanized countries, spatially dispersed urbanized countries (e.g., countries with many medium-sized cities scattered over the territory) show a lower national transportation CO2 emission than spatially polarized urbanized countries (e.g., there are only a few large cities). The urban system elasticity of transportation CO2 emissions is 0.4 or 0.6. That is, if the degree of polarization decreases by 1%, national transportation CO2 emissions decrease by approximately 0.4–0.6%. This effect is similar to the effect of GDP per capita of around 0.5%. Because it is particularly difficult to disperse people and economic activities across a country once spatial polarization is set, this study's findings have the most significant implications for urbanizing countries. If urbanizing countries adopt national urban policy and territorial plans to form dispersed cities, it could reduce transportation carbon emissions and promote sustainable development. For already urbanized countries, national urban policy development is recommended to promote spatially dispersed rather than polarized national urban systems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; National transportation CO2 emission; National urban policy; National urban system; Spatial distribution of cities; STIRPAT; Sustainable development; Territorial planning; Urban analytics","Big data; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Environmental protection; NASA; Planning; Polarization; Population statistics; Spatial distribution; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Urban growth; CO2 emissions; Stirpat; Territorial planning; Urban analytics; Urban policy; Urban systems; Urban transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data acquisition; global perspective; Gross Domestic Product; policy development; pollutant transport; spatial distribution; sustainable development; territorial planning; urban area; urban system; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065666966

We tested the strategy on data deriving from a three months survey at a residential site in proximity to an integral cycle steel plant in Trieste (NE Italy). We were able to identify four clusters representing recurrent PM class profiles whose meaning has been interpreted and confirmed by correlation to “external data”, i.e. data not used to build the model, registered by other devices (meteorological and pollutant monitoring stations). The four clusters were found to be related to two different plant type of emissions (sources) and to two different site background profiles, respectively. The powerful visualization features of SOM map allowed to describe and characterize the variability of size distribution of PM in a concise form. The clustered SOM being built for one measuring station, proved to be helpful for the analysis of OPC data collected at another location close to the industrial plant. Moreover, occasional episodes of Saharan dusts could be identified as outliers with respect to local particulate and discussed in terms of size distribution. Eventually, by means of an animated graph, we propose a method to visualize the PM experimental data evolution during the day using the PM cluster profiles as a legend. © 2019","Ambient air; Optical particle counter; Particulate matter; Pattern recognition; Self-Organizing Map","air monitoring; air pollutant; algorithm; ambient air; analytic method; Article; cluster analysis; correlational study; data analysis; dust; experimental study; industrial waste; meteorology; optics; particle size; priority journal; statistical model; suspended particulate matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066268723

It has been proved that tanshinone IIA (tan IIA) could alleviate pathological symptoms of AD via improving non-amyloidogenic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, decreasing the accumulations of p-tau and amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ1–42), and so forth. However, the further biochemical mechanisms of tan IIA are not clear. The experiment was undertaken to explore metabolites of tan IIA in AD rats induced by microinjecting Aβ1-42 in the CA1 region of hippocampus. AD rats were orally administrated with tan IIA at 100 mg/kg weight, and plasma, urine, faeces, kidney, liver and brain were then collected for metabolites analysis by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Qrbitrap mass spectrometry. Consequently, a total of 37 metabolites were positively or putatively identified on the basis of mass fragmentation behavior, accurate mass measurements and retention times. As a result, methylation, hydroxylation, dehydration, decarbonylation, reduction reaction, glucuronidation, glycine linking and their composite reactions were characterized to illuminate metabolic pathways of tan IIA in vivo. Several metabolites presented differences in the distribution of tan IIA between the sham control and the AD model group. Overall, these results provided valuable references for research on metabolites of tan IIA in vivo and its probable active structure for exerting neuroprotection. © 2019 by the authors.","Alzheimer’s disease; Hippocampus; Metabolic pathway; Morris water maze test; Passive avoidance test; Rat model; Tanshinone IIA; UHPLC-Q-Exactive Qrbitrap mass spectrometry","amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); peptide fragment; tanshinone; administration and dosage; Alzheimer disease; animal; chemistry; disease model; high performance liquid chromatography; hippocampal CA1 region; male; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; oral drug administration; pharmacokinetics; procedures; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; Abietanes; Administration, Oral; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Disease Models, Animal; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics; Peptide Fragments; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069728281

Herein, a universal combination strategy (solid-state reaction at room temperature followed by chemical activation) to prepare ultrahigh surface area porous carbons has been developed. The specific surface area can reach to 3775 m2/g even at a very low KOH/char ratio (0.19), and the morphologies, specific surface and pore size distributions of the products can be simply tuned by the KOH/char ratios. We found the solid-state reaction at room temperature prior to chemical activation is an efficient way to achieve the even dispersion of the activating agent and thus improve the utilization of KOH greatly. As a typical example, the as-obtained EDTA-3 K not only have an ultrahigh specific surface area up to 3614 m2/g, but also deliver a large total pore volume of 2.09 m3/g. Benefited from the ultrahigh specific surface area, hierarchically porous structure and unique morphology, the EDTA-3 K based supercapacitor exhibits excellent capacitive performance in both KOH and Li2SO4 electrolyte. Hence, this study not only exploits a new approach for the synthesis of hierarchically porous carbon materials with ultrahigh specific surface area for electrochemical energy storage applications, but also provides a universal combination strategy to improve the utilization ratio of activating reagent for the producing of porous carbons. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Carbon; Dispersions; Electrolytes; Lithium compounds; Morphology; Pore size; Porous materials; Potassium hydroxide; Solid state reactions; Specific surface area; Supercapacitor; Activating reagents; Capacitive performance; Combination strategies; Electrochemical energy storage; Hierarchically porous; Hierarchically porous carbons; Solid-state reaction at room temperatures; Supercapacitor application; Chemical activation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068821535

With data from 191 stations in China, this study investigated the applicability of some commonly used single-site precipitation occurrence and amount models. The data represent diverse climate conditions in terms of mean monthly wet days of 1–21.5 days and mean annual precipitation amount of 15.5–2631.3 mm. The stochastic models represent multiple model complexity including four occurrence models (the first-, second-, and third-order Markov Chain and semi-empirical distribution) and five amount models (the 2-parameter Gamma and Weibull distribution, the 3-parameter skewed normal and mixed exponential distribution, and 21-parameter semi-empirical distribution). Overall, the models do not perform better with increasing model complexity, especially for occurrence models. The first-order Markov chain and the mixed exponential distribution outperform the other models for occurrence and amount simulation, respectively. However, model performance varies with climate conditions. The semi-empirical distribution and the mixed exponential distribution are respectively recommended for occurrence and amount generation in dry climates, while the first-order Markov chain for occurrence simulation and the skewed normal distribution for amount generation are better for wet climate conditions.

Based on the wide range and real time data, remote sensing was widely employed in drought monitoring. Many researchers have proposed a series of drought monitoring methods based on MODIS data over the past few decades. The AquaCrop model was released by FAO, which is suitable for crop growth monitoring in arid area with its simple interface, less input parameters and good simulation effect. AquaCrop model was applied to the researches on climate change, irrigation strategy, planting management and so on. Many scholars have verified the efficiency of AquaCrop model in arid areas of China. Since AquaCrop model is driven by water, it is reasonable to use it to monitor and reflect the drought process. This study was based on Terra-MODIS data products and agro-meteorological data during the year of 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 of Winter Wheat growth periods in Henan Province. In this study, firstly, localizing the AquaCrop by the simulated and observed Canopy Cover (CC), Biomass (B), Yield (Y) and 0-50cm Soil Water Content (SWC). The values between observed and simulated have good consistency, with R2 = 0.9289 of CC, R2 =0.9418 of B, R2 = 0.8309 of SWC. Meanwhile, the simulation results of four growth stages of winter wheat show that the model has good applicability and stability in Henan Province. Secondly, calculating TVDI using MODIS data in the same time range. Finally, analyzing the correlation between the results of two models and observed soil water content in different depth of soil layers. Similarly, the simulation accuracy of two models are better with shallow soil moisture. MODIS TVDI has a highest correlation with 30cm soil water content (r= -0.344), while AquaCrop model with 10cm (r=0.819). The research can provide important reference for drought monitoring of winter wheat and it is helpful for effective agriculture drought monitoring and decision-making. © 2019 IEEE.","AquaCrop model; Drought monitoring; MODIS TVDI","Arid regions; Climate change; Crops; Decision making; Drought; Food supply; Monitoring; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Agriculture droughts; Agro-meteorological data; Drought monitoring; Input parameter; MODIS TVDI; Simulation accuracy; Simulation effects; Soil water content; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072910738

Understanding the governing parameters of fuel sprays is essential for the advancement of fuel direct-injection technologies and further improvement of engine performance. However, the effect of the ambient temperature on fuel sprays has not been fully understood yet, especially for flash-boiling spray which is common under some representative engine conditions. In this study, the effects of the ambient temperature on spray characteristics under both non-flash-boiling and flash-boiling conditions were investigated using Mie scattering techniques, and the correlations between spray characteristics and dimensionless numbers were established to study the effects of governing parameters on fuel sprays. The results show that the evaporation of fuel spray was enhanced as the ambient temperature was elevated. In addition, increasing the ambient temperature could enhance the collapse of multi-hole fuel spray under flash-boiling conditions. Such observations indicate that increasing the ambient temperature has a similar effect on the collapse of fuel sprays, compared with decreasing the superheat index (Pa/Ps) of the fuel injected. Therefore, in this study, the effect of ambient temperature on the local superheat degree of fuel spray was accounted for. A universal correlation between spray penetration and the equivalent original superheat index was then found, incorporating the effects from both ambient temperature and superheat index. The formulation introduced above was found to significantly extend the scope of the previous research and provides useful information for the design of fuel injection systems.

This work, with the example of the model used in the updated version of the weather@home distributed climate model framework, shows the potential for improving climate model simulations through a multiphased parameter refinement approach, particularly over the northwestern United States (NWUS). Each phase consists of (1) creating a perturbed parameter ensemble with the coupled global-regional atmospheric model, (2) building statistical emulators that estimate climate metrics as functions of parameter values, (3) and using the emulators to further refine the parameter space. The refinement process includes sensitivity analyses to identify the most influential parameters for various model output metrics; results are then used to cull parameters with little influence. Three phases of this iterative process are carried out before the results are considered to be satisfactory; that is, a handful of parameter sets are identified that meet acceptable bias reduction criteria. Results not only indicate that 74% of the NWUS regional warm biases can be reduced by refining global atmospheric parameters that control convection and hydrometeor transport, as well as land surface parameters that affect plant photosynthesis, transpiration, and evaporation, but also suggest that this iterative approach to perturbed parameters has an important role to play in the evolution of physical parameterizations. © 2019 Author(s).",,"atmospheric modeling; climate change; climate modeling; convection; ensemble forecasting; hydrometry; Northern Hemisphere; parameterization; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069199548

Besides, the rapid development of the city consumes a large amount of energy, and the sequent carbon dioxide emissions accelerate the process. This paper studies the relationship between industrial types and CO2 emissions based on DMSP-OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System) nighttime light data in different cities and the urban carbon emissions are estimated and spatialized. The correlation between the corrected DMSP-OLS and CO2 emissions from light manufacturing cities, service-based cities, and high-tech cities overmatch the energy production cities, heavy manufacturing cities. China's urban carbon emissions have a high-value cluster in East China and North China, and a low-value cluster in the southwestern region of China. It is also proved that secondary industry's share in GDP is a more important impact factor to CO2 emission than the GDP and population, suggesting that the urban industrial structure should be payed prime attention to when putting hands to carbon emission reduction. © 2019 IEEE.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Industrial structure; Nighttime light data; Spatial analysis","Carbon dioxide process; Emission control; Geology; Global warming; Manufacture; Remote sensing; Sea level; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission reductions; Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Energy productions; Environmental problems; Industrial structures; Night-time lights; Spatial analysis; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077676616

This paper quantifies the impact of subway expansion on air quality by leveraging fine-scale air quality data and the rapid build-out of 14 new subway lines and 252 stations in Beijing from 2008 to 2016. Our main empirical framework examines how the density of the subway network affects air quality across different locations in the city during this period. To address the potential endogenous location of subway stations, we construct an instrument based on historical subway planning, long before air pollution and traffic congestion were of concern. Our analysis shows that an increase in subway density by one standard deviation improves air quality by two percent and the result is robust to a variety of alternative specifications including the distance-based difference-in-differences method. The total discounted health benefit during a 20-year period from reduced mortality and morbidity as a result of 14 new subway lines amounts to $1.0–3.1 billion, or only 1.4–4.4 percent of the total construction and operating cost. © 2019 The Authors","Air quality; Subway; Traffic congestion","Air quality; Railroads; Subway stations; Subways; Air quality data; Difference-in-differences; Distance-based; Health benefits; Major cities; Standard deviation; Subway network; Subway systems; Traffic congestion; air quality; atmospheric pollution; empirical analysis; morbidity; public health; quantitative analysis; traffic congestion; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067581110

This paper is the first effort of proposing a modelling assessment of CO2-EOR and storage in the HZ2-1 oilfield in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in northern South China Sea offshore Guangdong Province. We attempt to couple the multi-parameter dimensionless quick screening model and reservoir compositional simulation for optimization of site screen and injection simulation. Through the quick screening, the reservoirs are ranked by EOR dimensionless recovery RD, and by CO2 storage in pore volume SCO2. Our results indicate that SCO2 is highly pressure dependent and not directly related to RD. Of these reservoirs, CO2-EOR and storage potential of the M10 was estimated through a compositional simulation as a case study based on a 3D geological model. Nine scenarios of CO2 injection operations have been simulated for 20 years with different well patterns and injection pressures. The simulation results represent an obvious improvement in oil production by CO2 flooding over No−CO2 production. The best operation for M10 is miscible CO2 flooding, which led to the higher recovery factors of 52%˜58% and CO2 stored masses of 8.1×106˜10.8×106t. The optimum operation for CO2 injection should be set well pattern in region of injector I1 and high injection pressure for miscible flooding. In a whole, the HZ21-1 field can be used as a candidate geological site for GDCCUS project. We are fully aware of the limitation in the primary modelling including reservoir and fluid properties and production history matching, and regard this study as a general and hypothetic proposal. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 storage; CO2-EOR; Compositional simulation; Offshore HZ21-1oilfield; Quick screening","3D modeling; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Floods; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Geology; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Oil well flooding; 3-d geological models; CO2 storage; CO2-EOR; Compositional simulations; Enhanced oil recovery; High injection pressures; Northern South China Sea; Pearl River Mouth basin; Enhanced recovery; carbon sequestration; emission control; enhanced oil recovery; fluid injection; hydrocarbon reservoir; offshore structure; oil field; reservoir flooding; simulation; China; Guangdong; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Zhujiangkou Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064938937

Previous work has examined co-benefits of climate policy from reducing PM2.5 in rapidly-developing countries such as China, but have not examined co-benefits from ozone and its transboundary impact for both PM2.5 and ozone. Here, we compare the air quality and health co-benefits of China's climate policy on both PM2.5 and ozone in China to their co-benefits in three downwind and populous countries (South Korea, Japan and the United States) using a coupled modeling framework. In a policy scenario consistent with China's pledge to peak CO2 emissions in approximately 2030, avoided premature deaths from ozone reductions are 54 300 (95% confidence interval: 37 100-71 000) in China in 2030, nearly 60% of those from PM2.5. Total avoided premature deaths in South Korea, Japan, and the US are 1200 (900-1600), 3500 (2800-4300), and 1900 (1400-2500), respectively. Total avoided deaths in South Korea and Japan are dominated by reductions in PM2.5-related mortality, but ozone plays a more important role in the US. Similar to co-benefits for PM2.5 in China, co-benefits of China's policy for ozone and for both pollutants in those downwind countries also rise with increasing policy stringency. © 2019 The Author(s).

EV can not only reduce the emission of polluted gases, but also reduce energy consumption. In order to ensure the reliability of the drive system of EV, it is very important to study the reliability of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module in the drive system. This study developed a method for swift calculation of power loss and junction temperature curves of an IGBT module of an EV inverter. The steps of proposed calculation method are as follows: (1) the mapping relation between the EV running state and the IGBT module on-state current and duty ratio was deduced; and (2) the power loss calculation model together with the thermal network model, the average power loss and junction temperature curve in each switching cycle were obtained. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, this study compared the calculations of the proposed method with Infineon's online simulation tool, and found that the difference in average power loss is 3.23 W, and the difference in junction temperature average is 7.65 °C. The differences between the results are within a reasonable range, which shows that the proposed model can be used as a quick, alternative method for calculating the IGBT module's power loss and junction temperature curves in the set driving process. Junction temperature periodic mean and amplitude extracted from the junction temperature curves can be used to calculate cumulative damage, which can be beneficial for IGBT lifetime prediction. In addition, this method can be used to analyze the influence of other relevant factors on power loss and junction temperature during the EV driving process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Average power loss; Electric vehicle; Insulated gate bipolar transistor module; Junction temperature; Switching cycle","Electric inverters; Electric vehicles; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); Average power; Electric vehicle inverters; Environmental pollution problem; Insulated gate bipolar transistor modules; Junction temperatures; Reduce energy consumption; Switching cycles; Thermal network models; Electric losses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063582364

To control the severe air pollution during the season, comprehensive regional joint-control strategies were implemented throughout a campaign. To evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies and to provide some insights into strengthening the regional joint-control mechanism, the influence of control measures on levels of air pollution was estimated with an integrated measurement-emission-modeling method. To determine the influence of meteorological conditions, and the control measures on the air quality, in a comprehensive study, the 2nd World Internet Conference was held during 16-18 December 2015 in Jiaxing City, Zhejiang province, in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. We first analyzed the air quality changes during four meteorological regimes and then compared the air pollutant concentrations before, during, and after the regulation under static meteorological conditions. Next, we conducted modeling scenarios to quantify the effects caused due to the air pollution control measures. We found that total emissions of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">SO2</span>, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NO<i>x</i></span>, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">PM2.5</span>, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Jiaxing were reduced by 56&thinsp;%, 58&thinsp;%, 64&thinsp;%, and 80&thinsp;%, respectively, while total emission reductions of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">SO2</span>, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">NO<i>x</i></span>, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">PM2.5</span>, and VOCs over the YRD region are estimated to be 10&thinsp;%, 9&thinsp;%, 10&thinsp;%, and 11&thinsp;%, respectively. Modeling results suggest that during the campaign from 8 to 18 December, <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">PM2.5</span> daily average concentrations decreased by 10&thinsp;<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">μ</span>g&thinsp;m<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-3</span> with an average decrease of 14.6&thinsp;%. Our implemented optimization analysis compared with previous studies also reveals that local emission reductions play a key role in air quality improvement, although it shall be supplemented by regional linkage. In terms of regional joint control, implementing pollution channel control 48&thinsp;h before the event is of most benefit in getting similar results.

However, their effects on natural ecosystems are largely unknown, in particular with different seasonal timing of the events and recurrence over multiple years. We conducted a 4 yr manipulative experiment to explore grassland response to heavy rainfall imposed in either the middle of, or late in, the growing season in Inner Mongolia, China. We measured hierarchical responses at individual, community and ecosystem levels. Surprisingly, above-ground biomass remained stable in the face of heavy rainfall, regardless of seasonal timing, whereas heavy rainfall late in the growing season had consistent negative impacts on below-ground and total biomass. However, such negative biomass effects were not significant for heavy rainfall in the middle of the growing season. By contrast, heavy rainfall in the middle of the growing season had greater positive effects on ecosystem CO2 exchanges, mainly reflected in the latter 2 yr of the 4 yr experiment. This two-stage response of CO2 fluxes was regulated by increased community-level leaf area and leaf-level photosynthesis and interannual variability of natural precipitation. Overall, our study demonstrates that ecosystem impacts of heavy rainfall events crucially depend on the seasonal timing and multiannual recurrence. Plant physiological and morphological adjustment appeared to improve the capacity of the ecosystem to respond positively to heavy rainfall. © 2019 The Authors.

Maximum covariance analysis (MCA) was applied to explore their possible coupled modes in space and time. The relative contribution of SO2 and NO2 to PM2.5 was then quantified via a statistical modeling scheme. The linear trends derived from the stratified data show that both PM2.5 and SO2 decreased significantly in northern China in terms of large values, indicating a fast reduction of high PM2.5 and SO2 loadings therein. The statistically significant coupled MCA mode between PM2.5 and SO2 indicated a possible spatiotemporal linkage between them in northern China, especially over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. Further statistical modeling practices revealed that the observed PM2.5 variations in northern China could be explained largely by SO2 rather than NO2 therein, given the estimated relatively high importance of SO2. In general, the evidence-based results in this study indicate a strong linkage between PM2.5 and SO2 in northern China in the past few years, which may help to better investigate the mechanisms behind severe haze pollution events in northern China. © 2019 by the authors.

Thirty cities have been designated as experimental sites to serve as models for future sponge city construction, as more than 80% of the built-up urban areas in China must reach the standards of sponge cities by 2030. Greening plants play an important role in sponge cities, and water-use efficiency (WUE) is a vital index to determine whether plants could adapt to and grow healthily in environments with water deficits. In this study, WUE of greening plants was quantified by measuring the stable carbon isotope fractionation. Suitable plants for the green spaces in Guyuan sponge city, in northern China, were selected based on their WUE, and the main factors affecting WUE were studied in four habitats within the city. Plant species identity had the greatest effect on WUE, while habitat and plant life form had lower effect, illustrating that WUE is a relatively stable and reliable index for the classification of plant species. We can improve the WUE and ecological function of green spaces in sponge cities by using isotope technology to select suitable plant species with high WUE. To our knowledge, this study is the first to select plant species for sponge city by using this method, providing a quick and scientific method for the selection of greening plants for future sponge cities.

Electricity systems in particular are being reconfigured with smart technologies to help integrate renewable generation, enhance energy efficiency, implement new forms of pricing, increase control and automation, and improve reliability. Many of these interventions are experimental, requiring real-world testing before wider diffusion. This testing often takes place in “urban living labs,” integrating urban residents as key actors in experimentation with goals for broader sustainability transitions. In this paper, I investigate one such urban living lab focused on smart grid research and demonstration in a residential neighbourhood in Austin, Texas. I develop a framework based in governmentality studies to critically interrogate urban experimentation. Findings suggest that the focus of experimentation devolves urban imperatives into individual responsibilities for socio-environmental change. Managing carbon emissions through energy efficiency, renewable energy, and conservation is promoted as a form of self-management, wherein households reconfigure everyday activities and/or adopt new technologies. At the same, sociotechnical interventions are shaped by technology companies, researchers, and policy-makers marking a central feature of contemporary urban entrepreneurialism. This skews the potential of active co-production, and instead relies on the delegation of responsibility for action to a constrained assemblage of smart technologies and smart users. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","entrepreneurialism; experimentation; governmentality; smart grid; Urban living lab","conceptual framework; entrepreneur; experiment; smart city; smart grid; sustainability; urban population; Austin [Texas]; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067604591

The hydrodynamically recycled association is composed of lenticular to continuous cross-laminated lime packstone-grainstone, heterolithic facies, and intraclastic grainstone conglomerate with intercalated calcareous mudrock. Sharp bedding contacts, abundant scours, ripple cross-lamination, oscillatory-current indicators, hummocky cross-bedding, and rounded clasts indicate recycling of the bottom sediments by storms and bottom currents above storm wave base (SWB). The pelagic association is composed of continuous lime packstone to grainstone and chalk beds with intercalated calcareous mudrock. Gradational contacts and planar lamination indicate dominant deposition by pelagic rain, but scour surfaces, coarsefine alternations, and ripple cross-laminae indicate the influence of bottom currents below SWB. Vertical shifts between the hydrodynamically recycled association, interpreted to represent storm agitation of the seafloor during falls in sea level, alternate with the pelagic association and define four sequence boundaries and three depositional sequences with a lower-order periodicity (third-order periodicity, ca. average 2.4 My). Sequence boundaries correspond approximately to member boundaries recognized by gamma-ray profiles. Spectral analysis reveals higher-frequency mudrock-carbonate cycles prominent in the pelagic association, likely resulting from Milankovitch climate forcing of planktonic carbonate productivity versus clay flux. Comparison of gamma-corrected spectra with absolute age constraints reveals that the Ernst Tinaja section (in Big Bend National Park) is less than 28% complete. This is interpreted to result from abundant depositional hiatuses and erosional gaps that occur at the bed scale and at member boundaries within and bounding the Eagle Ford Formation. We demonstrate that deep-marine pelagic deposits in epicratonic settings may be subject to a complex interaction of depositional processes including pelagic rain and recycling by bottom currents and wave-generated currents modulated by low-frequency sea-level fluctuation and high-frequency fluctuations in sediment supply. © 2019, SEPM.",,"Deposition; Fluid dynamics; Lime; Rain; Recycling; Scour; Sea level; Spectrum analysis; Storms; Big Bend National Park; Bottom sediments; Depositional process; Depositional sequences; High frequency fluctuations; Higher frequencies; Sea-level fluctuations; Sequence boundary; Gamma rays; conglomerate; depositional sequence; facies analysis; grainstone; hydrodynamics; mudstone; outcrop; sedimentation; Big Bend National Park; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070995556

In this context, carbon mineralization technology has received attention because of its high potential for carbon sequestration, environmental conservation, and economic market value. This project report introduces a national top-down approach for developing and implementing international technology cooperation in the Republic of Korea, focusing on carbon mineralization. The Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology (MSIT) leads international technology cooperation, identifies prominent climate technologies, and addresses scientific agendas to presidential meetings. The inter-ministerial bodies established the climate technology roadmap and masterplan for a climate change response. With the support of these inter-ministerial efforts, a National Strategic Project on carbon mineralization was developed by a presidential-level decision as a top-down approach. Furthermore, the demonstration of this technology was emphasized to enhance the possibility of success in commercialization.

We investigated the impact of substrate to inoculum (S/I) ratios, alkalinity sources (sodium bicarbonate and oyster shells), co-substrate mixing ratios and inoculum acclimation on HS-AcD of food waste, yard waste, and waste activated sludge using batch studies. Long-term HS-AcD performance was evaluated under the optimal conditions through a semi-continuous biodigester study with leachate recirculation. The digester with S/I = 1 using a mixture of crushed oyster shells and sodium bicarbonate as alkalinity sources had the highest methane yields (183 mL CH4/g VS). Addition of waste activated sludge to food waste and yard waste alleviated acidification (pH 6.86 ± 0.12) during the start-up period, which and improved digester stability. Mixtures with FW/YW/WAS = 0.8:1.7:0.5 had higher methane yields (134 ± 15 mL CH4/gVS) than mixtures with FW/YW/WAS = 1:1:1, but required a longer time (10 days) for self-recovery from volatile fatty acid inhibition. The use of an acclimated inoculum eliminated the lag time during start-up and produced 38% higher methane yield. In the semi-continuous biodigester, an average volatile solids reduction of 38% and methane yield of 186 mL/gVS was achieved. Improved performance in the semi-continuous biodigester compared with batch reactors was likely due to leachate recirculation, which can improve mass transfer of substrates to the microbial community. Digestate produced from HS-AcD of waste organics had a 1.7–2.3 fold higher nitrogen, similar phosphorous and 0.2–0.3 fold lower potassium content than commercially available bioorganic fertilizer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Biosolids; High-solids anaerobic digestion; Municipal solid waste; Solid state anaerobic digestion","Activated sludge process; Alkalinity; Anaerobic digestion; Batch reactors; Biogas; Biosolids; Carbonates; Mass transfer; Methane; Mixtures; Molluscs; Nitrogen fertilizers; pH; Shellfish; Sludge digestion; Sodium bicarbonate; Substrates; Volatile fatty acids; Anaerobic co-digestion; High-solids anaerobic digestion; Leachate recirculation; Microbial communities; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Solid-state anaerobic digestions; Volatile solids reductions; Waste activated sludges; Municipal solid waste; bicarbonate; biogas; methane; nitrogen; organic fertilizer; phosphorus derivative; potassium; volatile fatty acid; biofuel; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; biogas; biosolid; food waste; gas production; municipal solid waste; absorption lag time; acclimatization; acidification; activated sludge; agricultural inoculation; alkalinity; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic granular sludge; animal shell; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; food waste; leaching; microbial community; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); anaerobic growth; bioreactor; food; sewage; Ostreidae; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Food; Methane; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067860114

In Brazil, approximately 15% of the produced charcoal is discarded as charcoal fines, which are chemically similar to biochar. Therefore, we aimed to test charcoal fines as a strategy to increase soil carbon sequestration. Charcoal fines of hardwood Mimosa scabrella were incorporated into a Cambisol down to 10 cm (T1 = 0 and T4 = 40 Mg ha−1) in Southern Brazil. Soil samples were collected (0–30 cm) 20 months after charcoal amendment. Soil organic matter (SOM) acid extract, humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin fractions were separated. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from charcoal and SOM in T1 and T4 were obtained before and after 165 days of incubation under controlled conditions. Charcoal increased soil carbon as fulvic (10–20 cm) and humic acids (10–30 cm) and, especially, as humin (0–5 cm), which probably occurred due to the hydrophobic character of the charcoal. The 13C NMR spectra and mean residence times (MRT) measured from incubation essays indicated that the charred material decomposed relatively fast and MRT of T1 and T4 samples were similar. It follows that the charcoal fines underwent similar decomposition as SOM, despite the high charcoal dose applied to the soil and the high aryl C contribution (78%) to the total 13C intensity of the charcoal NMR spectra. © 2019 by the authors.","13C NMR; Field experiment; Incubation; Mean residence time; Slow pool",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070229530

Here, we provide global and regional probabilistic sea-level projections using conservative projections of glaciers and ice-sheets melting and a selection of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) delivering moderate thermal expansion. Our low-end sea-level projections are higher than previously estimated because they rely on modeling outcomes only, and do not add any expert judgement, aiming essentially at delivering more realistic upper tails. While there are good reasons to believe that our projections are excessively optimistic, they can be used as low-end sea-level projections in order to inform users with low aversion to uncertainty. Our low-end sea-level projection exceeds 0.5 m along most inhabited coasts by 2100 for business as usual greenhouse gas emissions (RCP8.5), which is relevant for adaptation practitioners as long as efficient climate change mitigation policies are not implemented. This means that without efficient climate mitigation, an acceleration of sea-level rise can hardly be avoided during the 21st century. © 2019 by the authors.","Probabilistic; Projections; Sea-level rise","Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Thermal expansion; Business-as-usual; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Probabilistic; Projections; Recent researches; Sea level rise; Sea level; adaptive management; business; CMIP; glacier dynamics; greenhouse gas; ice sheet; probability; sea level change; thermal expansion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073888008

Main St., Moscow, ID  83843, United States","Premise: Physiological responses to temperature extremes are considered strong drivers of species’ demographic responses to climate variability. Plants are typically classified as either avoiders or tolerators in their freezing-resistance mechanism, but a gradient of physiological-threshold freezing responses may exist among individuals of a species. Moreover, adaptive significance of physiological freezing responses is poorly characterized, particularly under warming conditions that relax selection on cold hardiness. Methods: Freezing responses were measured in winter and again for new foliage in spring for 14 populations of Artemisia tridentata collected throughout its range and planted in a warm common garden. The relationships of the freezing responses to survival were evaluated in the warm garden and in two colder gardens. Results: Winter and spring freezing resistance were not correlated and appeared to be under differing selection regimes, as evident in correlations with different population climate of origin variables. All populations resisted considerably lower temperatures in winter than in spring, with populations from more continental climates showing narrower freezing safety margins (difference in temperatures at which ice-nucleation occurs and 50% reduction in chlorophyll fluorescence occurs) in spring. Populations with greater winter freezing resistance had lower survivorship in the warmest garden, while populations with greater spring freezing resistance had lower survivorship in a colder garden. Conclusions: These survivorship patterns relative to physiological thresholds suggest excess freezing resistance may incur a survival cost that likely relates to a trade-off between carbon gain and freezing resistance during critical periods of moisture availability. This cost has implications for seed moved from cooler to warmer environments and for plants growing in warming environments. © Published 2019.

In 2016, the ICAO decided to implement a Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and in 2017 the EU decided on faster emission reductions in its Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which since 2012 includes the aviation sector. The effects of these policies on the expected development of air travel emissions from 2017 to 2030 have been analyzed. For the sample country Sweden, the analysis shows that when emissions reductions in other sectors are attributed to the aviation sector as a result of the EU ETS and CORSIA, carbon emissions are expected to reduce by −0.8% per year (however if non-CO2 emissions are included in the analysis, then emissions will increase). This is much less than what is needed to achieve the 2°C target. Our analysis of potential national aviation policy instruments shows that there are legally feasible options that could mitigate emissions in addition to the EU ETS and CORSIA. Distance-based air passenger taxes are common among EU Member States and through increased ticket prices these taxes can reduce demand for air travel and thus reduce emissions. Tax on jet fuel is an option for domestic aviation and for international aviation if bilateral agreements are concluded. A quota obligation for biofuels is a third option. Key policy insights Existing international climate policies for aviation will not deliver any major emission reductions. Policymakers who want to significantly push the aviation sector to contribute to meeting the 2°C target need to work towards putting in place tougher international policy instruments in the long term, and simultaneously implement temporary national policy instruments in the near-term. Distance-based air passenger taxes, carbon taxes on jet fuel and quota obligations for biofuels are available national policy options; if they are gradually increased, and harmonized with other countries, they can help to significantly reduce emissions. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

These materials are called functionally graded hardmetals and are characterized by increased wear resistance at set hardness. Three approaches to the development of functionally graded hardmetals that are implemented in Ukraine, Europe, and the USA are discussed. These approaches are based on one phenomenon, such as the migration of molten cobalt from one to another hardmetal region that differs in the size of tungsten carbide particles, liquid phase amount, and carbon content. The approaches differ by process features in preparing and sintering the samples that acquire a gradient structure. In addition, different methods to produce hardmetals with a gradient structure are described. New capabilities of the extrusion process for the production of parts with uneven cross-sectional structure are studied.

Although the relationship is well established locally, several intensely star-forming galaxies have been found whose [C ii] 158 $mu$m emission is either weak, absent, or spatially offset from the young stars. Here we present new ALMA data for the two most distant gravitationally lensed and spectroscopically confirmed galaxies, A2744-YD4 at z = 8.38 and MACS1149-JD1 at z = 9.11, both of which reveal intense [O iii] 88 $mu$m emission. In both cases we provide stringent upper limits on the presence of [C ii] 158 $mu$m with respect to [O iii] 88 $mu$m.

Few empirical studies have considered how dairy farmers and/or their advisors are interpreting and responding to climate impacts, risks, and opportunities in these regions. This study investigates dairy farmer and advisor views and decisions related to climate change using data from seven farmer and advisor focus groups conducted in New York and Wisconsin. The study examined how farmers and advisors perceived climate impacts on dairy farms, the practices they are adopting, and how perceived risks and vulnerability affect farmers' decision making related to adaptation strategies. Although dairy farmers articulated concern regarding climate impacts, other business pressures, such as profitability, market conditions, government regulations, and labor availability were often more critical issues that affected their decision making. Personal experience with extreme weather and seasonal changes affected decision making. The findings from this study provide improved understanding of farmers' needs and priorities, which can help guide land-grant researchers, Extension, and policymakers in their efforts to develop and coordinate a comprehensive strategy to address climate change impacts on dairy in the Northeast and the Midwest US. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Advisors; Climate change; Dairy; Farmers; Impacts; Perceptions; Resiliency; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; dairy farming; decision making; policy making; risk perception; strategic approach; vulnerability; Midwest; New York [United States]; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068639211

Climate has a dynamic structure, and climate change is caused either by natural or anthropogenic effects. Meteorological parameters are routinely recorded by national weather stations. In this study, climate variability was analyzed in a mid-populated city in the middle of the Anatolian Peninsula. Humidity, temperature, precipitation, open surface evaporation, and solar radiation records over 57-year period from 1960 to 2016 were considered. The increase in temperature and solar radiation was obvious. The increase rates were 0.05 °C and 0.62 W/m2 for temperature and solar radiation, respectively. Relative humidity showed a declining trend from 64 to 53%. This study also aimed to evaluate the climate change of planetary boundary layer development, which influences air quality level. AERMET, which is the AERMOD meteorological preprocessor was exploited in order to simulate the planetary boundary layer height, and twice daily upper air soundings, wind speed, wind direction, ambient temperature, and cloud cover have been used as minimum required parameters. The complete meteorological data available were between 2006 and 2016; for that reason, the boundary layer was calculated for 11 years.

The carbon accumulation in soils is related to the texture of their mineral horizons and biotic factors, such as the quality of litter and activity of earthworms. The forests on sandy soils were characterized by a high carbon stock in the plant litter, which is explained by the low biomass of earthworms. The carbon content was significantly higher in the mineral horizons of loamy soils owing to high share of fine particles. The carbon stock in the litter and mineral horizons of loamy and sandy soils turned out to be comparable, except for the sandy soils of mixed forests due to higher clay content. In the course of succession of the coniferous-deciduous forests on the loamy soil, the carbon accumulation in the litter was high only at the late stage due to the high input of spruce needles. The carbon stock in the humus horizons of the loamy soils varied due to changes in their density, which was regulated by earthworms. When comparing different succession stages/types of the forests on sandy soils, it was found that the carbon stock in the litter of the pine forests at the early stage of succession was significantly higher than that of the mixed and broadleaved forests. Trends of carbon accumulation in the mineral horizons of sandy soils were mainly explained by their thickness, which was related to the amount of percolating precipitation regulated by woody plants. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Bryansk region; C/N; earthworms; Moscow region; soil carbon stock; succession dynamics","accumulation; broad-leaved forest; carbon budget; comparative study; coniferous forest; earthworm; forest soil; loam; sandy soil; soil carbon; succession; Bryansk [Russian Federation]; Moscow [(ADS) Russian Federation]; Russian Federation; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073643684

The minimum content of carbonate necessary for the development of conduits is unknown, and the mechanisms of the origins of conduits in these rocks are poorly understood. This article focuses upon these questions in an important regional aquifer. Samples of limestones and sandstones were taken from outcrops in vertical profiles, and were subjected to a rapid dissolution test with 10% HCl. The degree of disintegration of the samples after dissolution of the carbonate was observed in order to estimate which portions of the rock enabled formation of karst conduits. Carbonate content was measured by calcimetry. Distribution of calcite cement and other sources of cohesion were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Tracer tests in the conduits were evaluated. Calcite is the dominant carbonate mineral and main cementing agent in the Jizera Fm. Aquifer (mean content 51%). However, calcite content was found to be a weak predictor of karst potential. Most of the samples disintegrated completely if the calcite content exceeded 55%. On the other hand, some rocks with a calcite content up to 70% did not disintegrate due to microcrystalline/amorphous silica, which bound the quartz grains together and/or formed a foam-like supporting structure. After in situ calcite dissolution, the rock in karst-prone zones is turned to residuum, which consequently is washed out by fast flow (0.01–0.2 m/s, based on tracer tests). Microscopic study of cementing agents of the siliciclastic-carbonate sediments and dissolution tests are essential for understanding the mechanisms of conduit origin in ghost-rock karst. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Conduit; Flow velocity; Karst; Limestone; Sandstone; Tracer test","Aquifers; Calcite; Carbonation; Cementing (shafts); Disintegration; Dissolution; Flow velocity; Lime; Limestone; Radioactive tracers; Sandstone; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Testing; Calcite dissolution; Carbonate content; Conduit; Karst; Microscopic study; Siliciclastic carbonates; Supporting structure; Tracer tests; Landforms; dissolution; flow velocity; karst; sandstone; scanning electron microscopy; silica; tracer; vertical profile; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066062051

To improve sustainable development, it is important to substitute fossil fuel with renewable and clean energy sources. In this study we employ a partial equilibrium, price endogenous mathematical programming model to analyze how bioenergy development in Taiwan can (1) enhance domestic energy production, (2) reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, and (3) protect the environment. The results show that the ethanol expands with an increase in gasoline price, but SO2 emission reduction would shrink because of a reduction in renewable electricity generation. Conversely, up to 10.4% of Taiwan’s annual SO2 emission can be reduced in the face of higher coal and emission prices. A tradeoff between CO2 and SO2 emission reductions is perceived during the switch of production of liquid and nonliquid bioenergy. Policy implications such as technology selection, market operation, and government subsidy are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.","Agricultural waste; biochar; mathematical programming; pyrolysis; renewable energy","Acid rain; Agricultural wastes; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Environmental protection; Mathematical programming; Public policy; Pyrolysis; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Bio chars; Bioenergy productions; Clean energy sources; Environmental analysis; Environmental problems; Mathematical programming models; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068788553

The electrochemical performance of the fabricated SOEC for CO2 reduction is compared with a similar high-temperature SOEC having Cu-infiltrated praseodymium-doped ceria electrode (Neetu et al., ECS Transaction 78, 3329, 2017). On varying the applied potentials and reducing environment at different volumetric ratio of CO2/CO and CO2/H2, electrochemical measurements are carried out to understand the role of reducing atmosphere. On the Cu-PDC composite electrode, a significantly improved reduction current (− 0.84 A cm−2 at Vapp = 2.5 V) is measured as compared to the Cu-infiltrated electrode reported earlier. Oxygen vacancy formation energy on doped ceria surface is calculated, using density functional theory, and found to be relatively lower (∆Evac = 84.6 kJ mole−1) as compared to the un-doped ceria surface (∆Evac = 152.8 kJ mole−1), indicating facile oxygen anion transport in Cu-PDC. Density of state calculations shows Pr substitution in ceria responsible for the reduction in band gap [O(2p) → Ce(4f)] from 1.75 to 0.4 eV, contributing to electronic conduction. The theoretical results thus elucidate the activity of Pr-doped ceria materials for CO2 reduction to CO. The theoretical results combined with experiments conducted on Cu-PDC electrode are therefore expected to provide a basis for the development of a new electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide reduction; Ceria; Density functional theory; Electrocatalyst; Solid oxide electrolysis","Carbon dioxide; Cathodes; Cerium compounds; Cerium oxide; Copper; Copper compounds; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Electrolytic reduction; Energy gap; Lanthanum compounds; Manganese compounds; Oxygen; Pollution control; Praseodymium; Praseodymium compounds; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Strontium compounds; Yttria stabilized zirconia; Yttrium oxide; Zirconia; Carbon dioxide reduction; Electrochemical measurements; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical reductions; Oxygen vacancy formation energies; Praseodymium-doped ceria; Solid oxide; Yttria-stabilized zirconias (YSZ); Regenerative fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061335574

This site provides important temporal constraints on regional stratigraphy and insights into late Oligocene to early Miocene ice sheet dynamics; however, previous age models were based on limited data. Here we provide a revised age model using a combination of biostratigraphy (dinoflagellate cysts, pollen, calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, and diatoms), magnetostratigraphy, Sr-isotope stratigraphy, and K[sbnd]Ar dating of glauconite. We divide the sequence between 386 and 20 mbsf into four chronostratigraphic intervals (CSIs). CSI 1 (386–352 mbsf) is dated to between ~26 and 25 Ma based on glauconite K[sbnd]Ar dating, the highest occurrence (HO) of the dinoflagellate Lejeunecysta rotunda (24.5 Ma), and a paleomagnetic reversal tied to the C8r/C8n.2r boundary (25.987 Ma). A distinct change in the benthic foraminifer assemblage at 352 mbsf marks an unconformity and the base of CSI 2. CSI 2 (352 to 149–146 mbsf) is dated to between 25.44 Ma and 23.13 Ma based on nannofossil biostratigraphy. Within this 200 m interval we correlate seven magnetic reversals to Chrons C8n.2n to C6Cr (25.3–23.3 Ma) and our line of correlation suggests rapid sedimentation (~80 m/m.y.). Microfossil and lithologic evidence indicate a distal marine setting with a paleo-water depth of ~200 m at 345 mbsf, with deepening above. Within CSI 2 is a diamictite overlain by grounding line proximal sandstone and laminated mudstone indicating glaciomarine deposition in a grounding-line proximal setting between 245 and 230 mbsf, followed by ice sheet grounding-line retreat into a more distal setting from 230 to 146 mbsf (~24.5–23.5 Ma), likely due to basin subsidence and incursion of relatively warm deep water onto the shelf. Another unconformity between 149 and 146 mbsf marks the boundary between CSI 2 and CSI 3. The thin CSI 3 (149–146 to 121/112 mbsf) is dated to ~23 Ma and we place the Oligocene/Miocene boundary at the base of the sequence, although we cannot rule out that the boundary is represented by an unconformity. Benthic foraminifers indicate continued deepening in the earliest Miocene and finer-grained mudstone with less IRD suggests that the site remained in a grounding line distal setting, although a decrease in abundance of calcareous plankton indicates cooling climatic conditions at that time. The boundary between CSI 3 and CSI 4 is marked by an unconformity spanning at least 2.5 m.y. based on the lowest occurrence of the dinoflagellate Batiacasphaera cooperi (<20.7 Ma) at 111 mbsf. Biostratigraphic data constrain CSI 4 to the early Miocene. We tentatively identify three magnetic reversals within CSI 4 (121/112–20 mbsf) that may tie this interval to Chrons C6An.2n to C6r (~20.6–19.7 Ma). A major unconformity at 20 mbsf separates the lower Miocene sediments from the overlying Pliocene and younger sediments. Late Oligocene to early Miocene pollen assemblages from Site 270 suggest a tundra landscape with low-growing Nothofagaceae, Podocarpaceae, and Proteaceae scrub in warmer locations with a relatively stable terrestrial environment during that time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biostratigraphy; Chronostratigraphy; DSDP Site 270; Magnetostratigraphy; Paleoecology; Ross Sea","Biostratigraphy; Deepwater drilling; Ecology; Glaciers; Ice; Mica; Sedimentary rocks; Chronostratigraphy; DSDP Site 270; Magnetostratigraphy; Paleoecology; Ross Sea; Chromium compounds; abundance; benthic foraminifera; biostratigraphy; chronostratigraphy; climate conditions; Deep Sea Drilling Project; diatom; dinoflagellate cyst; fossil assemblage; glaciomarine deposit; magnetostratigraphy; microfossil; Miocene; nanofossil; Oligocene; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; Pliocene; pollen; seafloor; Antarctica; Bacillariophyta; Batiacasphaera; Dinophyceae; Foraminifera; Nothofagaceae; Podocarpaceae; Proteaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064650153

The observed pulsars may actually be strange quark stars, rather than neutron stars. With such an SQM hypothesis, researchers have predicted the existence of hydrostatically stable sequence of strange quark stars, like strange quark dwarfs and even strange quark planets. However, the SQM hypothesis is difficult to test due to the similarity between strange stars and neutron stars. Recently, we proposed a hopeful new method to probe the existence of SQM, which focuses on the study of strange quark planet systems. Strange quark planets will not be tidally disrupted even when they get very close to their host stars due to their extreme compactness. It is pointed out that one could identify strange quark planets by searching for very close-in planets among extra-solar planetary systems. Particularly, we should pay attention to possible pulsar planets with an orbital radius less than about 5.6 × 1010â€?cm and/or an orbital period less than about 6100 s. The pulsar planet of PSR J1719 - 1438 b, with an orbital radius of ∼6 × 1010 cm and orbital period of 7837 s, is encouragingly found to be a good candidate. Additionally, recent progresses in the field of gravitational wave astronomy encourages us to study gravitational waves emission from SQM planet systems. Strange quark planets can spiral very close to their host strange stars, and produce strong gravitational waves at the final merging stage. This kind of events can be detected by our current and upcoming gravitational wave detectors, such as the advanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069707274

Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine fine-scale genetic diversity in Red Angus cattle in relation to climate zones. One hundred and seventy-five prominent Red Angus artificial insemination (AI) sires were sampled from five conterminous U.S. climate regions (Cool Arid, Cool Humid, Transition Zone, Warm Arid, and Warm Humid). Quantitative and molecular genetic approaches were used to evaluate genetic diversity for the cattle. The first method utilized neutral SNP to determine the genetic structure of the population. The second method used 66 SNP associated with traits potentially influenced by climate (body weight, heat stress, milk yield, heifer conception rate, and early embryonic survival) to detect loci under selection in each zone. Using 13,961 SNP, the genetic structure analysis revealed that there were eight sub-populations present within Red Angus. Furthermore, 23 of the 66 SNP were not in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and loci under selection tests (P < 0.05). Chi-square tests revealed 7 of the 23 SNP to differ (P < 0.008) among climate zones. In conclusion, fine genetic substructure observed in Red Angus corresponded to U.S. climate zones. By identifying the genetic diversity within a prominent Bos taurus beef breed in relation to climate, management strategies can be implemented to utilize the genetic diversity of this breed to adapt to changing climates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; Genetic diversity; Red Angus; SNP","animal experiment; Article; artificial insemination; body weight; bovine; climate; climate change; climate zone; conception; cool arid climate; cool humid climate; embryo; environmental aspects and related phenomena; genetic variability; geographic distribution; heat stress; heifer; milk yield; molecular genetics; nonhuman; population genetic structure; quantitative analysis; Red angus cattle; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival rate; taurine cattle; transition zone; United States; warm arid climate; warm humid climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065464165

For the first time, complete selectivity toward CO and improved catalyst productivity are observed in the presence of oxygen. The optimal activity is achieved in a feed containing 0.5 vol% O2 in CO2. In situ XAS, EPR, and UV-vis measurements suggest, among different Cu oxidation states, Cu(I) to be the most active species in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Oxygen sensing of the catalyst in the presence of O2/CO2 mixtures indicated an unexpected photoadsorption of oxygen on the titania surface. We propose photooxidation of surface hydroxyl groups to be the electron source for CO2 reduction, which is supported by hydroxyl group consumption, detection of hydroxyl radicals using in situ EPR, and detection of surface peroxide species after the reaction. The consumption of fossil fuels for energy generation results in harmful CO2 emissions, necessitating carbon-neutral energy sources for global environmental sustainability. Instead of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, using it as a renewable carbon feedstock for the synthesis of valuable chemicals and/or fuels is highly desirable. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C1 compounds combines the use of solar energy with CO2 valorization and is of great interest in basic research. Semiconductors, especially TiO2, are commonly used as photocatalysts. In this work, a highly porous TiO2 aerogel was synthesized and applied in aqueous CO2 reduction to CO.

They are mainly ectothermic during different behavioral tasks. We investigated the body temperature of two species living in differing habitats and climate regions, in order to reveal the environmental influence on their thermoregulatory behavior. The species were Polistes dominula in the temperate climate of Central Europe, and Polistes gallicus in the warm Mediterranean climate of Southern Europe. The wasp’s body temperature was measured during foraging on lovage (Levisticum officinale) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) by infrared thermography in the entire ambient temperature range they are usually exposed to (Ta ~ 20–40◦C). The temperature of all body parts increased nearly linearly with ambient temperature, with the thorax as the warmest part. To achieve optimal foraging temperatures, they preferably use solar radiation. An “operative temperature model” enabled the evaluation of the endothermic effort. Polistes dominula foraging on lovage exhibited no endothermic activity. However, while foraging on fennel they had a weak and almost constant endothermic performance of about 1◦C. Polistes gallicus, by contrast, exhibited mostly no or only minor endothermy during foraging. Both wasps avoid a high energetic effort and this way reduce their foraging costs. © 2019 by the authors.

On the territory of Tatarstan, one of the experimental sites for testing various technologies for the extraction of bitumen is the Lower-Karmalinsky bitumen deposit. Currently, on the field is testing the SAFD method. According to this technology for the extraction of hydrocarbons, steam is pumped in large volumes at a temperature of about + 180°C. Superheated steam reduces the viscosity of hydrocarbons, making them mobile. However, focusing on the reduction of bitumen viscosity, the problem of mineral phase's transformation due to anthropogenic impact in reservoir is not taken into account. In this work, using thermodynamic modeling, it was shown that the injection of superheated steam into the formation of bitumen-saturated sandstone will lead to the dissolution of calcite cement. Moreover, depending on the salinity of the injected water in the form of steam, the dissolution of carbonates will occur at different temperatures. To improve the technological characteristics and to increase the recoverability of bitumen from reservoir, it is recommended to pump hot water with as little mineralization as possible into sandstone layers. Temperature intervals were established, which should be followed in the process of technological development of bitumen collectors at the stage of heating the reservoir and at the stage of extracting water-bitumen solutions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bituminous materials; Calcite; Deposits; Dissolution; Extraction; Hydrocarbons; Oil fields; Phase transitions; Sandstone; Steam; Technological forecasting; Temperature; Viscosity; Anthropogenic impacts; Hydrocarbon reserves; Saturated sandstones; Technological characteristics; Technological development; Temperature intervals; Thermodynamic model; Various technologies; Thermal oil recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070367512

It was shown that three different approaches may be applied in order to control the ionic charge of vanadium, namely, charge compensation, via incorporation of Mg2+/Ca2+ ions, citric acid (CA)-assisted synthesis, with various CA concentrations and grain size tuning through annealing temperature regulation. Each of utilized method enables the significant reduction of V5+ emission band at 520 nm associated with the V4+→ O2− CT transition in respect to the 2E→ 2T2 emission band of V4+ at 645 nm and 1E2 → 3T1g emission band of V3+ at 712 nm. The most efficient V oxidation state stabilization was obtained by the use of grain size modulation, which bases on fact of different localization of the V ions of given charge in the nanoparticles.

Excess electricity is then exported, resulting in large greenhouse gas (GHG) credits. However, this approach will cause lifecycle GHG emissions of biofuels to increase as more renewable energy sources (wind, solar, etc.) participate in grid-electricity generation, and the GHG credits from displacing fossil fuel decrease. To overcome this drawback, a decentralized (depot-based) biorefinery can be integrated with a coal-fired power plant near a large urban area. In an integrated, decentralized, depot-based biorefinery (IDB), the residual solids are co-fired with coal either in the adjacent power plant or in coal-fired boilers elsewhere to displace coal. An IDB system does not rely on indirect GHG credits through grid-electricity displacement. In an IDB system, biogas from the wastewater treatment facility is also upgraded to biomethane and used as a transportation biofuel. The GHG savings per unit of cropland in the IDB systems (2.7–2.9 MgCO2/ha) are 1.5–1.6 fold greater than those in a conventional centralized system (1.7–1.8 MgCO2/ha). Importantly, the biofuel selling price in the IDBs is lower by 28–30 cents per gasoline-equivalent liter than in the conventional centralized system. Furthermore, the total capital investment per annual biofuel volume in the IDB is much lower (by ~80%) than that in the conventional centralized system. Therefore, utilization of biomethane and residual solids in the IDB systems leads to much lower biofuel selling prices and significantly greater GHG savings per unit of cropland participating in the biorefinery system compared to the conventional centralized biorefineries. © 2019 The Authors.

The main objective of this study was to quantify the effects of South Korean national reforestation programs on carbon budgets. We estimated the changes in C stocks and annual C sequestration in the years 1961-2014 using Korea-specific models, a forest cover map (FCM), national forest inventory (NFI) data, and climate data. Furthermore, we examined the differences in C budgets between Cool forests (forests at elevations above 700 m) and forests in lower-altitude areas. Simulations including the effects of climate conditions on forest dynamics showed that the C stocks of the total forest area increased from 6.65 Tg C in 1961 to 476.21 Tg C in 2014. The model developed here showed a high degree of spatiotemporal reliability. The mean C stocks of the Cool forests and other forests increased from 4.03 and 0.43 Mg C ha-1, respectively, to 102.43 and 73.76 Mg C ha-1 at a rate of 1.82 and 1.36 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 during the same period. These results imply that, although the total Cool forest area of South Korea occupied only about 12.3% (772,788 ha) of the total forest area, the Cool forests play important roles in C balances and forest ecosystems in South Korea. Annual C sequestration totals are projected to decrease at a low rate in the near future because the overall growth rate of a mature forest decreases as the stand ages. Our results quantified forest C dynamics in South Korean forests before and after national reforestation programs. Furthermore, our results can help in development of regional and national forest management strategies to allow for sustainable development of society and to cope with climate change in South Korea. © 2019 by the author.","Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; Cool forest; Forest carbon stock; National forest inventory","Budget control; Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Growth rate; Magnesium; Planning; Reforestation; Afforestation; Carbon sequestration; Climate condition; Forest carbons; Forest ecosystem; Management strategies; National forest inventories; National forests; C (programming language); afforestation; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; forest cover; forest inventory; quantitative analysis; reforestation; Carbon; Cost Control; Ecosystems; Growth Rate; Magnesium; Planning; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073886421

However, in regions where short-lived taxa are not well preserved, archeologists face a dilemma whether to use wood dates to construct archeological interpretations, often leading to controversies over validity of their chronologies. To systematically access this problem, this paper evaluates the intensity of the old wood effect in Korea. First we compared radiocarbon dates assayed from five wood and 32 soybean (Glycine max) samples obtained from a prehistoric pithouse in central-western Korea. Statistical analysis shows that there is no significant disparity in the ages between the materials in this case. To further assess the issue, we compared 24 cases from the Korean Radiocarbon Database in which both wood and short-lived taxa were found and dated from the same house feature. The results demonstrate that, in general, the old wood effect is not substantial in Korea. However, further analysis of these results suggests that the potential for an old wood effect increases slightly over time in Korea, despite the fact that there was no significant climatic change. We interpret the adoption of iron for woodcutting around the first century BCE as a catalyst for a noted increase in the thickness of wood timbers of houses, which consequently produced conditions more opportune for the occurrence of an old wood effect. It suggests that the variability of an old wood effect can be the result of technological factors even within the same general physical environment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Comparison; Korea; Old wood effect; Radiocarbon dating; Temporal variability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059592036

This research work formulates an urbanization algorithm to minimize the carbon dioxide emissions responsibility of districts based on energy usage and aspects of embodied energy to tackle multiple drivers of urban emissions. The combined method is implemented to scenarios that contribute to a net-zero exergy district target with 6 options for district density and the selection of building materials. Based on a comparison of scenarios for a case study in the province of Ankara, Turkey, the scenario in which on-site exergy production is about 9.5% of the annual exergy consumption will be responsible for about 13,731 ktonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in a timeframe of 30 years. Conversely, a near net-zero exergy district in which on-site exergy production is 75% of the annual exergy consumption will have about 2967 ktonnes of carbon dioxide emissions during the same timeframe, including embodied energy in buildings. The sensitivity analysis with 9 different combinations provides differences in trade-offs based on timeframes and scenarios.

The adoption of large-scale solar PV ensures that demand can be satisfied by utilising renewable energy and reduces the dependency on the conventional non-renewable energy resources. Bringing this energy to widespread consumers requires transmission medium. However, controlling and bringing the harvested energy to the homes and industries is a task which needs attention. According to the various researches, it is deduced that the implementation of large-scale solar PV will have a marked effect on the grid which may lead to instability. The main obstacle to implementation is the distribution and transmission of energy to the recipients. In this study, the efforts are put to design the large-scale solar PV suitable for Malaysia using Pvsyst designing algorithm and the designed LSS PV is studied in a power system analysis tool to analyse the potential difference variation in different buses when connected to the nine-bus power system. Three solar PV models were selected based on their efficiency; among them two best PV model were obtained by conducting PVSyst simulation.

Also, we examined the effect of child hemoglobin and sociodemographic risk factors on these neurocognitive outcomes. Methods: A convenience sample of healthy children aged 8–14 years attending public schools were recruited in Quito, Ecuador. Child residential proximity to the nearest heavily trafficked road was used as a proxy for traffic-related pollutant exposure. These included high exposure (<100 m), medium exposure (100–199 m) and low exposure (≥ 200 m) from the nearest heavily trafficked road. The Behavioral Assessment and Research System (BARS), a computerized test battery assessing attention, memory, learning and motor function was used to evaluate child neurobehavioral performance. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) was used to assess child behavioral dysfunction as reported by mothers. The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results: Children with the highest residential exposure to traffic pollutants (< 100 m) had significantly longer latencies as measured by match to sample (b = 410.27; p = 0.01) and continuous performance (b = 37.90; p = 0.02) compared to those living ≥ 200 m away. A similar but non-significant association was observed for reaction time latency. Children living within 100 m of heavy traffic also demonstrated higher scores across all CBCL subscales although only the relationship with thought problems (p = 0.05) was statistically significant in the adjusted model. Conclusion: The study findings suggest that children living within 100 m of heavy traffic appear to experience subtle neurobehavioral deficits that may result from fine and ultrafine particulate matter exposure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Distance from traffic; Fine and ultrafine particulate matters; Neurobehavioral outcomes; Traffic-generated air pollution","hemoglobin; adult; adverse outcome; air pollutant; Article; attention disturbance; behavior disorder; child; Child Behavior Checklist; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; Ecuadorean; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; functional assessment; health status; high risk population; human; latent period; learning disorder; linear regression analysis; low risk population; major clinical study; male; memory disorder; mental performance; motor dysfunction; neurologic disease; priority journal; residential home; risk assessment; risk factor; school child; scoring system; social aspect; suspended particulate matter; thought disorder; adolescent; adolescent behavior; adolescent development; adverse event; age; attention; behavior disorder; child behavior; child development; comparative study; drug effect; Ecuador; environmental exposure; growth, development and aging; memory; motor activity; nervous system; particulate matter; pathophysiology; psychology; risk factor; urban health; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adolescent Development; Age Factors; Attention; Child; Child Behavior; Child Behavior Disorders; Child Development; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ecuador; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Motor Activity; Nervous System; Particulate Matter; Residence Characteristics; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Traffic-Related Pollution; Urban Health; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062404951

Here, we present exploratory work towards developing a strategy to select variants of a state-of-the-art but expensive climate model suitable for climate projection studies. The strategy combines information from a set of relatively cheap, idealized perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) and CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (MME) experiments, and uses two criteria as the basis to select model variants for a PPE suitable for future projections: (a) acceptable model performance at two different timescales, and (b) maintaining diversity in model response to climate change. This second part of a pair of papers builds upon Part I in which we established a strong relationship between model errors at weather and climate timescales across a PPE for a variety of key variables. This relationship is used to filter out parts of parameter space that do not give credible simulations of present day climate, while minimizing the impact on ranges in forcings and feedbacks that drive model responses to climate change. We use statistical emulation to explore the parameter space thoroughly, and demonstrate that about 90% can be filtered out without affecting diversity in global-scale climate change responses. This leads to the identification of plausible parts of parameter space from which model variants can be selected for projection studies. We selected and ran 50 variants from the plausible parameter combinations and validated the emulator predictions. Comparisons with the CMIP5 MME demonstrate that our approach can produce a set of plausible model variants that span a relatively wide range in model response to climate change. We also highlight how the prior expert-specified ranges for uncertain model parameters are constrained as a result of our methodology, and discuss recommendations for future work. © 2019, Crown.","Filtering parameter space; Perturbed parameter ensemble; Plausible model variants; Seamless assessment; Statistical emulation; Uncertainty","climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; ensemble forecasting; statistical analysis; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062155552

However, it is not yet fully understood how climate interacts with human impacts or whether the effects of these factors differ between native and alien species. Facing ongoing climate change and urbanization, we explore the effects of climate on plant species richness and composition across European cities. Location: Sixty cities in Western, Central and Southern Europe. Taxon: Vascular plants. Methods: Species presence was recorded in seven habitats in each city. Large-scale climatic gradients were derived from 22 climatic variables using a partial principal component analysis that controlled for the effects of human population size and gross domestic product. The effects of climate and habitat type on the numbers of native and alien species were tested using linear mixed-effect models. The native and alien compositional variation across cities and habitats was analysed using principal component analysis with variation partitioning. Results: The Mediterranean-to-temperate climatic gradient had a significant effect on species numbers across all habitats. The numbers of both native and alien species increased from the Mediterranean to temperate Europe. Within each city, the proportion of alien species decreased from highly urbanized to less urbanized habitats. Climate had a stronger effect on the composition of alien plants than on the composition of native plants. The native species composition especially changed from the Mediterranean to temperate cities and alien species composition also from oceanic to continental cities. Main conclusions: Urban native and alien species richness follow the pattern found for the whole European flora. Based on this observation, we suggest that the future shift of warm and dry conditions from the Mediterranean to the north that is expected under global change scenarios could affect richness and change the composition of European urban floras. However, this shift would not necessarily alter the proportions of aliens. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alien species; invasion; macroclimate; native species; neophytes; plant species composition; species richness; urban habitats","biological invasion; climate change; climate effect; environmental factor; flora; Gross Domestic Product; human activity; invasive species; Mediterranean environment; microclimate; native species; population size; species richness; temperate environment; urban ecosystem; urbanization; vascular plant; Central Europe; Southern Europe; Western Europe; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065763491

The increase in phosphorus loading, specifically the dissolved reactive portion, has been attributed to a combination of changing climate and agricultural management. While many management practices and strategies have been identified to reduce phosphorus loads, the impacts of future climate remain uncertain. This is particularly the case for the Great Lakes region because many global climate models do not accurately represent the land-lake interactions that govern regional climate. For this study, we used midcentury (2046-2065) climate projections from one global model and four regional dynamically downscaled models as drivers for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool configured for the Maumee River watershed, the source of almost 50% of Lake Erie's Western Basin phosphorus load. Our findings suggest that future warming may lead to less nutrient runoff due to increased evapotranspiration and decreased snowfall, despite projected moderate increases in intensity and overall amount of precipitation. Results highlight the benefits of considering multiple environmental drivers in determining the fate of nutrients in the environment and demonstrate a need to improve approaches for climate change assessment using watershed models. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Climate change; Climate models; Lakes; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Watersheds; Agricultural management; Climate change assessment; Climate projection; Global climate model; Great Lakes regions; Harmful algal blooms; Management practices; Soil and Water assessment tools; Loading; phosphorus; climate change; climate modeling; evapotranspiration; future prospect; global climate; nutrient budget; nutrient dynamics; phosphorus; watershed; agricultural management; algal bloom; Article; climate change; comparative study; controlled study; evapotranspiration; global climate; nutrient loading; uncertainty; United States; warming; water quality; watershed; environmental monitoring; lake; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie; Maumee River; Mediterranean Sea; United States; Western Basin; algae; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Great Lakes Region; Lakes; Nutrients; Phosphorus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068118920

Not surprisingly, phenotypic responses to climate change have already been observed in many plant populations. These responses may be due to evolutionary adaptive changes or phenotypic plasticity. Especially plant species with a wide geographic range are either expected to show genetic differentiation in response to differing climate conditions or to have a high phenotypic plasticity. We investigated phenotypic responses and plasticity as an estimate of the adaptive potential in the widespread species Silene vulgaris. In a greenhouse experiment, 25 European populations covering a geographic range from the Canary Islands to Sweden were exposed to three experimental precipitation and two temperature regimes mimicking a possible climate-change scenario for central Europe. We hypothesized that southern populations have a better performance under high temperature and drought conditions, as they are already adapted to a comparable environment. We found that our treatments significantly influenced the plants, but did not reveal a latitudinal difference in response to climate treatments for most plant traits. Only flower number showed a stronger plasticity in northern European populations (e.g. Swedish populations) where numbers decreased more drastically with increased temperature and decreased precipitation treatment. Synthesis. The significant treatment response in Silene vulgaris, independent of population origin – except for the number of flowers produced – suggests a high degree of universal phenotypic plasticity in this widely distributed species. This reflects the likely adaptation strategy of the species and forms the basis for a successful survival strategy during upcoming climatic changes. However, as flower number, a strongly fitness-related trait, decreased more strongly in northern populations under a climate-change scenario, there might be limits to adaptation even in this widespread, plastic species. © 2019 The Authors.

Plasticity in group size and composition among gregarious ungulates likely reflects a response to a variety of proximate factors, including environmental conditions such as snow depth. Yet, longitudinal studies of social organization by ungulates in response to environmental conditions are limited. We used 11 years of aerial survey data to examine winter group size in a northern population of boreal woodland caribou in response to late-winter snow depth. We documented caribou social organization (size and types of groups) and annual variability in group size. We tested the hypothesis that group size increases with increasing snow depth. Most groups (61%; n = 456) were ≤ 5 animals; however, they only constituted 37% of the animals. Caribou were distributed among four types of groups, including solitary females, males only, females only, and mixed groups. Group sizes differed among group types. Mixed groups were both the most common and largest groups encountered in late winter. We found a positive relationship between snow depth and group size; however, there was no relationship between snow depth and the percentage of mixed groups. These caribou may form larger groups in winters with deep snow as a behavioral strategy to reduce energetic costs, predation risk, or both. Climate-induced decreases in late-winter snow depth will likely reduce group sizes in boreal woodland caribou. However, further work is required to understand if this change in social organization will affect the persistence of local boreal woodland caribou populations. © 2019, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.","Boreal forest; Caribou; Group composition; Group size; Rangifer tarandus; Snow depth; Social ecology; Winter ecology","annual variation; boreal forest; climate change; deer; endangered species; environmental conditions; global climate; group size; snow cover; social organization; ungulate; winter; woodland; Animalia; Rangifer tarandus; Rangifer tarandus caribou; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067955061

Work reported here focuses on the identification of plausible mechanistic pathways from CO2 to various C1 products including methane. It is found that Fe-Nx sites convert only CO2, CO, and CH2O into methane, whereas CH3OH appears to be an end product. Distinctly different pH dependence of the catalytic CH4 evolution from CH2O in comparison with that of CO2 and CO reduction indicates differences in the proton participation of rate-determining steps.

Given this expectation, a better understanding of the relationship between the presence of wind farms and the atmospheric boundary layer is needed. Turbulent wakes produced by wind turbines can significantly impact the flow dynamics within wind farms and downstream of them. Operating offshore parks have already shown losses on energy production and effects on the local climate. In order to analyse the interactions occurring during these impacts, a new tool has been developed. This numerical tool is a coupling between the Actuator Line Method (ALM) and the open-source, non-hydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model Meso-NH, based on the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) framework. The coupled Meso-NH + ALM system is first validated by using the experimental data obtained during the New MEXICO experiments. In particular, simulated and experimental loadings along the blades are compared. Then, a simulation of an idealized Horns Rev wind farm is performed using met mast measurements and reanalysis data for the ""Horns Rev 1 photo case"" as initial conditions.

However, acidified streams remain common in the region, which limits recovery of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations. To investigate liming as a method to accelerate recovery of brook trout, the channels of two acidified streams were limed annually from 2012 to 2015, and an entire watershed of a third acidified tributary was limed by helicopter in 2013. Stream flow, water chemistry, and density of young-of-year (YOY) brook trout were measured in limed streams, an untreated acidified stream, and a buffered reference stream. Lime additions increased pH and acid-neutralizing capacity and decreased inorganic monomeric aluminum concentrations to less than 2.0 μmol/L, the minimum concentration at which in situ brook trout mortality has been documented. However, of the two channel-limed streams, only stream T8 showed a significant response (P &lt; 0.01) in YOY density, increasing from a mean of 0.4 fish/m2 before liming to 2.7 fish/m2 after liming. No YOY brook trout response was observed in the stream within the limed watershed. Groundwater inputs to streams were identified by relative differences in temperature and concentrations of silica and sodium. YOY brook trout densities increased only in the channel-limed stream (T8) with suitable groundwater inputs for fall spawning and a summer nursery. Results suggest that targeted liming of acidified streams with the necessary groundwater habitat could be beneficial in accelerating recovery of brook trout populations. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Brook trout; Channel; Groundwater; Stream liming; Watershed","Deposition; Fish; Groundwater; Hydrochemistry; Recovery; Silica; Stream flow; Surface waters; Watersheds; Acid neutralizing capacity; Acidic deposition; Aluminum concentration; Brook trout; Channel; Chemical recovery; Reference streams; Stream liming; Lime; aluminum; calcium oxide; ground water; silicon dioxide; sodium; acid deposition; concentration (composition); groundwater; stream; water chemistry; watershed; acid deposition; acidification; Article; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; fishing; mortality rate; nonhuman; pH; pollution transport; population distribution; Salvelinus fontinalis; spawning; stream (river); water analysis; water flow; water sampling; watershed management; Salvelinus fontinalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067612683

Here, we investigate marine N2O emissions by forcing the Bern3D Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity with freshwater into the North Atlantic. The model simulates a decrease in marine N2O emissions of about 0.8 TgN yr-1 followed by a recovery, in reasonable agreement regarding timing and magnitude with isotope-based reconstructions of marine emissions for the Younger Dryas Northern Hemisphere cold event. In the model the freshwater forcing causes a transient near-collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) leading to a fast adjustment in thermocline ventilation and an increase in O2 in tropical eastern boundary systems and in the tropical Indian Ocean. In turn, net production by nitrification and denitrification and N2O emissions decrease in these regions. The decrease in organic matter export, mainly in the North Atlantic where ventilation and nutrient supply is suppressed, explains the remaining emission reduction. Modeled global marine N2O production and emission changes are delayed, initially by up to 300 years, relative to the AMOC decrease, but by less than 50 years at peak decline. The N2O perturbation is recovering only slowly and the lag between the recovery in AMOC and the recovery in N2O emissions and atmospheric concentrations exceeds 400 years. Thus, our results suggest a century-scale lag between ocean circulation and marine N2O emissions, and a tight coupling between changes in AMOC and tropical thermocline ventilation. © 2019 The Author(s).

The high concentration of fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) is known to be associated with lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disease. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations can help governments warn people at high risk, thus mitigating the complications. Although attempts have been made to predict PM2.5 concentrations, the factors influencing PM2.5 prediction have not been investigated. In this work, we study feature importance for PM2.5 prediction in Tehran's urban area, implementing random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and deep learning machine learning (ML) approaches. We use 23 features, including satellite and meteorological data, ground-measured PM2.5, and geographical data, in the modeling. The best model performance obtained was R2 = 0.81 (R = 0.9), MAE = 9.93 μg/m3, and RMSE = 13.58 μg/m3 using the XGBoost approach, incorporating elimination of unimportant features. However, all three ML methods performed similarly and R2 varied from 0.63 to 0.67, when Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution was included, and 0.77 to 0.81, when AOD at 3 km resolution was excluded. Contrary to the PM2.5 lag data, satellite-derived AODs did not improve model performance. © 2019 by the authors.","Deep leaning; Feature importance; PM2.5; Prediction; Random forest; XGBoost","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Diseases; Forecasting; Machine learning; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Deep leaning; Feature importance; PM2.5; Random forests; XGBoost; Deep learning; aerosol; algorithm; concentration (composition); machine learning; particulate matter; prediction; remote sensing; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068938395

This study quantified direct and indirect carbon reduction from tree planting in MRS in Korea and explored sustainable design guidelines to maximize the carbon offset service of MRS. The total annual direct and indirect carbon reduction through tree planting in all the MRS was estimated to be about 101.1 kt/year. This carbon reduction equaled 3.3% of the total annual carbon emissions from the heating and cooling energy consumption of multifamily buildings. This study considered both direct and indirect carbon reduction from trees in MRS which was insufficient in previous studies.

The group contribution method (GCM) is one of the most widely used approaches to estimate standard Gibbs energies and redox potentials of reactions for which no experimental measurements exist. Previous work has shown that quantum chemical predictions of biochemical thermodynamics are a promising approach to overcome the limitations of GCM. However, the quantum chemistry approach is significantly more expensive. Here, we use a combination of quantum chemistry and machine learning to obtain a fast and accurate method for predicting the thermodynamics of biochemical redox reactions. We focus on predicting the redox potentials of carbonyl functional group reductions to alcohols and amines, two of the most ubiquitous carbon redox transformations in biology. Our method relies on semiempirical quantum chemistry calculations calibrated with Gaussian process (GP) regression against available experimental data and results in higher predictive power than the GCM at low computational cost. Direct calibration of GCM and fingerprint-based predictions (without quantum chemistry) with GP regression also results in significant improvements in prediction accuracy, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. We design and implement a network expansion algorithm that iteratively reduces and oxidizes a set of natural seed metabolites and demonstrate the high-throughput applicability of our method by predicting the standard potentials of more than 315 »000 redox reactions involving approximately 70 »000 compounds. Additionally, we developed a novel fingerprint-based framework for detecting molecular environment motifs that are enriched or depleted across different regions of the redox potential landscape. We provide open access to all source code and data generated.

We estimate the PM2.5-related health benefits of emission reduction over New York State (NYS) from 2002 to 2012 using seven publicly available PM2.5 products that include information from ground-based observations, remote sensing and chemical transport models. While these PM2.5 products differ in spatial patterns, they show consistent decreases in PM2.5 by 28%-37% from 2002 to 2012. We evaluate these products using two sets of independent ground-based observations from the New York City Community Air Quality Survey (NYCCAS) Program for an urban area, and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Air Quality Program for a remote area. Inclusion of satellite remote sensing improves the representativeness of surface PM2.5 in the remote area. Of the satellite-based products, only the statistical land use regression approach captures some of the spatial variability across New York City measured by NYCCAS. We estimate the PM2.5-related mortality burden by applying an integrated exposure-response function to the different PM2.5 products. The multi-product mean PM2.5-related mortality burden over NYS decreased by 5660 deaths (67%) from 8410 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4570-12 400) deaths in 2002 to 2750 (CI: 700-5790) deaths in 2012. We estimate a 28% uncertainty in the state-level PM2.5 mortality burden due to the choice of PM2.5 products, but such uncertainty is much smaller than the uncertainty (130%) associated with the exposure-response function. © 2019 The Author(s).

This study investigated the change in NPP caused by the large-scale ecological restoration in the Chinese Loess Plateau (LPR) region from 1986 to 2015 based on land cover datasets and NPP calculated using the Carnegie- Ames-Stanford Approach model. The results indicated that the annual total NPP exhibited a significant uptrend (P < 0.01) throughout the whole vegetation restoration region during the last 30 years, with an annual increase of 0.137 Tg C. A significant abrupt change was detected in 2006 for the annual total NPP series. Over half of the restoration region showed an increase in NPP in the past three decades, however, about 30~40% of the vegetation restoration region exhibited NPP loss before 2006, but subsequently NPP loss was found in only approximately 20% of the study region. Overall, the increase in NPP attributed to the vegetation restoration reached 51.14 Tg C in the past three decades, indicating that these large-scale vegetation restoration programs increased the carbon sequestration capacity of terrestrial ecosystems in the Loess Plateau.

Although previous studies have largely revealed the drivers of carbon emissions, there is still a big challenge to uncover the impacts of the positions of countries in the global supply chains. This paper combined multi-regional input-output analysis, complex network and panel regression analysis to quantify the influence of the roles of countries in the global carbon emissions embodied in trade (EET) transfer networks on their direct carbon emissions. The results showed the network structures had significant evolutionary characteristics. Countries played different roles in the embodied carbon emission transfers, and their roles changed over time. Furthermore, we found the direct carbon emissions of countries were significantly determined by some roles in the networks, including import universality, import strength, media capability and the importance of transfer partners. Our work demonstrated the import of embodied carbon emissions significantly decreased countries’ direct carbon emissions. For the global emission reduction, these important importing countries should reduce their domestic consumptions, and take the responsibility to help their import sources reduce the environmental pressure. It also indicated developing the trade relations with some important countries would help reduce the unnecessary carbon emissions in the domestic productions. Moreover, our work indicated reducing carbon emissions should consider both direct and indirect influence from the entire supply chains. One country's carbon emission reduction would need the improvement of the trade structures of all the direct and indirect importer and exporters in the same supply chain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Complex network; Factors; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Panel regression analysis","Commerce; Emission control; Regression analysis; Supply chains; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Domestic production; Environmental pressures; Factors; Global carbon emission; Global supply chain; Input output analysis; Complex networks; carbon emission; emission control; environmental issue; export; import; input-output analysis; media role; regression analysis; supply chain management; Article; carbon footprint; complex network analysis; concentration (parameter); domestic waste; economic aspect; environmental factor; environmental impact; global multiregional input output analysis; panel regression analysis; risk factor; statistical analysis; structure analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064156769

We demonstrate enhanced oil recovery by utilizing CO2 foam under miscible conditions in the presence of crude oil. The foam was generated in situ by both co-injection and surfactant alternating gas injection modes. Foam transport and propagation were characterized as a function of the foam quality, shear rate, permeability, surfactant concentration, and method of injection. Finally, we utilize the experimental results to obtain the parameters for the STARS foam model by optimizing multiple variables related to the dry out, shear thinning, and surfactant concentration effects on foam transport. Enhanced oil recovery utilizing CO2 foam under miscible conditions in the presence of SMY crude oil was able to decrease oil saturation to 3.0%. It was also determined that significantly more injected pore volumes were required for the foam to reach the steady state in the presence of SMY crude oil. A foam simulation process in a heterogeneous reservoir is conducted applying the parameters obtained. The TTM CO2 foam generated significantly reduces the mobility of CO2 in the high permeability layers, which results in an improved swept volume in the low permeability zone that significantly improves oil recovery when epoil = 1 and fmoil = 0.5. Oil saturation parameters play important roles in the effectiveness of CO2 foam: large epoil and small fmoil will reduce the efficiency for TTM CO2 foam. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Crude oil; Enhanced recovery; Oil well flooding; Shear flow; Shear thinning; Surface active agents; Truck trailers; Carbonate reservoir; Enhanced oil recovery; Heterogeneous reservoirs; Low permeability zone; Simulation process; Surfactant concentrations; Total dissolved solids; Transport behavior; Petroleum transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068176934

However, response of SIC to afforestation has been studied rarely, which hinders any prediction about soil carbon dynamics. To determine the response of SIC and soil organic carbon (SOC) to afforestation in semiarid soils and whether such responses vary with soil aggregates, soil texture, and climatic conditions, we measured SIC and SOC in bulk soils and aggregate fractions under paired afforested lands and farmlands at five sites across the Loess Plateau. The relationship of these responses to soils and climatic variables was analyzed. Afforestation increased SOC at all sites, with accumulation rates of 0.21, 0.23, 0.34, and 0.09 g kg−1 yr−1 in bulk soils, macroaggregates (&gt;0.25 mm), microaggregates (0.25–0.053 mm), and silt + clay fraction, respectively, when averaged across sites and soil depths. However, the response of SIC to afforestation varied with site, with increased SIC in drier sites and decreased SIC in wetter sites. Change in SIC was negatively correlated with change in SOC either across or within bulk soils and aggregate fractions. The SIC decreased and SOC increased with increasing soil clay content, precipitation, temperature, and site aridity index. These results indicated consistent increase in SOC but variable response of SIC to afforestation among sites in the Loess Plateau. Such variable response of SIC should be incorporated into carbon cycle models to reduce uncertainties when predicting sequestration dynamics of soil carbon. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","afforestation; aggregate size fraction; inorganic carbon; organic carbon; semiarid soils","Aggregates; Arid regions; Landforms; Reforestation; Sediments; Silt; Textures; afforestation; Aggregate-size fractions; Arid and semi-arid regions; Carbon cycle models; Inorganic carbon; Semiarid soils; Soil carbon dynamics; Soil inorganic carbons; Organic carbon; afforestation; aggregate size; climate conditions; inorganic carbon; organic carbon; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil texture; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066038136

Because OC and EC are closely associated with fuel combustion, it is helpful for the scientific community and policymakers assessing the efficacy of air pollution control measures to study the impact of control measures and regional transport on OC and EC levels. In this study, hourly mass concentrations of OC and EC associated with PM2:5 were semi-continuously measured from March 2013 to February 2018. The results showed that annual mean OC and EC concentrations declined from 14.0 to 7.7 μgm-3 and from 4.0 to 2.6 μgm-3, respectively, from March 2013 to February 2018. In combination with the data of OC and EC in previous studies, an obvious decreasing trend in OC and EC concentrations was found, which was caused by clean energy policies and effective air pollution control measures. However, no obvious change in the ratios of OC and EC to the PM2:5 mass (on average, 0.164 and 0.049, respectively) was recorded, suggesting that inorganic ions still contributed a lot to PM2:5. Based on the seasonal variations in OC and EC, it appeared that higher OC and EC concentrations were still observed in the winter months, with the exception of winter of 20172018. Traffic policies executed in Beijing resulted in nighttime peaks of OC and EC, caused by heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty diesel vehicles being permitted to operate from 00:00 to 06:00 (China standard time, UTCC8, for all times throughout the paper). In addition, the fact that there was no traffic restriction in weekends led to higher concentrations on weekends compared to weekdays. Significant correlations between OC and EC were observed throughout the study period, suggesting that OC and EC originated from common emission sources, such as exhaust of vehicles and fuel combustion. OC and EC levels increased with enhanced SO2, CO, and NOx concentrations while the O3 and OC levels were enhanced simultaneously when O3 concentrations were higher than 50 μgm-3. Non-parametric wind regression analysis was performed to examine the sources of OC and EC in the Beijing area. It was found that there were distinct hot spots in the northeast wind sector at wind speeds of approximately 06 km h-1, as well as diffuse signals in the southwestern wind sectors. Source areas further away from Beijing were assessed by potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis. A highpotential source area was precisely pinpointed, which was located in the northwestern and southern areas of Beijing in 2017 instead of solely in the southern areas of Beijing in 2013. This work shows that improvement of the air quality in Beijing benefits from strict control measures; however, joint prevention and control of regional air pollution in the regions is needed for further improving the air quality. The results provide a reference for controlling air pollution caused by rapid economic development in developing countries. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental policy; particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution control; urban atmosphere; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068509015

The aim of this study was to perform sensitivity analyses of the ASCE-Penman–Monteith reference ET equation (EToPM) for different tropical and subtropical climates, where a quantitative understanding of water fluxes to the atmosphere is limited. Sensitivity coefficients were derived on a daily basis for maximum and minimum air temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed at 2 m height using data from 44-year of actual measurements for calibration (1970–2014), for nine different climatic zones across Brazil. A multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate the relation between meteorological data and EToPM across climatic zones. Seasonal and annual average estimates were obtained by averaging daily values and spatial patterns of EToPM were obtained by interpolating meteorological data from all sampled locations. Five climate variables were used in the analysis, which revealed diverse effects on EToPM across seasons and climatic zones. In order of importance, EToPM was most sensitive to annual variation in vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed (U2) and solar radiation (Rs) in all climate types. Our analysis also showed that VPD, calculated from measurements of relative humidity and temperature (T), are essential to accurately predict EToPM across tropical and subtropical climates. Due to the lack of direct meteorological measurements in many Brazilian regions, we recommend the adjustment of climate-driven hydrological fluxes predictions to the most sensitive variables, i.e., VPD, to improve the precision of reference ET losses. Our results will be useful in delineating the influence of different climatic variables in the ASCE Penman–Monteith model and in guiding new climatic modeling efforts in tropical and subtropical regions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"calibration; climate classification; climate modeling; equation; evapotranspiration; multiple regression; reference sample; relative humidity; sensitivity analysis; subtropical region; tropical region; water budget; weather forecasting; wind velocity; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060207547

In this paper, we propose for purpose of such a comparison the application of an institutional framework to the analysis of actors’ agency in renewable energy development occurring within the institutional configuration of two countries’ respective energy systems. For the analysis, institutional configurations are seen as being structured through institutional modes and through multiple regulatory scales from the local to the national. The approach is applied to wind and photovoltaic projects in two local case studies considered to be at the vanguard of climate protection policy in Germany and (Western) Australia. While in the German case, institutional configurations bring about a consistency across institutions at local, state and national scales, enabling the realisation of most RE projects, the Australian case exhibits in-consistencies between the scales, serving to both explicitly and implicitly constrain local actors. The analysis offers insights into how institutions combine to shape local contexts, influence local actor agency and thus affect energy transition. The approach presented here enables the comparison of system-specific configurations and dynamics and sheds light on how actors can gain agency within these.

This study uses a frame analysis to examine the disputed Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme in Cork, Ireland. This analysis reveals a multi-party and multi-perspective dispute that is more complex than the two sided conflict it may appear to be at first glance. However despite this diversity of views, many of the stakeholders involved share similar assumptions about flood risk and its management, reflecting the role of a dominant discourse in setting the boundaries of debate. Place attachment emerges as a key cross cutting theme, of importance to both opponents and proponents of the proposed scheme. Place attachment can act as either a barrier to transformative adaptation or as a motivator for action. While highlighting areas of disagreement between local stakeholders, conflicts such as the Cork dispute can also represent new opportunities to engage wider constituencies with hazards management and to bring new perspectives into the decision-making process. The emergence of place attachment as a cross cutting theme illustrates that using place as a boundary concept around which to centre the decision-making process may allow for the testing of new approaches to hazards management and climate change adaptation. These would incorporate both a wider range of stakeholders including those not directly impacted by hazards, and a broader range of issues, situating hazards management within a wider context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Flood risk; Flooding; Framing; Place attachment; Sense of place","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; flooding; hazard assessment; risk assessment; sense of place; Cork [(CTY) Munster]; Ireland; Munster [Ireland]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061129968

Furthermore, it is accentuated with puddling of soil, which disrupts soil aggregates. Conservation agriculture (CA) practices involving zero tillage, crop residue management and suitable crop rotation can serve as better alternative to conventional agriculture for maintaining soil quality. Soil organic carbon is an important determinant of soil quality, playing critical role in food production, mitigation and adaptation to climate change as well as performs many ecosystem functions. To understand the turnover of soil carbon in different forms (Total organic carbon-TOC; aggregate associated carbon-AAC; particulate organic carbon- POC), soil aggregation and crop productivity with different management practices, one conventional agriculture based scenario and three CA based crop management scenarios namely conventional rice-wheat system (Sc1), partial CA based rice-wheat-mungbean system (Sc2), full CA-based rice-wheat-mungbean system (Sc3) and maize-wheat-mungbean system (Sc4) were evaluated. TOC was increased by 71%, 68% and 25% after 4 years of the experiment and 75%, 80% and 38% after 6 years of the experiment in Sc4, Sc3 and Sc2, respectively, over Sc1 at 0–15 cm soil depth. After 4 years of the experiment, 38.5% and 5.0% and after 6 years 50.8% and 24.4% improvement in total water stable aggregates at 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil depth, respectively was observed in CA-based scenarios over Sc1. Higher aggregate indices were associated with Sc3 at 0–15 cm soil depth than others. Among the size classes of aggregates, highest aggregate associated C (8.94 g kg −1 ) was retained in the 1-0.5 mm size class under CA-based scenarios. After 6 years, higher POC was associated with Sc4 (116%). CA-based rice/maize system (Sc3 and Sc4) showed higher productivity than Sc1. Therefore, CA could be a potential management practice in rice-wheat cropping system of Northwest India to improve the soil carbon pools through maintaining soil aggregation and productivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregate associated carbon; Crop management; Crop productivity; Particulate organic carbon; Soil organic carbon","Aggregates; Agricultural wastes; C (programming language); Climate change; Crops; Grain (agricultural product); Plants (botany); Productivity; Soil conservation; Soils; Aggregate associated carbons; Crop managements; Crop productivity; Particulate organic carbon; Soil organic carbon; Organic carbon; aggregation; agricultural management; cereal; climate change; crop improvement; crop production; crop residue; crop rotation; farming system; management practice; organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; semiarid region; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil quality; tillage; India; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062828545

In this study, in-traffic emissions of diesel-fueled city buses meeting enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle (EEV)and Euro VI emission limits and the effects of retrofitting of EEV buses were studied on-road by chasing the buses with a mobile laboratory in the Helsinki region, Finland. The average emission factors of particle number (PN), particle mass (PM1)and black carbon mass (BC)were 0.86·1015 1/kgfuel, 0.20 g/kgfuel and 0.10 g/kgfuel, respectively, for EEV buses. For Euro VI buses, the emissions were below 0.5·1015 1/kgfuel (PN), 0.07 g/kgfuel (PM1)and 0.02 g/kgfuel (BC), and the exhaust plume concentrations of these pollutants were close to the background concentrations. The emission factors of PM1 and BC of retrofitted EEV buses were at the level of Euro VI buses, but their particle number emissions varied significantly. On average, the EEV buses were observed to emit the largest amounts of nanocluster aerosol (NCA)(i.e., the particles with size between 1.3 and 3 nm). High NCA emissions were linked with high PN emissions.

In the case of staple crops, this potentially undermines household and national food security. We examine recent wheat rust epidemics and smallholders’ coping mechanisms in Ethiopia as a case study. Wheat is a major food crop in Ethiopia widely grown by smallholders. In 2010/11 a yellow rust epidemic affected over one-third of the national wheat area. Two waves of nationally representative household level panel data collected for the preceding wheat season (2009/10) and three years after (2013/14) the occurrence of the epidemic allow us to analyze the different coping mechanisms farmers used in response. Apart from using fungicides as ex-post coping mechanism, increasing wheat area under yellow rust resistant varieties, increasing diversity of wheat varieties grown, or a combination of these strategies were the main ex-ante coping mechanisms farmers had taken in reducing the potential effects of rust re-occurrence. Large-scale dis-adoption of highly susceptible varieties and replacement with new, rust resistant varieties was observed subsequent to the 2010/11 epidemic. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify the key factors associated with smallholder ex-ante coping strategies. Household characteristics, level of specialization in wheat and access to improved wheat seed were the major factors that explained observed choices. There was 29–41% yield advantage in increasing wheat area to the new, resistant varieties even under normal seasons with minimum rust occurrence in the field. Continuous varietal development in responding to emerging new rust races and supporting the deployment of newly released resistant varieties could help smallholders in dealing with rust challenges and maintaining improved yields in the rust-prone environments of Ethiopia. Given the global importance of both wheat and yellow rust and climate change dynamics study findings have relevance to other regions. © 2019 Jaleta et al.

In most mycorrhizal symbioses, plants provide sugars derived from photosynthesis to the fungi, whereas the fungi provide essential minerals to the plant. However, in some plants, the flow of carbon has reversed and the fungi provide carbon to the plants. These plants are called mycoheterotrophs. However, it remains unclear how and under which circumstances trophic modes change and whether transitions in trophic modes are associated with changes in mycorrhizal communities. Here, we review the available literature on mycorrhizal associations and trophic modes in plants. We first outline how trophic modes can be determined and how they differ across plants. We then investigate the evolutionary context under which mycoheterotrophy originated. We also examine the mycorrhizal communities associating with autotrophic, partially mycoheterotrophic and fully mycoheterotrophic plants within different plant families and investigate whether commonalities can be observed. Our overview shows that mycoheterotrophy has originated more than 40 times through evolutionary time and can be found in a wide range of plant groups, including liverworts, lycophytes, ferns, monocots and dicots. Partial mycoheterotrophy appears to be much more common than previously anticipated and represents an almost continuous gradient between autotrophy and full mycoheterotrophy. Comparison of the mycorrhizal communities associating with autotrophic, partial and full mycoheterotrophic plants indicates that, although they share some commonalities, shifts from autotrophy to full mycoheterotrophy are accompanied by either losses or shifts in mycorrhizal partners, suggesting that full or partial loss of photosynthesis selects for different mycorrhizal communities. Synthesis. Partial mycoheterotrophy appears to be much more common than previously thought and represents an almost continuous gradient from autotrophy to full mycoheterotrophy. Evolution to full mycoheterotrophy is challenging as it requires specific adaptations and often a switch to other mycorrhizal partners. More detailed analyses of the functionality of different mycorrhizal systems co-occurring in the roots of a single plant and the costs of mycorrhizal switching are needed to understand the precise mechanisms leading to full mycoheterotrophy. © 2019 The Authors.

This productive transformation seems to be opening up new opportunities for styles of living, ownership, place-making and manufacturing that are more sustainable, democratic and bespoke. However, the full potential of this transformation is not yet clear nor how it will interact with-in the UK context-ongoing crises in housing provision rooted in an increasingly financialised and critically unbalanced national economy, timid state housing policies and a longstanding cultural preoccupation with mortgaged 'bricks and mortar' housing. In this paper, we report on an ongoing mixed method project interrogating the technological, environmental and social implications of the emergence of offsite housing construction in the UK. To a degree, we situate this interrogation in the Northern English region of Yorkshire, an emerging focal point of the growing offsite construction industry in the UK but an area afflicted by entrenched, post-industrial economic imbalances. The results show that offsite house engineers, designers and builders are innovatively embracing digital methods, a low carbon agenda and new approaches to place-making but that they have had little role, so far, in resolving the deeper structural problems affecting housing production in the UK, bringing the sustainability of their innovation into question. © 2019 by the authors.","Embodied carbon; Mass customisation; Mass production; Modular housing; Sustainable prefab","construction industry; environmental change; housing provision; innovation; perception; social structure; sustainable development; technological development; England; United Kingdom; Yorkshire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070280752

Till now, the generation rate of C&amp;D waste has not been well understood or not explicitly documented in Bangladesh. This study aims to provide an approach to estimate C&amp;D waste generation using waste generation rates (WGR) through regression analysis. Furthermore, analyses the economic benefit of recycling C&amp;D waste. The results revealed that WGR 63.74 kg/m2 and 1615 kg/m2 for construction and demolition activities respectively. Approximately, in financial year (FY) 2016, 1.28 million tons (0.149 construction and 1.139 demolition) waste were generated in Dhaka city, of which the three largest proportions were concrete (60%), brick/block (21%) and mortar (9%). After collection they were dumped in either landfills or unauthorized places. Therefore, it can be summarized as: waste is a resource in wrong place. The results of this study indicate that rapid urbanization of Dhaka city would likely experience the peak in the generation of C&amp;D waste. This paper thus designates that C&amp;D waste recycling is an entrepreneurial activity worth venturing into and an opportunity for extracting economic and environmental benefits from waste.

In order to address some of these emission sources, alternative fuel technology vehicles are becoming more progressive and market ready. Transit agencies are making an effort to reduce their carbon footprint by adopting these technologies. The overarching objective of this paper is to aid transit agencies make more informed decisions regarding the process of replacing a diesel fleet with alternative-technology buses to minimize GHG emissions. This study investigates the complete course of fleet replacement using a deterministic mixed integer programming. Bus fleet replacement is optimized by minimizing the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of owning and operating a fleet of buses and required infrastructures while reducing GHG emission simultaneously. Buses operated by Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) were used as a case-study. Results also show a significant reduction in both cost and emission for optimized replacement schedule vs the unoptimized one. Results also show that a fleet consisting of 79% Battery Electric Bus and 21% Diesel Hybrid Bus yields the least cost solution which conforms to the other operational and environmental constraints. This study also includes various sensitivity tests, that illustrates that although the magnitude of the results may vary depending on the input data, the direction remains the same. The problem formulated in this study can help any transit agencies determine the most optimized solution to their fleet replacement problem under customizable constraints or desired set of outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","GHG emission; Mixed-integer program; Optimization; Parallel fleet replacement; Transit Bus","Bus transportation; Buses; Carbon footprint; Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Life cycle; Optimization; System buses; Alternative fuel technologies; Department of Transportation; Environmental constraints; Fleet replacement; GHG emission; Mixed integer programming; Mixed-integer programs; Transit bus; Fleet operations; alternative fuel; bus transport; carbon emission; carbon footprint; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; optimization; traffic emission; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066127684

However, the instability of the catalyst-sorbent matrix is a challenging obstacle for the gasification process. The direct current (dc) arc plasma melting method was employed to prepare a series of bifunctional catalysts (Ni-CaO) with varied Ni loadings, while TiO2 as polymorphic transition material was added to promote the stability of the catalyst. The catalyst samples were evaluated for cyclic CO2 capture and catalytic gasification of MSW using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a fixed-bed reactor, respectively. The obtained results showed that the addition of TiO2 into Ni-CaO catalyst-sorbent led to improvements in the stability of catalyst for CO2 capture. The gasification performance of a bifunctional Ni-CaO-TiO2 catalyst was evaluated on the basis of Ni loading, the catalyst to MSW (C/M) ratio, temperature, and steam rate. The results indicated that, after the addition of a Ni-CaO-TiO2 catalyst (20% Ni loading), the dry gas yield (DGY) increased from 0.75 to 1.74 Nm3/kg and H2 concentration increased from 35.1 to 57.7%. Meanwhile, the tar content decreased from 9.38 to 2.55% with the addition of the catalyst. The significant influences of Ni loading, C/M ratio, gasification temperature, and steam on product composition and characteristics were also evaluated. Tar analysis indicated that steam and catalyst addition resulted in tar reduction, which led to a higher DGY. Moreover, an unconventional method (i.e., thermal plasma technique) was employed for the catalyst preparation, which demonstrated promising results for MSW gasification with an industrial application prospect. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Chemical reactors; Gasification; Hydrogen production; Melting; Nickel; Plasma stability; Synthesis gas manufacture; Tar; Thermogravimetric analysis; Titanium dioxide; Bi-functional catalysts; Catalyst preparation; Catalytic gasification; Gasification process; Gasification temperatures; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Polymorphic transitions; Thermal plasma technique; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070495441

During El Niño, rainfall is less while La Niña more rainfall than normal drop over the region. To cope with climate change issues where ENSO is very likely to occur in future time, an appropriate mitigation is required to conduct for instance: managing forest resources and land use by reducing deforestation and land conversion, the control of fossil fuel burning, and the most important thing is to establish a renewable energy as an effort to implement sustainable green energy in the future as well as climate risk reduction. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) moiety has been investigated as a candidate for enhancing the activity for CO2 electrochemical reduction to C2+ products. The reduction process is affected by catalytic grain boundary, local pH, residual oxygen atoms, and other features of the catalysts. In order to understand the detailed mechanism, we performed in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (in situ ATR-SEIRAS) measurements for CO2 reduction using several different Cu electrodes whose oxidation states are controlled. The spectroscopic investigations demonstrate that a copper oxide electrode (Cu2O) has low activity against CO2 reduction on the basis of low-level detection of CO as an intermediate of CO2 reduction. On the other hand, other Cu electrodes possessing an OH layer on the Cu surface (Cu(OH)2/Cu) and metallic Cu exhibit higher CO2 reduction activity with significantly greater detection of produced CO. When the metallic Cu electrode is used, only one peak (2060 cm-1) assignable to CO bound to the atop site of Cu is observed. However, additional peaks are detected in the range of 1900-2100 cm-1 when the Cu(OH)2/Cu electrode is used. To understand these findings, the adsorption energy of CO on a Cu(OH)2/Cu electrode and the CO stretching frequency were evaluated by performing DFT calculations. The adsorption energy is enhanced and the CO stretching frequencies are shifted to lower energy in comparison with those using a metallic Cu electrode. These results indicate that it is predominantly favorable to adsorb some CO molecules near the OH moiety of the Cu(OH)2/Cu electrode and to induce interactions of CO molecules with each other. This observation is consistent with the results of controlled potential electrolysis (CPE), which generates C2+ products as previously reported. When CPE is carried out in D2O solution, residual and/or adsorbed OD- groups on Cu are detected by ATR-SEIRAS and the surface of the Cu(OH)2/Cu electrode is confirmed to be metallic Cu, as measured by in situ Raman and XPS. From the ATR-SEIRAS experiments when switching from under CO2 to Ar during the electrochemical reduction, the OH layer is suggested to prevent deactivation of the Cu electrode via formation of the CO layer, which is detected as a bridge-bounded form on the metallic Cu electrode. The above findings indicate that the OH layer provides the advantage of attracting CO molecules closer to each other while reducing them to C2+ products without any degradation during electrolysis. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","CO2 reduction; Cu electrode; DFT calculation; electrochemical catalysis; hydroxide layer; SEIRAS","Absorption spectroscopy; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Copper oxides; Density functional theory; Electrolysis; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Grain boundaries; Light absorption; Metals; Molecules; CO2 reduction; Cu electrode; DFT calculation; Electrochemical catalysis; Hydroxide layers; SEIRAS; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068188104

Alternate renewable and sustainable sources have become the ultimate solution to overcome the expected depletion of fossil fuels. The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to liquid (BtL) transportation fuels seems to be a promising path and presents advantages over first generation biofuels and fossil fuels. Therefore, development of BtL systems is critical to increase the potential of this resource in a sustainable and economic way. Conversion of lignocellulosic BtL transportation fuels, such as, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel can be accomplished through various thermochemical processes and processing routes. The major steps for the production of BtL fuels involve feedstock selection, physical pretreatment, production of bio-oil, upgrading of bio-oil to transportation fuels and recovery of value-added products.

For some, unions represent particularistic interest groups that pursue the economic interests of their members at the expense of the environment. For others, they represent the organized political voice of a working class demanding safe and healthy work environments and communities. We also consider how the effect of unions is conditioned by institutional context, including the presence of employment protection laws and the degree of corporatist governance. We use error correction models (ECMs) to examine the relationship between union density and GHG emissions among 18 affluent countries between the years of 1990 and 2010. We find union density to be associated with reduced GHG emissions, net of controls. We also find that unions have a greater reducing capacity when they are able to participate in policy formation, but that capacity is reduced with the presence of strong employment protection laws. We conclude that further research is needed before policy decisions are made and hope that this study opens up new discussions about the role of labor in addressing climate change. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; GHG emissions; jobs versus the environment; labor unions; treadmill theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057307604

Most countries and scientific research communities are endeavoring to solve the climate change issue due to global warming by reducing GHG emissions. At present, most of the researches are focusing on decreasing the dependency on fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy. Nevertheless, this transition still faced major obstacles such as require new infrastructure, technology and market failures. To solve this problem, three CO2 emission reduction strategies can be used, namely CO2 capture and storage (CCS), CO2 utilisation and CO2 conversion. Among these potential approaches, the utilisation and conversion of CO2 are preferable since it converts harmful gas into valuable products. Moreover, conversion of CO2 is a key element for sustainable development towards the low-carbon economy. Furthermore, the application of carbon dioxide conversion technologies involves CO2 capture and reprocess would able to stabilise the atmospheric GHG levels and make a good prospect to transform CO2 into value-added products. A recent advance in electrochemical CO2 conversion has opened an existing possibility of utilisation of CO2 as useful for fuel generation and produce a valuable commodity chemical. This short review highlights the current development related to an electrochemical conversion of CO2 between 2014 and 2018. In addition, this review discusses recent technologies and approaches through electrochemical reduction using electrocatalyst and biocatalyst. This review also aims in providing the research community with current research in this electrochemical field also inspiring new ideas in the CO2 electrochemical conversion technology. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070073292

However, the succession of the uptake of carbon leaving the roots by distinct rhizosphere microbiota has rarely been resolved between microbial kingdoms. This can provide valuable insights on the niche partitioning of primary rhizodeposit consumption, as well as on community interactions in plant-derived carbon flows in soil. Here, we have traced the flow of fresh plant assimilates to rhizosphere microbiota of maize (Zea mays L.) by rRNA-stable isotope probing (SIP). Carbon flows involving bacteria, unicellular fungi, as well as protists were observed over 5 and 8 days. Surprisingly, labeling of Paraglomerales and several bacteria including Opitutus, Mucliaginibacter and Massilia spp. was especially apparent in soil surrounding the strict rhizosphere after 5 d. This highlights the central role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as a shunt for fresh plant assimilates to soil microbes not directly influenced by root exudation. Distinct trophic webs involving different flagellates, amoeba and ciliates were also observed in rhizosphere and surrounding soil, while labeling of filamentous saprotrophic Ascomycota or Basidiomycota was not apparent. This challenges the proposed “sapro-rhizosphere” concept and demonstrates the utility of rRNA-SIP to disentangle inter-kingdom microbial relationships in the rhizosphere. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Amplicon sequencing; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Mycorrhizosphere; Rhizodeposition; Rhizosphere microbes; rRNA-stable isotope probing","Bacteria; Carbon; Fungi; Grain (agricultural product); Isotopes; RNA; Amplicons; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Mycorrhizosphere; Rhizodeposition; Rhizosphere microbes; Stable-isotope probing; Soils; arbuscular mycorrhiza; bacterium; carbon flux; fungus; maize; molecular analysis; niche partitioning; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; stable isotope; Ascomycota; Bacteria (microorganisms); Basidiomycota; Ciliophora; Fungi; Massilia; Mastigophora (flagellates); Opitutus; Paraglomerales; Protista; Protofungi; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063624091

However, the large volume of energy produced, the copious amounts of accompanying consumption data, and the uncertainties germane to intermittent energy sources will result in the real-time energy management of the IoE in the future being much more difficult to deal with than that of traditional centralized-controlled power generation systems. In this work, a real-time power scheduling system based on the architecture of the IoE is proposed to tackle the complicated real-time energy management problems. We divide the whole power network into different geographical regional grids under a hierarchical framework, and the scheduling process is activated at the regional grid if a power shortage is estimated to happen during a fixed time period ahead. After electricity consumption data and renewable generation data are collected at the prosumer level, the governing regional grid schedules the usage of electricity for the prosumers by considering the efficiency of the use of distributed renewables and the peak shaving of the electricity load. Excess electricity generated in a regional grid is allowed to be allocated to others facing power supply shortages, whereby a reduction of emissions during peak load periods and the maximal utilization of distributed renewables can be achieved. Notably, the charging management of moving electric vehicles is also included in the proposed power scheduling mechanism. The simulation results reveal that the proposed real-time power scheduling system for the IoE can efficiently utilize renewable generation, lessen the demand of traditional power, and balance peak and off-peak period loads in an electricity market in real time. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","emission reduction; Internet of Energy; optimization; real-time power scheduling; renewables","Electric load distribution; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy management; Energy management systems; Information management; Network architecture; Optimization; Real time systems; Scheduling; Electricity-consumption; Emission reduction; Intermittent energy source; Power generation systems; Power Scheduling; Real-time energy management; Reduction of emissions; Renewables; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065175296

This species is highly dependent on alpine habitats, which are considered vulnerable to rapid climate change. This study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on potential L. muta japonica habitat based on predicted changes to alpine vegetation, to identify population vulnerability under future climatic conditions for conservation planning. We developed species distribution models, which considered the structure of the alpine ecosystem by incorporating spatial hierarchy on specific environmental factors to assess the potential habitats for L. muta japonica under current and future climates. We used 24 general circulation models (GCMs) for 2081-2100 as future climate conditions. Results: The predicted potential habitat for L. muta japonica was similar to the actual distribution of the territories in the study area of Japan's northern Alps (36.25-36.5°N, 137.5-137.7°E). Future potential habitat for L. muta japonica was projected to decrease to 0.4% of the current potential habitat in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in alpine vegetation communities. Some potential habitats in the central and northwestern part of the study area were predicted to be sustained in the future, depending on the GCMs. Conclusions: Our model results predicted that the potential habitats for L. muta japonica in Japan's northern Alps, which provides core habitat for this subspecies, would be vulnerable by 2081-2100. Small sustainable habitats may serve as refugia, facilitating the survival of L. muta japonica populations under future climatic conditions. Impact assessment studies of the effect of climate change on L. muta japonica habitats at a nationwide scale are urgently required to establish effective conservation planning for this species, which includes identifying candidate areas for assisted migration as an adaptive strategy. © 2019 The Author(s).","Climate change impact; Lagopus muta japonica; Potential habitat; Rock Ptarmigan; Species distribution model","alpine environment; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; ecological modeling; future prospect; gamebird; habitat selection; nature conservation; spatial distribution; vegetation dynamics; Alps; Japan; Japonica; Lagopus; Lagopus mutus; climate change; ecosystem; Japan; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068855462

However, it has always been omitted from the international emission mitigation pledges. The delayed mitigation process in this area may slow down the process of global CO2 emission control. In this article, we evaluated the potential to realize the emission mitigation targets in air transport through biofuel and estimated the corresponding cost. The emission from international air transport of Palau and Seychelles was taken as the example. Then, the emission caused by each airline to these two islands was calculated by the distance-based method, with information of the travelers' arrival data, fuel consumption of different aircraft types, routes, and aircraft seat data. Future scenarios with and without commitment to CO2 mitigation targets were predicted to evaluate the emission difference. Then, we estimated the amount of biofuel required to fill the emission gap, and the corresponding cost based on the future biofuel price prediction. The results show that distance is the determining factor of international air transport emission per capita. The component of origin can decrease the aggregated emission per capita to small island destinations by 0.5-2%. The accumulated emission gaps are 3.15 Mt and 9 Mt for Palau and Seychelles, which indicates that 7.64 and 19.34 Mb of biofuel are needed for emission mitigation, respectively. The corresponding costs are $27-163 million and $72-424 million per year. © 2019 by the authors.","Air transport; Biofuel; CO2 mitigation; Cost; Small islands","air transportation; biofuel; carbon emission; cost analysis; emission control; fuel consumption; small island state; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068804615

These estimates are useful to individuals interested in water resources, ecological function, and avalanche forecasting. They can also be assimilated into models to help improve predictions of total water volumes over large regions. The conversion of depth to SWE is particularly valuable since snow depth measurements are far more numerous than costlier and more complex SWE measurements. Our model regresses SWE against snow depth (h), day of water year (DOY) and climatological (30-year normal) values for winter (December, January, February) precipitation (PPTWT), and the difference (TD) between mean temperature of the warmest month and mean temperature of the coldest month, producing a power-law relationship. Relying on climatological normals rather than weather data for a given year allows our model to be applied at measurement sites lacking a weather station. Separate equations are obtained for the accumulation and the ablation phases of the snowpack. The model is validated against a large database of snow pillow measurements and yields a bias in SWE of less than 2mm and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) in SWE of less than 60mm. The model is additionally validated against two completely independent sets of data: one from western North America and one from the northeastern United States.

Ways in which the state can govern industrial decarbonisation and contributes to green state theory are explored by addressing a largely ignored issue: the green state’s industrial relations and its role in industrial governance. With insights from a Swedish case study, the tension between the state’s economic imperative and ecological concerns in greening industry are shown to persist. However, as the energy-intensive industry’s previously privileged position in the economy is weakening, industry is opened to decarbonisation strategies. While the case exposes a number of governance challenges, it also suggests potential areas where the state can pursue decarbonisation in energy-intensive industry and points the way to an active role of the green state in governing industrial decarbonisation and greening industry. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

There is increasing evidence for impacts of climate and other drivers on plant community change, and fragmented habitats are predicted to be much less resilient to negative impacts on biodiversity and other services. Within Europe, Scotland's native forests are highly fragmented and now cover 4% of the land after many centuries of degradation and loss, but little is known about how their species composition has changed. We recorded long-term vegetation change (from resurvey data) and examined the relationships with climate, pollutant deposition and grazing as key drivers of change, focusing on four forest types: pine, ash, acid- and base-rich oak-birch. All four forest types showed dynamic compositional change during 30–50 years between surveys, with increased species richness and decreased diversity. There was no evidence for homogenisation - the opposite was the case for all except pine (no change). Analyses indicate significant and varied climate, pollution and grazing impacts; NHy deposition showed the most frequent association with species compositional changes. Notable species changes include increases in pteridophytes and declines in forb cover, and a doubling in frequency and cover of Fagus sylvatica between surveys. Our findings suggest a possible extinction debt, with many more species declining than increasing between surveys. This trajectory of change and our other findings indicate a pressing need for mitigation management to reduce the risks of future species losses, with forest expansion planning explicitly considering spatial location in relation to existing native forest and those plant species identified as most at risk. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity change; Climate; Extinction-debt; Forest; Fragmentation; Pine","adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; coniferous tree; conservation management; dicotyledon; forest ecosystem; habitat fragmentation; long-term change; plant community; pteridophyte; species diversity; species richness; vegetation type; Europe; Scotland; United Kingdom; Fagus sylvatica; Pteridophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064710174

Most prominently, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals in particular require data on biomass to monitor progress. Unprecedented opportunities to provide forest biomass data are created by a series of upcoming space-based missions, many of which provide open data targeted at large areas and better spatial resolution biomass monitoring than has previously been achieved. We assess various policy needs for biomass data and recommend a long-term collaborative effort among forest biomass data producers and users to meet these needs. A gap remains, however, between what can be achieved in the research domain and what is required to support policy making and meet reporting requirements. There is no single biomass dataset that serves all users in terms of definition and type of biomass measurement, geographic area, and uncertainty requirements, and whether there is need for the most recent up-to-date biomass estimate or a long-term biomass trend. The research and user communities should embrace the potential strength of the multitude of upcoming missions in combination to provide for these varying needs and to ensure continuity for long-term data provision which one-off research missions cannot provide. International coordination bodies such as Global Forest Observations Initiative (GFOI), Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), and Global Observation of Forest Cover and Land Dynamics (GOFC‐GOLD) will be integral in addressing these issues in a way that fulfils these needs in a timely fashion. Further coordination work should particularly look into how space-based data can be better linked with field reference data sources such as forest plot networks, and there is also a need to ensure that reference data cover a range of forest types, management regimes, and disturbance regimes worldwide. © 2019, The Author(s).","Carbon stocks; Climate change; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD); Remote sensing; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","Climate change; Conservation; Deforestation; Distributed computer systems; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Open Data; Planning; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Biomass measurements; Carbon stocks; Earth observation satellites; Forest conservation; Global observation; International coordination; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD); Space based mission; Biomass; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental management; environmental policy; remote sensing; satellite data; sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061374917

The produced hydrochar is made suitable for agricultural applications by removing plant growing inhibitory substances. Wet household waste such as fruit peel, coffee grounds, inedible vegetable parts, or wet lignocellulosic material in general, are treated in presence of water at 215 °C and 21 bar in an autoclave, i.e., by hydrothermal carbonization. All these leftovers have a considerable water content of up to 90 weight % (wt%). Adding water extends the procedure to drier materials such as nutshells or even garden prunings and compostable polymers, i.e., the plastic bag for collection of the leftovers. Usually, the resulting carbon material, called hydrochar, produces a negative effect on plant growth when added to soil. It is supposed that this effect is caused by adsorbed phytotoxic compounds. A simple post-treatment under inert atmosphere (absence of oxygen) at 275 °C removes these substances. Therefore, the raw hydrochar is placed on a glass frit of a vertical tubular quartz reactor. A nitrogen gas flow is applied in down-flow direction. The tube is heated to the desired temperature by means of a heating mantle for up to one hour. The success of the thermal treatment is easily quantified by thermogravimetry (TG), carried out in air. A weight loss is determined when the temperature of 275 °C is reached, since volatile content is desorbed. Its amount is reduced in the final material, in comparison to the untreated hydrochar. The two-step treatment converts household leftovers, including compostable bags employed for their collection, into a carbon material that may serve as plant growth promoter and, at the same time, as a carbon sink for climate change mitigation. © 2019 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.","Autoclave; Carbon capture and storage; CCS; Chemistry; Climate change mitigation; Compostable polymer; Continuous flow reactor; Hydrothermal carbonization; Issue 149; Organic fraction of municipal solid waste; Phytotoxicity; TG; Thermogravimetry","carbon; nitrogen; organic compound; chemistry; composting; housing; procedures; soil; temperature; waste; Carbon; Composting; Housing; Nitrogen; Organic Chemicals; Soil; Temperature; Waste Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070440814

Methods: We estimate ZIP code-level changes in two different-but related-exposure metrics: total PM2.5 concentrations and exposure to coal-fired power plant emissions. We associate changes in 10 health outcome rates among approximately 30 million US Medicare beneficiaries with exposure changes between 2005 and 2012 using two difference-in-difference regression approaches designed to mitigate observed and unobserved confounding. Results: Rates per 10,000 person-years of six cardiac and respiratory health outcomes-all cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, cardiovascular stroke, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and respiratory tract infections-decreased by between 7.89 and 1.95 per decrease in PM2.5, with comparable decreases in coal exposure leading to slightly larger rate decreases. Results for acute myocardial infarction, heart rhythm disorders, and peripheral vascular disease were near zero and/or mixed between the various exposure metrics and analyses. A secondary analysis found that nonlinearities in relationships between changing health outcome rates and coal exposure may explain differences in their associations. Conclusions: The direct analyses of emissions reductions estimate substantial health benefits via coal power plant emission and PM2.5 concentration reductions. Differing responses associated with changes in the two exposure metrics underscore the importance of isolating source-specific impacts from those due to total PM2.5 exposure. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Existing pond systems at mine sites could be used for N removal through denitrification and we investigated capacity in tailings and clarification pond sediments at an iron-ore mine site. Despite differences in microbial community structure in the two ponds, the potential denitrification rates were similar, although carbon limited. Therefore, a microcosm experiment in which we amended sediment from the clarification pond with acetate, cellulose or green algae as possible carbon sources was conducted during 10 weeks under denitrifying conditions. Algae and acetate treatments showed efficient nitrate removal and increased potential denitrification rates, whereas cellulose was not different from the control. Denitrifiers were overall more abundant than bacteria performing dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) or anaerobic ammonium oxidation, although DNRA bacteria increased in the algae treatment and this coincided with accumulation of ammonium. The algae addition also caused higher emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The bacterial community in this treatment had a large proportion of Bacteroidia, sulfate reducing taxa and bacteria known as fermenters. Functional gene abundances indicated an imbalance between organisms that produce N2O in relation to those that can reduce it, with the algae treatment showing the lowest relative capacity for N2O reduction. These findings show that pond sediments have the potential to contribute to mitigating nitrate levels in water from mining industry, but it is important to consider the type of carbon supply as it affects the community composition, which in turn can lead to unwanted processes and increased greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Algae; Clarification pond; Greenhouse gases; Nitrate removal; Tailings pond; Water treatment","Algae; Bacteria; Carbon; Cellulose; Clarification; Clarifiers; Denitrification; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Iron ores; Lakes; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Bacterial community composition; Dissimilatory nitrate reduction; Enhancing denitrifications; Microbial community structures; Nitrate removal; Potential denitrification; Tailings pond; Nitrogen removal; acetic acid; ammonia; carbon; cellulose; methane; nitrate; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide; alga; bacterium; community composition; community structure; freshwater sediment; greenhouse gas; methane; microbial community; mordenite; nitrate; nitrous oxide; pond; subarctic region; water treatment; anaerobic metabolism; Article; carbon source; community structure; denitrification; gene function; green alga; microbial community; microcosm; mining; nonhuman; pond; priority journal; sediment; soil amendment; bacterium; Algae; Bacteria; Carbon; Cellulose; Clarification; Clarifiers; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlorophyta; Bacteria; Carbon; Denitrification; Nitrous Oxide; Ponds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064467376

For appropriate synoptic forcing and/or topographic channeling, katabatic surges occur, which result in warm signatures also over adjacent ice shelves. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice surface temperature (IST) data are used to detect warm signatures over the Antarctic for the winter periods 2002-2017. In addition, high-resolution (5 km) regional climate model data is used for the years of 2002 to 2016. We present a case study and a climatology of wind-induced IST anomalies for the Ross Ice Shelf and the eastern Weddell Sea. The IST anomaly distributions show maxima around 10-15K for the slopes, but values of more than 25K are also found. Katabatic surges represent a strong climatological signal with a mean warm anomaly of more than 5K on more than 120 days per winter for the Byrd Glacier and the Nimrod Glacier on the Ross Ice Shelf.

Quantitatively evaluating the contributions of VOC sources to ozone (O3) formation could provide valuable information for emissions control and photochemical pollution abatement. This study analyzed continuous measurements of VOCs during the photochemical season in 2014 at a receptor site (Heshan site, HS) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, where photochemical pollution has been a long-standing issue. The averaged mixing ratio of measured VOCs was 34±3 ppbv, with the largest contribution from alkanes (17±2 ppbv, 49 %), followed by aromatics, alkenes and acetylene. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was applied to resolve the anthropogenic sources of VOCs, coupled with a photochemicalage- based parameterization that better considers the photochemical processing effects. Four anthropogenic emission sources were identified and quantified, with gasoline vehicular emission as the most significant contributor to the observed VOCs, followed by diesel vehicular emissions, biomass burning and solvent usage. The O3 photochemical formation regime at the HS was identified as VOC-limited by a photochemical box model with the master chemical mechanism (PBM-MCM). The PBM-MCM model results also suggested that vehicular emission was the most important source to the O3 formation, followed by biomass burning and solvent usage. Sensitivity analysis indicated that combined VOC and NOx emission controls would effectively reduce incremental O3 formation when the ratios of VOCto- NOx emission reductions were &gt;3:8 for diesel vehicular emission, &gt;4:6 for solvent usage, &gt; 4.6 for biomass burning and 3.3 for gasoline vehicular emission. Based on the above results, a brief review of the policies regarding the control of vehicular emissions and biomass burning in the PRD region from a regional perspective were also provided in this study. It reveals that different policies have been, and continue to be, implemented and formulated and could help to alleviate the photochemical pollution in the PRD region. Nevertheless, evaluation of the cost-benefit of each policy is still needed to improve air quality. © 2019 Author(s).

Results reveal that the Yudu eggs can be identified as representatives of the known oospecies Macroolithus rugustus within Elongatoolithidae based on external shape, size, ornamentation, and internal microstructure between the columnar and cone layers. The major element found in Macroolithus rugustus shells is Ca, while trace elements mainly include Sr, Ba, As, Cr, Mn, Pb, Cd, La, and Ir, characterised by Ir and Sr abnormalities, as well as the toxic elements As and Pb. Enrichment of trace elements in shells might be due to the diet of dinosaurs and subsequent deposition in eggs, consistent with global Ir anomalies and the regional enrichment of trace elements. δ13C values for Macroolithus rugustus ranging between −8.81‰ and −7.65‰ are indicative of C3 plants with relatively high CO2 concentration and low mean annual precipitation (MAP), while δ18O values ranging between −8.51‰ and 3.14‰ indicate relatively low humidity and the alteration of water sources of female dinosaur. The Sr and Ca contents as well as δ18O values of eggshells could be associated with the drinking water and food materials together with dissolved bone apatite. In light of the red-brown colour of surrounding rocks, high Fe composition revealed by macroelement analysis, and the presence of a C3 vegetation with low MAP, the palaeoenvironment of Yudu dinosaur nesting area was most likely to be fluvial and the palaeoclimate was semi-arid to arid, which is conducive to the preservation of eggs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dinosaur eggs; Jiangxi Province; Late Cretaceous; Palaeoenvironment; Stable isotopes; Trace elements; Yudu County","Cretaceous; dinosaur; egg; geochemistry; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; stable isotope; trace element; China; Jiangxi; Dinosauria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062414468

The forward convolution fitting of the laboratory data along with ab initio and statistical calculations revealed that both reactions have no entrance barrier, proceed via indirect (complex-forming) reaction dynamics involving C6H7 intermediates with life times longer than their rotation period(s), and are initiated by the addition of the 1-propynyl radical with its radical center to the π-electron density of the unsaturated hydrocarbon at the terminal carbon atoms of methylacetylene (C1) and allene (C1/C3). In the methylacetylene system, the initial collision complexes undergo unimolecular decomposition via tight exit transition states by atomic hydrogen loss, forming dimethyldiacetylene (CH3CCCCCH3) and 1-propynylallene (H3CCCHCCCH2) in overall exoergic reactions (123 and 98 kJ mol-1) with a branching ratio of 9.4 ± 0.1; the methyl group of the 1-propynyl reactant acts solely as a spectator. On the other hand, in the allene system, our experimental data exhibit the formation of the fulvene (c-C5H4CH2) isomer via a six-step reaction sequence with two higher energy isomers - hexa-1,2-dien-4-yne (H2CCCHCCCH3) and hexa-1,4-diyne (HCCCH2CCCH3) - also predicted to be formed based on our statistical calculations. The pathway to fulvene advocates that, in the allene-1-propynyl system, the methyl group of the 1-propynyl reactant is actively engaged in the reaction mechanism to form fulvene. Because both reactions are barrierless and exoergic and all transition states are located below the energy of the separated reactants, the hydrogen-deficient C6H6 isomers identified in our investigation are predicted to be synthesized in low-temperature environments, such as in hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres of planets and their moons such as Titan along with cold molecular clouds such as Taurus Molecular Cloud-1. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Calculations; Clouds; Decomposition; Dynamics; Hydrocarbons; Isomers; Molecular beams; Plants (botany); Temperature; Chemical reaction dynamics; Crossed molecular beams; Elementary reaction; Low temperature environment; Statistical calculations; Terminal carbon atoms; Unimolecular decompositions; Unsaturated hydrocarbons; Reaction intermediates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069270992

Limiting mortality in the yearling (1–2 yr old) age class is a primary consideration, and regional differences in climate, habitat characteristics, hunting regulations, and hunter behavior complicate the understanding of how specific factors influence the risk of mortality. We used Cox proportional hazard modeling to determine the effects of body size, mean distance to road, dispersal behaviors, use of forested land, and use of land open to public hunting on the risk of mortality for a population of radio-collared, yearling males (n = 76) in Sussex County, Delaware, USA. Annual survival averaged 0.55 (95% CI = 0.45–0.68), with harvest accounting for 79% (26/33) of all mortalities. Measurements of body size (chest girth, shoulder height, and total length; cm) influenced dispersal probability but not dispersal distance. The best approximating model for mortality risk included a covariate for landownership, whereby mortality risk increased on public land. Among males who dispersed, longer-distance dispersal was associated with reduced mortality, which contradicts previous research describing dispersal as a high-risk behavior. The effect of landownership on mortality risk has not been previously identified, especially when regulations regarding harvest of yearling males are similar between landownership types. We observed annual survival rates of 0.69 (95% CI = 0.57–0.82) for deer apparently using private land exclusively during the hunting season, and 0.20 (95% CI = 0.11–0.48) for deer that used public land during the hunting season. Survival rates on private land were comparable to those of other regions actively managing male age structure. These results suggest survival of yearling males in the region is influenced by hunter harvest and the risks associated with dispersal may be minimal in areas where harvest pressure is low, although hunter harvest on public land may limit male age structure on a localized scale. © The Wildlife Society, 2019. © The Wildlife Society, 2019","Delaware; dispersal; harvest management; Odocoileus virginianus; public land; survival; white-tailed deer","age class; body size; deer; dispersal; hunting; landownership; mortality risk; private land; survival; Delaware; Sussex County [Delaware]; United States; Cervidae; Odocoileus virginianus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068908228

Here, we present a study utilizing 69 lake samplings in boreal Quebec, Canada, identifying variables driving the success of phytoplankton that have a capacity for mixotrophy and pointing to the underlying mechanisms. We found that the success of mixotrophs (% of total biomass) was positively influenced by both colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM) and dissolved CO2 concentration but limited by the abundance of crustacean zooplankton. The effect of cDOM manifested as a consequence of limited autotrophic phytoplankton biomass in lakes with reduced light penetration. We observed a nonlinear (u-shaped) relation between CO2 and mixotrophs, with biomass favored at both low and high CO2 concentrations. A reduced fitness of mixotrophs at near-atmospheric CO2 concentrations is likely owing to the costs of rapidly switching between or maintaining multiple trophic strategies. The abundance of zooplankton had a negative effect on mixotroph biomass but a positive effect on autotrophic phytoplankton. We also found that while the community composition of potentially mixotrophic phytoplankton was to some degree likely influenced by zooplankton biomass, composition was unaffected by the CO2 and cDOM gradients. Overall, this study highlights mixotrophy in boreal lake systems as a strategy of persistence, with the maintenance of a moderate but constant presence across a changing gradient of light and trophic conditions. The results of our study support the hypothesis that phytoplankton with a capacity for mixotrophy provide a superior and stable stoichiometric food source for zooplankton, implicating mixotrophs as a vital component of boreal lake food webs. © 2019 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"abundance; biomass; carbon dioxide; community composition; crustacean; dissolved organic matter; food web; lacustrine environment; mixotrophy; phytoplankton; zooplankton; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Crustacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068470267

We studied three hypotheses related to propagule limitation, stress-dominance, and limiting similarity concepts in community assembly in a restoration field experiment with a trait-based null model approach. The experiment aimed to assist the recovery of sand grassland on former arable land in the Kiskunság, Pannonian biogeographic region, Europe. Treatments included initial seeding of five grassland species, carbon amendment, low-intensity mowing, and combinations in 1 m by 1 m plots in three old fields from 2003 to 2008. The distribution of 10 individual plant traits was compared to the null model and the effect of time and treatments were tested with linear mixed effect models. Initial seeding had the most visible impact on species and trait composition confirming propagule limitation in grassland recovery. Reducing nutrient availability through carbon amendment strengthened trait convergence for length of flowering as expected based on the stress-dominance hypothesis. Mowing changed trait divergence to convergence for plant height with a strengthening impact with time, supporting our hypothesis of increasing dominance of limiting similarity with time. Our results support the idea that community assembly is simultaneously influenced by propagule limitation and multiple trait-based processes that act through different traits. The limited impact of manipulating environmental filtering and limiting similarity compared to seeding, however, supports the view that only targeting the dispersal and environmental filters in parallel would improve restoration outcome. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration","carbon amendment; grassland restoration; limiting similarity; mowing; plant traits; seeding","biogeography; carbon; grassland; mowing; plant; propagule; restoration ecology; seeding; Hungary; Kiskunsag",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063273068

Here we describe the participating methods and first results from the first experiment, using “perfect” reanalysis (and reanalysis-driven regional climate model (RCM)) predictors to assess the intrinsic performance of the methods for downscaling precipitation and temperatures over a set of 86 stations representative of the main climatic regions in Europe. This study constitutes the largest and most comprehensive to date intercomparison of statistical downscaling methods, covering the three common downscaling approaches (perfect prognosis, model output statistics—including bias correction—and weather generators) with a total of over 50 downscaling methods representative of the most common techniques. Overall, most of the downscaling methods greatly improve (reanalysis or RCM) raw model biases and no approach or technique seems to be superior in general, because there is a large method-to-method variability. The main factors most influencing the results are the seasonal calibration of the methods (e.g., using a moving window) and their stochastic nature. The particular predictors used also play an important role in cases where the comparison was possible, both for the validation results and for the strength of the predictor–predictand link, indicating the local variability explained. However, the present study cannot give a conclusive assessment of the skill of the methods to simulate regional future climates, and further experiments will be soon performed in the framework of the EURO-CORDEX initiative (where VALUE activities have merged and follow on).

Critical to addressing this important public-health issue is the effective dissemination of air quality data, information about adverse health effects, and the necessary mitigation measures. However, recent studies have shown that even when public get data on air quality and understand its importance, people do not necessarily take actions to protect their health or exhibit pro-environmental behaviors to address the problem. Most existing studies on public attitude and response to air quality are based on offline studies, with a limited number of survey participants and over a limited number of geographical locations. For a larger survey size and a wider set of locations, we collected Twitter data for a period of nearly 2 years and analyzed these data for three major cities: Paris, London, and New Delhi. We identify the three hashtags in each city that best correlate the frequency of tweets with local air quality. Using tweets with these hashtags, we determined that people’s response to air quality across all three cities was nearly identical when considering relative changes in air pollution. Using machine-learning algorithms, we determined that health concerns dominated public response when air quality degraded, with the strongest increase in concern being in New Delhi, where pollution levels are the highest among the three cities studied. The public call for political solutions when air quality worsens is consistent with similar findings with offline surveys in other cities. We also conducted an unsupervised learning analysis to extract topics from tweets in Delhi and studied their evolution over time and with changing air quality. Our analysis helped extract relevant words or features associated with different air quality–related topics such as air pollution policy and health. Also, the topic modeling analysis revealed niche topics associated with sporadic air quality events, such as fireworks during festivals and the air quality impact on an outdoor sport event. Our approach shows that a tweet-based analysis can enable social scientists to probe and survey public response to events such as air quality in a timely fashion and help policy makers respond appropriately. © The Author(s) 2019.","air quality; data mining; machine learning; online social networks; PM; text classification; topic modeling; Twitter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081954950

The results showed that average PM concentrations were 3.3 times higher inside auto-rickshaws than ambient level. The highest PM fractions concentrations were observed during congestion period (844 μgm−3 for PM10, 458 μgm−3 for PM2.5 and 302 μgm−3 for PM1) of auto-rickshaw riding. The survey reports showed that eighty percent of drivers believed they were more exposed than a non-driver. More than half of auto-rickshaws drives believed, alternative fuel like CNG was a better way to reduce the air pollution. In the health screening, about 23% and 20% of auto-rickshaws drivers complained of the ‘body pain and eye irritation’ and ‘a headache’, respectively. Overall, the total RDDs values were estimated 4.8 (PM10-2.5), 8.8 (PM2.5-1) and 10.1 (PM1) times higher compared to ambient level to auto-rickshaw drivers in an average day. Based on this result, the fine particulate matter showed in a higher risk of auto-rickshaw drivers in Dhanbad city. This study indicated that driver awareness of traffic air pollution was limited.

In this article, we present a novel approach for direct laser writing of heavily reduced graphene oxide films by nanosecond laser melting of amorphous carbon on silicon (001) substrates under ambient conditions. Ultrafast quenching from the undercooled melt state above the melting threshold energy density (Ed) of 0.4 J/cm2 leads to the formation of large-area rGO films. The first-order phase transformation of liquid carbon into graphene is triggered by low undercooling at the C melt/silicon interface. The laser-irradiated rGO films exhibit electron mobility of 12.56 cm2/V s and charge carrier concentration of -1.2 × 1021/cm3 at 300 K. Temperature-dependent electrical measurements and Raman spectroscopic investigations suggest low disorder and charge transport via 2D Mott variable range hopping between the graphene islands for rGO films. The localization length corresponding to the size of these graphitic domains is 3 nm. The ultrafast regrowth of rGO creates an atomically sharp interface between n-type rGO and p-type amorphous carbon, resulting in p-n junction heterojunction diodes with a turn-on voltage of 0.3 V, rectification ratio of 110@±1.5 V, and activation energy of 0.13 eV under reverse bias. This unique laser processing method solves the problems of traps and defects associated with equilibrium-based rGO fabrication methods, enabling high conductivity and mobility, providing insights into the fundamental mechanism driving laser writing of graphene-based materials on silicon. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","diode; graphene; laser patterning; molecular dynamics; p-n junction; Raman spectroscopy; transmission electron microscopy","Activation energy; Amorphous carbon; Amorphous silicon; Carbon films; Carrier concentration; Carrier mobility; Carrier transport; Diodes; Electric rectifiers; Heterojunctions; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Laser materials processing; Melting; Molecular dynamics; Oxide films; Raman spectroscopy; Semiconductor diodes; Transmission electron microscopy; Atomically sharp interface; Electrical measurement; Fundamental mechanisms; Laser patterning; Mott variable-range hopping; P-n junction; Reduced graphene oxides; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068403510

Here, we report that S. cerevisiae cells regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolic homeostasis through tRNA U34-thiolation. Despite amino acid sufficiency, tRNA-thiolation deficient cells appear amino acid starved. In these cells, carbon flux towards nucleotide synthesis decreases, and trehalose synthesis increases, resulting in a starvation-like metabolic signature. Thiolation mutants have only minor translation defects. However, in these cells phosphate homeostasis genes are strongly down-regulated, resulting in an effectively phosphate-limited state. Reduced phosphate enforces a metabolic switch, where glucose-6-phosphate is routed towards storage carbohydrates. Notably, trehalose synthesis, which releases phosphate and thereby restores phosphate availability, is central to this metabolic rewiring. Thus, cells use thiolated tRNAs to perceive amino acid sufficiency, balance carbon and amino acid metabolic flux and grow optimally, by controlling phosphate availability. These results further biochemically explain how phosphate availability determines a switch to a ‘starvation-state’. © Gupta et al.",,"acid phosphatase; adenosine phosphate; glucose 6 phosphate; glycogen; guanosine phosphate; messenger RNA; transcription factor GCN4; transfer RNA; trehalose; carbon; nitrogen; phosphate; thiol derivative; transfer RNA; amino acid metabolism; Article; carbon metabolism; cell cycle progression; cell growth assay; cell mutant; chemical modification; down regulation; enzyme activity; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene; kwashiorkor; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; live cell microscopy; luciferase assay; metabolic fingerprinting; metabolic regulation; metabolite; microscopy; nitrogen metabolism; nucleotide metabolism; pentose phosphate cycle; phase contrast microscopy; phosphate homeostasis gene; phosphate metabolism; protein phosphorylation; protein processing; RNA isolation; RNA translation; S phase cell cycle checkpoint; spotting assay; tRNA thiolation; Western blotting; yeast; gene expression regulation; homeostasis; metabolism; RNA processing; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Carbon; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Homeostasis; Nitrogen; Phosphates; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA, Transfer; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Sulfhydryl Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071349767

Using the panel data from 1995 to 2016, the paper analyses the driving factor of carbon dioxide emissions from transport sector with two different analytical methods. The results of LMDI show that transportation energy intensity and economic effect is the main factor increasing the carbon dioxide emissions and the contributing factors to the carbon dioxide emissions reduction in the transport sector are the energy structure effect, the freight turnover of unit industrial output effect and the industrialization effect. In different subclasses divided by different threshold variables, industrialization has the positive impact while the coefficients vary, which indicates that appropriate development policies should be formulated in light of the development characteristics of different regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Industrialization; LMDI; Threshold regression; Transport sector","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Freight transportation; Global warming; Industrial economics; CO2 emissions; Industrialization; LMDI; Threshold regressions; Transport sectors; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064446417

Methods: In the phase I of the study, patients were randomized to receive either ice (30 min; N = 16) or cold CO2 (2 min; N = 16) applied twice during 1 day at an 8-h interval on the arthritic knee. In phase II, 16 other ice-treated arthritic knees according to the same protocol were compared to the contralateral non-treated arthritic knees (N = 16). The synovial fluid was analyzed just before the first cold application, then 24 h later. IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17A, VEGF, NF-kB-p65 protein, and PG-E2 levels were measured in the synovial fluid and compared before/after the two cold applications. Results: Forty-seven patients were included (17 gouts, 11 calcium pyrophosphate deposition diseases, 13 rheumatoid arthritides, 6 spondyloarthritides). Local ice cryotherapy significantly reduced the IL-6, IL-1β, VEGF, NF-kB-p65, and PG-E2 synovial levels, especially in the microcrystal-induced arthritis subgroup, while only phosphorylated NF-kB-p65 significantly decreased in rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis patients. Cold CO2 only reduced the synovial VEGF levels. In the phase II of the study, the synovial PG-E2 was significantly reduced in ice-treated knees, while it significantly increased in the corresponding contralateral non-treated arthritic knees, with a significant inter-class effect size (mean difference - 1329 [- 2232; - 426] pg/mL; N = 12). Conclusions: These results suggest that local ice cryotherapy reduces IL-6, IL-1β, and VEGF synovial protein levels, mainly in microcrystal-induced arthritis, and potentially through NF-kB and PG-E2-dependent mechanisms.

We have explored the exceptionally high photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE) of Proteaceae in this region, triggering the question what the PPUE of co-occurring species in other families might be along the Jurien Bay chronosequence. We explored how traits associated with PPUE, photosynthetic nitrogen (N)-use efficiency (PNUE) and leaf respiration might converge along the chronosequence, and whether Proteaceae and non-Proteaceae species differ in leaf traits associated with nutrient use. Seven to 10 species were sampled at three sites differing in nutrient availability (ranging from N- to P-limited). Measurements of leaf light-saturated photosynthesis and dark respiration were integrated with measurements of total N and P concentration in both mature and senesced leaves, and leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Contrary to what is known for other chronosequences, rates of photosynthesis and respiration did not decrease with increasing soil age and LMA along the Jurien Bay chronosequence. However, they increased when expressed per unit leaf P. Both N and P were used much more efficiently for photosynthesis on nutrient-poor sites, in both Proteaceae and non-Proteaceae species. Proteaceae had the fastest rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf P, followed by species that preferentially allocate P to mesophyll cells, rather than epidermal cells. Synthesis. Our results show that with declining soil P availability, photosynthetic P-use efficiency of all investigated species from different families increased. Plants growing on the oldest, most nutrient-impoverished soils exhibited similar rates of CO2 exchange as plants growing on more nutrient-rich younger soils, and extraordinarily high photosynthetic P-use efficiency. This indicates convergence in leaf traits related to photosynthetic nutrient use on severely P-impoverished sites. © 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, mycotoxin occurrence in feed should be monitored. To this end, we performed a large-scale global survey of mycotoxin contamination in feed and assessed regional differences and year-to-year variation of mycotoxin occurrence. Concentrations of aflatoxin B1, zearalenone, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, and T-2 toxin were analyzed in 74,821 samples of feed and feed raw materials (e.g., maize, wheat, soybean) collected from 100 countries from 2008 to 2017. In total, 88% of the samples were contaminated with at least one mycotoxin. Mycotoxin occurrence showed distinct regional trends and climate was a key determinant governing these trends. In most regions, the majority of samples complied with maximum levels and guidance values for mycotoxins in animal feed that are in effect in the European Union. However, 41.1%, 38.5%, and 20.9% of samples from South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, respectively, exceeded the maximum level for aflatoxin B1 (20 µg/kg). In several regions, mycotoxin concentrations in maize showed a pronounced year-to-year variation that could be explained by rainfall or temperature during sensitive periods of grain development. A large fraction of samples (64%) was co-contaminated with ≥ 2 mycotoxins. Most frequently observed mycotoxin mixtures were combinations of deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, and fumonisins, as well as fumonisins and aflatoxin B1. Deoxynivalenol and zearalenone concentrations were correlated in maize and wheat. In conclusion, according to an extensive global survey, mycotoxin (co-)contamination of animal feed is common, shows regional trends, and is governed in part by climate and weather. © 2019 by the authors.

Pre–post experience surveys and interviews with citizen scientists illustrate the transformative potential of place-based climate learning. Findings suggest that the relationships individuals developed with specific scientists and their personalized approaches to conducting science impacted how individuals related to the responsibility of environmental stewardship.

Many factors affect individuals’ choices to consume tap water and bottled water including perceived health risks and water quality. The University of South Florida (USF) has joined a nationwide initiative to become carbon-neutral, and reducing bottled water consumption was a chosen strategy. The purpose of this study was to assess the risk perceptions and drinking water choices of the USF-Tampa campus community. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 561 students, faculty and staff members responded to an online survey. The survey contained questions about the use of bottled water and tap water, reusable water bottles, risk perceptions and demographics. Findings: The results revealed that certain groups – undergraduate students and ethnic/racial minorities (e.g. black/African American, Hispanic/Latino) – drank significantly more bottled water. Among political ideologies, Liberals drank the least bottled water. Females and minorities had significantly greater risk perceptions of the tap water on campus. Important perceived benefits were tap water being less expensive and better for the environment than bottled water. Important perceived barriers were poor tasting tap water and the desire for filtered water. Originality/value: The findings suggest the need for public health campaigns to increase awareness of health, environmental and financial consequences of bottled water consumption. Such campaigns should aim to discourage bottled water and any potential increased sugar-sweetened beverage consumption while promoting tap water consumption. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon neutral; Drinking water; Health education; Recycling; Risk perceptions; Water consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068170354

Related, are these same people more willing to support policy actions aimed at preventing future losses when compared to older adults? In spite of reporting by the U.S. popular press about the heightened environmental consciousness of Millennials, prior research offers conflicting answers. Scholarship focusing on age effects suggests that the answer to both questions is yes due to the dampening of environmental concern and action in older adults. More recent applied research on climate related risks and risk management options, by contrast, suggest that the answer to both questions is no, and that there is no difference in climate concern and risk mitigation between younger and older adults. In an attempt to disentangle these contradictory viewpoints, we undertook a study in which respondents in the United States characterized by age and generational cohort were presented with small and large hypothetical losses due to climate change. These same participants were then asked to indicate their support for future policy actions aimed at stemming these environmental losses.

Recent publications estimate that 30–40% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gases are directly emitted by urban areas. This paper focuses on CO2, which is the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, and presents an implementation of CO2 flux modelling in urban areas within the urban canopy model Town Energy Balance (TEB). Highly weather-dependent contributors to CO2 fluxes (buildings and vegetation) are explicitly modelled by TEB using the Building Energy Model (BEM) for buildings and Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) for urban vegetation. This approach allows the impacts of the urban microclimate on CO2 fluxes to be simulated. Non-weather-dependent contributors (traffic and human respiration) are simulated using simpler approaches. A sensitivity study applied to the centre of Toulouse, France, highlights the relevance of detailed input data related to traffic, building use and human behaviour to simulate accurate CO2 fluxes. The results show that traffic (48.5%) and buildings (42%) are the main contributors to the annual mean CO2 flux. A comparison of the model results with independent eddy-covariance flux data shows good agreement with a root mean square error of 15.3 μmol m−2 s−1 and demonstrates that the model is able to reproduce seasonally averaged daily cycles of CO2 fluxes. In future studies, this model can be used to quantify the impacts on CO2 fluxes of different urban development scenarios such as urban expansion, changes in urban form, changes in practices related to the heating of buildings or urban greening strategies. © 2019 The Authors","Cities; CO2fluxes; Eddy covariance; Model evaluation; Urban canopy layer model","Behavioral research; Buildings; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mean square error; Urban growth; Vegetation; Cities; CO2fluxes; Eddy covariance; Model evaluation; Urban canopy layers; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric modeling; carbon flux; climate change; eddy covariance; greenhouse gas; implementation process; microclimate; numerical model; urban area; urban development; urban ecosystem; Article; atmosphere; biosphere; building; canopy; energy balance; European; evaluation study; exhaust gas; flux assay; greenhouse gas; microclimate; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; soil; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; France; Haute Garonne; Occitanie; Toulouse",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068262417

The effects will not be limited to a rising average temperature and changing rainfall patterns, but also to increasing severity and frequency in droughts, heat stress and floods. Agriculture is not only impacted upon by climate change but also contributes to global warming. However, not all agricultural systems affect negatively climate change. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a farming system that promotes continuous no or minimum soil disturbance (i.e. no tillage), maintenance of a permanent soil mulch cover, and diversification of plant species. Through these principles it enhances biodiversity and natural biological processes above and below the ground surface, so contributing to increased water and nutrient use efficiency and productivity, to more resilient cropping systems, and to improved and sustained crop production. Conservation Agriculture is based on the practical application of three interlinked principles along with complementary good agricultural practice. The characteristics of CA make it one of the systems best able to contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. In this article, the carbon sequestration potential of CA is assessed, both in annual and perennial crops, in the different agro-climatic regions of Africa. In total, the potential estimate of annual carbon sequestration in African agricultural soils through CA amounts to 143 Tg of C per year, that is 524 Tg of CO 2 per year. This figure represents about 93 times the current sequestration figure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Groundcovers; No-tillage","Biodiversity; Carbon; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Plants (botany); Soils; Atmospheric greenhouse; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Climate change mitigation; Conservation agricultures; Groundcovers; No tillage; Nutrient-use efficiencies; Soil conservation; agrometeorology; alternative agriculture; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation tillage; greenhouse gas; ground cover; mulch; nutrient use efficiency; water use efficiency; zero tillage; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062153042

In the indicative stage, data was collected through questionnaires and surveys, and a quick evaluation was conducted of the affected units. In the investigative stage, an analysis of the entire building complex was conducted through simulation and tested against the building energy standards. In the diagnostic stage, in-situ and laboratory measurements were made and used for calculations. The results show that many factors were involved in the moisture damage, whose main causes were overcrowded spaces, inadequate thermal regulation for the local climate, poor apartment and complex design, and flaws and inconsistencies in the quality of construction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BIM; Building pathology; Data; Indoor environment; Post-occupancy evaluation; Social housing","Apartment houses; Meteorological problems; Moisture; Surveys; Building pathology; Data; Indoor environment; Post occupancy evaluation; Social housing; Architectural design; construction method; damage; design; housing project; indoor air; moisture content; repair; social housing; thermal regime; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065703202

However, an information gap exists about odour emissions quantification from different treatment strategies. In the present work, odorous emissions generated in a full-scale sewage sludge composting plant were characterized, aiming at providing specific odour emission factors (OEF) and to determine their variability depending on the composting time. Additionally, characterization of VOCs emitted during the process was conducted through TD-GC/MS analyses. Odour emission and VOCs characterization considered both (1) a first stage where a raw sludge and vegetal fraction mixture were actively composted in dynamic windrows and (2) a second curing stage in static piles. After increasing the composting time, a reduction of 40% of the maximum odour concentration referred to the dynamic windrow stage was estimated, whereas a reduction of 89% of the maximum odour concentration was achieved after turning of curing piles. However, global OEF increased from 4.42E + 06 to 5.97E + 06 ou·Mg−1 RS – VF when the composting time increased. Finally, different VOCs such as isovaleraldehyde, indole, skatole, butyric acid, dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide were identified as main potential odour contributors. Results obtained are a valuable resource for plant management to choose an appropriate sewage sludge composting strategy to mitigate odour emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Full-scale composting plant; Gaseous emissions; Odour emission factor; Odour emission rate; Sewage sludge; VOC","Butyric acid; Chemical analysis; Curing; Gas emissions; Piles; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Different treatments; Dimethyl disulphide; Full-scale composting plant; Odorous emissions; Odour concentrations; Odour emission rates; Odour emissions; Sewage sludge composting; Sewage sludge; 2 butanone; acetic acid derivative; bulking agent; butyric acid; butyric acid derivative; indole; isovaleraldehyde; phenol; pinene; skatole; sulfur derivative; terpene; volatile organic compound; fragrance; volatile organic compound; activated sludge; composting; emission; factor analysis; odor; sewage treatment; volatile organic compound; wastewater treatment plant; air pollution; ambient air; Article; composting; degradation; dispersion; municipal solid waste; odor; reduction (chemistry); sewage; Composting; Odorants; Sewage; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063787237

The review includes a synthesis of our knowledge regarding the main sources supplying moisture to the Arctic, the changes experienced over the last few decades due to variations in the transport of moisture, the factors that control interannual variability, and the inherent contrast in the mechanisms related to the effect of changes in moisture transport on SIE in the Arctic. We note that the precise identification of the moisture sources for the Arctic depends both on the definition of the Arctic region itself and on the approach used to identify the sources, with the remote regions over the extratropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans being universally important, as are some continental areas over Siberia and North America. This review also reaffirms the absence of any clear agreement regarding the trends in atmospheric moisture transport to the Arctic, and highlights discrepancies between different data sets and approaches in the quantification of moisture transport, implying that its long-term impact on the intensification of the hydrological cycle in the Arctic remains unclear. We confirm the influence of the major modes of climate variability, planetary circulation patterns, and the changes in cyclonic activity in the variability of moisture transport to the Arctic. We reaffirm that the effect of moisture transport on the Arctic SIE through changes in humidity, cloud cover, and precipitation over the Arctic is a complex scientific problem that requires further detailed study over the decades to come, and we propose some important challenges for future research.

To facilitate broader analysis, several datasets of the social costs of air quality have been produced by a set of reduced-complexity models (RCMs). It is much easier to use the tabulated marginal costs derived from RCMs than it is to run 'state-of-the-science' chemical transport models (CTMs). However, the differences between these datasets have not been systematically examined, leaving analysts with no guidance on how and when these differences matter. Here, we compare per-tonne marginal costs from ground level and elevated emission sources for each county in the United States for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and inert primary PM2.5 from three RCMs: Air Pollution Emission Experiments and Policy (AP2), Estimating Air pollution Social Impacts Using Regression (EASIUR) and the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP). National emission-weighted average damages vary among models by approximately 21%, 31%, 28% and 12% for inert primary PM2.5, SO2, NOx and NH3 emissions, respectively, for ground-level sources. For elevated sources, emission-weighted damages vary by approximately 42%, 26%, 42% and 20% for inert primary PM2.5, SO2, NOx and NH3 emissions, respectively. Despite fundamental structural differences, the three models predict marginal costs that are within the same order of magnitude. That different and independent methods have converged on similar results bolsters confidence in the RCMs. Policy analyzes of national-level air quality policies that sum over pollutants and geographical locations are often robust to these differences, although the differences may matter for more source- or location-specific analyzes.

However, some methodological limitations hinder the spatial development of this discipline. This study presents a new approach to historical climatology that overcomes some of the limitations of classical approaches, such as the rogation method or content analysis: the Cost Opportunity for Small Towns (COST). It analyses historic documents and takes advantage of all sorts of meteorological information available in written documents, and not only the severest events, to therefore overcome the most prominent bottlenecks of former approaches. COST relies on the fact that using paper is very costly, so its use to describe meteorological conditions is hypothesised as being proportional to the impact they had on society. To prove the validity of this approach to reconstruct climate conditions, this article exemplarily uses the Municipal Chapter Acts of a small town in southern Spain (Caravaca de la Cruz), which span the 1600-1900 period, and allows reconstructions to be obtained on a monthly basis. Using the same documentary source, the three approaches were used to derive respective climate reconstructions, which were then compared to assess climate signal consistency and to identify possible caveats in the methods. The three approaches led to a generally coherent series of secular variability in the hydrological conditions, which agrees well with previous study results. The COST approach is arguably more objective and less affected by changes in societal behaviour, which allows it to perform comparative studies in regions with different languages and traditions. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

In this study the SPN emissions of one moped and eight motorcycles, all fulfilling the Euro 4 standards, were measured with a SPN measurement system employing a catalytic stripper to minimize volatile artefacts. Although the particulate matter mass emissions were &lt; 1.5 mg/km for all vehicles tested, two motorcycles and the moped were close to the SPN limit for passenger cars (6 × 1011 particles/km with sizes larger than 23 nm) and four motorcycles exceeded the limit by a factor of up to four. The measurement repeatability was satisfactory (deviation from the mean 10%) and concentration differences between tailpipe and dilution tunnel were small, indicating that performing robust SPN measurements for regulatory control purposes is feasible. However, steady state tests with the moped showed major differences between the tailpipe and the dilution tunnel sampling points for sub-23 nm particles. Thus, the measurement procedures of particles for small displacement engine mopeds and motorcycles need to be better defined for a possible future introduction in regulations. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution; Artefacts; Dilution tunnel (CVS); L-category; Particulate matter (PM) mass; Powered two-wheelers; Solid particle number (SPN); Sub-23 nm; Tailpipe; WMTC","Air pollution; Air quality; Automobiles; Bicycles; Motorcycles; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Artefacts; L-category; Particulate Matter; Solid particles; Sub-23 nm; Tailpipe; Two wheelers; WMTC; Exhaust systems (engine); atmospheric pollution; cycle transport; emission inventory; literature review; measurement method; particulate matter; regulatory framework; standard (reference); traffic emission; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070542878

Reaction of the prepared compound with Co and Cr salts in the presence of 1,6-diaminohexane resulted in formation of discrete complex compounds (CoL and CrL). The synthesized compounds were identified by chemical analyses and characterized by IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and the ligand additionally by NMR spectroscopy. The crystal and molecular structure of the prepared complexes were determined by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction and electrochemical properties by cyclic voltammetry. The molecular structure of the complex compounds is found to be isostructural with rather small differences in the crystal packing arrangement. In both complexes the coordination geometry is octahedral and each metal ion is coordinated by two mutually orthogonal ligand molecules that act as N,N,O-tridentate ligand. In the crystal structure, the molecules are linked via multiple O–H⋯O, N–H⋯O and N–H⋯Cl hydrogen bond interactions thus forming a supramolecular zig-zag motif that is additionally stabilized by a series of hydrogen bond interactions that involve water molecule, diaminohexane cation, uncoordinated oxygen atom of carboxylic group and oxygen atom of carbonyl group. Electrochemical analysis of complex compounds indicated irreversible oxidation of Cr3+ in CrL and reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ in CoL, which agrees with the proposed oxidation state of the metal in complexes. © 2019","Chrome complexes; Cobalt complexes; Dipicolinic derivates acid; Hydrazide; Isostructural crystal structures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064318255

Past sedimentation, vegetation and marine productivities were inferred from palynological, radiocarbon, seismic and lithological data. A substantial reduction in the pollen and dinoflagellate cyst accumulation rates is observed at ∼12,700 to 11,700 cal a BP, suggesting lower marine and vegetation productivities likely as a response to the Younger Dryas cooling event. Overall, the regional vegetation changed from cold-tolerant open woodlands (Pinus sylvestris/P. nigra and Betula) dominating before ∼10,200 cal a BP to coastal wetlands and the regional spread of Quercus-dominated forests after ∼9800 cal a BP. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis allowed the identification of several small environmental oscillations, such as the 11.4 ka and 10.5 ka cooling events. After that, a conspicuous heath expansion was likely favoured by the palaeotopography, the increased precipitation and the relative sea level rise, which might have caused a profound change in the coastal configuration. Concurrently, both the dinoflagellate cyst and non-pollen palynomorph records reveal variations in the marine productivity and coastal hydrodynamics that also agree with a period of marked marine transgression, warming and increasing river flow. New sedimentary data highlight the high sensitivity of the ria's ecosystems to environmental oscillations and show a close temporal correspondence between terrestrial and marine responses to climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dinoflagellate cysts; Late Pleistocene–Holocene transition; Lithology; Non-pollen palynomorphs; Palaeoclimatology; Pollen; Seismic stratigraphy; Southern Europe; Vegetation dynamics","Climate change; Cluster analysis; Ecosystems; Glacial geology; Lithology; Productivity; Sea level; Sedimentology; Seismology; Stratigraphy; Vegetation; Wetlands; Dinoflagellate cysts; Holocenes; Palaeoclimatology; Palynomorphs; Pollen; Seismic stratigraphy; Southern Europe; Vegetation dynamics; Principal component analysis; climate variation; coastal wetland; cooling; dinoflagellate cyst; fossil record; glacial-interglacial cycle; Holocene; hydrodynamics; late glacial; lithology; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; palynomorph; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; pollen; proxy climate record; sea level change; sedimentary sequence; seismic stratigraphy; vegetation dynamics; Younger Dryas; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Galicia [Spain]; Iberian Peninsula; Ria de Arosa; Rias Bajas; Spain; Betula; Dinophyceae; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066453372

Based on 14 climate indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the application of the nonparametric Mann-Kendall and Sen’s slope tests, the observed trends of climate extremes in 16 urban areas in Mexico from 1980 to 2010 were analyzed. The results show that climate conditions over most cities of México are changing, as indicated by a warming trend during the study period. Significant increases were detected in the annual average maximum temperature (TMX) and the annual average minimum temperature (TMN). There is no clear trend that the warmest days (TXx) are increasing, but the annual number of warm days (TX90p) and summer days (SU) has increased, and the cold days (TX10p) have decreased. Associated with these changes are concomitant decreases in fewer coldest nights (TNn), an increase in the percentage of days with warm nights (TN90p) and tropical nights (TR), and a decrease in the number of frost days (FD). In contrast, the analysis reveals a statistically significant decrease in the mean temperature and the amount of warm days in Mexico City, which could be associated with the increasing trend of atmospheric pollution and the continuous smoke and ash emissions from the volcano Popocatepetl, which disperse incoming solar radiation and reduce radiative forcing. Climate change indices based on daily precipitation data show positive trends in many cities. In general, an increasing trend in very wet days (R95p), a number of very heavy rainfall days ≥ 25 mm (R25), and the annual total wet days (PRCP) were observed. These results highlight the vulnerability of cities confronted with both global and local climate change and the importance of promoting effective local risk reduction measures as part of urban planning for city dwellers. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"annual variation; climate change; extreme event; trend analysis; urban climate; wet season; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053775955

We have improved the traditional evaluation method to construct a comprehensive air quality assessment model based on China's major air pollutants. Using the daily air pollutant data of 2015-2018, we calculated and analyzed the monthly air quality of nine cities in the Pearl River Delta of China, and conducted a comparative study on the effect of the air pollution control policies of the cities in the Pearl River Delta. We found that the air quality control policies in those nine cities were not consistent. Specifically, the pollution control policies of Guangzhou and Foshan have achieved more than 20% improvement. The pollution control policies of Dongguan and Zhaoqing have also achieved more than 10% improvement. However, due to the relative lag of the formulation and implementation of air pollution control policies, the air quality of Jiangmen, Zhuhai and Zhongshan has declined.

The solar reactor uses cerium oxide (CeO2) as a metal-redox and operates at 1773 K and 1300 K for reduction and oxidation step respectively under non-stoichiometric condition. The plant is analyzed by performing a quasi-steady state simulation under boundary condition that the Fischer-Tropsch reactor should operate with the capacity factor of 0.95 or 8350 hours annually. A storage tank is used to store and regulate the flow of syngas going into the Fischer-Tropsch reactor. Sensitivity analysis is carried out, particularly on solar reactor conversion and solid-to-solid heat exchanger efficiency. Another sensitivity analysis is to combine PV and CSP as the external electricity source.

Inherent to their anisotropic 2D structure, however, is the loss of continuous tunability of their photoluminescence (PL) properties due to stepwise growth. On top of that, limited experimental availability of NPLs of different thicknesses and ultimately the bulk band gap of CdSe constrain the achievable PL wavelengths. Here, we report on the doping of CdSe NPLs with mercury, which gives rise to additional PL in the red region of the visible spectrum and in the near-infrared region. We employ a seeded-growth method with injection solutions containing cadmium, selenium, and mercury. The resulting NPLs retain their anisotropic structure, are uniform in size and shape, and present significantly altered spectroscopic characteristics due to the existence of additional energetic states. We conclude that doping takes place by employing elemental analysis in combination with PL excitation spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and single-particle fluorescence spectroscopy, confirming single emitters being responsible for multiple distinct emission signals. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Anisotropy; Energy gap; Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Infrared devices; Mercury (metal); Optical properties; Particle size analysis; Selenium compounds; Semiconductor doping; Sols; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Absorption cross sections; Anisotropic structure; Continuous tunability; Near infrared region; Photoluminescence properties; Semiconductor nanocrystals; Spectroscopic characteristics; Two Dimensional (2 D); Cadmium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070550097

Since such emissions change according to temporal patterns of electricity generation and EV charging, this study operationalizes the concept of marginal emission factors (MEFs) and uses person-level travel activity data to simulate charging scenarios. Our study is set in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area in Ontario, Canada. After generating hourly MEFs using a multiple linear regression model, we estimated GHG emissions for EV charging at two EV penetration rates, 5% and 30%, and five charging scenarios: home, work and shopping, night, downtown vs suburb, and an optimal low emission charging scenario, matching charging time with the lowest available MEF. We observed that vehicle electrification substantially reduces GHG emissions, even when using MEFs that are up to seven times higher than average electricity emission factors. With Ontario's 2017 electricity generation mix, EVs achieve over 80% lower fuel cycle emissions compared with equivalent sets of gasoline vehicles. At 5% penetration, night charging nearly matches low emission charging, but night charging emissions increase with 30% EV penetration, suggesting a need for policy that can smooth out charging demand after midnight. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Charging time; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Gas emissions; Linear regression; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity generation; Electricity system; Multiple linear regression models; Penetration rates; Travel activities; Vehicle electrifications; Greenhouse gases; electric vehicle; electricity; electricity generation; electrification; emission control; greenhouse gas; marginalization; Article; carbon footprint; electricity; environmental policy; multiple linear regression analysis; Ontario; electricity; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; Electricity; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Ontario; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068074704

We propose an Ecosystem Services (ES) approach to promote coordinated governance of aquaculture and environmental conservation in a brackish lagoon of the Po River delta (Italy). Spatiotemporal changes of aquatic vegetated habitats and clam production were evaluated, and experimentally related to ESs: climate regulation, habitat provision for birdlife, and potential for birdwatching. Almost all emergent vegetation was lost during past decades, while aquaculture production increased rapidly. Vegetated habitats sequestered significant amounts of carbon and supported more diverse bird communities than non-vegetated wetlands, including protected species of interest for birdwatching. We demonstrated that sectoral management was ineffective in maintaining ESs, promoting the exploitation of few provisioning services while decreasing many others. We propose an innovative, integrated management that focuses on restoring aquatic vegetation to offset anthropic impacts for the future sustainable governance of deltas. © 2019, © 2019 Newcastle University.","Clam aquaculture; Ecosystem Services; habitat restoration; Life AGREE; Phragmites australis; Po River delta","anthropogenic effect; brackish water; clam culture; ecosystem service; habitat conservation; halophyte; sustainability; Italy; Po Delta; Veneto; Aves; Bivalvia; Phragmites australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064828650

Protected floodplains provide important ESs to local populations such as water flow regulation and climate regulation through carbon storage. This study investigates the effects of biodiversity protection initiatives (i.e. declaration of Protected Areas – PAs) and the related spatio-temporal land use/land cover (LULC) changes on ecosystem services (ESs) in the Nature Reserve of Paul do Boquilobo – NRPB (Central Portugal). Special focus was made on climate mitigation (i.e. carbon storage and sequestration) and water-related (flood mitigation, water regulation and supply) ESs. The analysis was performed using InVEST model. Three dates of past LULC conditions were considered in the analysis (1967, 1990 and 2015). Moreover, two future alternative LULC scenarios for 2050 were designed (a “Business”- BUS and a “Naturalization”- NAT scenario). The BUS scenario considers a LULC distribution towards high productive agricultural systems, considering only a restricted central core of natural areas, while the NAT scenario considers full coverage of natural areas. The two future extreme LULC scenarios were analyzed considering both no climate change and climate change effects on water-related services based on the pessimistic rcp8.5 climatic scenario. The results showed that PA declaration of NRPB after 1980 increased carbon storage-sequestration and flood mitigation (higher water storage, lower recharge and runoff). The analysis of future LULC scenarios demonstrated that the complete renaturing in combination with climate change (reduction of precipitation, increase of temperature) may lead to severe reduction of recharge and runoff. These results indicate that conflicts may appear between specific water regulation services by the application of PA initiatives in places where groundwater resources are limited or minimum ecological flows in surface waters are difficult to be preserved. © 2019","Carbon storage; Ecosystem services trade-offs; InVEST model; Protected areas; Water flow regulation","Biodiversity; Carbon capture; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Floods; Flow of water; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydraulics; Land use; Runoff; Surface water resources; Biodiversity protection; Carbon storage; Carbon storage and sequestrations; Minimum ecological flows; Protected areas; Sustainable management; Trade off; Water flows; Climate change; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem service; flood; flood control; floodplain; flow regulation; groundwater; land use change; protected area; trade-off; water flow; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064951175

Our new data indicate that enstatite and ordinary chondrites possess uniform and small, but resolvable, Sr and Nd isotopic deviations from terrestrial rocks. In contrast, the Sr isotope ratios varied across different classes of carbonaceous chondrites (CM, CO, and CV). The deviation of data from the s-process mixing line in Sr-Nd isotopic space likely resulted from the incorporation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) into carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. Planetary-scale Sr and Nd isotopic heterogeneities among terrestrial rocks, enstatite, ordinary chondrites, and CAI-subtracted carbonaceous chondrites suggest a heterogeneous distribution of s-process-enriched materials in the early solar system, probably caused by nebular thermal processing. The observed Sr and Nd isotopic variation across the CAI-subtracted carbonaceous chondrites cannot be explained solely by nebular thermal processing, but is likely attributable to s-process-depleted silicate grains that repeatedly circulated among the early solar system. These grains were transferred and incorporated at varying degrees into the formation region of the parent bodies of individual carbonaceous chondrites. © 2019. The American Astronomical Society.

The corresponding sub-grid scale turbulence–chemistry interactions are modelled using a probability density function transport equation, which is solved by the stochastic fields method. A 15-step reduced, but accurate, methane mechanism including 19 species is employed for the description of all chemical reactions. The test case involves a combustor with complex geometry and simulations are carried out for two different combustor operating conditions. Overall, results of the velocity, temperature and species mass fractions (including carbon monoxide) as well as the instantaneous thermochemical properties are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating the capabilities of the applied stochastic fields method. The inclusion of wall heat transfer in the combustion chamber is found to improve temperature and species predictions, especially in the near-wall regions. Comparisons between an oscillating and a ‘stable’ flame case furthermore highlight the influence of experimentally observed thermo-acoustic instabilities on the scalar fluctuations near the combustor centreline. None of the default model parameters were adjusted and the results showcase the accuracy and flexibility of the present large eddy simulation method for an application to complex, partially premixed combustion problems; this being particularly important for the designers of new generation low emission gas turbine combustors. © 2019 The Combustion Institute","Gas turbine combustion; Large eddy simulation; PRECCINSTA burner; Stochastic fields method; Transported sgs pdf; Wall heat transfer","Carbon monoxide; Combustion chambers; Combustors; Computational fluid dynamics; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Heat transfer; Industrial emissions; Large eddy simulation; Probability density function; Gas-turbine combustion; Large Eddy simulation methods; Partially premixed combustion; Stochastic field; Thermoacoustic instability; Thermochemical properties; Transported sgs pdf; Wall heat transfer; Stochastic systems; Article; combustion; flame; heat transfer; partially premixed swirl flame; priority journal; stochastic model; temperature; velocity; wall heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064940099

The index compares cumulative emissions data with patterns of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) in regional temperature (Frame et al 2017 Nat. Clim. Change 7 407-11). The latter act as a proxy for a range of local climate impacts, so emergent patterns of this ratio provide an informative way of summarising the regional disparities of climate change impacts. Here we combine these with measures of regional/national contributions to climate change to develop an 'emissions-emergence index' (EEI) linking regions'/countries' contributions to climate change with the emergent regional impacts of climate change. The EEI is a simple but robust indicator which captures relative contributions to and regional impacts from climate change. We demonstrate the applicability of the EEI both for discussions of historical contributions and impacts, and for considering future relative contributions and impacts, and examine its utility in the context of existing related metrics.

These surveys, conducted manually using handheld leak detection technologies, are time-consuming. To improve the speed and cost-effectiveness of leak detection, technology developers are introducing innovative solutions using mobile platforms, close-range portable systems, and permanent installations. Many of these new approaches promise faster, cheaper, or more effective leak detection than conventional methods. However, ensuring mitigation targets are achieved requires demonstrating that alternative approaches are at least as effective in reducing emissions as current approaches – a concept known as emissions reduction equivalence. Here, we propose a five-stage framework for demonstrating equivalence that combines controlled testing, simulation modeling, and field trials. The framework was developed in consultation with operators, regulators, academics, solution providers, consultants, and non-profit groups from Canada and the U.S. We present the equivalence framework and discuss challenges to implementation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Emissions equivalence; Fugitive emissions; Leak detection and repair; Methane emissions; Natural gas; Upstream oil and gas","conceptual framework; detection method; emission control; gas industry; installation; leakage; methane; natural gas; oil industry; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070546647

However, serpentinizing environments also place multiple constraints on microbial life by generating highly reduced hyperalkaline waters that are limited in dissolved inorganic carbon. To better understand how microbial life persists under these conditions, we performed geochemical measurements on waters from a serpentinizing environment and subjected planktonic microbial cells to metagenomic and physiological analyses. Metabolic potential inferred from metagenomes correlated with fluid type, and genes involved in anaerobic metabolisms were enriched in hyperalkaline waters. The abundance of planktonic cells and their rates of utilization of select single-carbon compounds were lower in hyperalkaline waters than alkaline waters. However, the ratios of substrate assimilation to dissimilation were higher in hyperalkaline waters than alkaline waters, which may represent adaptation to minimize energetic and physiologic stress imposed by highly reducing, carbon-limited conditions. Consistent with this hypothesis, estimated genome sizes and average oxidation states of carbon in inferred proteomes were lower in hyperalkaline waters than in alkaline waters. These data suggest that microorganisms inhabiting serpentinized waters exhibit a unique suite of physiological adaptations that allow for their persistence under these polyextremophilic conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"dissolved inorganic carbon; genome; metabolism; microorganism; ophiolite; oxidation; physiological response; serpentinization; ultramafic rock; Oman; carbon; chrysotile; adaptation; anaerobic growth; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; chemistry; classification; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; metagenomics; microbiology; Oman; oxidation reduction reaction; sediment; Adaptation, Physiological; Anaerobiosis; Asbestos, Serpentine; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Carbon; Geologic Sediments; Metagenomics; Oman; Oxidation-Reduction; Water Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063039947

This paper presents a framework for evaluating permafrost mapping exercises designed to inform climate change adaptation actions. We apply the framework using a case study of the Incorporating Climate Change into Land Development—Terrain Analysis project (ICCiLD). ICCiLD is a hazard mapping project utilizing interferometric synthetic aperture radar to monitor ground disturbance and categorize land development suitability in seven communities in the territory of Nunavut, Canada. We looked at one of the communities, Arviat, as our case study. We examined technical data and drew upon semi-structured interviews (n = 19) with map creators and users. We found ICCiLD added new and relevant information for community planning, increased awareness of the risks posed by permafrost thaw and built stakeholder relations. Strong coordination and high public consciousness of local climate impacts emerged as key factors underpinning project success. Nevertheless, in the case of Arviat, the effectiveness of the hazard maps in influencing land-use planning was constrained by communication challenges between project creators and end-users. These challenges included limited community access to the data and uncertainty surrounding how to operationalize the map suitability classifications. Broader climate change adaptation challenges included the presence of other more immediate community planning priorities and a limited ability to incorporate Indigenous ways of knowing into a technical mapping project. The lessons from this evaluation provide insight for the development of mapping-based adaptations across Arctic regions. © 2018, The Author(s).","Adaptation evaluation; Climate change; Hazard mapping; Permafrost degradation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051668445

We construct a novel database of CSR contracting and document that CSR contracting has become more prevalent over time. We further find that the adoption of CSR contracting leads to (a) an increase in long-term orientation; (b) an increase in firm value; (c) an increase in social and environmental initiatives; (d) a reduction in emissions; and (e) an increase in green innovations. These findings are consistent with our theoretical arguments predicting that CSR contracting helps direct management's attention to stakeholders that are less salient but financially material to the firm in the long run, thereby enhancing corporate governance. Managerial Summary: This paper examines the effectiveness and implications of integrating environmental and social performance criteria in executive compensation (CSR contracting)—a recent practice in corporate governance that is becoming more and more prevalent. We show that CSR contracting mitigates corporate short-termism and improves business performance. Firms that adopt CSR contracting experience a significant increase in firm value, which foreshadows an increase in long-term operating profits. Furthermore, firms that adopt CSR contracting improve their environmental and social performance, especially with respect to the environment and local communities.

Freeze-tolerant ectotherms may experience increased ice content and/or energy expenditure in suboptimal subnivium conditions, with implications for overwinter survival and body reserves available for spring reproduction. We used a novel mechanistic modeling approach to explore effects of winter climate on the microclimate conditions, energy expenditure, and ice dynamics of the freeze-tolerant, subnivium-dwelling wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) in the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Basin region of the United States. We hypothesized that (1) frogs would experience the greatest energy cost to survive winter in southern regions of our study area, where air temperatures are warmer and shallower snow could allow for increased numbers of freeze-thaw cycles, and (2) frogs would be most vulnerable to lethal freezing in the cold, dry northwest portion of our study region. We found that total winter energy expenditure changed little with latitude because the effect of warmer soil temperatures (higher metabolic rates) to the south was offset by a shorter winter duration. Energy expenditures were greatest in the snowbelts of the Great Lakes, characterized by more persistent snow cover and relatively warm soil temperatures. In contrast, highest ice contents occurred in the northwest of the study region where air temperatures were coldest and snow was shallow. Thus, it appears that wood frogs experience a trade-off between risk of lethal ice content and extensive use of body reserves across geographic space. Simulations showed that interpopulation differences in burrow depth and cryoprotectant concentration can influence risk of lethal ice content and overuse of body reserves prior to spring breeding, and those risks vary in relation to winter climate. Our mechanistic modeling approach is a novel tool for predicting risk and shifting niche space for cold-adapted and subnivium-dependent species. © 2019 The Authors.","Energetics; Freeze-tolerant; Lake effect; Mechanistic model; Midwest; Niche model; Subnivium; Wood frogs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069901864

At the same time, increases in future mobility demand require the rapid development of new infrastructures. Here we quantify investment needs for transportation infrastructures over time to achieve both development and climate objectives. We compared investment needs between world regions and analyzed their main determinants. To do so, we built socioeconomic scenarios with the Imaclim-R integrated assessment model, combining alternatives for model parameters that determine mobility patterns. We then estimated the levels of investment that are consistent with the passenger and freight transportation trends in the different scenarios with and without climate policy. Finally, we used a global sensitivity analysis to identify the determinants of investments in low-carbon scenarios. We find that the expenditure needed for transportation infrastructure is lower in low-carbon pathways than in baseline scenarios. This result holds true at both the global and regional scales and is robust to the uncertainties considered. This overall decrease is brought about in particular by a reduction in transport activity. Rail utilization rates and road construction costs are determining factors for investment in all regions. Modal shift from road to rail can be a lever to reduce investment needs only if combined with action on rail infrastructure occupancy. To obtain a comprehensive assessment of the costs related to the transport sector in a low-carbon world, additional investments not considered in this study related to energy efficiency or alternative fuels use should be integrated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Investment needs; Low-carbon pathways; Modeling; Transportation infrastructures","Alternative fuels; Carbon; Costs; Economics; Energy efficiency; Freight transportation; Models; Roads and streets; Sensitivity analysis; Comprehensive assessment; Determinants of investment; Global sensitivity analysis; Integrated assessment models; Low carbon; Rail infrastructure; Road construction cost; Transportation infrastructures; Investments; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; environmental policy; freight transport; investment; modeling; transportation infrastructure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065137741

Signal-controlled intersection is a bottleneck of the urban traffic system. Platooning has the potential to improve the intersection throughput, and a typical V2X application, green light optimal speed advisory (GLOSA), can also reduce vehicles' stopping at intersections to enhance traffic efficiency. However, there is scarcely any literature regarding GLOSA system for platoon to increase intersection throughput. In this paper, the composite platoon trajectory planning strategy (CPTPS) is proposed to maximize the intersection throughput. Since the intersection throughput maximization problem can be transformed into minimizing vehicles' intersection arrival time in a green phase by optimizing vehicles' trajectories, three portions are designed in CPTPS to solve the problem, which are a GLOSA-based trajectory planning method for platoon leaders, a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for platoon followers, and a flexible platoon management protocol to ensure the smooth operations in a platoon. Simulation results show that, compared to the non-optimized cases, CPTPS can effectively increase intersection throughput while reduce stoppings at intersections and gas emissions. Especially in saturation cases, CPTPS can achieve a near-ideal throughput performance. And the communication delay within 100 ms scarcely affects CPTPS's headway maintenance performance.

After more than 30 years of reform and opening up, its economic construction has made great progress and has shown rapid development momentum. E-commerce and economic growth have driven the development of the logistics industry and promoted the growth and development of the aviation logistics industry. In the low-carbon and environmentally-friendly environment, the aviation logistics industry has been constrained by the macro-system, the impact of other logistics channels, the shortage of logistics talents, and the restrictions on carbon emissions, making the development of aviation logistics industry in Jilin Province difficult.

Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about DAC's current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine DAC's anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art DAC technologies are performed, wherein, DAC technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT DAC) and low temperature solid sorbent (LT DAC) systems, from an energy system perspective. DAC capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for DAC capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. DAC system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that LT DAC systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. CO 2 capture costs of LT DAC systems powered by hybrid PV-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 €/t CO2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively.

Vigorous recirculation between the aeration and the anoxic tanks is enforced, to ensure complete denitrification. The scope of the present work was to investigate the possibility for nitrification-denitrification process in once-through systems (i.e.: without recirculation), without the need for the addition of extra carbon source (i.e. using the BOD in wastewater as carbon source), using encapsulated microorganisms. The primary aim was to increase the concentration of nitrifiers in the aerated reactor with parallel operation at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) below the doubling time of heterotrophic microorganisms, thus ensuring high ammonia oxidation rate and minimal reduction of organic carbon. The preserved organic carbon may be then used as carbon source at the downstream anoxic reactor. Coagulated and clarified wastewater from the effluent of the primary clarifier of a municipal wastewater treatment plant was used as feed to the system. The system comprised of two reactors (with 2 L working volume each) configured in series. The first one (aerated tank) contained encapsulated nitrifiers, while the second one (anoxic tank) contained encapsulated denitrifiers. The system operated at HRTs 8, 4 and 3 h (calculated individually for each reactor). The experiments indicated that at HRT equal to 8 h, almost all N-NH4+ was converted to N-NO3- in the aerated reactor, while the total nitrogen (TN) concentration was below 2 mg L-1 at the exit of the system. At HRT of 4 h a slight decrease in N-NH4+ removal was observed at the exit of the aerated tank (N-NH4+ concentration was measured 3.7 ± 0.1 mg L-1). At HRT equal to 4 h, N-NH4+ concentration did not change significantly during the downstream treatment in the anoxic tank, while N-NO3- concentration at the exit of the system was 1.4 ± 0.1 mg L-1. At the lowest HRT (3 h), N-NH4+ concentration was measured between 10 and 11 mg L-1, both, at the exit of the aeration tank and at the exit of the system; while, N-NO3- was measured 2.6 ± 0.2 mg L-1 at the exit of the system. On the other hand, BOD and TOC removal in the aeration tank decreased with the decrease of the HRT. BOD concentration at the exit of the anoxic tank measured 30.3 ± 2.2 and 19.4 ± 1.7 mg L-1 for HRTs 8 h or 4 h, respectively, while it was measured 51.6 ± 7.6 mg L-1 at HRT 3 h. On the other hand, TOC concentration at the outlet was measured 17.5 ± 1.2 and 13.2 ± 0.6 for HRTs 8 or 4 h, respectively, while it was measured 31.1 ± 5.6 mg L-1 at HRT equal to 3 h. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant variations of all measured parameters with the applied HRT, apart from N-NO3- concentration at the exit of the aerated tank. The latter was attributed to the complete oxidation oft N-NH4+ in the aerated tank at all HRTs. Based on the efficiency of the system, the volume of the aeration and denitrification tanks of a wastewater treatment plant using encapsulated microorganisms may be designed 16 times smaller, compared to conventional activated sludge plants, while the need for recirculation between the aerated and anoxic tanks may be completely eliminated. © 2019","Denitrification; Encapsulated microorganisms; Lentikats biocatalyst; Nitrification; Wastewater treatment","ammonia; nitrogen; organic carbon; catalyst; encapsulation; microorganism; municipal solid waste; nitrification; recirculating system; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; Article; carbon source; denitrification; hydraulic retention time; microencapsulation; microorganism; municipal wastewater; Nirosomonas europea; nitrification; Nitrobacter; Nitrobacter winogradskyi; nonhuman; Paracoccus denitrificans; Pseudomonas fluorescens; bioreactor; denitrification; sewage; waste water; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Sewage; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065472967

The OBEAS-3000 vehicle exhaust gas detector was used to collect the instantaneous emission rate of motor vehicle exhaust at different speeds and accelerations in field experiments. Based on the data, the effects of speed and acceleration rate on the emission rate of different exhaust gases by partial correlation methods were analyzed. Results show that there are potential interactions between acceleration and velocity effects at different gas emission rates and emission ratios. At different stages of the velocity and acceleration, the proportions of CO and HC emissions are significantly different, but the proportion of NOX changes little. At the low-velocity stage, emission ratios of CO and HC have no significant changes in different acceleration stages. In the mid-speed driving phase, the CO emission ratio is positively correlated with the acceleration, whereas the HC emission ratio is negatively correlated with the acceleration. During the high-velocity driving period, CO and HC emission ratios have no significant change in different acceleration stages. The results provide theoretical supports for establishing accurate emission models for various gases. © 2019 IEEE.","Emission differences; Emission rate; Proportion of different emission gas; Transportation","Acceleration; Correlation methods; Gas emissions; Particulate emissions; Transportation; Velocity; Acceleration rates; Different stages; Emission rates; Gas emission rates; Partial correlation; Scientific management; Vehicle exhaust gas; Velocity effects; Exhaust gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074919027

Indeed, Tonga is rated the second most at-risk nation in the Pacific. The aim of this study was to assess the urban resilience of Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa to the effects of climate changes and natural disasters. This paper identifies the natural hazard risk in the Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa by providing an integrated disaster and climate risk reduction assessment. It outlines major gaps in risk awareness and community-based disaster risk management practices through extensive literature research, the analysis of secondary information and consultations with stakeholders. This research adopts an indicator-based approach to assess each element of the country's disaster management system. Furthermore, it assesses policy and regulatory frameworks that define Nuku'alofa's approach to disaster management and climate change. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were used in this study, which co-benefits urban development in Tongan communities to enhance urban resilience. The main objective of this model is to rank a given set of infrastructure sector indicators based on their disaster and development-related vulnerability. Disaster risk depends on both physical vulnerability and a wide range of social, economic, and environmental aspects. For a better risk understanding, a holistic perspective was applied to assess the natural hazard risk for Nuku'alofa. The comprehensive approach of this paper outlines the current disaster risk resilience profile of Nuku'alofa, including current hazard assessments and urban disaster resilience assessments, while recommending mitigation measures to help reduce the risk. © 2019 The Authors","Climate change; Disaster management system; Natural hazards; Risk; Urban resilience; Vulnerability","climate change; disaster management; holistic approach; natural hazard; risk assessment; urban area; urban development; vulnerability; Tonga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087292123

While some of the SiO is photospheric, a substantial portion must arise in the wind from the red giant component of T CrB. A simple fit to the SiO feature, assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, suggests a SiO column density of 2.8 × 1017 cm-2 and temperature ∼1000 K; the SiO column density is similar to that present in the winds of field red giants. A search for SiO maser emission is encouraged both before and after the next anticipated eruption. We find that the 12C/13C ratio in the red giant is &lt;9, with a best-fitting value of ∼5, a factor ∼18 times lower than the solar value of 89. We find no convincing evidence for the presence of dust in the environment of T CrB, which we attribute to the destructive effects on nucleation sites of hard X-ray emission. When the next eruption of T CrB occurs, the ejected material will shock the wind, producing X-ray and coronal line emission, as is the case for the recurrent nova RS Oph. T CrB is also a good candidate for very high energy γ-ray emission, as first observed during the 2010 outburst of V407 Cyg.

To determine if forest-related policy demonstrates a paradigm shift toward forest protection, we identify and code a set of 218 national forest-related policy documents passed between 1999 and 2016. We determine whether a paradigmatic change in forest-related policy occurred and the mechanism by which change has or has not taken place through the interpretation of policy citation networks and statistical analysis of temporal relationships between forest-related policy content and change over time. We find that there was a significant increase in the amount of Indonesian forest-related policy from 1999 to 2016 and that it was largely comprised of content that promotes forest protection and redefines the structure and funding for forest-related organizations. These content changes primarily occurred through the process of policy layering, when new policy does not amend or repeal old policy and regulation.

The CO2 emission reduction is conducted in a three-stage phases. The first stage is to obtain the total amount CO2 emission reduction from the Chinese government goal as our total CO2 emission quota to reduce. The second stage is to allocate the reduction quota to different two-digit level manufacturing industries in China. The third stage is to further allocate the reduction quota for each industry into different provinces. A new inverse data envelopment analysis (InvDEA) model is developed to achieve our goal to allocate CO2 emission quota under several assumptions.

Larger temporal and spatial drought conditions are predicted in future. The temperate south east coastal zone is characterized by dense forests of Eucalyptus. Drought conditions have implications for the functioning of these indigenous ecosystems, and for emissions of reactive gases that are upwind of major metropolitan regions along the eastern coast. Here, we focus on the impact of drought on the emission of isoprene, a volatile organic compound emitted by a range of trees and shrubs. Previous model calculations grossly overestimate observations of the isoprene mixing ratio, potentially due to overestimated emission factors for native vegetation, but could also be due to drought-induced isoprene emission reductions. We develop the implementation of the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) within the CSIRO Chemical Transport Model to include a parameterization of drought using soil moisture. We test this parameterization using two approaches. First, we drive MEGAN using soil moisture fields from two Australian land surface models achieving reductions in isoprene emissions of 24–52% during summer. Second, we use a simple statistical approach to nudge model soil moisture towards satellite observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) instrument. This work is the first application of SMOS towards isoprene emission modelling, providing a constraint on surface soil moisture which extends to global scales. Applying these soil moisture approaches, domain average isoprene emissions reduce by 38–58% in summer. Using these results, errors in basal emissions are likely in the region of 40%. Comparison of modelled soil moisture to observations using root density weighted averages across depths of 4 m showed minor differences of up to 0.04 m3 m−3. We find that the choice of land surface model used in the SMOS assimilations has a greater impact on isoprene emissions than adjusting either the nudging strength or the number of soil levels these satellite data may influence. However there are only small differences of 3% when using hourly or 24-hourly soil moisture input data to drive the emission calculations, suggesting that the lower temporal availability of satellite data does not reduce model quality. As the spatial resolution of satellite observations of atmospheric composition and land surface properties begin to approach the resolution of regulatory air quality models, we anticipate that these data will improve model predictive skills further. © 2019 The Authors","Drought; Isoprene emissions; SMOS; Soil moisture","Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Data reduction; Digital storage; Drought; Emission control; Isoprene; Small satellites; Soil testing; Surface measurement; Volatile organic compounds; Chemical transport models; Isoprene emission; Land surface modeling; Land surface properties; Satellite observations; SMOS; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); South-eastern Australia; Soil moisture; ground water; isoprene; volatile organic compound; air quality; coastal zone; drought; emission control; isoprene; satellite data; shrub; SMOS; soil moisture; tree; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air quality; Article; atmosphere; Australia; calculation; drought; environmental impact; exhaust gas; priority journal; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry; salinity; shrub; soil moisture; summer; surface property; surface soil; transport kinetics; tree; vegetation; Australia; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064491012

The assessment of the therapeutic response is important to change protocol strategy. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT, a valuable tool gives both metabolic and anatomic information for whole-body regions. Obesity is an important risk factor for colorectal cancer. AIM: To evaluate post-surgical and therapeutic colorectal cancer by PET/CT and study obesity association to its prognosis. METHODS: This was a prospective study involved 93 patients with, post-surgical colorectal cancer examined by PET/CT, then follow up after 4-6 months. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between PET/CT and contrast CT. The sensitivity& the specificity were (96.4%-100% & 92.3%-98.2%) for PET/CT and (84.2%-90.2% & 76.5%-85.4%) for contrast CT respectively. Post-therapeutic follow up showed; progressive course (24.5%), stationary course (26.4%), partial regression (28.3%) and complete regression course (20.8%). Obesity is a risk factor for progression with highly statistically significant to treatment response. Obese patients had a progressive or stationary course of the disease. Also, there was a highly statistically significant association between total abdominal fat & visceral abdominal fat areas with good response of treatment. CONCLUSION: PET/CT is the most appropriate imaging technique to detect any recurrence or metastases in post-surgical colorectal cancer with high sensitivity and specificity comparing to CT. Obesity is a predictor risk factor for prognosis of the disease, as generally and abdominally (total & visceral fat) had an association with therapeutic response. © 2019 Safenaz Y.

High-resolution images, which are commonly utilized for carbon estimation, are not readily available, and their cost prohibits communities from reaping the benefits of maintaining their forest under the UN reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation program. Our study explores the combination of readily available and relatively cheaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (4-cm resolution) and multispectral Pleiades (50-cm resolution) images for species classification robustness in view for carbon estimation through object-based image analysis. The images are resampled and used to evaluate the effect of combining multispectral Pleiades image on the accuracies of segmenting UAV images for tree crown projection area (CPA) estimation and species classification. RGB images from a UAV platform are processed in a photogrametric software and combined with the near-infrared band of a Pleiades image to get a UAV-Pleiades image composite. The images are segmented using the ESP 2 tool and the segmentation accuracy compared using a paired t-test. The segmented tree crowns are classified using random trees (RT), support vector machines (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML) classifiers, and the classification accuracies of the three classifiers are compared using the McNemar's chi-squared test. Our study demonstrates a 93.5% accuracy of segmenting UAV-Pleiades image composite, which is significantly higher than the 84.8% accuracy of segmenting UAV images (p < 0.05). Also an 84% classification accuracy of UAV-Pleiades image composite is significantly higher than the 54% classification accuracy of the UAV images (p < 0.05). Of the three classifiers used, the classification accuracies of SVM and RT are significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the ML classifier.

Natural gas use is increasing, and it ranks as one of the most often consumed alternative fuels for public transportation and is leading to improved air quality in urban areas, enabling cleaner production in the transport sector. The investment and maintenance costs for buses fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG) are higher than for diesel buses. Notably, the use of CNG buses can reduce fuel costs. These factors have a significant influence on the financial effectiveness of deploying CNG buses for public transport. Replacing diesel buses with CNG buses in urban transport reduces the emission of toxic substances and greenhouse gases and contributes to reducing the negative impact from the transportation sector on the environment. Fuelling the buses with a renewable energy source also results in reduced external costs, a crucial factor in determining the economic effectiveness of investments in the transport sector.

The present state of knowledge when it comes to the impact of stress on the CO2 and CH4 sorption properties of coal is limited. Hence, in situ sorption capacity or sorption-induced deformation may vary considerably from these specified in the unloaded conditions. As part of this paper, a research device that enables the sorption measurements for coal samples submitted to loads of up to 40 MPa is presented. Sorption experiments with pure CO2 and pure CH4 were carried out by means of the volumetric method, under isobaric-isothermal conditions. Dry coal material in the form of granular coal briquettes was used. Presented results aimed to prove the existence of a relation between the stress state, sorption capacity and volumetric deformation of coal. Gas sorption and desorption processes on coal may be triggered by the action of mechanical factor. The mechanical load applied to the coal sorbent reduces its sorption capacity but has no direct effect on swelling. The sorption or desorption induced volumetric changes of coal occur regardless of the stress state and regardless of the mechanism of the sorption process itself. Deeper coal seams with reduced CO2 and CH4 sorption capacity may not be as useful for ECBM techniques as the shallower coal seams. Reduction of the sorption capacity with depth may also explain the growing threat of coal and methane outbursts in the USCB mines observed in recent years. © 2019","Coal; ECBM; Mechanical load; Outburst threat; Sorption capacity; Stress; Swelling/shrinkage effects","Briquets; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Deformation; Desorption; Stresses; ECBM; Mechanical loads; Outburst threat; Sorption capacities; Swelling/shrinkage; Coal mines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062643956

Plant-associated microbial communities stimulate the plant growth and increase their resistance to various abiotic and biotic stresses. Linking the distribution of microbial diversity and ecosystem functioning is essential to understand ecosystem responses to changing environment. Soil microbial taxa are imperative in relation to global climate changes as they play important and undisputable roles in biogeochemical cycling, plant growth and carbon sequestration. Modern genomic approaches show tremendous potential for identification of uncultivated diversity and finding shifts in the bacterial community associated with sensitive and disease tolerant plants, and understanding how microbes are affected by climate change.

About 46% of the area that was originally covered has been deforested. Land use can cause pronounced reduction in soil carbon stocks that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. The objective of this study was to improve our understanding of the effect of land use on oxidizable carbon fractions, total carbon stocks and humic substances in different layers of soil in a Brazilian semi-arid region. We analyzed soils from tropical dry forest (TDF), forest succession with Anadenanthera falcata (ANA), with Tabebuia alba (TAB), secondary scrubby regeneration (SCR), and non-irrigated maize (MS). Forests showed larger fractions of more labile carbon, except for TDF. The most recalcitrant fraction of carbon stock, humin fraction stock, with the different land use decreased by 38–53% compared to TDF. Oxidizable carbon fractions, carbon stocks, and humic fraction stocks were able to differentiate the successional land uses and agricultural cover from TDF, mainly in the 0–5 cm layer. Our results show that changes in land use, especially with ANA forest succession, showed a larger labile carbon fraction, indicating easy decomposition and loss. Our results provide an alternative tool for the management of deforested areas in tropical dry caatinga ecosystems. This would contribute to the conservation of dry forest systems and could serve as guideline for sustainable management of agriculturally impacted caatinga areas. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon cycle; labile carbon; semi-arid; total carbon stock; tropical dry forest","caatinga; carbon cycle; decomposition; dry forest; forest soil; humic substance; land use change; organic carbon; semiarid region; soil carbon; tropical forest; Brazil; Anadenanthera falcata; Tabebuia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060461973

The government department of plant protection normally collects the crop pest and disease information by manual inspection, which is unable to provide timely and spatially continuous crop growth status and pest/ disease development over large areas. The manuscript aims to bring together and produce cutting edge research to provide crop pest and disease monitoring and forecasting information, integrating multi-source (Earth Observation-EO, meteorological, entomological and plant pathological, etc.) to support decision making in sustainable management of pest and disease. Taking national disease -a fungal disease of wheat rust and national pest - a serious insect pest locust as the experimental object, we conducted the following research: 1) the sensitive spectral features of rust and locust with capability of stresses differentiation would be identified or formed based on field hyperspectral data and UAV hyperspectral images for detection, 2) multi-sources of data that are composed by remote sensing images (eg. GF, Landsat and Sentinel) and meteorological observations would be integrated to evaluating habitat of rust and locust in farmland level, 3) multi-temporal remote sensing images and vegetation ecological dataset are combined to provide environmental information of rust and locust dispersion, and forecast the damaged areas and levels in regional scales. Moreover, an automatic system is developed to do the disease and pest timeseries monitoring and forecasting, also the visual display of the thematic maps and analysis reports. The system is constructed based on WebGIS platform. It selected Browser/Server (B/S) architecture, access the system interface through a web browser, simple, quick and easy to operate. And, it could timely, efficiently, quantitatively do the extraction and analysis of crop pest and disease occurrence and developing information, also produce pest and disease thematic maps and scientific report. The crop pest and disease monitoring and forecasting system, can provide effective information of pest and disease developing for our agricultural sector, provide a scientific basis to formulate pest and disease prevention and control measures, and also provide data basis and technical support for the crop network management. Based on the system, we analysed the damaged situation and changes of national wheat rust in 2019, and locust in Tianjing 2019. The results would not only promote efficacy of pest and disease management and prevention by improving the accuracy of monitoring and forecasting, but also help to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides, which could thus guarantee the food security and sustainable development of agriculture in China. © 2019 IEEE.","Crop; Disease; Forecasting; Monitoring; Pest; System","Aircraft detection; Atmospheric movements; Chemical contamination; Climate change; Crops; Decision making; Disease control; Diseases; Food supply; Forecasting; Information management; Maps; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Sustainable development; Weather forecasting; Disease prevention and controls; Environmental information; Global climate changes; Government departments; Meteorological observation; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Pest; System; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072938072

Nations, communities, and individuals' current ability to deal with the impacts will be continuously undermined and insufficient to deal with more complex future disasters. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 2015–2030 is a global strategy for reducing the risks of disasters. It has 4 priorities by which Priority 2 calls for strengthening disaster risk governance (DRG). We find that this short paper critically analyzes progress, challenges and strategies to strengthen DRG. We find that there is enormous progress for DRG planning and implementation at the international, regional and national level, mostly in terms of formation of organizations and networks for DRR. We call for increasing the capacity of local actors through providing more resources, data and capacity for decision making. We propose four strategies to deal with future complexities and uncertainties in DRR: reduce the underlying vulnerability as the root cause of disasters; be inclusive/leave no-one behind: focus on vulnerable groups, migrants and displaced; governing urban disaster risks; governing climate change adaptation and mitigation; and governing for resilience: towards adaptive and transformative governance. © 2019 The Author(s)",,"adaptive management; climate change; decision making; disaster management; governance approach; policy implementation; risk assessment; strategic approach; vulnerability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084565338

Less is known about the risk at lower concentrations. The association of long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, NO2, and NOx with all-cause mortality and stroke was investigated in a cohort of men aged ≥ 65 years who lived in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. Methods: Land use regression models were used to estimate longterm exposure to air pollutants at participant's home address (n = 11,627) over 16 years. Different metrics of exposure were assigned: baseline; year before the outcome event; and average exposure across follow-up period. The Mortality Register and Hospital Morbidity Data from the Western Australia Data Linkage System were used to ascertain mortality and stroke cases. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for age, smoking, education, and body mass index for all-cause mortality. For fatal and hospitalized stroke, the models included variables controlled for all-cause mortality plus hypertension. Results: Fifty-four percent of all-participants died, 3% suffered a fatal stroke, and 14% were hospitalized stroke cases. PM2.5 absorbance increased the risk of all-cause mortality with adjusted HR of 1.12 (1.02-1.23) for baseline and average exposures, and 1.14 (1.02- 1.24) for past-year exposure. There were no associations between PM2.5 absorbance, NO2, and NOx and stroke outcomes. However, PM2.5 was associated with reduced risks of fatal stroke. Conclusion: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 absorbance was associated with all-cause mortality among older men exposed to low concentrations; and exposure to PM2.5 was associated with reduced risk of fatal stroke.

Realizing such interfacing in a nanobiohybrid organism (or nanorg) requires (1) chemical coupling via affinity binding and self-assembly, (2) the energetic coupling between optoelectronic states of artificial materials with the cellular process, and (3) the design of appropriate interfaces ensuring biocompatibility. Here we show that seven different core-shell quantum dots (QDs), with excitations ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared energies, couple with targeted enzyme sites in bacteria. When illuminated by light, these QDs drive the renewable production of different biofuels and chemicals using carbon-dioxide (CO2), water, and nitrogen (from air) as substrates. These QDs use their zinc-rich shell facets for affinity attachment to the proteins. Cysteine zwitterion ligands enable uptake through the cell, facilitating cell survival. Together, these nanorgs catalyze light-induced air-water-CO2 reduction with a high turnover number (TON) of ∼106-108 (mols of product per mol of cells) to biofuels like isopropanol (IPA), 2,3-butanediol (BDO), C11-C15 methyl ketones (MKs), and hydrogen (H2); and chemicals such as formic acid (FA), ammonia (NH3), ethylene (C2H4), and degradable bioplastics polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).

However, coordinated control systems of urban arterial roads often do not achieve the desired effect. On the contrary, they are very likely to increase the traffic congestion on arterial roads, resulting in more delays of the platoon with more exhaust emissions, if the coordinated control system does not have effective settings. Meanwhile, taking into account increasing environmental pollution, measures are needed to solve the conflict between environmental and traffic management. Thus, in order to ensure the smooth flow of urban arterial roads while considering the environment, this paper develops a bi-objective offset optimization model, with reducing delays of the platoon on arterial roads as the primary objective, and reducing exhaust emissions as the secondary objective. The proposed bi-objective model is based on the division of platoon operating modes on arterial roads, and more pollutant types, including NOx, HC, and CO, are considered when measuring environmental impact. Further, the modified hierarchical method, combining the branch and bound approach with the introductions of a relaxation coefficient, is employed to solve the model. By introducing a relaxation coefficient, the modified hierarchical method overcomes the defects of the traditional one. Finally, Xi Dajie Road in Beijing was taken as an example. The results showed that the bi-objective offset optimization model, considering both the delays and emissions of the platoon reduced delays by up to 20% and emissions by 7% compared with the existing timing plan. If compared with the offset optimization model considering delays only, such a model increases delays no more than 3% and reduces emissions by 6%. © 2019 by the authors.","Bi-objective model; Delays; Exhaust emissions; Offset optimization; Platoon; Urban arterial","conflict management; emission control; environmental impact; exhaust emission; numerical model; optimization; traffic congestion; traffic management; transport vehicle; travel time; urban area; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073914176

It seems that key economic models have greatly overestimated the delay between carbon emissions and warming, and ignored the saturation of carbon sinks that takes place when the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide rises. This has important implications for climate policy. If carbon emissions are abated, damages are avoided almost immediately.

Herein, a cooperative role involving an ultrathin 2D structure and surface defects is employed to design defective Bi 2 MoO 6 ultrathin nanosheets, to boost the CO 2 photoreduction activity under water with no sacrificial agent, co-catalyst or extra photosensitizer. Bi 2 MoO 6 ultrathin nanosheets with surface “Bi[sbnd]O″ vacancy pairs are grown via a template-directed strategy, as proved by STEM-ADF and positron annihilation spectroscopy. The engineered “Bi[sbnd]O″ vacancy pairs tune the local atomic structure, electronic structure of Bi 2 MoO 6 and serve as charge separation centers to boost the electron-hole separation. Meanwhile, the defective ultrathin structure favors the CO 2 adsorption, activation and CO desorption processes. With the merits of atomically-thin configuration and surface defects, the defective Bi 2 MoO 6 ultrathin nanosheets display 2.55 times improved CO formation rate than their bulk counterpart under light irradiation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bi 2 MoO 6; CO 2 reduction; Photocatalytic; Ultrathin; Vacancy pairs","Carbon dioxide; Electronic structure; Energy conversion; Nanosheets; Photosensitizers; Positron annihilation spectroscopy; Surface defects; Bi2MoO6; CO2 reduction; Electron-hole separation; Local atomic structures; Photo-catalytic; Ultra-thin; Ultra-thin structures; Ultrathin nanosheets; Bismuth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064327774

However, little is known about how belowground plant traits vary across climate and soil gradients. Focusing on interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) in western Canada, we tested whether fine-root traits relate to the environment at the intraspecific level. We quantified the variation in commonly measured functional root traits (morphological, chemical, and architectural traits) among the first three fine-root orders (i.e., absorptive fine roots) and across biogeographic gradients in climate and soil factors. Moderate but consistent trait-environment linkages occurred across populations of Douglas-fir, despite high levels of within-site variation. Shifts in morphological traits across regions were decoupled from those in chemical traits. Fine roots in colder/drier climates were characterized by a lower tissue density, higher specific area, larger diameter, and lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratio than those in warmer/wetter climates. Our results showed that Douglas-fir fine roots do not rely on adjustments in architectural traits to adapt rooting strategies in different environments. Intraspecific fine-root adjustments at the regional scale do not fit along a single axis of root economic strategy and are concordant with an increase in root acquisitive potential in colder/drier environments. © 2019 by the authors.

As it can be difficult to increase cow productivity, mitigation options beyond this production strategy need to be identified. The aim of this study was to identify entry points for mitigation of GHG emissions in small-scale dairy farms in Lembang Sub-district, West Java, Indonesia. Data on herd composition, productivity, feeding, and manure management were collected in a survey of 300 randomly selected dairy farms. Characteristics of farms with the 25% lowest (<3291 kg milk/cow/y), medium 50% (3291–4975 kg milk/cow/y), and 25% highest milk yields (≥4976 kg milk/cow/y) were compared. Life cycle assessment was then performed to estimate the cradle-to-farm gate GHG emission intensity (EI) of farms. The relationship between EI and milk yield per cow for all farms was modeled and farms with an EI below and above their predicted EI were compared (“low” and “high” EI farms). Results showed that milk yield explained 57% of the variance in EI among farms. Farms with medium and high milk yields were more often specialized farms, fed more tofu waste and compound feed, and had higher feed costs than farms with low milk yields (P < 0.05). Farms with high milk yields also applied less manure on farm land than farms with low milk yields (P < 0.05). Low EI farms had fewer cows, and fed less rice straw, more cassava waste, and more compound concentrate feed (particularly the type of concentrates consisting largely of by-products from milling industries) than high EI farms (P < 0.05). In addition, low EI farms discharged more manure, stored less solid manure, used less manure for anaerobic digestion followed by daily spreading, and applied less manure N on farmland than high EI farms (P < 0.05). Some associations were affected by confounding factors. Farm management factors associated with milk yield and the residual variation in EI were considered potential entry points for GHG mitigation. Feeding less rice straw and discharging manure, however, were considered unsuitable mitigation strategies because of expected trade-offs with other environmental issues or negative impacts on food-feed competition. © Copyright © 2019 de Vries, Zahra, Wouters, van Middelaar, Oosting, Tiesnamurti and Vellinga.","climate change mitigation; dairy cattle; feeding; greenhouse gases; manure management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077639161

Until recently, the lack of integrative studies using archaeological, palaeoecological and palaeoclimatological data prevented an evaluation of the relationship between climate change, distinct subsistence strategies and cultural transformations across the largest rainforest of the world, Amazonia. Here we review the most relevant cultural changes seen in the archaeological record of six different regions within Greater Amazonia during late pre-Columbian times. We compare the chronology of those cultural transitions with high-resolution regional palaeoclimate proxies, showing that, while some societies faced major reorganization during periods of climate change, others were unaffected and even flourished. We propose that societies with intensive, specialized land-use systems were vulnerable to transient climate change. In contrast, land-use systems that relied primarily on polyculture agroforestry, resulting in the formation of enriched forests and fertile Amazonian dark earth in the long term, were more resilient to climate change. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"archeology; Brazil; climate change; forest; rain forest; Archaeology; Brazil; Climate Change; Forests; Rainforest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068193772

Plume transects at successively further downwind distances provide a decreasing gradient of nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations, which together with the implied loss rates of isoprene, constrains the OH dependence on NOx. We find that OH concentrations were highest at nitrogen dioxide concentrations near 1–2 ppbv and decreased at higher and at lower concentrations. These findings agree with the dependence of OH on NOx concentrations expected from known chemical reactions but are not consistent with some studies reporting direct OH measurements higher than expected in regions of the atmosphere with low NOx (NO &lt; 0.08 and NO2 &lt; 0.46 ppbv) and high biogenic hydrocarbon emissions. ©2019.

Each region behaves strategically and maximizes its welfare net of environmental damage caused by the pollutant stock. The emission-output ratio is reduced by investment in region specific clean technology which evolves over time. The spatio-temporal dynamics of the pollutant stock is described by a parabolic partial differential equation. Using aggregate variables we study the feedback Nash equilibrium of a discrete-space model which could be seen as a space discretization of the continuous-space model. The discrete-space model presents the three main features of the original formulation: the model is truly dynamic; the agents behave strategically; and the model incorporates spatial aspects. For special functional forms previously used in the literature we analytically characterize the feedback Nash equilibrium and evaluate the impact of the introduction of the spatial dimension in the economic-environmental model. We show that our spatial model is a generalization of the model that disregards the spatial aspects. We analytically show that as the parameter describing how pollution diffuses among regions tends to infinity the equilibrium policies converge to those in the non-spatial setting. In the non-cooperative framework the spatially non-myopic behavior prescribes lower equilibrium emission rates, and consequently a lower global pollution stock. This is compatible with greater long-run welfares. In the cooperative framework, although the strategic interaction among the players does not exist, the only decision-maker still makes spatially strategic decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Differential games; OR in environment and climate change; Spatial dynamics; Spatially distributed controls; Transboundary pollution","Climate change; Computation theory; Decision making; Feedback; Game theory; Geographical regions; Cooperative frameworks; Differential games; Distributed control; Parabolic partial differential equations; Spatial dynamics; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Strategic interactions; Trans-boundary pollution; Pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059810716

In fact, among the biotic stresses, damage caused by insect pests, which can be categorized as either minor or major pests, can severely constrain the potential yield of rice. Hence, planting transgenic rice is considered a solution for reducing environmental and human health impacts. Therefore, in this research, life cycle assessment for environmental and human health impacts of transgenic and non-transgenic rice cultivars was considered. Hence, four transgenic lines (driven from back cross of Khazar cultivar with transgenic line of Tarom Molaii) along with conventional cultivars (non-transgenic parents) were cultivated under the standard of biosafety protocol in three isolated sites in north of Iran in 2016. In order to conducted life cycle assessment, first, the results of each site were analyzed separately, and since there were not differences among the impact categories and indices in different sites, the average for the results of the three sites are being presented. Results show that decreased insecticides application in transgenic cultivars lowers the need for labor, machineries, and fuel, thereby contributing to reduction in use of energy and greenhouse gases emission from construction, transportation and application of inputs during cultivation. Furthermore, most investigated impact categories were obtained high for Tarom Molaii and Khazar and less for three transgenic lines. In addition, the most important categories were non-renewable energy, global warming, aquatic eutrophication, aquatic acidification, terrestrial acid/nutri, land occupation, terrestrial ecotoxicity, ozone layer depletion, ionizing radiation, respiratory inorganics, respiratory organics, cumulative energy demand, ecological footprint, greenhouse gas protocol, water footprint, carcinogens and non-carcinogens. Therefore, according to the findings of this research, it was observed that the emission amount of environmental pollutants has a positive correlation with the consumption of inputs and field management practices. © 2019","Environmental pollutants; GM rice; Heavy metals; Life cycle assessment; Resources depletion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067238036

With a mega-biodiversity ecosystem, the assessment of forest cover resilience will enhance the effectiveness of climate adaptive conservation strategies. In the current study, we have used an open source tree canopy cover percentage (TCC %) data to map the spatial distribution of forest, scrub, grassland and treeless, and to relate with long term annual precipitation. The natural occurrences forest, scrub, grassland and treeless were identified in the precipitation ranges as 340–8650 mm, 196–1018 mm, 167–995 mm, and 34–965 mm precipitation, respectively; whereas their mean values were observed as 1952 mm, 779 mm, 760 mm, and 322 mm respectively. We applied binary logistic regression with the binary presence and absence of life forms, and used the probability value to define the resilience state and precipitation thresholds. Only 0.02% of the total forest covers in India are estimated least resilient observed in the dry regions in the trans-Himalaya. Whereas, the forest covers in the wet climate regimes as the Western Ghats, Western Himalaya, Eastern Ghats and North-East (NE) India are predicted highly resilient. The forest cover resilience curve saturates about 1400 mm precipitation, indicating majority forest covers in India are extremely resilient that can withstand large precipitation alterations in addition to the shorter drought periods. However, the TCC % loss and gain during 2000–2017 were observed dominantly in highly resilient forest covers areas may be indicating its anthropogenic origin. The precipitation thresholds of each life forms and forest cover resilience are critically important in ecological research. Moreover, the spatially explicit forest cover resilience map offers to integrate with other spatial and non-spatial data to frame uniform and improved conservation and management policies in India under the threats to climate alteration. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Binary logistic regression; Forest resilience; Precipitation threshold; Tree canopy cover","adaptive management; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; forest cover; forest ecosystem; precipitation (climatology); regression analysis; spatial distribution; strategic approach; threshold; Eastern Ghats; India; Western Ghats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064350830

The temporal evolution of Corg content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico)by using 210Pb-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01–0.03 g cm−2 yr−1)than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02–3.21 g cm−2 yr−1). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The Corg stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2–53.6 Mg ha−1 at 10 cm depth; 259–320 Mg ha−1 at 1 m depth)than in seagrass cores (5.7–14.4 Mg ha−1, and 80–98, Mg ha−1, respectively), whereas Corg burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13–60 g m−2 yr−1)than in seagrass (9–144 g m−2 yr−1)habitats, and the temporal variations observed in Corg burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall Corg stock (485 ± 51 Gg C)for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby.

These films were characterized by XRD, AFM, photoluminescence, UV–Vis, ellipsometry and XPS. The optical properties of TiO2 thin films with different thickness, influenced their photocatalytic behavior in two photoinduced process. When TiO2 thin films were irradiated with a UV light, midgap states were generated and the electrons were placed in lower energies than its band gap, favoring the photocatalytic hydrogen production and CO2 photoreduction. From PL technique analyses it was observed that electrons occupied midgap states between the bands, with lower energies than the band gap. With these results it was possible to propose an energy diagram in order to correlate with photoinduced processes results. The presence of Ti3+ species was reconfirmed by means of XPS analyses. These species could be found in the midgap states, generated by the interaction between the UV irradiation and the film surface, which contributed to the photocatalytic activity of the films. The hydrogen production was similar for all the thin films studied (33–35 μmol) associated to the presence of similar energy midgap states. In the case of CO2 photoreduction, all films produced CH2O (8951 and 6252 μmol/g) and the films with a thickness of 330 and 420 nm generated CH3OH (970 and 292 μmol/g). The extinction coefficient confirmed the XRD results for the film with greatest deposited time, which exhibited the highest crystallinity.

To be successful, conservation strategies now need to account for geographical patterns in traits sensitive to climate change, as well as climate threats to species-level diversity. As part of an effort to provide such information, we conducted a climate vulnerability assessment that included all anadromous Pacific salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus spp.) population units listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Using an expert-based scoring system, we ranked 20 attributes for the 28 listed units and 5 additional units. Attributes captured biological sensitivity, or the strength of linkages between each listing unit and the present climate; climate exposure, or the magnitude of projected change in local environmental conditions; and adaptive capacity, or the ability to modify phenotypes to cope with new climatic conditions. Each listing unit was then assigned one of four vulnerability categories. Units ranked most vulnerable overall were Chinook (O. tshawytscha) in the California Central Valley, coho (O. kisutch) in California and southern Oregon, sockeye (O. nerka) in the Snake River Basin, and spring-run Chinook in the interior Columbia and Willamette River Basins. We identified units with similar vulnerability profiles using a hierarchical cluster analysis. Life history characteristics, especially freshwater and estuary residence times, inter-played with gradations in exposure from south to north and from coastal to interior regions to generate landscape-level patterns within each species. Nearly all listing units faced high exposures to projected increases in stream temperature, sea surface temperature, and ocean acidification, but other aspects of exposure peaked in particular regions. Anthropogenic factors, especially migration barriers, habitat degradation, and hatchery influence, have reduced the adaptive capacity of most steelhead and salmon populations. Enhancing adaptive capacity is essential to mitigate for the increasing threat of climate change.

Consequently, Spain, as European Member State, is currently facing the initial steps of the so called ""Energy Transition"" that will hopefully end up with the so called ""Climate Change Law"". By 2030, the Spanish electricity mix will be very different compared with the current one, due to the fact that all plants that will be decommissioned in the coming years will not be replaced by conventional technologies but totally by renewables. This study has demonstrated that STE/CSP will be essential to achieve a 2030 EU compliant electricity mix without Coal, Nuclear and with much less gas consumption and backup power than currently assumed while ensuring quality of supply and grid stability without pool price increase. The key will be a balanced share between PV and STE in the new solar capacity to be added and the dispatching of STE when PV starts to ramp down. This study has considered hourly data over 4 years of the Spanish electricity demand, broken down by all electricity generation sources. Then, considering a yearly increase of the demand of 1.2%1 and a smart combination of Renewables, we claim that STE would be the essential technology choice for meeting this target while reducing greenhouse gases and allowing further non-dispatchable, non-synchronous, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) penetration. At the same time, long term auctions-based remuneration model would keep generation costs below 50€/MWh. This demonstration has taken into account Spanish real hourly natural resources and real hourly demand. The study basically answers how EU RES targets can be achieved, or exceeded, if 2030 Spanish natural resources (sun, wind and water) are the same than either 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017 real ones. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070637275

Currently, ammonia for fertilizers is one of the highest volume commodity chemicals and is produced through the Haber-Bosch process. However, this process is energy and carbon intensive and is highly centralized, which leads to inequitable distribution of fertilizers across the globe. Developed countries have an abundance of fertilizer and often over-apply it, leading to nitrogen pollution in water and air. Contrarily, developing countries lack access to fertilizer, resulting in malnutrition and hunger. Solar fertilizers provide a route to combine solar energy with nitrogen, oxygen, and water that are available in the air to produce nitrogen-based nutrients for plants. This work examines the agronomic and technical considerations of solar fertilizers and suggests that they present an opportunity to promote more equitable, efficient, and sustainable production and utilization of fertilizers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Nitrogen fertilizers are critical to supporting the current global human population. However, current means of production require massive energy inputs, have a large carbon footprint, and are highly centralized. One sustainable alternative is the decentralized production of “solar fertilizers” that utilize solar energy and air as inputs. This work examines the feasibility of solar fertilizer technologies including agricultural implications of decentralized fertilizer production, the technological requirements to achieve solar fertilizers, and initial targets for key performance metrics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Using solar energy to convert triple bonded molecular dinitrogen from the air into fixed nitrogen products that act as nutrients for plants presents an opportunity to develop “solar fertilizers.” The approach has much in common with solar fuels and chemicals but also has some unique advantages and challenges. The possibility of producing nitrogen fertilizers at a country's regional level may be able to effectively compete with existing technology by reducing the per unit cost of N nutrient production, removing or reducing transportation costs within or across international borders, and integrating with existing infrastructure. Furthermore, solar fertilizer technologies can reduce the energy and carbon footprint currently associated with the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. Deploying solar fertilizer technology in developing countries can also improve access to fertilizers for farmers in remote regions and help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 of ending hunger and ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all people, in particular the poor. However, there are also substantial challenges that must be overcome in identifying active catalytic materials and effectively integrating solar fertilizer processes with agricultural infrastructure. This paper outlines the agronomic considerations that drive the development of decentralized solar fertilizer production and explores their implications on fertilizer prices with an emphasis on the developing world. The work also provides an overview of the technical strategies that may enable photo(electro)chemical fertilizer production processes, including the use of fertigation or production of enhanced biochar, and identifies some target metrics and testing considerations to promote efficient development of new fertilizer materials and processes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","agronomics; ammonia; electrochemistry; nitrogen; photocatalysis; sustainability","Agronomy; Ammonia; Carbon footprint; Costs; Developing countries; Electrochemistry; Emission control; Image enhancement; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Photocatalysis; Planning; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Water pollution; agronomics; Chemical fertilizers; Decentralized production; Fertilizer production; International border; Materials and process; Means of productions; Sustainable production; Nitrogen fertilizers; agronomy; ammonia; catalysis; electrochemistry; fertilizer; nitrogen; solar power; sustainability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068691394

While biodiversity-function experiments show that greater plant diversity increases resistance of plant productivity to climate extremes, it is not known whether real-world management options for grassland restoration likewise stabilize ecosystem responses to extreme climate events. We used a long-term (23 year) field experiment in northern England to test the hypothesis that management aimed at biodiversity restoration increases the resistance and recovery of ecosystem carbon (C) fluxes to short-term summer drought. This was tested by measuring plant, soil and microbial responses to a simulated drought in experimental grassland plots where fertilizer application and seed addition have been managed to enhance plant species diversity. The cessation of fertilizer application brought about small increases in plant species richness. Additionally, cessation of fertilizer application reduced overall plant productivity and promoted hemi-parasitic plants at the expense of grasses and forbs. Resistance of CO2 fluxes to drought, measured as ecosystem respiration, was greater in non-fertilized plots, as lower plant biomass reduced water demand, likely aided by proportionally more hemi-parasitic plants further reducing plant biomass. Additionally, legumes increased under drought, thereby contributing to overall resistance of plant productivity. Recovery of soil microbial C and nitrogen was more rapid after rewetting than soil microbial community composition, irrespective of restoration treatment, suggesting high resilience of soil microbial communities to drought. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that while grassland diversity restoration management increases the resistance of carbon fluxes to drought, it also reduces agricultural yields, revealing a trade-off for land managers. Furthermore legumes, promoted through long-term restoration treatments, can help to maintain plant community productivity under drought by increasing their biomass. As such, grassland management strategies not only have consequences for ecosystem processes, but also the capacity to withstand extreme weather events. © 2019 The Authors.

Quantifying these impacts as they vary across regions, sectors, time, and social and climatological scenarios supports detailed planning, policy, and risk management. This article summarises and compares recent climate impact assessments in Europe (the JRC PESETA III project) and the USA (the American Climate Prospectus project). Both implement a multi-sector perspective combining high resolution climate data with sectoral impact and economic models. The assessments differ in their coverage of sectors and scenarios, mix of empirical and process-based methods, handling of uncertainty, and representation of damages. Despite the dissimilarities, projected relative economic impacts are comparable, with human mortality as the dominant impact category. Both studies further show a large spatial heterogeneity of impacts that may amplify pre-existing economic inequality in the EU and US, and that mitigation can considerably reduce economic impacts. The comparison highlights the various decision-points involved in interdisciplinary climate impact modelling and lessons learnt in both projects, on the basis of which we provide recommendations for further research. © 2019 The Author(s).

The detailed flame structures, such as the inner recirculation zone (IRZ) and exhaust tube vortex (ETV), were observed via particle image velocimetry (PIV) using various swirl combinations. The appearance of the ETV structure in the swirl-stabilized flame was an attractive flame to reduce NOx emissions that was shown to be associated with the oxygen-deficient and fuel-rich atmosphere similar to the environment of the IRZ. The flow fields of the swirl-stabilized flame were divided into four regions (zone (1): IRZ region; zone (2): stagnation region; zones (3) and (4): transition regions). For the co-swirling coal flames with swirl conditions of Sco = 0.9 and 1.3, relatively uniform patterns of the root-mean-square of the axial velocity fluctuation (u′rms) appeared between the IRZ and ETV, including zone (2). In addition, the ratio of the strain rate from the velocity gradient (SR) of zones (3) and (4) converged between 35% and 40% in the co-swirling flames with swirl conditions of Sco = 0.9 and 1.3.

Given that regular working may deviate outdoor air pollution exposure, the association between air pollution and fetal growth restriction can be different across maternal working status. This study was to assess possible effect modification by maternal employment in the association between exposure to PM during pregnancy and fetal growth restriction. Methods: Using hourly PM less than or equal to 10 and 2.5 μm in diameter (PM10 and PM2.5) regulatory monitoring data for 2001-2012 and 2008-2012, respectively, and birth certificate data for 2002-2012, we computed maternal exposures with district-level averages of PM10 and PM2.5 during one year before birth, entire pregnancy, and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The outcomes of fetal growth restriction were assessed by small for gestational age (SGA, weighted &lt;10th percentile in the same gestational age) as well as low birth weight (LBW, &lt; 2.5 kg) at term. We performed logistic regression to examine the association between PM and each of fetal growth restriction outcomes adjusting for individual risk factors. For effect modification by maternal employment, we estimated adjusted odds ratio (OR) of SGA or LBW for interquartile (IQR) increases in PM10 or PM2.5 stratified by employed and non-employed mothers. We also computed relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) to investigate additive interaction. Results: Among 824,011 singleton term births, 34.0% (279,856) were employed and 66.0% (544,155) were non-employed mothers. Proportions of LBW were 1.5% in employed and 1.6% in non-employed (P &lt; 0.001). SGA occurred in 12.7% of employed and 12.8% of non- employed (P = 0.124) mothers. For non-employed mothers, we observed increased odds of SGA per IQR increase in PM10 for one year before birth (OR = 1.02, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.00-1.04, P = 0.028). ORs of SGA for full pregnancy period and the 3rd trimester were also positive but did not reach statistical significance. We did not observe positive association for PM2.5. RERI was not significant both for PM10 and PM2.5. Conclusions: We did not observe evidence of effect modification by maternal employment in the association between ambient PM and fetal growth restriction. Future studies using more refined exposure measures should confirm this finding. © 2019 The Author(s).","Air pollution; Employment; Low birth weight; Particulate matter; Small for gestational age","adult; air pollution; Article; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; employment; female; human; intrauterine growth retardation; low birth weight; maternal exposure; particulate matter; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; retrospective study; risk factor; small for date infant; South Korea; third trimester pregnancy; unemployment; young adult; adverse event; air pollutant; employment; intrauterine growth retardation; newborn; odds ratio; particulate matter; pregnancy; statistical model; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Employment; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Logistic Models; Maternal Exposure; Odds Ratio; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069511899

One possible approach is the use of coal ash as fill material in mine reclamation, but environmental concerns have so far blocked the implementation of this procedure, and no relevant regulations or guidelines exist. In this study, we review international approaches to the environmental management of coal ash recycling and consider how the lessons learned can be applied to South Korea. Each studied country was proactively using coal ash for beneficial uses under locally suitable conditions. The United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan are all putting coal ash to beneficial use following thorough analyses of the environmental impact based on several considerations, including bulk concentration, coal ash leachate concentration, field inspections, and water quality monitoring. Our findings can contribute to the development of proper regulations and policies to encourage the use of recycled coal ash in South Korea as an approach to managing carbon emissions and climate changes. There are currently no relevant regulations in South Korea, so we consider the adoption of the strictest standards at each stage of the other cases at the time of introduction. Based on our findings, detailed and appropriate management guidelines can be developed in the future. Establishing management plans for complex carbonates, verifying their environmental stability, and using them as fill material will provide clear benefits for South Korea in the future. © 2019 by the authors.","Coal ash; Complex carbonates; Environmental policy; Mine reclamation; South Korea","ash; carbon emission; climate change; coal mine; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental policy; European Union; leachate; policy implementation; recycling; Australia; Japan; South Korea; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068683824

In this article, two pivotal factors of farming practices and climate change were included to assess their role in the future paddy water management of Korea. Field surveys were conducted across irrigated areas of twelve agricultural reservoirs to distinguish traditional and current paddy farming practices. Projected climate for two future time slices the 2060s (2020 to 2059) and the 2100s (2060 to 2100) under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) were used for climate change impact assessment. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc), effective rainfall, gross duty of water (GDW) and annual inflow were simulated from 1987 to 2100 under both farming practices. Future climate projections suggested a continuous warming trend accompanied by distinctively negative/positive shifts in central/southern region annual rainfall by the end of the twenty-first century. Annual inflow in the central (southern) region reservoirs exhibited downward (upward) trends during the 2060s and only upward trends during the 2100s, respectively, whereas rice ETc showed upward tendencies regardless of the farming practices. Rice season effective rainfall varied for different reservoirs mostly showing increasing tendencies. The GDW increased implying that projected positive rainfall shifts might not withhold the driving impacts of temperature rise over regional irrigation water demands. Following the traditional farming practices in future would intensify the anticipated rise in irrigation demand and may lead to water shortages given the present storage capacities of agricultural reservoirs. © 2019, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering.","Climate change; Farming practices; Irrigation water demand; Paddy rice","Irrigation; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Water management; Water supply; Agricultural reservoirs; Climate change impact assessments; Crop evapotranspiration; Farming practices; Future climate projections; Influence mechanism; Irrigation waters; Paddy rice; Climate change; climate change; environmental impact assessment; evapotranspiration; farming system; irrigation; paddy farming; rainfall; twenty first century; water demand; water management; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064518720

In addition, increased intensity and frequency of wildfires is posing threats to Himalayan ecosystems. Modeling a species’ ecological niche and its potential distribution under projected impacts of climate change and distribution of wildfires provides an understanding of the behavior of native flora in altered climatic conditions. In this study, we predicted future distribution of four endemic tree species Pinus roxburghii, Quercus semecarpifolia, Rhododendron arboretum, and Cedrus deodara in western Himalaya under A1B scenario of Special Report on Emission Scenarios for 2030, 2050, and 2080, under two conditions: (i) without wildfire and (ii) with wildfire. We included wildfire occurrence as a predictor variable in the Maxent model along with 35 climate variables, to predict the future distribution of four indicator species. As per the predictions, there will be a significant reduction in the geographic distribution of the indicator species under the ‘with wildfire’ scenario as compared to the ‘without wildfire’ scenario. The future distribution range was shifted towards the northern and north-eastern regions of our study area owing to higher moisture availability. We predicted reduction in the range of C. deodara during 2030, R. arboreum during 2050, and P. roxburghii during 2080, while the distribution of Q. semecarpifolia remained unchanged. Our modeling predicted that climate change could induce reduction, expansion, and shift in the distributions of endemic plant species, which could lead to alteration in the endemic flora of the Himalayas. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change scenario; Maximum entropy method; Species distribution modelling; Wildfire","biodiversity; bioindicator; climate change; coniferous tree; endemic species; floristics; global warming; maximum entropy analysis; spatial distribution; wildfire; Himalayas; Cedrus deodara; Pinus roxburghii; Quercus semecarpifolia; Rhododendron; Rhododendron arboreum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062594545

The Hybrid Solar Receiver Combustor (HSRC), which directly integrates the function of a solar receiver and a combustor into a single device, is a particularly promising hybrid technology. Its design allows the receiver to operate in three modes: solar-only, combustion-only and a mixed-mode (a combination of both solar and combustion). Compared with the present state-of-the-art in hybrid solar-combustion systems (which collect the thermal energy from the solar and combustion sources in separate devices and then combine them subsequently), the HSRC offers a reduction in total infrastructure (and hence capital costs), heat-exchange surface area, start-up/shut-down losses and pollutant emissions, due to a reduced need to start-up the back-up combustion plant. Also, the use of the HSRC with renewable fuels (e.g. hydrogen, syngas) offers the additional potential for low-cost carbon neutral or carbon-negative energy, although no data on performance for systems fed with alternative fuels are presently available. To this aim, the present work provides the first direct measurement of the performance of a Hybrid Solar Receiver Combustor (HSRC) fed with hydrogen-based fuels. A laboratory-scale HSRC prototype operated in the Moderate or Intense Low oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion regime was tested at a nominal capacity of 12-kWth for both the combustion-only and mixed mode, using hydrogen and syngas (H2/CO=2/1 v/v) as fuels. A 5-kWel xenon-arc lamp was used to simulate solar radiation into the device. The influence of the mode of operation on the thermal efficiency, heat losses, heat flux distribution within the cavity and pollutant emissions are reported for a range of values of the heat extraction. It was found that the combustion process can be successfully stabilised within the HSRC over a wide range of operating conditions, and in the mixed-mode of operation, providing ultra-low NOx emissions. The thermal performance was found to be similar for all the modes of operation, despite the different nature of the two energy sources and fuel composition. Overall, this study highlights that, if renewable H2 or syngas are used as fuels, the device can efficiently operate in all the modes of operation employing 100% renewable energy. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070652475

Two cases were considered: i) straight biochar use and ii) biochar in combination with compost (COMBI: 20% biochar and 80% compost mass fraction), at application rates of 5 and 10 Mg ha−1 respectively. Based on realistic estimations of achievable crop-yield performances by biochar and COMBI addition to dry soils, the effect of current policies on the economic viability of biochar deployment and farmers’ income has been investigated. Using a cost-model we identified the required levels of support, in the form of (i) area subsidies for crop cultivation, (ii) tradable carbon certificates (credits), and (iii) REDII-compliant biofuel support for Aviation and Maritime, so to make biochar and sunflower cultivation in EU MED dry marginal lands competitive for sustainable crop-based biofuels. Results show that, by employing existing policy instruments, sufficient income can be generated for famers to recover marginal land, sequester large amount of carbon by BECCS at costs (∼82 € Mg−1 of CO2) falling at or below the typical range of CCS measures, as well as offer additional environmental and socio-economic positive benefits. The combination of currently operational economic mechanisms from the Common Agricultural Policy, the Climate Policy, and the Renewable Energy Directive II can: i) maintain domestic farming activities, ii) support the implementation of biochar projects at local level, iii) contribute to achieve EU and national biofuel targets without generating ILUC impacts and iv) achieve unprecedent potential for carbon sequestration.

Against the background of global climate change, further investigation is needed on how meteorological characteristics and complex geographical environment variations can drive spatial air pollution variations. This study analyzed the response of air pollutant emissions to climate change and the potential effects of air pollutant emissions on human health by integrating the air pollutant emission simulation model (GAINS) with 3 versions and CMIP5. The mechanism by which meteorological characteristics and geographical matrices can drive air pollution based on monitoring data at the site-scale was also examined. We found the total global emission of major air pollutants increased 1.32 times during 1970-2010. Air pollutant emissions will increase 2.89% and 4.11% in China and developed countries when the scenario of only maximum technically feasible reductions is performed (V4a) during 2020-2050. However, it will decrease 19.33% and 6.78% respectively by taking the V5a climate scenario into consideration, and precipitation variation will contribute more to such change, especially in China. Locally, the air circulation mode that is dominated by local geographical matrices and meteorological characteristics jointly affect the dilution and diffusion of air pollutants. Therefore, natural conditions, such as climate changes, meteorological characteristics and topography, play an important role in spatial air pollutant emissions and fluctuations, and must be given more attention in the processes of air pollution control policy making. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollutant; Climate change; GAINS model; Life expectancy loss","atmospheric pollution; climate change; CMIP; emission; emission control; global perspective; life expectancy; pollution effect; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068692239

The hydrolyzed algal biomass was subjected to sequential dark hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion to improve energy conversion efficiency (ECE). The results of X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy indicated that hydrothermal heating with increasing concentrations of sulfuric acid (H2SO4; 0–8%) led to stronger damage to amorphous cellulose, which resulted in the increase in crystallinity index of cellulose. Hydrothermal heating with 4% H2SO4 resulted in the maximum ECE of 55.7%, which yielded 37.33 mL H2/g-total volatile solids (TVS) and 261.93 mL CH4/g-TVS.

It is necessary to explore the environmental impacts of actual end-of-life (EOL) treatments of waste plastics in China. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental impacts of mechanical recycling of waste plastics as well as incineration and landfilling with municipal solid waste in China. The results indicate the environmental benefits of current EOL treatments of waste plastics in China. Mechanical recycling was a negative and decisive contributor, with a minimum impact on terrestrial acidification potential (-83.4%) and a maximum impact on global warming potential (-165.8%). Incineration had negative contributions to 8 of the 12 environmental indicators, and landfilling was a positive contributor to all environmental impacts. Scenarios of treatment pattern, recycling technologies and import policy were set to analyze the potential reduction in environmental impacts of future EOL treatments of waste plastics. Increasing the proportion of mechanical recycling would reduce all environmental impacts, including up to 51.8% on particulate matter formation potential. Energy conservation and emission reduction in atmospheric pollutants would effectively reduce the environmental impacts of mechanical recycling. Banning waste plastics imports would decrease the transportation distances of waste plastics, thereby reducing the related environmental impacts, most notably a reduction of 84.8% for marine ecotoxicity potential.

A box model was used to study nighttime nitrate radical (NO3), O3 oxidation and nitrate products in Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China. The model input data were collected from five representative monitoring sites in YRD regions from 20 August to 11 September 2016. The production rate of NO3 was found very fast with the nocturnal average of 1–3 ppbv h−1 in different sites. Large directly NO3 loss frequency was determined from VOCs measurements, with the average of 0.01–0.03 s−1, which represented a lower limit due to the lack of monoterpene measurement. The model results show NO3 governs nocturnal oxidation of hydrocarbons (HCs) in YRD region (80%) and O3 contributes to 20% in average. The oxidation percentage attributable to NO3 increased against the NOx concentration, with 3.5–7.7 ppbv HCs removal by NO3 per night in average, suggesting that the production of organic nitrate by NO3 oxidation may be significant. As to products, the integrated inorganic nitrate production in the nighttime was considerable around 62% ± 20% of the whole day in urban sites, but the percentage was small in rural sites. More inorganic nitrate was produced with the increase of NOx, since the HCs oxidation by NO3 has already been saturated at night. This study highlights nocturnal fast oxidation by NO3 in YRD region, and the variability of oxidation is large in different NOx regime. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","HCs removal; Nighttime chemistry; Nitrate; NO3 radical; Oxidation capacity; YRD region","Monoterpenes; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Urban growth; Volatile organic compounds; Inorganic nitrate; Nitrate radicals; NO3 radical; Organic nitrates; Oxidation capacity; Spatial characteristics; Yangtze river delta; YRD region; Oxidation; hydrocarbon; nitrate; organic nitrate; radical; terpene; volatile organic compound; atmospheric chemistry; environmental monitoring; hydrocarbon; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; oxidation; pollutant removal; spatial analysis; volatile organic compound; Article; boundary layer; chemical parameters; China; environmental monitoring; oxidation; pollution; priority journal; urban area; waste component removal; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064085057

To explore the way to achieve CO2 emission peak of road transport in such a typical province, multiple scenarios were designed, including a baseline scenario, four single mitigation scenarios, and three combined mitigation scenarios. The peaking regularity and scale of provincial CO2 emissions and mitigation potential until 2035 were quantitatively evaluated. The assessment results showed that CO2 emissions kept rapid growth without control and reached 315.4 Mt in 2035. The peak of CO2 emission by 2030 could not be addressed by single mitigation measures. But combination of four single mitigation scenarios could drive CO2 emissions to peak in 2030 at the level of 171.3 Mt. The peak appeared later at higher level of CO2 emissions compared with UK (30.5%) and Australian (45.6%). Therefore, the CO2 emissions from road transport in such a developed province should be constrained in the future.

The number of motor vehicles in Guangdong province continues to grow, with more than 18 million at the end of 2017. Under the dual pressure of energy and environmental protection, new energy vehicles, as an important carrier of ""low-carbon economy"", have become the development direction of cars in Guangdong province. The Guangdong government adopts the B2B model to introduce new energy vehicles from the public transportation. In 2017, Guangdong province had 63,391 buses, of which new energy vehicles accounted for 46.2%. This study takes the implementation of new energy vehicles in the public transport system of Guangdong province as the research object, and the energy consumption of new energy vehicles and traditional vehicles were compared. Based on the CDM methodology, the changes in carbon emissions caused by the introduction of new energy vehicles in the transit system were calculated. Carbon emissions in 2020 were estimated according to the number of public buses in Guangdong province and the new energy bus planning. From 2016 to 2020, EV (electric vehicles) accounted for 63-79% of new energy vehicles in buses of Guangdong province, and HEV (hybrid electric vehicles), mainly natural gas and electric hybrid, accounted for 13-16% of the total buses. The total carbon emission of buses in 2020 was reduced by 44.6% compared with 2016, of which EV contributed the most to the emission reduction. In this study, different scenarios are set up to analyze the influence of power generation energy structure and vehicle fuel type on greenhouse gas emission reduction. It is found that power grid energy structure is a key factor affecting the carbon emission and emission reduction space of electric vehicles. The fuel type of vehicle directly affects the emission coefficient of CO2 per unit fuel, and plays an important role in carbon emission reduction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air quality; Carbon; Climate change; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Transit time devices; Urban transportation; Vehicle-to-grid; Air pollutant emission; Carbon emission reductions; Development directions; Emission coefficient; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Public transport systems; Public transportation; Urban energy consumption; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070219282

Urban green space (UGS)can effectively alleviate PM; however, few studies have investigated the effects of the UGS morphological pattern on PM, especially from a spatial strategy perspective. This study probed the contribution and strength of UGS on variation of PM2.5 concentration based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA). Three relative indicators (range, duration, and rate)were used to represent PM2.5 changes, and seven MSPA classes (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, and branch)were performed to measure UGS morphological patterns. Stepwise regression analysis was used to build the PM2.5 estimation models and partial correlation analysis was used to further analyze how well different MSPA classes influence PM2.5. Results showed that MSPA classes and meteorological factors combined can explain more of PM2.5 increase variance at a high PM2.5 level, and 40.7–81.4% for PM2.5 reduction variance, and meteorological factors contributed more to PM2.5 increase and reduction. Higher proportions of the core and bridge were conducive to restrict the growth and promote the reduction of PM2.5 concentration, however, a higher proportion of perforation, islet, and edge showed opposite results. The effects of loop and branch were complex. In addition, higher air temperature and lower relative humidity were effective in reducing PM2.5. Wind speed, also a significant factor, had an unstable influence.

An assessment of the inequality of industrial carbon emissions between cities can quantitatively explain interregional differences regarding low-carbon activities. This research was conducted to assess inequalities related to total industrial carbon emissions per capita within the urban agglomeration and peripheral cities in the Pearl River Delta during the period 2005–2015. A Kaya-Theil model was utilised to evaluate the effects which represented the primary driving factors that caused the carbon-inequality changes in industrial carbon emissions. The findings revealed that the inequalities in carbon emissions per capita in the urban agglomeration and peripheral cities showed an overall decline, and the within-group inequality component produced patterns that were similar to those of the entire inequality. Further decomposition identified the industrial energy intensity effect as the primary contributor to carbon inequality in both regions during the period. However, the effect varied across the regions. The impact of the inequality associated with industrial energy intensity showed a decline, though the regional inequality of the peripheral cities was greater than that observed in the urban agglomeration, particularly over the first five years, after which the inequality stabilised.

In Canada, the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) operational FireWork (v1.0) air quality forecast system incorporates near-realtime biomass burning emissions to forecast smoke plumes from fire events. The system is based on the ECCC operational Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) augmented with near-real-time wildfire emissions using inputs from the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS). Recent improvements to the representation of fire behaviour and fire emissions have been incorporated into the CFS Canadian Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (CFFEPS) v2.03. This is a bottom-up system linked to CWFIS in which hourly changes in biomass fuel consumption are parameterized with hourly forecasted meteorology at fire locations. CFFEPS has now also been connected to FireWork. In addition, a plumerise parameterization based on fire-energy thermodynamics is used to define the smoke injection height and the distribution of emissions within a model vertical column. The new system, FireWork v2.0 (FireWork-CFFEPS), has been evaluated over North America for July-September 2017 and June- August 2018, which are both periods when western Canada experienced historical levels of fire activity with poor air quality conditions in several cities as well as other fires affecting northern Canada and Ontario. Forecast results were evaluated against hourly surface measurements for the three pollutant species used to calculate the Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), namely PM2:5, O3, and NO2, and benchmarked against the operational FireWork v1.0 system (FireWork-Ops). This comparison shows improved forecast performance and predictive skills for the FireWork-CFFEPS system. Modelled fire-plume injection heights from CFFEPS based on fire-energy thermodynamics show higher plume injection heights and larger variability. The changes in predicted fire emissions and injection height reduced the consistent over-predictions of PM2:5 and O3 seen in FireWorkOps. On the other hand, there were minimal fire emission contributions to surface NO2, and results from FireWork- CFFEPS do not degrade NO2 forecast skill compared to the RAQDPS. Model performance statistics are slightly better for Canada than for the US, with lower errors and biases. The new system is still unable to capture the hourly variability of the observed values for PM2:5, but it captured the observed hourly variability for O3 concentration adequately. FireWork-CFFEPS also improves upon FireWork-Ops categorical scores for forecasting the occurrence of elevated air pollutant concentrations in terms of false alarm ratio (FAR) and critical success index (CSI). © 2019 Author(s).",,"air quality; biomass burning; emission; fuel consumption; ozone; particulate matter; thermodynamics; Canada; Ontario [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069690026

However, studies on city-level emission pathways and mitigation strategies aiming at building sector are still far from sufficient, especially for regions in Central China. Considering the large potential for further building energy demand increase within this area, this study focuses on Hubei, one of the first batch low-carbon pilot provinces to investigate the possibility of earlier emission peak and reduction potentials by prefecture-level city. When downscaling provincial energy use and emissions estimated from local government plans and academic research, statistical data was applied to exploring the relationship between building energy consumption and socioeconomic variables, then spatial allocation factor could be generated after combining with projections of grid-level GDP and population. Results show that by replacing coal and natural gas (NG) that are currently the main heating & cooking energy sources with more electricity and renewable energy, emissions from the building sector would peak around 2025, which is especially true for three major big cities with higher emission growth rate due to population and urban expansions. Moreover, when considering additional improvement on building energy efficiency, provincial reductions burden would be more evenly distributed among cities. It is implied that by formulating tiered mitigation policies for cities at various economic development levels, including decarbonization of energy structure and improvement of energy efficiency, more cities would peak their emissions from the building sector before 2030. This analytical framework innovatively create a multi-city platform for the simulation of building sector mitigation pathway to facilitate cities’ low-carbon development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building sector; City-level emissions; Emission peak; Energy consumption; Low-carbon province","Carbon; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Office buildings; Population statistics; Public policy; Simulation platform; Urban growth; Building energy consumption; Building energy demands; Building energy efficiency; Building sectors; Emission peaks; Low carbon; Simulation of buildings; Spatial allocation factors; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063315652

The imbalance of ES supply and demand in urban areas has become a key issue in regional sustainable development. In this context, we calculated ES supply and demand for Wuhan City, China, using the ES supply and demand ratio (ESDR) and the comprehensive ES supply–demand ratio (CESDR) to express the relationship between ES supply and demand. Ecological zoning was proposed according to the spatial differentiation of the ES supply–demand relationship, and policy recommendations are made. The results show that from the perspective of total ES supply and demand, the water yield supply (SWY), grain yield supply (SGY), and recreation services supply (SRS) are greater than the water yield demand (DWY), grain yield demand (DGY), and recreation services demand (DRS), and that the climate regulation supply (SCR) is less than the climate regulation demand (DCR). From a spatial perspective, there are imbalances and mismatches in ES supply and demand, especially in urban central areas. The values of SWY, SGY, SCS, and SRS per unit area are less than their respective demand values, and the area of mismatch has expanded with the gradual increase of the built-up area. The spatial pattern of ES supply and demand is circular, with the form of “deficit zone–relative equilibrium zone–surplus zone”, which corresponds to “urban central area–near suburbs–distant suburbs and rural areas”. © 2019 by the authors.

It is of great interest to evaluate the reduction of emissions and the air quality response using a data assimilation (DA) approach. In this study, we updated the WRF-Chem/EnKF (Weather Research and Forecasting-WRF, model coupled with the chemistry/ensemble Kalman filter-Chem/EnKF) system to directly analyze HYDRO emissions instead of using emission scaling factors, as in our previous study. Our purpose is to investigate whether the WRF-Chem/EnKF system is capable of detecting the emission deficiencies in the bottom-up emission inventory (2010-MEIC, Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China), dynamically updating the spatial-temporal emission changes (2010 to 2015/2016) and, most importantly, locating the ""new"" (emerging) emission sources that are not considered in the a priori emission inventory. The 2010 January MEIC emission inventory was used as the a priori inventory (to generate background emission fields). The 2015 and 2016 January emissions were obtained by assimilating the hourly surface HYDRO concentration observations for January 2015 and 2016. The HYDRO emission changes for northern, western, and southern China from 2010 to 2015 and from 2015 to 2016 (for the month of January) from the EnSRF (ensemble square root filter) approach were investigated, and the emission control strategies during the corresponding period were discussed. The January 2010-2015 differences showed inhomogeneous change patterns in different regions, including (1) significant emission reductions in southern China; (2) significant emission reductions in larger cities with a wide increase in the surrounding suburban and rural regions in northern China, which may indicate missing raw coal combustion for winter heating that was not taken into account in the a priori emission inventory; and (3) significantly large emission increases in western China due to the energy expansion strategy. The January 2015-2016 differences showed wide emission reductions from 2015 to 2016, indicating stricter control strategies having been fully executed nationwide. These derived emission changes coincided with the period of the energy development national strategy in northwestern China and the regulations for the reduction of HYDRO emissions, indicating that the updated DA system was possibly capable of detecting emission deficiencies, dynamically updating the spatial-temporal emission changes (2010 to 2015/2016), and locating newly added sources. Forecast experiments using the a priori and updated emissions were conducted. Comparisons showed improvements from using updated emissions. The improvements in southern China were much larger than those in northern and western China. For the Sichuan Basin, central China, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta, the BIAS (bias, equal to the difference between the modeled value and the observational value, representing the overall model tendency) decreased by 61.8%-78.2% (for different regions), the RMSE decreased by 27.9%-52.2%, and CORR values (correlation coefficient, equal to the linear relationship between the modeled values and the observational values) increased by 12.5%-47.1%. The limitation of the study is that the analyzed emissions are still model-dependent, as the ensembles are conducted using the WRF-Chem model; therefore, the performances of the ensembles are model-dependent. Our study indicated that the WRF-Chem/EnSRF system is not<span idCombining double low line""page8620""/> only capable of improving the emissions and forecasts in the model but can also evaluate realistic emission changes. Thus, it is possible to apply the system for the evaluation of emission changes in the future. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

Life expectancy is a well-documented and important measure of overall public health policy. However, few investigators examined the relationship between PM2.5 levels and adult life expectancy. In this Taiwan-wide study, county-level annual mean PM2.5 concentrations data were collected concomitantly with potential confounding variables including demographic and socioeconomic status, as well as smoking prevalence. Subsequently, these PM2.5 data were analyzed with respect to county-level adult life expectancy data for the period 2010 to 2017. Linear regression was used to determine the relationship between PM2.5 and life expectancy in adults. Residents residing in the counties characterized as containing higher levels of PM2.5 exhibited significantly reduced life expectancy after controlling for potential confounders. For each 10 ug/m3 increase in PM2.5 there was an estimated mean decrease in life expectancy in adults of 0.3 years.

Transitioning toward sustainable diets that are nutritionally adequate and low in environmental impact is key in achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. However, designing region-specific sustainable diets that are culturally acceptable is a formidable challenge. Recent studies have suggested that optimization algorithms offer a potential solution to the above challenge, but the evidence is mostly based on case studies from high-income nations using widely varying constraints and algorithms. Here, we employ nonlinear optimization modeling with a consistent study design to identify diets for 152 countries that meet four cultural acceptability constraints, five food-related per capita environmental planetary boundaries (carbon emissions, water, land, nitrogen, and phosphorus use), and the daily recommended levels for 29 nutrients. The results show that a considerable departure from current dietary behavior is required for all countries. The required changes in intake amounts of 221 food items are highly country-specific but in general point toward a need to reduce the intake of meat, dairy, rice, and sugar and an increase in fruits, vegetables, pulses, nuts, and other grains. The constraints for fiber, vitamin B12, Vitamin E, and saturated fats and the planetary boundaries for carbon emissions and nitrogen application were the most difficult to meet, suggesting the need to pay special attention to them.

This study investigates the environmental effectiveness of regulatory requirement on energy-efficient building design. A Code of Practice for Overall Thermal Transfer Value in Buildings implemented in Hong Kong was used as a case study. Through a survey and energy simulations, it revealed that implementation of this mandatory building design regulation in Hong Kong is successful in terms of both saving in building operating energy and recovering in embodied energy of the extra building materials used.

These freeze events—often called false springs—are one of the strongest factors determining temperate plants species range limits and can impose high ecological and economic damage. As climate change may alter the prevalence and severity of false springs, our ability to forecast such events has become more critical, and it has led to a growing body of research. Many false spring studies largely simplify the myriad complexities involved in assessing false spring risks and damage. While these studies have helped advance the field and may provide useful estimates at large scales, studies at the individual to community levels must integrate more complexity for accurate predictions of plant damage from late spring freezes. Here, we review current metrics of false spring, and how, when, and where plants are most at risk of freeze damage. We highlight how life stage, functional group, species differences in morphology and phenology, and regional climatic differences contribute to the damage potential of false springs. More studies aimed at understanding relationships among species tolerance and avoidance strategies, climatic regimes, and the environmental cues that underlie spring phenology would improve predictions at all biological levels. An integrated approach to assessing past and future spring freeze damage would provide novel insights into fundamental plant biology and offer more robust predictions as climate change progresses, which are essential for mitigating the adverse ecological and economic effects of false springs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; false spring; forest communities; freezing tolerance; phenology","climate change; climate effect; environmental cue; freezing; phenology; plant community; spring (season); temperature tolerance; climate change; freezing; plant; season; Climate Change; Freezing; Plants; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065304241

By comparison with their bulk counterparts, nanophosphors exhibit reduced concentration quenching effects and a great potential to enhance luminescence effciency and tunability. In this paper, the physics of the nanophoshors is overviewed with a focus on the impact of spatial confinement and surface-to-volume ratio on the luminescence issue, as well as rare earth-activated multicolor emission for white light (WL) output. In this respect, the prominently practiced strategies to achieve WL emission are single nanophosphors directly yielding WL by means of co-doping and superposition of the individual red, green, and blue emissions from different nanophosphors. Recently, a new class of effcient broadband WL emitting nanophosphors has been proposed, i.e., nominally un-doped rare earth free oxide (yttrium oxide, Y2O3) nanopowders and Cr transition metal-doped garnet nanocrystals. In regard to this unconventional WL emission, the main points are: it is strictly a nanoscale phenomenon, the presence of an emitting center may favor WL emission without being necessary for observing it, and, its inherent origin is still unknown. A comparison between such an unconventional WL emission and the existing literature is presented to point out its novelty and superior lighting performances. © 2019 by the authors.

We present BioGEEM (BioGeographical Eco-Evolutionary Model), a spatially explicit model that integrates theories and processes understood to drive biodiversity dynamics. We investigated the necessary degree of mechanistic complexity by exploring simulation experiments to evaluate the relative roles of the underlying processes across spatio-temporal scales and ecological levels (e.g. populations, species, communities). Location: Hypothetical oceanic islands. Methods: BioGEEM is stochastic and grid-based, and it integrates ecological (metabolic constraints, demography, dispersal and competition), evolutionary (mutation and speciation) and environmental (geo-climatic dynamics) processes. Plants on oceanic islands served as a model system. We ran the simulations both with all processes on and with selected processes switched off to assess the role of each process from the emergent patterns. Results: The full model was able to generate patterns matching empirical evidence and theoretical expectations. Population sizes were largest on young islands, and species, particularly endemics, better filled their potential range on young and old islands due to limited area and reduced competition. Richness peaked at mid-elevations. The proportion of endemics was highest in old, large and isolated environments within the islands. Species and trait richness showed unimodal temporal trends. Switching off selected processes led to several unrealistic patterns, including the evolution of super-dominant species, extremely high richness and weakened spatial diversity gradients. Main conclusions: The main predictions derived from BioGEEM are: Competition has cross-scale effects on diversity. Hump-shaped temporal dynamics can be obtained without speciation. Endemic species seem less susceptible to extinction than native non-endemic species. Endemism reflects stronger geographical and environmental isolation. Finally, only the integration of all implemented processes generates realistic spatio-temporal dynamics at population, species, community and assemblage levels. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","demography; dispersal; interspecific competition; island biogeography; mechanistic simulation model; metabolic theory; plant community; process-based niche model; speciation; species richness","biodiversity; complexity; demographic survey; dispersal; ecological approach; endemic species; extinction risk; interspecific competition; island biogeography; metabolism; speciation (biology); species diversity; species richness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066975444

STI testing and treatment mitigate adverse health outcomes and substantially reduce transmission; yet, testing rates remain below recommended levels. Innovation is needed to produce the required increases in testing levels, frequency, and the use of appropriate testing technologies in ways that are engaging, nonstigmatizing, and acceptable to men. Objective: The aim of this study is to build consensus with regard to interventions with the greatest potential for improving local STI testing services for MSM communities in Toronto, Canada. Methods: Following a literature review of evidence regarding the effectiveness of novel testing interventions, and focus groups, and surveys to describe local barriers and facilitators of testing among MSM, we will conduct a Web-based, modified Delphi study (e-Delphi). We will form expert panels of community members and STI test providers. Panelists will rate potential interventions in terms of their priority, using a 7-point Likert scale from definitely not a priority to definitely a priority. They will also rank their preferences by selecting their top 3 preferred interventions. Surveys will be distributed in 3 rounds, with feedback on the distribution of responses from preceding rounds provided in rounds 2 and 3. We will define consensus as having ?60% (18/30) members indicate a preference within 2 adjacent response points. Qualitative data on disagreements will be obtained using open-ended text responses to explain for ratings and rankings that are different from the majority. Results: On the basis of a literature review and identification of barriers and facilitators to STI testing among community members and test providers in Toronto, we have selected 8 potential interventions for inclusion in the e-Delphi panel surveys. These include 4 interventions that streamline STI testing for asymptomatic individuals, 2 interventions that are targeted at clients and 2 interventions that are targeted at providers. Conclusions: Findings will provide community direction for informed decision making regarding the implementation of STI testing interventions in this setting. They will characterize the intervention climate for innovation to STI testing services, including perceived needs for changes to test delivery, relative priorities for change, and readiness for implementation. These methods may be transferable to other urban jurisdictions experiencing similar epidemics and for other contexts where stakeholder input is needed to manage sensitive areas of concern. © 2019 Geoff McCombe, Aine Harrold, Katherine Brown, Liam Hennessy, Mary Clarke, David Hanlon, Sinead O'Brien, John Lyne, Ciaran Corcoran, Patrick McGorry, Walter Cullen.","Community-based research; Mass screening; Patient acceptance of health care; Sexual and gender minorities; Sexually transmitted diseases",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071642154

Benefits of climatechange mitigation for reducing the impacts of sea-level rise in G-20 countries. Journal of Coastal Research, 35(4), 884-895. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. This paper assesses the potential benefits of climate-change mitigation in reducing the impacts of sea-level rise over the 21st century in G-20 countries (excluding the European Union as a whole), using the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment model. Impacts of the expected number of people flooded annually and wetland losses were assessed. To assess the benefits of mitigation, it was assumed that defences were not upgraded during the study. Globally, with a sea-level rise of 0.68 m by the 2080s (with respect to 1980-99), representing a potential future with limited climate-change mitigation, and with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1 socio-economic scenario, 123 million additional people could be flooded annually and 39% of present global wetland stock could be lost. For a 0.19-m rise in sea level, associated with a substantial reduction in emissions, the number of people flooded could be reduced to 13 million/y, with 21% of global wetland stock loss, unless new wetlands emerge. Collectively, non-Annex 1 G-20 countries experience a disproportionately higher number of people flooded in their nations compared with the proportion of population flooded globally. The greatest wetland losses for G-20 countries are projected for Australia, Indonesia, and the United States. Thus, G-20 nations with the highest emissions or gross domestic product frequently do not experience the greatest impacts, despite some of these nations being potentially more able to pay for adaptation. © 2019 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.","Adaptation; equity; expected number of people at risk from flooding; wetland loss","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; coastal protection; equity; European Union; flooding; G-20 country; risk assessment; sea level change; wetland management; Australia; Florida [United States]; Indonesia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068474446

This paper investigates the case of the materials-management programme in the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality which has emerged as a national and international leader by focusing on the role of household consumption in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Two noteworthy innovations involve the development of a consumption-based GHG emissions inventory and introduction of policies aimed at facilitating construction of small homes (so-called Accessory Dwelling Units, ADU). The case traces over several decades the higher order learning processes within the group and their entrepreneurship toward affecting broader changes in emission accounting and climate policies in Oregon. The paper identifies the enabling factors for these innovations, and considers: how to create the conditions for learning, experimentation, and policy entrepreneurship; how to reproduce these conditions in different locales; and how to recognize and foster innovations that arise outside the established mainstream ‘climate community’. It also stresses the benefits of breaking down the barriers between science-based analysis and policy. The two questions frequently raised in the climate policy debate – how to bring researchers and practitioners together to develop efficacious policies; and how to replicate successful programmes and policies across different communities, jurisdictions, and locations–should be re-examined. It may be more appropriate to ask instead: How to create conditions for learning, experimentation, and policy entrepreneurship; and how to reproduce these conditions in different locales. Key policy insights Using a consumption-based greenhouse gas emission inventory instead of a sector-based inventory radically changes climate policy priorities, shifting the emphasis from technological fixes to curbing household consumption. Policy innovations thrive in teams that combine technical and scientific competencies with: a commitment to addressing societal problems; interest in inquiry, experimentation, and learning; entrepreneurship; and strategic and political savvy.

To tackle this challenge, it is crucial to conceive the new sanitation infrastructure based on sustainability principles, including an integrated approach for the management of the liquid, solid and gaseous phases. This study aimed at developing sustainable sewage treatment flowsheets for different scales and regional scenarios in the state of Minas Gerais. Two watersheds were chosen as study areas, due to their remarkable regional importance and socioeconomic and environmental diversity, i.e. Rio das Velhas and Jequitaí-Pacuí. Currently available processes for sewage treatment and resources recovery were assessed based on: literature review and benchmarking of operational practices, experiences reported by sanitation companies, techno-economic feasibility of resource recovery and carbon footprint assessment of anaerobic-based technologies. Social acceptance was also considered. A total of 15 sustainable flowsheets were proposed, comprising passive/natural systems (stabilization ponds, constructed wetlands and controlled land application), anaerobic process combined with natural systems (UASB reactors followed by controlled land application, constructed wetlands or polishing ponds) and compact anaerobic/aerobic systems (UASB reactors followed by activated sludge or trickling filters). Processes selected for small-scale sewage treatment plants (STPs) (people-equivalent - PE < 10,000 inhab.) intended to be integrated into local communities and economic activities. Large-scale STPs (especially those with PE > 100,000 inhab.) were conceived as industries, where a wide range of resources (e.g. sand for non-structural concrete, biogas for electricity, sludge for thermal energy) could be recovered from the influent sewage. Results obtained from the current study could serve as support for decision-making on the planning and implementation of new sustainable sanitation solutions in the state of Minas Gerais and possibly in other regions of Brazil and other developing countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Carbon footprint; Resource recovery; Sewage treatment plant; UASB reactor","carbon; carbon; activated sludge; anoxic conditions; biogas; bioreactor; carbon footprint; developing world; economic activity; integrated approach; literature review; planning process; resource use; sanitation; sewage treatment; sustainability; watershed; activated sludge; aerobic sludge; anaerobic digestion; Article; benchmarking; carbon footprint; community; constructed wetland; decision making; developing country; electricity; energy; energy recovery; energy resource; environmental planning; environmental protection; manufacturing industry; medical literature; Minas Gerais; program feasibility; recycling; sand; sanitation; sewage treatment plant; sludge; social acceptance; social status; thermal energy; waste water recycling; watershed management; wetland; bioreactor; Brazil; city; sewage; Brazil; Minas Gerais; Velhas River; Velhas River; Bioreactors; Brazil; Carbon; Cities; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065073195

Hence, assessing potential implications for humans and ecosystems of bromine soil contamination is urgently needed, which requires the combination of measured soil concentrations from environmental studies and quantified potential toxicity impacts. To address this need, we used data from an experimental study assessing bromine in soils (384 samples) of Tomsk oblast, Russia, starting from measured concentrations obtained by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis in an earlier study. From these data, we calculated the bromine mass in soils and used these as starting point to characterize related cumulative impacts on human health and ecosystems in the Tomsk region, using a global scientific consensus model for screening-level comparative toxicity characterization of chemical emissions. Results show that the combination of sampling methodology with toxicity characterization techniques presents a new approach to be used in environmental studies aimed at environmental assessment and analysis of a territory. Our results indicate that it is important to account for substance-specific chemical reaction pathways and transfer processes, as well as to consider region-specific environmental characteristics. Our approach will help complement environmental assessment results with environmental sustainability elements, to consider potential tradeoffs in impacts, related to soil pollution, in support of improved emission and pollution reduction strategies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bromine contamination; Characterization factors; Freshwater ecotoxicity; Human toxicity; Tomsk oblast; USEtox","bromine; detection method; environmental impact assessment; integrated approach; public health; soil pollution; territory; toxicity; Russian Federation; Tomsk [Russian Federation]; bromine; analysis; environmental monitoring; human; pollution; procedures; risk assessment; Russian Federation; soil pollutant; toxicity; Bromine; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Risk Assessment; Russia; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066044069

To enable engineering of the SEI layer, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics underlying its formation processes is required. We first demonstrate the importance of the rate of ring opening of reduced ethylene carbonate (c-EC-) to its chain-like conformation (o-EC-). According to our classical molecular dynamics simulations, c-EC- is far more likely to diffuse away from the anode than o-EC-, implying that longer c-EC- lifetimes would correlate with thicker SEI layers and reduced capacity retention. Our work then illustrates that the activation barrier for the c-EC- → o-EC- reaction can be strongly influenced by the entropic effects associated with the reorganization of the surrounding molecules. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with metadynamics sampling clearly demonstrate a considerable decrease (by a factor of 2.5) in the ring-opening barrier when considering a 50/50 mixture of cyclic EC and linear dimethyl carbonate as the solvent rather than pure liquid EC. This is not predicted by implicit solvent methods owing to their failure to capture the effect of solvent geometry. Our findings also suggest that other perturbations of the local environment not considered, such as those due to interfaces, anions, or other reduction products, may also significantly affect the diffusion/reaction kinetics of EC- radical anion, and, thus, SEI formation and evolution. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbonation; Entropy; Ethylene; Lithium-ion batteries; Molecular dynamics; Negative ions; Reaction kinetics; Seebeck effect; Solid-State Batteries; Solvents; Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; Activation barriers; Classical molecular dynamics; Dimethyl carbonate; Generation technologies; Local environments; Reduction products; Solid electrolyte interphase; Solid electrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070676740

While debates continue over how to mitigate emissions, it is evident that many parts of the world will need to adapt to an increasingly unstable climate. However, the persistence of climate denial presents a significant barrier to climate change response; if a future in which the climate has dramatically changed cannot be imagined, there is little motivation to act. Using qualitative interview data, our research investigates community responses to climate change adaptation planning in a coastal region of Australia identified as highly vulnerable to future sea level rise. While the local council engaged in extensive consultation to develop an adaptation plan, community opposition to proposed development changes ultimately resulted in a ‘wait and see’ response. We show how the community's local understandings of place informed temporalities that led to a practice of climate denial. We outline three processes by which climate denial is socially organised: anchoring the past via historical reference; projecting continuity through a nostalgic lens of managing disaster; and enclosing the present by prioritising existing economic value. We show how these processes result in the social organisation of climate denial, and an inability to plan for a climate changed future. © 2019","Adaptation; Climate change; Place; Socially organised denial; Temporality","adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone management; community response; emission control; environmental planning; mitigation; questionnaire survey; temporal analysis; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068228836

Yet, these services can be negatively affected by anthropogenic stress factors. In the boreo-nemoral zone, large amounts of salts are spread each year for deicing the pavement. To address the effect of deicing salt on street lines of lime trees and how this cascades up to influence the surrounding arthropod biodiversity, we compared heavily salt-polluted, and less polluted sites in the city of Riga, Latvia. We analyzed the impairment of foliar functions and development of aphid colonies using a common garden experiment. We found marked variation in the soil physico-chemical properties in polluted vs. unpolluted sites, and the overall composition of arthropod communities, considering their abundance together with their diversity, significantly responded to site contamination. In a common garden experiment, we also showed that the exposure to increased salt levels in the soil caused functional as well as structural injuries within foliage and slowed down the development of aphid colonies. Finally, the damage inflicted by the lime tree aphids, especially in unpolluted sites, was positively correlated to the production of mucilage in the leaves, suggesting herbivore-induced mucilage production in leaves. The effects of de-icing salts thus appeared to cascade up through the trophic chain and to negatively affect not only the trees but also the associated arthropod biota. These findings point at the necessity of a wider screening of plant species and cultivars that not only better tolerate anthropogenic stress but also promote the biodiversity in cities. © Copyright © 2019 Bouraoui, Cekstere, Osvalde, Vollenweider and Rasmann.","arthropod biodiversity; deicing salt; Eucallipterus tiliae; multidisciplinary functional approach; plant tolerance; urban ecology; urban soils",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072197240

Foliar sodium influences consumption rates by animals and can structure herbivores across landscapes. We quantified foliar sodium in 201 locally abundant, herbaceous species representing 32 families and, at 26 sites on four continents, experimentally manipulated vertebrate herbivores and elemental nutrients to determine their effect on foliar sodium. Foliar sodium varied taxonomically and geographically, spanning five orders of magnitude. Site-level foliar sodium increased most strongly with site aridity and soil sodium; nutrient addition weakened the relationship between aridity and mean foliar sodium. Within sites, high sodium plants declined in abundance with fertilisation, whereas low sodium plants increased. Herbivory provided an explanation: herbivores selectively reduced high nutrient, high sodium plants. Thus, interactions among climate, nutrients and the resulting nutritional value for herbivores determine foliar sodium biogeography in herbaceous-dominated systems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","Biogeography; herbivory; nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, micronutrients; Nutrient Network (NutNet); plant taxonomy","Animalia; Vertebrata; nitrogen; sodium; adaptation; animal; grassland; herbivory; plant; soil; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Grassland; Herbivory; Nitrogen; Plants; Sodium; Soil",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065729983

Terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere models, which are used to predict how ecosystems are expected to respond to changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, and land-use change, require accurate representations of plant canopy composition at large spatial scales. The ability to accurately specify plant canopy composition is important because it determines the physiological and ecological properties of plants (such as leaf photosynthetic capacity, patterns of plant carbon allocation and tissue turnover, and the resulting dynamics of plant demography) that govern the biophysical and biogeochemical functioning of ecosystems. Traditionally, plant canopy composition has been represented in a coarse-grained manner within terrestrial biosphere models, with ecosystems being comprised of a single plant functional type (PFT). However, models are increasingly seeking to represent fine-scale spatial variation in plant functional diversity. In this study, we show how imaging spectrometry measurements can provide spatially-comprehensive estimates of within-biome heterogeneity in PFT composition across a functionally diverse and topographically heterogeneous ~710 km2 area in the Southern Sierra Mountains of California. AVIRIS (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data at 18 m resolution from the recent HyspIRI Preparatory Mission (Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager) were used to estimate the sub-pixel fractions of seven PFTs represented in the ED2 terrestrial biosphere model: Shrub, Oak, Western Hardwood, Western Pine, Cedar/Fir, and High-elevation Pine, plus a Grass/NPV (Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation) fraction using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). ED2 is an individual-based terrestrial biosphere model capable of representing fine-scale sub-pixel ecosystem heterogeneity. Our results show that this methodology captures important elevation-related shifts in canopy composition that occur within the study area that are not resolved by existing multi-spectral land-cover products. These estimates modestly improved when the putative PFT endmembers considered in the mixture analysis were constrained using available geospatial data about the presence and absence of the PFTs in particular areas: the average RMSEs (root-mean-square errors) with the geospatially-constrained versus conventional method were 11.3% and 11.9% respectively, with larger reductions in the bias (i.e. mean error) in the abundances of Oak, Cedar/Fir, and Western Hardwood PFTs (ranging from 2.0% to 7.8%). At the hectare scale around four flux towers in the Southern Sierra Mountains, the overall composition improved from an RMSE of 18.2% (5.0–24.2% for individual PFTs) to an RMSE of 9.5% (3.3–13.2% for individual PFTs). Downgrading AVIRIS to 30 m resolution resulted in a reduction in accuracy of the constrained method to an RMSE of 12.7% (0–23.7%) with &lt;1% change in the bias for all tree and shrub PFTs. Our results demonstrate that imaging spectrometry measurements from planned satellite missions such as HyspIRI, EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program), and HISUI (Hyper-spectral Imager SUIte) can provide important and much-needed information about fine-scale heterogeneity in the composition of plant canopies for constraining and improving terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere model simulations of regional- and global-scale vegetation dynamics and function. © 2019","Canopy composition; HyspIRI; Imaging spectrometry; Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis","Biospherics; Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Forestry; Hardwoods; Hyperspectral imaging; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Infrared spectrometers; Land use; Mean square error; Mixtures; Photomapping; Pixels; Spectrometry; Spectroscopy; Thermography (imaging); Vegetation; Airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer; Biogeochemical functioning; HyspIRI; Imaging spectrometry; Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis; Non-photosynthetic vegetation; Plant functional diversities; Sierra Nevada , California; Ecosystems; air-soil interaction; AVIRIS; biomass allocation; biosphere; carbon dioxide; ecosystem function; estimation method; heterogeneity; land surface; plant community; satellite data; satellite mission; spatial variation; spectral analysis; spectrometry; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation dynamics; California; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064465797

According to the International Energy Agency, these emissions have to be reduced by more than 70% by 2040 to stay on track for the 1.5-2 °C scenario suggested by the Paris Agreement. To ensure a socially fair transition towards the phase-out of coal, the European Commission introduced the Coal Regions in Transition initiative in late 2017. The present paper analyses to what extent the use of photovoltaic electricity generation systems can help with this transition in the coal regions of the European Union (EU). A spatially explicit methodology was developed to assess the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in selected regions where open-cast coal mines are planned to cease operation in the near future. Different types of solar PV systems were considered including ground-mounted systems developed either on mining land or its surroundings. Furthermore, the installation of rooftop solar PV systems on the existing building stock was also analysed. The obtained results show that the available area in those regions is abundant and that solar PV systems could fully substitute the current electricity generation of coal-fired power plants in the analysed regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Coal power plant; Paris Agreement; PV potential; Solar photovoltaics","coal; coal mine; coal mining; coal-fired power plant; electricity generation; European Commission; European Union; photovoltaic system; power plant; solar power; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068649978

At the same time, there has explored sufficient reserves of potassium-containing raw materials, which, according to technological, economic and, most importantly, rational utilization levels, will provide an opportunity to get their own potassium carbonate to ensure internal and external consumption markets. In this regard, the development of a method of producing potash based on local raw materials is currently actual. RESULTS: The process of obtaining potassium bicarbonate by the amine method has been studied for the first time. The optimal process parameters were established: ΔP = 2 atm, duration-45 min. CONCLUSION: The study found that the resulting potassium bicarbonate precipitates quickly from the suspension and is easily filtered, which allows us to recommend the use of existing standard thickeners and filtering plants with a minimum working surface. ©BEIESP.","Amine; Carbonization; Method; Potassium bicarbonate; Potassium chloride",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073333115

Two receptor models, principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF), were applied to determine trends in source contributions to OC and EC at the principal study site, Pinnacle State Park (PSP), between 2001 and 2015. The PSP results are interpreted in relation to state and regional emission and pollutant trends. Multi-site average SO4 concentrations showed a linear relationship to reductions in anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in New York, surrounding states, and eastern Canada from 6.1 million metric tons in 1995 to 1.0 million metric tons in 2015. On average, 0.5 ± 0.1 μg m-3 sulfate (SO4) originated from natural SO2 emissions or from outside the region. Emission-reduction programs yielded measurable reductions of ambient OC, EC, and SO4 concentrations, but OC and EC improvements at PSP were partly offset by increasing concentrations of biomass-burning OC and EC. Between 2001 and 2015, biomass burning contributions increased the PSP 2001–2003 mean EC and OC concentrations by 13–18% and 23–30%, respectively. With decreases in other source contributions, net total reductions of PSP 2001–2003 mean EC and OC concentrations were 36–58% and 26–45%, respectively. Contributions to PSP EC and OC declined from four source types: (1) fossil-fuel combustion associated with SO2, (2) combustion not associated with SO2 (tentatively identified as mobile sources), (3) crustal OC and EC, and (4) sulfate-associated OC and EC. SO2-associated fossil-fuel and biomass-burning OC and EC concentrations were higher in winter, sulfate and non-SO2 combustion OC and EC concentrations were higher in summer, and crustal OC and EC were higher in spring. Spatial and temporal coherence of mean OC and EC concentrations, which was observed as a constant slope of annual-average OC-vs-EC across sites and years, indicates that multiple sites were influenced by similar emission source types and responded similarly to emission reductions during the study period. The lowest mean annual OC and EC concentrations were recorded at the most remote site, Whiteface Mountain Base (WMB), averaging 1.0 ± 0.05 μg m-3 and 0.2 ± 0.01 μg m-3, respectively; these values may represent regional background concentrations. © 2019 The Authors","Anthropogenic emissions; New York state; PM2.5; Receptor models; Trends","Biomass; Combustion; Emission control; Factorization; Fossil fuels; Organic carbon; Principal component analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Anthropogenic emissions; New York State; PM2.5; Receptor model; Trends; Air pollution; carbon; fossil fuel; organic carbon; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; ambient air; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; chemical composition; chemical compound; concentration (composition); elemental carbon; organic carbon; particulate matter; seasonal variation; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; ambient air; Article; biomass; combustion; controlled study; New York; particulate matter; principal component analysis; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); statistical distribution; Adirondack Mountains; New York [United States]; United States; Whiteface Mountain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067463796

Large (∼50–85%) reductions in anthropogenic emissions occurred in the northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada between 1995 and 2015. Spatially and temporally aggregated ambient concentrations of O3 precursors declined steadily along with emission reductions: multi-site mean annual nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and toluene concentrations tracked state and regional emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx, NO + NO2), CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOC), respectively (r2 = 0.97, 0.88, and 0.73), showing linear responses of average O3 precursor concentrations to both state and regional emission reductions. O3 exhibited complex spatial and temporal variations, indicating that O3 was influenced not only by the steady decline of regional emissions but also by subregional emission changes, chemical and physical processes, and day-specific variations in emissions and weather. The statewide multi-site mean annual 4th-highest daily 8-h O3 peak declined at the rate of 0.86 ± 0.14 ppbv y−1 (1.1% y−1). Influences on peak daily 8-h O3 were studied using a long-term data record from a research site at Pinnacle State Park (PSP), located near Addison, New York. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to separate the influences of local and regional emission changes, weather, and other factors. GAM results indicate that the reduction of summer O3 peak values and the overall trends in O3 at PSP were due to changes in ambient pollutant levels, rather than to trends in temperature or other meteorological factors. Whereas PSP summer O3 was NOx-sensitive, O3 was often VOC-sensitive during winter and spring days. The frequency of VOC-sensitive days decreased between 2001 – 2005 and 2012–2016, consistent with an expectation of increasing NOx sensitivity as ambient NOx concentrations decline. © 2019 The Authors","Anthropogenic emissions; Generalized additive model; New York state; Ozone; Trends","Additives; Carbon monoxide; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutant concentrations; Anthropogenic emissions; Generalized additive model; New York State; Precursor concentration; Spatial and temporal variation; Trends; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Air pollution; carbon monoxide; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; oxide; ozone; toluene; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; carbon monoxide; chemical composition; concentration (composition); nitrogen dioxide; ozone; trend analysis; air pollutant; ambient air; Article; Canada; concentration (parameter); environmental temperature; meteorological phenomena; model; New York; precursor; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; United States; weather; winter; Canada; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066257077

Tourism in protected areas is a complex phenomenon, which brings both positive and negative effects on the environment and local communities. The transition toward forms of sustainable mobility, such as electric boats, allows to reconcile tourist activities with preservation of protected areas, strengthening the links between land use and transport. The aim of this paper has been the investigation tourists’ preferences to elicit their willingness to pay for the introduction of electric boat fleet in the Regional Park of Trasimeno Lake, a protected area in Italy, in order to reduce CO2 emissions. Data were collected by means of questionnaires. The impact of uncertainty on contingent valuation responses using three different approaches has been used. Also the effects of pricing CO2 emissions from boating activities have been investigated. The research results show that variables such as sex, age and visits’ duration of stay have an impact on the respondents’ willingness to pay and the related uncertainty. Considering two electrification options of the fleet, simulation results indicate that both price premiums and a subsidy policy are needed for electric boats deployment. This paper showed the need for public and private authorities to implement instruments including an important role for education to achieve a new tourism model based on natural features and sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation; Electric boats; Protected area; Respondent uncertainty; Sustainable mobility; Tourists’ preferences","Boats; Carbon dioxide; Conservation; Economic analysis; Electric vehicles; Environmental protection; Land use; Surveys; Contingent valuations; Electric boats; Protected areas; Respondent uncertainty; Sustainable mobility; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063963236

An intensive and complex multi-cropping irrigated agricultural system has developed here to optimize the use of these mountain water resources in conjunction with monsoonal rainfall. Snow and glacier melt thereby modulate the seasonal pattern of river flows and, together with groundwater, provide water when rainfall is scarce. Climate change is expected to weaken this modulating effect, with potentially strong effects on food production in one of the world’s breadbaskets. Here we quantify the space-, time- and crop-specific dependence of agriculture in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on mountain water resources, using a coupled state-of-the-art, high-resolution, cryosphere–hydrology–crop model. We show that dependence varies strongly in space and time and is highest in the Indus basin, where in the pre-monsoon season up to 60% of the total irrigation withdrawals originate from mountain snow and glacier melt, and that it contributes an additional 11% to total crop production. Although dependence in the floodplains of the Ganges is comparatively lower, meltwater is still essential during the dry season, in particular for crops such as sugar cane. The dependency on meltwater in the Brahmaputra is negligible. In total, 129 million farmers in the Indus and Ganges substantially depend on snow and glacier melt for their livelihoods. Snow and glacier melt provides enough water to grow food crops to sustain a balanced diet for 38 million people. These findings provide important information for agricultural and climate change adaptation policies in a climate change hot spot where shifts in water availability and demand are projected as a result of climate change and socio-economic growth. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Crops; Cultivation; Economics; Floods; Groundwater; Irrigation; Landforms; Rain; Rivers; Snow; Sugar cane; Agricultural system; Climate change adaptation; Crop production; Food production; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Modulating effect; Seasonal patterns; Water availability and demand; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068751224

This type of saltwater intrusion places communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure at substantial risk. Risk perceptions of local residents are an indicator to gauge public support for climate change adaptation planning. Here, we document residential perspectives on the present and future threats posed by saltwater intrusion in a rural, low-lying region in coastal North Carolina, and we compare the spatial distribution of survey responses to physical landscape variables such as distance to coastline, artificial drainage density, elevation, saltwater intrusion vulnerability, and actual salinity measured during a synoptic field survey. We evaluate and discuss the degree of alignment or misalignment between risk perceptions and metrics of exposure to saltwater intrusion. Risk perceptions align well with the physical landscape characteristics, as residents with greater exposure to saltwater intrusion, including those living on low-lying land with high concentrations of artificial drainages, perceive greater risk than people living in low-exposure areas. Uncertainty about threats of saltwater intrusion is greatest among those living at higher elevations, whose properties and communities are less likely to be exposed to high salinity. As rising sea levels, drought, and coastal storms increase the likelihood of saltwater intrusion in coastal regions, integrated assessments of risk perceptions and physical exposure are critical for developing outreach activities and planning adaptation measures. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate adaptation; Climate change exposure; Residential risk perception; Rural coastal regions; Sea level rise impacts","climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; environmental planning; field survey; public attitude; risk perception; saline intrusion; sea level change; spatial distribution; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070290892

The proposed approach has been described in detail in three phases. This allows its application in any region and modification according to different agro-climatic conditions. The application of the ADM-SPEI approach has resulted in obtaining a modified SPEI for different crops (agricultural drought SPEI (AD-SPEIcrop)) in the Vojvodina region. In the first phase of the proposed approach, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to obtain an experts' group decision regarding the most suitable method for calculating evapotranspiration for a particular analyzed region. In the second phase, SPEI was modified and adjusted to the conditions in Vojvodina, where ET0 was replaced by ETc. In the validation phase, the results of the application of AD-SPEIcrop were compared to crop yields and well-known indices and evaluated by the experts' feedback. The statistically significant correlations were achieved between AD-SPEIcrop and crop yields. The highest correlations were achieved in the months when the analyzed crops were in the developmental stages when they are most sensitive to drought. The AD-SPEIcrop better correlates to the crop yields compared to SPEI. The comparison of AD-SPEIcrop to the standardized precipitation index (SPI), SPEI, and self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (SC-PDSI) shows that it can successfully detect dry and wet periods. The results have indicated that the proposed approach can be successfully applied, and AD-SPEIcrop has shown a good performance for agricultural drought monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; AHP; Crop; Drought; Drought index; SPEI","Agriculture; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Hierarchical systems; Agricultural drought; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Climatic conditions; Developmental stage; Drought indices; Self-calibrated palmer drought severity indices; SPEI; Standardized precipitation index; Drought; agrometeorology; analytical hierarchy process; climate conditions; crop plant; drought; index method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073893139

However, ICP-based extraction and enrichment of uncharged (neutral) compounds, important for pharmaceutical, biological, and environmental applications, has not yet been reported. Here, we report the ICP-based continuous extraction of two neutral compounds from aqueous solution, by their partition into an ionic micellar phase. Our initial results show that the efficiency of the extraction increases with the concentration of the surfactant comprising the micellar phase, reaching 98 ± 2%, and drops precipitously when the concentration of the target compound exceeds the capacity of the micelles. As a key feature relevant to the practical application of this method, we show that focusing occurs even an order of magnitude below the critical micelle concentration through the local enrichment and assembly of surfactants into micelles, thus minimizing their consumption. To underscore the relevance of this approach to water purification, this method is applied to the extraction of pyrene, a model for polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This approach provides access to a broad range of strategies for selective separation that have been developed in micellar electrokinetic chromatography. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Critical micelle concentration; Electrodynamics; Focusing; Liquid chromatography; Micelles; Polarization; Continuous extraction; Electrokinetic focusing; Environmental applications; Extraction and enrichments; Ion concentration polarizations; Micellar electrokinetic chromatography; Polyaromatic hydrocarbons; Selective separation; Extraction; dodecyl sulfate sodium; pyrene; ion; pyrene derivative; surfactant; water; aqueous solution; Article; critical micelle concentration; electrical potential parameters; extraction; ion concentration polarization; micellar electrokinetic chromatography; micelle; polarization; priority journal; water management; chemistry; devices; isolation and purification; microfluidic analysis; solution and solubility; Chromatography, Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary; Ions; Micelles; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Pyrenes; Solutions; Surface-Active Agents; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068127196

Our aim was to directly estimate the health and longevity impacts of current PM2.5 concentrations and the benefits of reductions from 1999 to 2015, nationally and at county level, for the entire contemporary population of the contiguous United States. Methods and findings: We used vital registration and population data with information on sex, age, cause of death, and county of residence. We used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different adjustments for other determinants of mortality, to directly estimate mortality and life expectancy loss due to current PM2.5 pollution and the benefits of reductions since 1999, nationally and by county. The covariates included in the adjusted models were per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; cumulative smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity. In the main model, which adjusted for these covariates and for unobserved county characteristics through the use of county-specific random intercepts, PM2.5 pollution in excess of the lowest observed concentration (2.8 μg/m3) was responsible for an estimated 15,612 deaths (95% credible interval 13,248–17,945) in females and 14,757 deaths (12,617–16,919) in males. These deaths would lower national life expectancy by an estimated 0.15 years (0.13–0.17) for women and 0.13 years (0.11–0.15) for men. The life expectancy loss due to PM2.5 was largest around Los Angeles and in some southern states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama. At any PM2.5 concentration, life expectancy loss was, on average, larger in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate than in wealthier counties. Reductions in PM2.5 since 1999 have lowered mortality in all but 14 counties where PM2.5 increased slightly. The main limitation of our study, similar to other observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and diet, but these factors were adjusted for with use of county-specific random intercepts. Conclusions: According to our estimates, recent reductions in particulate matter pollution in the USA have resulted in public health benefits. Nonetheless, we estimate that current concentrations are associated with mortality impacts and loss of life expectancy, with larger impacts in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate. © 2019 Bennett et al.",,"adult; African American; air pollution; Alabama; Arkansas; article; California; cause of death; controlled study; diet; family income; female; health care access; high school; human; humidity; life expectancy; longevity; major clinical study; male; observational study; Oklahoma; particulate matter; poverty; public health; race; registration; smoking; spatiotemporal analysis; unemployment; urban area; adolescent; adverse event; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; Bayes theorem; child; comparative study; demography; environmental exposure; epidemiology; income; infant; middle aged; newborn; particulate matter; preschool child; risk assessment; risk factor; sex factor; social determinants of health; spatiotemporal analysis; time factor; United States; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Income; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter; Poverty; Residence Characteristics; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Social Determinants of Health; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Time Factors; United States; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070452371

Researchers are continually working on improving the existing desalination technologies and exploring new methods and ideas to desalinate salty water. The main goal is to come up with cost-effective systems. Renewable energy desalination is becoming an attractive option nowadays because of its viability of producing fresh water, technology improvement continuation, limitation of conventional sources and compatibility between water needs and renewable resources availability. More importantly, using renewable energy to power desalination systems is extremely important for reducing global emissions and protecting the environment. This research is an attempt to provide a systematic methodology for determining the most cost-effective combination of renewable energy powered reverse osmosis desalination system for a given location and required capacity. Two combinations are compared which are RO-Wind and RO-PV. Results show that for Dhahran, Saudi Arabia cost of water produced by RO-Wind is 1.366 $/m3 to 1.273 $/m3 and by RO-PV is 2.119 $/m3 to 2.048 $/m3 for a system capacity of 1000 m3 to 10,000 m3, respectively. © 2019 Desalination Publications.

There are many models developed to understand socio-environmental processes and interactions, and analyze alternative scenarios, but hardly one single model can serve all the needs. There is much expectation in climate-energy research that constructing new purposeful models out of existing models used as building blocks can meet particular needs of research and policy analysis. Integration of existing models, however, implies sophisticated coordination of inputs and outputs across different scales, definitions, data and software. This paper presents an online integration platform which links various independent models to enhance their scope and functionality. We illustrate the functionality of this web platform using several simulation models developed as standalone tools for analyzing energy, climate and economy dynamics. The models differ in levels of complexity, assumptions, modeling paradigms and programming languages, and operate at different temporal and spatial scales, from individual to global. To illustrate the integration process and the internal details of our integration framework we link an Integrated Assessment Model (GCAM), a Computable General Equilibrium model (EXIOMOD), and an Agent Based Model (BENCH). This toolkit is generic for similar integrated modeling studies. It still requires extensive pre-integration assessment to identify the ‘appropriate’ models and links between them. After that, using the web service approach we can streamline module coupling, enabling interoperability between different systems and providing open access to information for a wider community of users. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Integrated modeling; Interoperability; Low carbon economy; Scenario analyses; Web services","Autonomous agents; Carbon; Climate change; Computational methods; Computer aided software engineering; Interoperability; Modeling languages; Open access; Renewable energy resources; Simulation platform; Web services; Websites; Climate change mitigation; Computable general equilibrium model; Integrated assessment models; Integrated modeling; Integration frameworks; Low carbon economy; Scenario analysis; Temporal and spatial scale; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073700304

The electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied as a function of pH using cyclic voltammetry with a rotating disk electrode. The trends in onset potential were correlated to the carbon nanostructure and chemical composition of the electrodes as determined via Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Results suggest that: 1) the ORR activity in acidic conditions is strongly correlated to the concentration of pyridinic nitrogen sites. 2) At high pH, the presence of graphitic nitrogen sites and a graphitized carbon scaffold are the strongest predictors of high ORR onsets, while pyridinic nitrogen site density does not correlate to ORR activity. An inversion region where pyridine-mediated activity competes with graphitic-N mediated activity is identified in the pH region close to the value of pK a of the pyridinium cation. The onset of the ORR is therefore determined by the activity of different sites as a function of pH and evidence for distinct reduction reaction pathways emerges from these results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Chemical analysis; Cyclic voltammetry; Doping (additives); Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Rotating disks; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon Nanostructures; Chemical compositions; Electrocatalytic activity; Graphitized carbons; Mediated activities; Oxygen reduction reaction; Post deposition annealing; Rotating disk electrodes; Amorphous carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063969556

Switching from polluting (e.g. wood, crop waste, coal) to clean (e.g. gas, electricity) cooking fuels can reduce household air pollution exposures and climate-forcing emissions. While studies have evaluated specific interventions and assessed fuel-switching in repeated cross-sectional surveys, the role of different multilevel factors in household fuel switching, outside of interventions and across diverse community settings, is not well understood. Methods. We examined longitudinal survey data from 24 172 households in 177 rural communities across nine countries within the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology study. We assessed household-level primary cooking fuel switching during a median of 10 years of follow up (∼2005-2015). We used hierarchical logistic regression models to examine the relative importance of household, community, sub-national and national-level factors contributing to primary fuel switching. Results. One-half of study households (12 369) reported changing their primary cooking fuels between baseline and follow up surveys. Of these, 61% (7582) switched from polluting (wood, dung, agricultural waste, charcoal, coal, kerosene) to clean (gas, electricity) fuels, 26% (3109) switched between different polluting fuels, 10% (1164) switched from clean to polluting fuels and 3% (522) switched between different clean fuels. Among the 17 830 households using polluting cooking fuels at baseline, household-level factors (e.g. larger household size, higher wealth, higher education level) were most strongly associated with switching from polluting to clean fuels in India; in all other countries, community-level factors (e.g. larger population density in 2010, larger increase in population density between 2005 and 2015) were the strongest predictors of polluting-to-clean fuel switching. Conclusions. The importance of community and sub-national factors relative to household characteristics in determining polluting-to-clean fuel switching varied dramatically across the nine countries examined. This highlights the potential importance of national and other contextual factors in shaping large-scale clean cooking transitions among rural communities in low- and middle-income countries. © 2019 The Author(s).

Steers (n = 20; BW = 269 ± 35 kg) were acclimated to a portable, automated head-chamber system (AHCS; GreenFeed; C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD), and were randomly assigned to one of four treatments, either no supplement (CON), whole cottonseed (WCS), a supplement with bypass fat (BYP; Megalac, Arm and Hammer Animal Nutrition, Princeton, NJ), or a supplement containing soybean oil (SBO). Control steers gained less (P &lt; 0.01) average daily gain (ADG; kg/d) than those that were supplemented. This was a result of improved performance by the SBO and BYP treatments, as BYP had similar (P = 0.13) performance to WCS and SBO, but WCS had significantly lower (P = 0.05) ADG than SBO. Supplemented steers had greater DMI than the CON (P = 0.04) due to the additional supplement, which did not reduce forage intake (P = 0.08). The WCS treatment reduced ADF digestibility (P = 0.02) compared to the other treatments, but aNDF digestibility was not affected by supplementation (P = 0.11). The supplements containing rumen available fat had similar (P = 0.88) CH4 emissions and were lower than BYP and CON (P &lt; 0.01). Bypass supplemented steers and CON had similar (P = 0.75) CH4 emissions. Supplements reduced emission intensity (g CH4/kg ADG) compared to the CON (P ≤ 0.03). However, SBO had lower (P = 0.05) emission intensity than WCS. Across all treatments, increases in forage intake and ADF digestibility increased CH4 emissions (P &lt; 0.05), but aNDF digestibility had a negative relationship (P = 0.03). Both rumen available fat supplements reduced daily CH4 emissions (P &lt; 0.01); however, WCS had less (P = 0.05) ADG compared to SBO. Hence, SBO had a lower (P = 0.05) CH4 emission intensity than WCS. WCS reduced ADF digestibility compared to the other treatments and greater ADF digestibility increased CH4 emissions, therefore it is safe to say that this is the mechanism for CH4 reductions by WCS. The mechanism for SBO is less apparent but may be related to shifts in microbial populations. All supplements improved the sustainability of the tall-grass prairie system, albeit by different mechanisms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bypass fat; Enteric methane; Soybean oil; Whole cottonseed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068582906

Pádua Dias, CP 9, Piracicaba, São Paulo  13418-900, Brazil","The use of specific crop management in a growing region according to its climate can reduce the yield gap caused by water deficit, the main cause of soybean yield gap in Brazil. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the Brazilian soybean-growing regions based on attainable yield and water deficit patterns. The attainable yields were estimated by the crop model DSSAT-CROPGRO-Soybean, considering six sowing dates, three soil types and 33 growing seasons (1980–2013), using gridded weather data with 453 locations. The homogenous regions were defined by the cluster analysis, based on attainable yield. The water deficit pattern (WDP) was identified by a simulated 5-day running average of water stress index (WSPD) during the growing seasons across different planting dates and soil types, using the cluster analysis for each homogenous region. The attainable yield varied considerably between environments, from 0 to 3400 kg ha−1. Ten environmental zones were obtained, where locations in the same zone indicated the same level and variability of the attainable yield across sowing dates, soils and growing seasons. The highest attainable yield (&gt; 2800 kg ha−1) occurred in the central-western to northern regions (zones 1, 2 and 3), covering most soybean growing areas in Brazil. The lowest attainable yield was observed in the extreme South (zone 6) and East border (zone 7) (&lt; 1170 kg ha−1). The highest attainable yield variability occurred in northern/northeastern (zones 4 and 5), eastern (zone 8) and southern (zones 9 and 10) regions. Three WDP were obtained in each environmental zone, which differed in frequency, level and moment of occurrence during the soybean growing season. Sowing dates and soil types contributed to defining the frequency of each WDP. The homogenous zones and WDP demonstrate that attainable yield and yield gap by water deficit can differ significantly across Brazilian soybean-growing regions. These patterns could be used to improve crop management, such as sowing dates, preferential soils, and irrigation requirements, as well as breeding strategies to deal with water deficit, namely deeper root systems, stomatal closure by decreased water content in the soil and drought tolerance of nitrogen fixation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Crop management; Crop model; Drought patterns; Environment classification; Yield gap","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; cluster analysis; crop plant; crop yield; drought; growing season; irrigation system; plant breeding; sowing date; soybean; water stress; yield response; Brazil; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067671160

However, this collective action is precluded by the ‘consensus gap’ between scientific knowledge and public opinion. Here, we test the extent to which the iconic cities around the world are likely to shift in response to climate change. By analyzing city pairs for 520 major cities of the world, we test if their climate in 2050 will resemble more closely to their own current climate conditions or to the current conditions of other cities in different bioclimatic regions. Even under an optimistic climate scenario (RCP 4.5), we found that 77% of future cities are very likely to experience a climate that is closer to that of another existing city than to its own current climate. In addition, 22% of cities will experience climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any existing major cities. As a general trend, we found that all the cities tend to shift towards the sub-tropics, with cities from the Northern hemisphere shifting to warmer conditions, on average ~1000 km south (velocity ~20 km.year-1), and cities from the tropics shifting to drier conditions. We notably predict that Madrid’s climate in 2050 will resemble Marrakech’s climate today, Stockholm will resemble Budapest, London to Barcelona, Moscow to Sofia, Seattle to San Francisco, Tokyo to Changsha. Our approach illustrates how complex climate data can be packaged to provide tangible information. The global assessment of city analogues can facilitate the understanding of climate change at a global level but also help land managers and city planners to visualize the climate futures of their respective cities, which can facilitate effective decision-making in response to on-going climate change. © 2019 Bastin et al.

This work uses adjoint sensitivity analysis in a chemical transport model to identify emission sources and chemical reactions that influence formaldehyde mixing ratios in the San Francisco Bay Area and within three urbanized sub-areas. For each of these receptors, the use of the adjoint technique allows for efficient calculation of the sensitivity of formaldehyde to emissions of NOx, formaldehyde, and VOC precursors occurring at any location and time. Formaldehyde mixing ratios are found to be generally higher in summer than in winter. The opposite seasonal trend is observed for the sensitivities of these mixing ratios to formaldehyde emissions. In other words, even though formaldehyde is higher in summer, reducing formaldehyde emissions has a greater impact in winter. In winter, 85 %-90 % of the sensitivity to emissions is attributed to direct formaldehyde emissions. In summer, this contribution is smaller and more variable, ranging from 27 % to 75 % among the receptor areas investigated in this study. Higher relative contributions of secondary formation versus direct emissions are associated with receptors located farther away from heavily urbanized and emission-rich areas. In particular, the relative contribution of biogenic VOC emissions (15 %-43 % in summer) is largest for these receptors. Ethene and other alkenes are the most influential anthropogenic precursors to secondary formaldehyde. Isoprene is the most influential biogenic precursor. Sensitivities of formaldehyde to NOx emissions are generally negative but relatively small in magnitude compared to sensitivities to VOC emissions. The magnitude of anthropogenic emissions of organic compounds other than formaldehyde is found to correlate reasonably well with their influence on population-weighted formaldehyde mixing ratios at the air-basin scale. This correlation does not hold for ambient formaldehyde in smaller urbanized sub-areas. The magnitude of biogenic emissions does not correlate with their influence in either case. © 2019 Author(s).",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; biogenic emission; chemical reaction; concentration (composition); formaldehyde; mixing ratio; nitrogen oxides; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; volatile organic compound; California; San Francisco Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068377084

Keevil Institute of Mining Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","Financial risks and environmental concerns associated with fossil fuel dependency are motivating mining companies to improve their energy profile. Diesel generators are vastly used as the main power source in off-grid mining operations located in the cold climate regions of Canada and other northern areas of the globe. However, almost 65% of the heat generated in the combustion chambers of a diesel generator is rejected as waste heat, a sizeable portion of which is discarded through the exhaust. This study presents a techno-economic analysis on the feasibility of recovering waste heat from exhaust streams of diesel generators by identifying their fuel consumption and recoverable thermal energy available in their exhaust. The potential energy and economic savings are investigated by reviewing the performance of the proposed diesel exhaust heat recovery system through a series of parametric studies, especially on temperature conditions, heat exchanger effectiveness, mine size and applications. The analysis shows that an extensive fraction of the heat demand of the mine could be supplied by the system. For pre-heating the mine intake air in cold climate regions, these savings could be as high as several millions of dollars. Consequently, the present work shows how deploying such diesel exhaust heat recovery strategy can lead remote mining towards a more energy efficient, economic and sustainable operation while gradually reducing carbon footprint in the life cycle of mines. © 2019","Combined heat and power; Diesel generator; Energy efficiency; Exhaust; Life cycle assessment; Remote mine; Waste heat recovery","Air intakes; Carbon footprint; Cogeneration plants; Combustion chambers; Economic analysis; Fossil fuels; Lead mines; Life cycle; Potential energy; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Waste incineration; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power generation; Diesel generators; Exhaust; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sustainable operations; Techno-Economic analysis; Temperature conditions; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064206728

The selection of building materials plays a key role in the reduction of energy consumption, especially in the Mediterranean area, where the internal overeating risk is high if the solar radiation is not controlled and the free supply of internal heat is poorly managed. Traditionally, in the Italian context, the slab-on-ground floor is made in concrete or more rarely in stone. However, it is usually recommended to minimize the use of concrete as it has a strong environmental impact, reinforced concrete is still the most recommended solution for foundations, both for regulatory and practical reasons. The present study proposes a methodology for the design of high efficiency slab-on-ground floor for warm climate through optimization code performed with the software modeFRONTIER. Starting from the traditional floor structures, the multi-objective methodology stands as an advanced step for the identification of new configurations, favoring the management of many variables, such as thermal, environmental and economic aspects. The results are characterized by high presence of local and eco-friendly materials and reduced costs. At the end, this work demonstrates that it is possible to obtain high performance solutions with also very few numbers of layers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","ITACA; Optimization; Slab-on-ground floor; Warm climate; Zero Energy Building","Climate change; Construction industry; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Floors; Optimization; Reinforced concrete; Construction sectors; Eco-friendly materials; Fossil energy sources; ITACA; Mediterranean climates; Multi-objective analysis; Slab-on-ground; Warm climates; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062536404

Combined biochar, heat, and power production is an option to achieve carbon sequestration for cities relying on biomass-fuelled district heating, while biochar use could mitigate environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector. By using prospective life cycle assessment, the climate impact of the pyrolysis of woodchips in Stockholm is compared with two reference scenarios based on woodchip combustion. The pyrolysis of woodchips produces heat and power for the city of Stockholm, and biochar whose potential use as a feed and manure additive on Swedish dairy farms is explored. The climate change mitigation trade-off between bioenergy production and biochar carbon sequestration in Stockholm's context is dominated by the fate of marginal power. If decarbonisation of power is achieved, building a new pyrolysis plant becomes a better climate option than conventional combustion. Effects of cascading biochar use in animal husbandry are uncertain but could provide 10-20% more mitigation than direct biochar soil incorporation. These results help design regional biochar systems that combine negative carbon dioxide emissions with increased methane and nitrous oxide mitigation efforts and can also guide the development of minimum performance criteria for biochar products. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Economic and social effects; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Product design; Pyrolysis; Bioenergy productions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Conventional combustions; Environmental pollutions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Performance criterion; Life cycle; biochar; charcoal; methane; nitrous oxide; unclassified drug; biochar; carbon dioxide; biochar; bioenergy; biological production; carbon sequestration; emission; life cycle analysis; mitigation; trade-off; agriculture; air pollution; animal husbandry; Article; bioenergy; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; city; climate change; combustion; dairying; heat; life cycle assessment; prospective study; pyrolysis; Sweden; carbon sequestration; soil; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden; Animalia; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Charcoal; Nitrous Oxide; Prospective Studies; Soil; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069948862

As one of the signatories to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the country is determined to reduce its carbon footprint. In this paper, the role of green hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources to the South African energy sector is presented with the objective of increasing the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix. First, an overview of the South African energy sector is presented with the aim of pointing out the energy inputs and the usage patterns. Thereafter, the potential of renewable energy resources that could support green hydrogen production is highlighted. Some of the key findings show that 67% of total primary energy sources in South Africa is coal. Industrial and residential sectors account for the bulk of energy usage with 53% and 19%, respectively. It is also revealed that industrial and transportation sectors account for 51% and 38%, respectively, of GHG emission with the residential sector contributing only 2%. The renewable energy resources in South Africa are encouraging for green hydrogen production. Solar has an average 2500 h of sunshine per year with daily total solar irradiation between 4 and 6.5 kWh/m2 day. The annual average wind speed ranges from 5.6 to 8.7 m/s with power density between 218 and 693 W/m2 at 10 m anemometer height in the coastal region of the country. The biomass potential is estimated as 83.91 Teragram per annum with hydropotential of 4.851 GW.

The technology on the basis of fuel cells for electricity production or transport sector is already developed. However, a key missing element is a large-scale method of hydrogen production. The Cu-Cl combined thermochemical cycle is a promising thermochemical cycle to produce cheap hydrogen in large amounts. Especially is this process interested in combination with nuclear or thermal power plants. This paper focuses on a copper-chlorine (Cu-Cl) cycle and describes the models how to calculate thermodynamic and transport properties. This paper discusses the mathematical model for computing the thermodynamic properties for pure HCl and CuCl2. The developed mathematical model for solid phase takes into account vibrations of atoms in molecules and intermolecular forces. This mathematical model can be used for the calculation of thermodynamic properties of polyatomic crystals on the basis of the Einstein and Debye equations. We developed the model in the low temperature and high temperature region. All analytical data are compared with some experimental results and show good agreement. For solid phase we have developed model for calculation of thermal conductivity on the basis of electron and phonon contributions. For fluid phase we have calculated viscosity and thermal conductivity on the basis of Chung-Lee-Starling kinetic model. For the fluid phase we have developed expressions for thermodynamic properties obtained on the basis of statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT). All these models are based on the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential function and the influence of SAFT. On the basis of statistical thermodynamics we have taken into account translation, rotation, internal rotation, vibration energy of molecules and atoms. To calculate the thermodynamic properties of Lennard-Jones chains, I have used the Liu-Li-Lu model. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078693768

Despite these effects, literature is limited in terms of studies focusing on these groups and a reason often cited is the limited information on their mobility important for exposure assessment. The current study presents a method for assessing individual-level exposure to traffic-related air pollution by integrating mobility patterns tracked by global positioning system (GPS) devices with dynamics of air pollutant concentrations. The study is based on a pool of 17 pregnant women residing in Hidalgo County, Texas. The traffic-related particulate matter with diameter of less than 2.5 micrometer (PM2.5) emissions and air pollutant concentrations are predicted using MOVES and AERMOD models, respectively. The daily average traffic-related PM2.5 concentration was found to be 0.32 µg/m3, with the highest concentration observed in transit (0.56 µg/m3), followed by indoors (0.29 µg/m3), and outdoor (0.26 µg/m3) microenvironment. The obtained exposure levels exhibited considerable variation between time periods, with higher levels during peak commuting periods, close to the US–Mexico border region and lower levels observed during midday periods. The study also assessed if there is any difference between traffic-related dynamic exposure, based on time-varying mobility patterns, and static exposure, based solely on residential locations, and found a difference of 9%, which could be attributed to the participants’ activity patterns being focused mostly indoors. © 2019 by the authors.

One key criticism directed towards CCS has been its inability to gain public support. This study compares public attitudes to the range of low carbon energy sources and technologies across Australia and China, and is the first study to compare primary data across these two countries on this topic. An online survey encompassing a broad set of questions was used to identify the factors that are associated with support for CCS compared to other energy technologies. Data were collected from a nationally representative Australian sample (n = 2383) and from Chinese urban residents across six regions (n = 1266). The survey confirmed low levels of knowledge and support for CCS in both countries. However, male respondents, those who perceived themselves to have higher knowledge of CCS, and those who valued economic outcomes over environmental protection were more likely to support CCS - as long as the risks were not perceived to outweigh the benefits. The results found that for Australians who believed in human-induced climate change they were likely to be unsupportive of CCS. This opposition appears to be linked to no tolerance for extending fossil fuels as in our factor analysis CCS was aligned to fossil fuels in Australia. In both countries, support for renewable energy technologies remains strong. Given the International Energy Agency's future energy demand projections, combined with slow progress towards meeting the Paris Climate Agreement, the lack of knowledge and support for CCS is concerning. While there have been some technological advances, without parallel improvements in public acceptance of CCS, it will be difficult to see any commercial projects going forward in the near future. Although, the Chinese government's success in educating on climate science, as evidenced in these results, suggests that they may be more effective at informing the public of the benefits of CCS and take the lead on its deployment for climate change mitigation. Based on the latest climate models, it is almost crunch time for governments to decide if CCS has a role to play as part of an energy transition to a low carbon future or perhaps it may be time to turn their focus to climate adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Benefits; Carbon capture and storage; Public attitudes; Risks; Support; Surveys","Climate models; Digital storage; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Public risks; Renewable energy resources; Risks; Supports; Surveying; Surveys; Benefits; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; International energy agency; Parallel improvement; Public attitudes; Renewable energy technologies; Technological advances; Carbon capture; alternative energy; carbon sequestration; climate change; factor analysis; knowledge; perception; public attitude; resident population; risk assessment; Australia; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065102203

As population and correspondingly required number of vehicles are also increasing in cities, it is problematic for citizens at the major traffic points of these big cities. It is not only causing travelling delays, accidents and their corresponding emergency response services, traffic jams, parking availability but also contributing heavily to environmental air and noise pollution as well as health threats due to pollution produced by vehicle combustion. Many urban societies are now actualizing smart frameworks for traffic control that work on the standards of traffic automation with prevention of the previously mentioned issues, to keep away from such serious problems but, as per best of our knowledge, no single model deals with such issues comprehensively. The prime idea lies in collecting the current locations of vehicles immediately and suggesting the optimal route to the vehicle from departure node to destination node using optimal path finding algorithm before starting the journey, mainly focusing on reducing the Congestion, greenhouse gases emission and fuel expenditure and also providing the alternate plan to vehicles at any point of journey. In this context, a smart traffic monitoring and controlling framework has been proposed that can perform fast information communication and their concerning actions. In the said model, under a VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network) scenario, the proposed Traffic management paradigm implements a smart signaling system along with optimal path finding algorithm to control congestion to regularly unify the traffic flow by avoiding the congestion at the smart township zones. The Paradigm includes other unique modules such as prevention of accidents, signaling control module, smart car parking module, Law Enforcement and Emergency response services controlling module those all collectively contribute to reduce carbon emission rate. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Accident; Intelligent Transportation System; Prevention; Reduction; Smart cities; VANET; WSN","Accidents; Air quality; Distributed database systems; Emergency services; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Intelligent systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Noise pollution; Pollution control; Reduction; Smart city; Street traffic control; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Emergency response; Greenhouse gases emissions; Information communication; Intelligent transportation systems; Optimal path finding algorithms; Prevention; Prevention of accidents; VANET; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072812986

Since, due to statistics, Isfahan enjoys remarkable prospects in terms of wind, solar and biomass energies, a combined system of indigenous energy sources for powering a cattle farm has been investigated and evaluated in this study. To evaluate the possibility of the optimal system for comparative reasons, the HOMER software was used. The designed hybrid system was a wind-solar-biomass generator that used a battery saver as backup. Although it seems that wind and solar energies have the highest potential for energy generation in Isfahan, the results showed that biomass, by itself, can provide the required power for a cattle farm. In fact, biomass energy was more economically efficient than wind and solar energies. Owing to the low electricity cost, generated from fossil fuels, in Iran, relative to a large number of countries, the findings revealed that using biomass for generating the electricity of a cattle farm will compensate the expenses by the mid-15th year and will generate profit for 9.5 years later. The results also showed that the solar cell-based hybrid system is cheaper than the wind turbine-based one. Regarding the price of per kWh of electricity produced, the results showed that the biomass generator system with the price 0.12 $/kWh is the cheapest, and the solar cell-based and wind turbine-based hybrid systems are 3.33% and 10.83% more expensive, respectively. The results can be used for electricity generation with minimum pollution and expenses in the same regions. © 2019. CBIORE-IJRED.

One inconvenience in MoD-EV systems is the need for some customers to perform in-routing charging for almost-out-of-charge EVs. In this paper, we propose a routing scheme that aims to reduce this inconvenience by minimizing the relative excess time spent by MoD-EV systems customers for in-route charging compared to the on-road trip time. By modeling the routing problem between multiple MoD-EV stations with in-route charging as a multi-server queuing system, we formulate our objective as a stochastic convex optimization problem that minimizes the average overall trip time for all customers relatively to their actual trip time without in-route charging. Both single and multiple charging units per charging station are considered in this paper and modeled as M/M/1 and M/M/c queues, respectively. For both types of queues, the optimal routing proportions are derived analytically using the Lagrangian analysis and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results show the merits of our proposed solution in both cases as compared to the shortest time and the random routing decisions. Finally, the proposed method is tested on a real-world scenario, and the computation times are calculated for different settings. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","charging; Electric vehicles; Mobility-on-Demand (MoD); routing; smart cities","Charging (furnace); Convex optimization; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Network routing; Queueing theory; Sales; Servers; Smart city; Solar cells; Stochastic systems; Transportation; Urban transportation; Charging station; Computational model; Delays; On demands; Routing; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054216401

In this study, the SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model was used to simulate how changes in minimum and maximum air temperature and solar radiation under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate projections would change Tmrt in Vancouver over the 2070–2100 period. With micrometeorological variables representative of a changed climate, days with Tmrt above 65 °C were predicted to increase three-to five-fold under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. SOLWEIG was also used to quantify the potential of maximum feasible street tree cover to reduce Tmrt for the hottest day on record for Vancouver (July 29, 2009), and an end-of-century hot day under the two future climate scenarios. SOLWEIG simulations with maximum feasible street tree cover under RCP 4.5 demonstrated an average reduction of 1.3 °C in Tmrt, compared to the contemporary extreme heat day with current street trees. However, average Tmrt increased by 1.9 °C under the RCP 8.5 scenario even with maximum feasible street tree cover, relative to the contemporary extreme heat day. We conclude that adding street trees has the potential to offset Tmrt increases under the RCP 4.5 scenario, however this measure is insufficient to maintain contemporary Tmrt under the RCP 8.5 scenario. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Extreme radiant thermal exposure; Heat mitigation; Local climate zones; Mean radiant temperature; SOLWEIG; Street trees","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Reforestation; Thermal comfort; Wind; Local climate; Mean radiant temperature; SOLWEIG; Street trees; Thermal exposure; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; climate prediction; extreme event; longwave radiation; temperature effect; tree planting; urban climate; urban planning; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065729335

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of quantitative understanding of the effects of the increases in tree cover on the future potential of urban forests when it comes to air quality improvement. Therefore, this research aims to assess and quantify the current and future biophysical and monetary value of the regulating ecosystem service provided by urban forest in Tabriz, Iran (as a case study). Both the current conditions and future prospect are assessed through tree planting scenarios based on the i-tree Eco model. The results indicate that the trees and shrubs removed 238.4 t of pollutants during a year (in 2015), which suggests only a modest potential in air purification when compared with other cities around the world. However, through appropriate – though feasible – urban forest management and development practices, they may improve up to 814.46 t cumulatively over the next 20 years. Tree planting schemes have different efficacies in terms of providing air purification services. Our data-rich temporal approach allowed identifying the optimum tree planting strategy, taking into account the growth and mortality dynamics. Thus, the paper illustrates a methodology to assess the current and future potentials of urban forests to reduce air pollution at the city-scale, which helps the development of future urban tree planting strategies in cities to improve air quality as well as the management of the green infrastructure. Our approach paves the way for the quantitative assessment and optimization of the future condition of (urban) ecosystem services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air purification; Green infrastructure; i-Tree Eco; Iran; Quantification; Urban ecosystem services","Air purification; Air quality; Ecosystems; Reforestation; Air quality improvement; Development practices; Green infrastructure; Iran; Quantification; Quantitative assessments; Urban ecosystem; Urban forest management; Air cleaners",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064901093

In previous research, assessing the influence of information on health effects on people's motivation to adopt mitigation actions, health co-benefits for the individual were typically confounded with collective health co-benefits, for example from pollution reduction. The present research aims to overcome this limitation by providing information on individual health co-benefits that are unconditional on the actions of others (direct health co-benefits). We report effects of this kind of health information on stated willingness to adopt mitigation actions as well as on simulation-based carbon emission reductions in a pre-registered experimental setting among 308 households in 4 mid-size case-study cities in 4 European high-income countries: France, Germany, Norway and Sweden. For each mitigation action from the sectors food, housing, and mobility, half of the sample received the amount of CO2equivalents (CO2-eq) saved and the financial costs or savings the respective action generated. The other half additionally received information on direct health co-benefits, where applicable. For households receiving information on direct health co-benefits, we find a higher mean willingness to adopt food and housing actions, and a greater proportion very willing to adopt one or more mitigation actions (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.1, 3.12); and a greater simulated reduction in overall carbon footprint: difference in percent reduction -2.70%, (95% CI -5.34, -0.04) overall and -4.45%, (95% CI -8.26, -0.64) for food.

To make a comparison on CPA models, both SRK and PR are accounted in the physical term of the model. In the case of pure hydrocarbons, the effect of volume shift correction (VS) on modeling results is also investigated. Afterwards, CPA EoS is used to predict the density of mixtures and relative volume change of mixing for hydrocarbon rich phase of mixtures at various temperatures.

For validating the CEC-Q structure, several models were tested trough confirmatory factor analyses, and for testing construct validity, correlation and regression analysis were realized using children's sense of community and satisfaction with teacher's socio-emotional support as external criteria. Results support hypotheses related to CEC-Q structure, to discriminant validity in relation to the other components of classroom climate, and to concurrent validity in relation to external criteria.

Also, being migrants' destinations, resulting from the availability of economic opportunities, the target of attaining low-carbon, energy efficiency, and the cleaner atmospheric environment by these advanced economies is further bewildered. In that light, we investigate the impact of renewable energy consumption and migration on the carbon dioxide emissions of the panel of European Union's largest economies of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom over the period of 1990–2016. The consistency of the group fully modified least square and dynamic ordinary least square presents elasticity of −0.13 and −0.14 respectively for the nexus of renewables and carbon emissions. Similarly, 0.04 and 0.05 are the respective elasticity of the two models for the nexus of migration and carbon emissions. In support of extant literature, the nexus of carbon emissions with gross domestic product and consumer price index are significant, and respectively positive and negative. In addition, the study reveals evidence of Granger causality with feedback between renewable energy consumption and carbon emissions, and between consumer price index and carbon emissions. On the other hand, a unidirectional Granger causality running from migration to carbon emissions is observed. In practical term, the study presents policy frameworks for the examined countries and other advanced nations.

We study the characteristics of intermediate drift bursts (fibers) embedded in a large type-IV event. Methods. We used high-sensitivity, low-noise dynamic spectra obtained with the acousto-optic analyzer (SAO) of the ARTEMIS-JLS solar radiospectrograph, in conjunction with high time-resolution images from the Nançay radioheliograph (NRH) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) to study fiber bursts during the large solar event of July 14, 2000. We computed both 2D and 1D images and applied high pass time filtering to the images and the dynamic spectrum in order to enhance the fiber-associated emission. For the study of the background continuum emission we used images averaged over several seconds. Results. Practically all fibers visible in the SAO dynamic spectra are identifiable in the NRH images. Fibers were first detected after the primary energy release in a moving type-IV event, probably associated with the rapid eastward expansion of the flare and the post-flare loop arcade. We found that fibers appeared as a modulation of the continuum intensity with a root mean square value of the order of 10%. Both the fibers and the continuum were strongly circularly polarized in the ordinary mode sense, indicating plasma emission at the fundamental. We detected a number of discrete fiber emission sources along two parallel stripes of ∼300 Mm in length, apparently segments of large-scale loops encompassing both the EUV loops and the CME-associated flux rope. We found cases of multiple fiber emissions appearing at slightly different positions and times; their consecutive appearance can give the impression of apparent motion with supra-luminal velocities. Images of individual fibers were very similar at 432.0 and 327.0 MHz. From the position shift of the sources and the time delays at low and high frequencies, we estimated the exciter speed and the frequency scale length along the loops for a well-observed group of fibers; we obtained consistent values from imaging and spectral data, supporting the whistler origin of the fiber emission. Finally we found that fibers in emission and fibers in absorption are very similar, confirming that they are manifestations of the same wave train. © ESO 2019.","Sun: activity; Sun: corona; Sun: flares; Sun: magnetic fields; Sun: radio radiation","Extreme ultraviolet lithography; Image enhancement; Sun : corona; Sun: activity; Sun: flares; Sun: magnetic field; Sun: radio radiation; Fibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069436749

Specific objectives included exploring social supports such as interpersonal interactions and experiences with faculty and peers. Results: Those who self-identified with an underrepresented group were more likely to feel uncomfortable with those whose race/ethnicity was different from their own, more likely to report hearing racists or stereotypical remarks in school, and less likely to have a supportive group of friends on campus.

Organic carbon stored in floodplains is typically a product of pedogenic development between periods of mineral sediment deposition. However, in organically-dominated upland catchments with a high sediment load, eroded particulate organics may also be fluvially deposited with potential for storage and/or oxidation. Understanding the redistribution of terrestrial carbon laterally, beyond the bounds of river channels is important, especially in eroding peatland systems where fluvial particulate organic carbon exports are often assumed to be oxidised. Floodplains have the potential to be both carbon cycling hotspots and areas of sequestration. Understanding of the interaction of carbon cycling and the sediment cascade through floodplain systems is limited. This paper examines the formation of highly organic floodplains downstream of heavily eroded peatlands in the Peak District, UK. Reconstruction of the history of the floodplains suggests that they have formed in response to periods of erosion of organic soils upstream. We present a novel approach to calculating a carbon stock within a floodplain, using XRF and radiograph data recorded during Itrax core scanning of sediment cores. This carbon stock is extrapolated to the catchment scale, to assess the importance of these floodplains in the storage and cycling of organic carbon in this area. The carbon stock estimate for the floodplains across the contributing catchments is between 3482-13460 tonnes, equating on an annualised basis to 0.8-4.5% of the modern-day POC flux. Radiocarbon analyses of bulk organic matter in floodplain sediments revealed that a substantial proportion of organic carbon was associated with re-deposited peat and has been used as a tool for organic matter source determination. The average age of these samples (3010 years BP) is substantially older than Infrared Stimulated Luminesence dating which demonstrated that the floodplains formed between 430 and 1060 years ago. Our data suggest that floodplains are an integral part of eroding peatland systems, acting as both significant stores of aged and eroded organic carbon and as hotspots of carbon turnover. © 2019 The Authors.

Papua New Guinea—comprising the eastern half of the island—plans to nearly double its national road network (from 8,700 to 15,000 km) over the next three years, to spur economic growth. We assessed these plans using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data. We identified numerous environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with these projects, including the dissection of 54 critical biodiversity habitats and diminished forest connectivity across large expanses of the island. Key habitats of globally endangered species including Goodfellow’s tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus goodfellowi), Matchie’s tree kangaroo (D. matschiei), and several birds of paradise would also be bisected by roads and opened up to logging, hunting, and habitat conversion. Many planned roads would traverse rainforests and carbon-rich peatlands, contradicting Papua New Guinea’s international commitments to promote low-carbon development and forest conservation for climate-change mitigation. Planned roads would also create new deforestation hotspots via rapid expansion of logging, mining, and oil-palm plantations. Our study suggests that several planned road segments in steep and high-rainfall terrain would be extremely expensive in terms of construction and maintenance costs. This would create unanticipated economic challenges and public debt. The net environmental, social, and economic risks of several planned projects—such as the Epo-Kikori link, Madang-Baiyer link, Wau-Malalaua link, and some other planned projects in the Western and East Sepik Provinces—could easily outstrip their overall benefits. Such projects should be reconsidered under broader environmental, economic, and social grounds, rather than short-term economic considerations. © 2019 Alamgir et al.

The assessment has incorporated the selection of the algal species and MCT technologies, the extent of nutrient removal, and the biomass/biofuel production rate. The cost benefit of the abatement of pollutants (in the form of CO2 and nutrient discharges) was included by assigning appropriate credits to these contributions. The overall economic viability was quantified as the break-even selling price (BESP) of the generated biocrude, taken to be the price at which the product must sell to cover the operating expenditure (OPEX). Based on available information and optimal operational conditions, the BESP was calculated as being $0.544 per kg biomass, equating to $0.9 L−1 for the extracted biocrude, the credited items contributing ˜14% of this figure. The BESP was found to be most sensitive to the algal growth rate μ, the BESP changing by ±24% in response to a ±20% change in μ. Whilst the terms of reference of the study are limited to OPEX contributors, the potential for sustainability associated with the innately reliably high levels of natural light in the Gulf region appear to provide auspicious circumstances for large-scale implementation of MCT.

Our findings indicate that, as in studies of climate change public opinion, belief certainty that SLR is happening and attitudes about its consequences significantly influence issue prioritization and policy support. Compared to climate change, SLR demonstrates less salience, but is similarly a low public priority. Nevertheless, the public supports governmental policies that address the issue, preferring strategies that discourage new construction in high risk areas and employ “soft” protection through natural barriers.

To reduce GHG emissions, significant changes in the transportation fleet have been considered, with electric vehicles as one of the alternatives that could potentially reduce GHG emissions. This paper presents a comprehensive lifecycle emission and cost comparison among electric vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), full battery electric vehicles (EVs), hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are compared with gasoline vehicle as the base case. Since the selection among these electric vehicles depends on several factors, external costs of emission, fuel, time loss, charging time loss and maintenance cost are considered. The results show that the most environmentally benign vehicles in terms of GHG emission are FCEV and full EVs, which is approximately half of the emission by Internal combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. The results also show that both FCVs and EVs have better air quality related emission reduction compared to ICE vehicle which results in approximately accounts for 84% reduction. The lifecycle cost results show that HEVs have the lowest lifecycle cost among all the selected vehicles, with the cost of $0.38 per mile. In addition, the effect of Carbon damage cost on total lifecycle cost is investigated. The results show that an increase in Carbon damage cost results in the penetration of HEVs and EVs to the market share. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; LCA; Lifecycle cost; Lifecycle emission; Optimization","Air quality; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon; Charging time; Competition; Electric losses; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Fleet operations; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Optimization; Effect of carbons; Emission reduction; Environmentally benign; Gasoline vehicle; Life cycle emissions; Lifecycle costs; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Transportation fleet; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064268569

This study was carried out to assess the PM10 mass concentration and PM10-bound lead (Pb) at two major traffic junctions in Charsadda and Upper Dir Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. A high-volume Reference Ambient Air Sampler (RAAS) was used to collect PM10 samples (n = 30) on glass fiber filters from April 2017 to September 2017. The PM10 mass was determined by gravimetric analysis weighing each filter disc before and after sampling. The PM10-bound Pb concentrations were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy after filters acid digestion. Health risks of PM10-bound Pb were evaluated numerically by hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI). The PM10 mass (24 h mean) was 4.6 times higher than the WHO guideline value for air quality. Likewise, the PM10-bound Pb was 1.3 times higher than the WHO guideline value. Mean PM10 concentrations were 254 ± 67 μg/m3 and 208 ± 85 μg/m3 and mean PM10-bound Pb concentrations were 709 ± 206 ng/m3 and 638 ± 231 ng/m3 at the traffic junctions in Charsadda and Upper Dir Districts respectively.

Zinc oxide and selenium nanoparticles could be used to improve feed digestibility and volatile fatty acids production. Magnesium oxide, silver, and copper nanoparticles exhibit strong antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative microbes and weaken the biofilm formation of the microbial community.

Most often this discursive formation labels climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’. This framing, however, is vague, linear and leaves many questions unanswered regarding how institutions can develop and implement policy that addresses the joint challenges of climate change, conflict and security. Utilising a mixed-methods approach, and grounding data collection in US policy communities, this article examines how policy actors and institutions integrate climate-security discourses into policy processes. The objective of this research is to provide direct insight into how the discourses and technical understandings of climate-security transition into policy priorities and implementation realities. This research identified three common approaches to climate-security: (1) A challenge of adaptation and resilience; (2) A potent political argument; and (3) An issue of limited importance and feasibility. These approaches, however, are inconsistent across sectors and within organisations, suggesting a lack of cohesion and considerable challenges in identifying and responding to climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’. © 2019, © 2019 King’s College London.","Climate change; climate-conflict; climate-security; discourse; environmental security; policy implementation; threat multiplier",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071121730

Among these gases, carbon dioxide is considered as the prominent gas which motivated researchers to explore carbon reduction and mitigation strategies. Research work on this domain expands from carbon emission reporting to identifying and implementing carbon mitigation and reduction strategies. A comprehensive study to map global research on carbon emissions is, however, not available. Therefore, based on a scientometric analysis method, this study reviewed the global literature on carbon emissions. A total of 2945 bibliographic records, from 1981 to 2019, were extracted from theWeb of Science core collection database and analyzed using techniques such as co-author and co-citation analysis. Findings revealed an increasing trend of publications in the carbon emission research domain, which has been more visible in the past few years, especially during 2016-2018. The most significant contribution to the domain was reported from China, the United States, and England. While most prolific authors and institutions of the domain were from China, authors and institutions from the United States reported the best connection links. It was revealed that evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and estimating the carbon footprint was popular among the researchers. Moreover, climate change and environmental effects of carbon emissions were also significant points of concern in carbon emission research. The key findings of this study will be beneficial for the policymakers, academics, and institutions to determine the future research directions as well as to identify with whom they can consult to assist in developing carbon emission control policies and future carbon reduction targets. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; China; Global research; Research trends; Scientometric","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate change; emission control; global climate; greenhouse gas; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; China; England; United Kingdom; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072636663

The aims of this study include: 1) to address the issue of hydrological simulations for regulated river catchments; 2) to develop a new method revealing the trends of water resources for different scenarios (e.g. dry and wet) and 3) to facilitate water resources assessment under both climate change impacts and regulations. We use the SWAT model to model the hydrological process of the river basin with carefully designed configurations to isolate the impact from the water use regulations and practice. The spatially-distributed model simulations are then analysed with the quantile regression method to reveal the spatial and temporal patterns of regional water resources. The results show that this approach excels in presenting distributed, spatially focused trend information for extremely dry and wet scenarios, which can well address the needs of practitioners and decision-makers in dealing with long-term planning and climate change impact. The representation of the management practice in the modelling process helps identify the impact from both climate change and necessary regulatory practices, and as such lays a foundation for further study on how various management practices can mitigate the impact from other sources such as those from climate change. The novelty of the study lies in three aspects: 1) it devises a new way of isolating and representing management practice in the hydrological modelling process for regulated river basins; 2) it integrates the QR technique to study spatial-temporal trends of catchment water yield in a distributed fashion, for wet and dry scenarios instead of the mean; 3) the combination of the methods are able to reveal the impacts from various sources as well as their interactions with catchment water resources. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change impact; Natural flow restoration; Quantile regression; Regulated river basins; SWAT","Catchments; Decision making; Regression analysis; Rivers; Runoff; Watersheds; Climate change impact; Natural flow; Quantile regression; Regulated river; SWAT; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; computer simulation; hydrological modeling; regression analysis; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; water resource; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069043310
